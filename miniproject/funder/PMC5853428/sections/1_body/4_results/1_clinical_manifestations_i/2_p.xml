<p>Therefore, in addition to PCR, we used an in-house ZIKV NS1-specific ELISA to validate the presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies from the patients. The majority of patients (83 of 95) were PCR positive for ZIKV during hospitalization, and the 12 who were PCR negative patients were serologically confirmed as ZIKV positive by ELISA. In line with the observation that ZIKV is generally self-limiting with mild symptoms, 84 of 95 of ZIKV-infected patients were observed to display mild symptoms, with no neurological complications during the acute phase of infection (
