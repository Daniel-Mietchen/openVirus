<p>Using a multiplex microbead-based immunoassay, the immune profile comprising of up to 45 immune mediators were determined and quantified from serum samples obtained from the 95 ZIKV-infected patients. Samples from 13 healthy adults were also included in the analysis as controls. All ZIKV-infected febrile patients had high levels of a set of common immune mediators compared with the healthy controls (
