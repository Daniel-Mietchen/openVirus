<p>Nineteen factors were significantly higher in febrile patients than in healthy adults: proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 18, 8, 6, and 7 [IL-18, IL-8, IL-6, and IL-7], TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GRO-α), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10, 1RA, and 4 [IL-10, IL-1RA, and IL-4]), chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and SDF-1α), growth factors and others immune mediators (HGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and stem cell factor) (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). However, 2 more mediators, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB, also had significantly higher levels in febrile patients than in healthy controls when patients were classified based on ZIKV PCR status (Supplementary Figure S1). This observation suggests that an active production of a network of immune mediators, along with detectable levels of ZIKV RNA, could provide a strong antiviral environment during the acute phase of disease, resulting in a milder clinical outcome. However, no significant correlations were found between the immune mediator profiles and viral load from patients’ blood and urine samples (data not shown).
