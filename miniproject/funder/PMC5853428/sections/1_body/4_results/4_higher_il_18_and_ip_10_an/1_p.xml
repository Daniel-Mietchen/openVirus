<p>Profiles in infants with congenital CNS abnormalities and healthy infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers were analyzed next (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, only 3 immune mediators—IL-18, IP-10, and HGF—showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Infants with congenital CNS deformities have higher levels of IL-18 and IP-10 but much lower levels of HGF than healthy infants without any specific clinical outcomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is the first observation showing a differential up- and down-regulation of immune mediators in infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers.
