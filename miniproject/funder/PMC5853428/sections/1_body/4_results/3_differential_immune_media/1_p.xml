<p>Profiles between the ZIKV-infected pregnant women were assessed using serum samples collected during the acute and convalescent phases of disease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Profiles showed that the pregnant woman carrying a fetus with fetal development anomalies had very high levels of 12 immune mediators: IL-8, IL-18, IL-4, interleukin 22 (IL-22), 23 and 27, MCP-1, TNF-α, IP-10, epidermal growth factor, eotaxin, FGF-2 compared with the other pregnant women carrying normal fetuses. Levels of IL-22, MCP-1, IP-10, and TNF-α were observed to be significantly higher during the acute phase of disease (
