<p>In the current study, we aimed to analyze the clinical and immunological response by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine profiles of ZIKV-infected patients from the Campinas metropolitan area in Brazil, s home to about 4 million inhabitants and a hub for travelers transiting between different destinations in Brazil and South America. Patients were classified according to their in-house diagnostic test result, type of clinical observation during hospitalization, and fetal development. Comprehensive multiplex microbead-based arrays were performed to associate the differential patterns of immune mediators between adult patients with/without neurological complications; pregnant women who later gave birth to infants with or without congenital CNS deformities; and infants with or without congenital CNS deformities born to ZIKV-infected mothers. These findings will provide critical predictors of severe ZIKV infection and improve current practices of clinical management.</p>
