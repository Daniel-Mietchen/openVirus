<p>Because the mode of transmission of ZIKV and the clinical symptoms caused by ZIKV infection are highly similar to those in multiple arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), specific biomarker profiles will be useful for disease prognosis. Based on the current knowledge, DENV and ZIKV are largely similar, but dissimilarities between the 2 viruses (eg, the distinct pattern of E protein glycosylation sites) may have potential effects on viral tropism, thermostability of the virus, and immunomodulation during viral replication [

In addition, predictive biomarkers that could differentiate between ZIKV-induced neurological complications would be highly desirable. Until now, the association between clinical profile and immune response to ZIKV infection in patients has remained largely unknown.
