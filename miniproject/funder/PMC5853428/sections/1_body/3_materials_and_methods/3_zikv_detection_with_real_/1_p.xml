<p>RNA samples were extracted from 140 μL of serum using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. ZIKV detection was performed using real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan RNA to-Ct 1-Step Kit; Applied Biosystems) with primers and probes as described elsewhere, with modifications [

Briefly, all reactions were performed in a final volume of 12.5 μL with 50 ng of RNA, 400 and 200 nmol/L of primers and probe, respectively, and 6.25 μL of TaqMan PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The following cycling algorithm was used: 48°C for 30 minutes, followed by 95°C for 10 minutes, 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 1 minute.
