<p>Sample randomization for the Luminex assays could not be performed for the various sample groups because the sample processing was dependent on the collection at the hospital. Once sufficient samples were collected, the Luminex assays were performed. To remove any potential plate effects, an additional plate was assayed that contained a selected number of samples from all assayed plates. These samples were then used to normalize the assayed plates. A correction factor was obtained from the difference observed between the original assayed plate data and the replicates on the addition plate. This correction factor was then applied to the rest of the samples of the original assayed plate. The concentrations were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. </p>
