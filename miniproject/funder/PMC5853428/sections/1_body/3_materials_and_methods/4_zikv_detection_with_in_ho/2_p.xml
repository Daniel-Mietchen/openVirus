<p>After a new washing cycle, secondary anti-human IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) was added to wells and incubated again for 1 hour. After a final washing, plate wells were developed with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Sigma). The reaction was stopped after 15 minutes by adding 00 ÂµL of sulfuric acid at 0.2 mol/L. The optical density reading was measured at 450 nm with a plate reader (Thermo Scientific). A signal-to-cutoff was calculated based on known negative samples and applied on the tested samples. After the cutoff determination, the samples were categorized as negative, borderline (undetermined), or positive.</p>
