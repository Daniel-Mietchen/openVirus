<p>ZIKV immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies were evaluated by means of ELISA serology of patients’ serum samples, according to a modified method [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, polystyrene COSTAR microplates (Corning) were coated with 100 ng of a recombinant ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 protein expressed in bacterial cells and suspended in a carbonate buffer solution (pH 9.6). Serum samples were diluted 1:100 and preincubated in sample solution at 37°C for 1 hour. Plate wells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 2 hours at room temperature, washed 4 times in a phosphate-buffered saline–Tween 0.05% solution and then exposed to the sample solutions at 37°C for 1 hour.
