<p>Acute-phase serum specimens were collected from 95 patients a median of 3 days after illness onset. Of these patients, 6 were pregnant women who also provided serum samples 1â€“3 months (convalescent phase) after the first sampling. Serum samples were collected at birth from the 6 newborns born to these women. Additional serum samples from 4 other newborns (born to the 4 ZIKV-infected mothers who were not included in this study) obtained during the same Zika epidemic in Brazil were also included as study samples. Serum samples were obtained from 10 mL of peripheral blood collected in dry tube after peripheral venipuncture. All samples were transported on ice within &lt;6 hours to the Laboratory for Study of Emerging Viruses at the Biology Institute of the University of Campinas. </p>
