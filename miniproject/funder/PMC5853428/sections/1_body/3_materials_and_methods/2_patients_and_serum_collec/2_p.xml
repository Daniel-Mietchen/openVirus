<p>All samples were processed and tested for ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Frozen serum samples were sent to the Vaccine Development Laboratory at Biomedical Science Institute of University of SÃ£o Paulo and tested for presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples from 13 healthy donors were included and prescreened for presence of ZIKV viral RNA and ZIKV-specific antibodies. Clinical data and maternal and perinatal outcomes were retrospectively retrieved from medical records.</p>
