<p>Plates were incubated for another 30 minutes and then washed, followed by a final 10-minute incubation in the presence of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Results were acquired using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) with Luminex xPONENT software (version 3.1), based on standard curves plotted through a 5-parameter logistic curve setting. TNF-Î² was found to be below detection limit and hence excluded from subsequent analysis.</p>
