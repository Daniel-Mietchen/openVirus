<p>Serum levels of immune mediators were measured using human cytokine 45-plex immunoassay kits (Procarta), according to the manufacturer’s instruction; cytokines included granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, epidermal growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, beta-nerve growth factor (bNGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP] 1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] 1α), MIP-1β, CCL5 (RANTES [regulated on activation, normal T-expressed, and presumably secreted]), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (GRO-α), CXCL12α (stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1α]), CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]), eotaxin, interferon (IFN) α, IFN-γ, interleukin 1α, 1β, 1RA, 10, 13, 15, 17A, 18, 2, 21, 22, 23, 27, 31, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (CXCL8), 9, and 12p70, leukemia inhibitory factor, stem cell factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, TNF-β, vascular endothelial growth factors A and D, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF-BB], and placental growth factor [PIGF-1]). Briefly, magnetic beads were aliquoted in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of standards and serum samples from patients and control subjects. After an incubation period, plates were washed using a magnetic wash station according to manufacturer’s instructions, followed by addition of a detection antibody. </p>
