ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is typically transmitted by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Since 2007, of 76 countries and territories that have reported evidence of mosquito-borne ZIKV local transmission, 29 countries have reported congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly, possibly associated with ZIKV infection [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;6</xref>]. Most patients remain asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms that normally last 2&#x02013;7 days. Symptoms include fever, arthritis/arthralgia, rash, conjunctivitis, joint pain, and headache [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there is now evidence of ZIKV with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome and congenital central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;13</xref>]. Therefore, ZIKV infection represents a major public health concern with severe social and economic burden owing to a lack of commercial vaccines or effective antiviral treatments. Treatment is usually symptomatic and pain-relief medicine is the only available option during disease onset. Brazil, hit by the ZIKV epidemics since 2014, accounted &#x0003e;200000 probable cases of ZIKV infection, with almost 2000 cases of microcephaly in 2015&#x02013;2016.</p><p>Because the mode of transmission of ZIKV and the clinical symptoms caused by ZIKV infection are highly similar to those in multiple arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), specific biomarker profiles will be useful for disease prognosis. Based on the current knowledge, DENV and ZIKV are largely similar, but dissimilarities between the 2 viruses (eg, the distinct pattern of E protein glycosylation sites) may have potential effects on viral tropism, thermostability of the virus, and immunomodulation during viral replication [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Altogether, this may cause different host response and induce distinct clinical observations, particularly in severe cases. In addition, predictive biomarkers that could differentiate between ZIKV-induced neurological complications would be highly desirable. Until now, the association between clinical profile and immune response to ZIKV infection in patients has remained largely unknown.</p><p>In the current study, we aimed to analyze the clinical and immunological response by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine profiles of ZIKV-infected patients from the Campinas metropolitan area in Brazil, s home to about 4 million inhabitants and a hub for travelers transiting between different destinations in Brazil and South America. Patients were classified according to their in-house diagnostic test result, type of clinical observation during hospitalization, and fetal development. Comprehensive multiplex microbead-based arrays were performed to associate the differential patterns of immune mediators between adult patients with/without neurological complications; pregnant women who later gave birth to infants with or without congenital CNS deformities; and infants with or without congenital CNS deformities born to ZIKV-infected mothers. These findings will provide critical predictors of severe ZIKV infection and improve current practices of clinical management.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and participants&#x02019; parents or legal guardians (parental consent for age under 17) and study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles.

Of these patients, 6 were pregnant women who also provided serum samples 1&#x02013;3 months (convalescent phase) after the first sampling. Serum samples were collected at birth from the 6 newborns born to these women. Additional serum samples from 4 other newborns (born to the 4 ZIKV-infected mothers who were not included in this study) obtained during the same Zika epidemic in Brazil were also included as study samples. Serum samples were obtained from 10 mL of peripheral blood collected in dry tube after peripheral venipuncture. All samples were transported on ice within &#x0003c;6 hours to the Laboratory for Study of Emerging Viruses at the Biology Institute of the University of Campinas. </p><p>All samples were processed and tested for ZIKV using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Frozen serum samples were sent to the Vaccine Development Laboratory at Biomedical Science Institute of University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo and tested for presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples from 13 healthy donors were included and prescreened for presence of ZIKV viral RNA and ZIKV-specific antibodies.

The following cycling algorithm was used: 48&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, followed by 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 minute.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>ZIKV Detection With In-House Specific ELISA</title><p>ZIKV immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies were evaluated by means of ELISA serology of patients&#x02019; serum samples, according to a modified method [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, polystyrene COSTAR microplates (Corning) were coated with 100 ng of a recombinant ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 protein expressed in bacterial cells and suspended in a carbonate buffer solution (pH 9.6). Serum samples were diluted 1:100 and preincubated in sample solution at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. Plate wells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 2 hours at room temperature, washed 4 times in a phosphate-buffered saline&#x02013;Tween 0.05% solution and then exposed to the sample solutions at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. </p><p>After a new washing cycle, secondary anti-human IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) was added to wells and incubated again for 1 hour. After a final washing, plate wells were developed with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Sigma). The reaction was stopped after 15 minutes by adding 00 &#x000b5;L of sulfuric acid at 0.2 mol/L. The optical density reading was measured at 450 nm with a plate reader (Thermo Scientific). A signal-to-cutoff was calculated based on known negative samples and applied on the tested samples. After the cutoff determination, the samples were categorized as negative, borderline (undetermined), or positive.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Multiplex Microbead-Based Immunoassay</title><p>Serum levels of immune mediators were measured using human cytokine 45-plex immunoassay kits (Procarta), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction; cytokines included granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, epidermal growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, beta-nerve growth factor (bNGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP] 1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] 1&#x003b1;), MIP-1&#x003b2;, CCL5 (RANTES [regulated on activation, normal T-expressed, and presumably secreted]), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (GRO-&#x003b1;), CXCL12&#x003b1; (stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1&#x003b1;]), CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]), eotaxin, interferon (IFN) &#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, interleukin 1&#x003b1;, 1&#x003b2;, 1RA, 10, 13, 15, 17A, 18, 2, 21, 22, 23, 27, 31, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (CXCL8), 9, and 12p70, leukemia inhibitory factor, stem cell factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b2;, vascular endothelial growth factors A and D, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF-BB], and placental growth factor [PIGF-1]). Briefly, magnetic beads were aliquoted in 96-well plates, followed by the addition of standards and serum samples from patients and control subjects. After an incubation period, plates were washed using a magnetic wash station according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, followed by addition of a detection antibody. </p><p>Plates were incubated for another 30 minutes and then washed, followed by a final 10-minute incubation in the presence of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Results were acquired using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) with Luminex xPONENT software (version 3.1), based on standard curves plotted through a 5-parameter logistic curve setting.

Once sufficient samples were collected, the Luminex assays were performed. To remove any potential plate effects, an additional plate was assayed that contained a selected number of samples from all assayed plates. These samples were then used to normalize the assayed plates. A correction factor was obtained from the difference observed between the original assayed plate data and the replicates on the addition plate. This correction factor was then applied to the rest of the samples of the original assayed plate. The concentrations were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. </p><p>One-way analysis of variance with post hoc <italic>t</italic> test corrected using the Bonferroni method was used to detect differences between the various sample groups. These results were corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. Functional group and canonical pathway analyses were generated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Qiagen; IPA Spring Release [March 2017]). All statistical analyses were performed with R software (version 3.1.2). Differences were considered statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05.

Brazil has recently declared an end to ZIKV epidemics because the number of reported cases has decreased significantly since the later part of 2016; this may be linked to the development of herd immunity in populations [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but the effect of herd immunity (generation of protective antibodies against a particular pathogen after an epidemic) on the reemergence of ZIKV and/or DENV epidemics in the future is still unknown. In the current study, to better define ZIKV infection in patients, 95 patients were stratified according to their clinical features, and multiplex microbead-based immunoassays were carried out to determine the immune profiles of ZIKV-infected patients with different clinical features, ranging from mild symptoms to neurological complications. Most of the patients in this study displayed fever and rash only, confirming that Zika fever is generally self-limiting. However, in a small fraction of patients (11.6%), neurological complications developed 0&#x02013;3 days after the appearance of acute symptoms, consistent with other observations [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is only 1 publication describing the cytokine profiles of 6 ZIKV-infected patients from acute to recovery phases [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Owing to the small number of patients, larger cohorts of patients should be accessed to strengthen the observations. In the current cohort, levels of 21 immune mediators were significantly higher in ZIKV-infected patients than in the healthy controls. This pattern is similar to an earlier study in another cohort that showed high levels of multiple immune mediators, including IL-1RA, IP-10, and HGF in DENV-infected patients [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. IPA analysis further revealed that these 21 mediators are highly interconnected and are involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has been reported to be activated in DENV infection and responsible for proinflammatory response [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the exact mechanistic pathway involving NF-&#x003ba;B activation should be further explored.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Signature of immune mediators in patients with acute Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. <italic>A,</italic> All immune mediators up-regulated relative to healthy controls were analyzed, and the predicted network was depicted with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. <italic>B,</italic> Relative levels of specific immune mediators between ZIKV-infected pregnant women carrying fetuses with or without congenital anomalies. <italic>C,</italic> Relative levels of specific immune mediators infants born to these ZIKV-infected women.

The differential levels of IL-22, MCP-1, IP-10, and TNF-&#x003b1; in pregnant women could serve as useful prognostic biomarkers to predict the possible outcome in infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated the presence of high levels of TNF-&#x003b1; in ZIKV-infected human fetal brain cells, further implying its role in neuroinflammation [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The independent detection of high levels of TNF-&#x003b1; (Supplementary Table S1) further strengthened the possibility of using this set of identified mediators as ZIKV prognostic biomarkers to improve clinical management and potential treatments in future ZIKV outbreaks.</p><p>Hypercytokinemia, more commonly known as &#x0201c;cytokine storm,&#x0201d; has been well reported in viral diseases [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the current study, ZIKV-infected patients had higher levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-18, GRO-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3;. Notably, IL-18 and IFN-&#x003b3; have been shown to be important proinflammatory cytokines in host defense against infection and in natural killer (NK) cell activation [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Classically, activation of NK cells could initiate neuroprotection or neurotoxicity through different immune cascades in the presence of specific immune mediators [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the presence of IL-18, NK cells could be activated and induce IFN-&#x003b3;. Although little is known about the role of NK cells in patients infected by flaviviruses, the involvement of NK cells during the acute phase of ZIKV infection could be inferred from the high levels of IL-18 and IFN-&#x003b3;. Moreover, studies in other flaviviruses have demonstrated the pathogenic role of IFN-&#x003b3; in Japanese encephalitis virus infections through the down-regulation of a tight-junction protein within the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Establishing the role of IFN-&#x003b3; in the neuropathogenesis of ZIKV will be of interest in the future.</p><p>Interestingly, higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-1RA, and IL-10, were observed in patients with mild disease outcome. Specifically, the level of IL-10 was higher in patients without any neurological complications. A similar pattern of the immune mediators&#x02019; network that contributes to the neurological status after pathogen infection has also been reported in various studies [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, the current observation suggests a plausible link between NK cells through the cytokine network, involving IL-18, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-10 to protect against ZIKV-induced neuropathogenesis.</p><p>The level of HGF was significantly lower in infants with congenital CNS deformities, suggesting an important role in the development of fetal CNS development in during gestation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The presence of HGF typically activates the HGF/MET signaling pathway that further induces mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Animal studies have demonstrated the crucial role of mTOR in overall brain growth and postnatal survival [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], while whereas role of HGF in neuroprotection has been indicated in both autoimmune and infectious diseases [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, it is now of prime importance to understand the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection that could lead to a down-regulation of HGF during gestation in developing fetuses.</p><p>In conclusion, ours is the first systematic large-scale analysis of immune mediators reported in ZIKV-infected patients including pregnant women and infants with congenital CNS abnormalities. Data sets from other cohorts combined with meta-analysis will further verify and validate the list of biomarkers identified in this study, to improve prognostic efficiency and clinical management in the face of emerging new outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s15"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
