<p>In order to identify potential transmission clusters in the full dataset, we constructed maximum likelihood trees with RAxML (with the GTR+Γ substitution model) and applying the Cluster Picker with a cutoff of 90% for node statistical support and ≤6% for the intra-cluster genetic diversity. In order to minimise the effect of recombination in the detection of clusters, further Cluster Picker analyses of the genes gag (1.5Kb), 
 <italic>pol</italic> (3Kb) and 
 <italic>env</italic> (2.5Kb) were performed, using genetic diversity cutoffs of ≤5.5%, ≤4.5% and ≤9%, respectively. These levels were chosen taking as reference the value commonly used for 
 <italic>pol</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and adjusting the rest of the genes according to their different evolutionary rates.
