<p>In order to generate HIV consensus genomes, the pipeline was applied to 420 HIV samples, collected between 2012 and 2014 at two major London clinics: University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Trust (n = 332) and Barts Health NHS Trust (n = 88). UCLH NHS Trust specimens were from a cohort of 4,700 patients under follow-up in London of which 75% of patients are men, 65% are men-having-sex-with-men (MSM) with a median age of 44 years and 20% are over 50. Almost all (97%) were already on treatment and the majority of tests (80%) were performed at virological failure or during treatment interruption pre restarting. Only 10–20% of specimens included baseline samples at diagnosis. Specimens from Barts Health NHS Trust came from a cohort that includes 1,200 HIV genotypic resistance tests each year from a North East London patient cohort. The catchment area includes Barts Health NHS trust, the Homerton trust, and Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust with a prevalence of HIV ranging from 1.6 to 7.4 per 1,000 adults. North-East London’s population is diverse: Tower Hamlets and Hackney have large MSM populations and Newham has the highest number of black Africans living with HIV in London. Most of the patients in the cohort are men (64%), with a median age of 41 years and 22% aged over 50. Approximately one fifth of samples tested are at baseline, the remainder tested because of viral escape or non-compliance.</p>
