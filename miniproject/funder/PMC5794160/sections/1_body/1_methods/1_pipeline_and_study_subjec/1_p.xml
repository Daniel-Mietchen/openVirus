<p>Within the ICONIC project, we have developed an automated and customisable high-throughput analysis pipeline to generate HIV clinical whole genomes, quantify minority variants and identify drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). Via de novo assembly of contigs, concatenation and correction by alignment to reference and subsequent remapping of reads, this pipeline derives a consensus sequence and minority variants across each genome [
