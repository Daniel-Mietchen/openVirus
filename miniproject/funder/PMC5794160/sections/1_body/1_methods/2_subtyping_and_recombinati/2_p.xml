<p>In those sequences where these tools confirmed the presence of recombination events, further analyses were applied using the program SimPlot version 3.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which applies a bootscanning method. This consists of a sliding-window phylogenetic bootstrap analysis of the query sequence (using a window size of 300bp moving in 10bp increments) aligned against a set of reference strains to reveal breakpoints, which was later confirmed by performing phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (GTR+Î“ substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replicates) of the inter-breakpoint segments. For these, we incorporated sequences from the 2010 HIV subtype reference alignment downloaded from Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV database website [
