<p>Whereas inter-subtype recombination can be detected relatively easily, intra-subtype recombination is much more difficult to identify due to a greater sequence similarity between sequences of the same subtype/variant, and the lack of standardised methodology. For the largest pure subtype datasets, we aimed to detect intra-subtype recombination using the program RDP version 4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] following the approach described by Kiwelu and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In short, RDP4 uses 7 non-parametric recombination detection methods: RDP, GENECONV, modified Bootscan, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, SISCAN and 3SEQ. For each of these methods, the default RDP4 settings were used. The recombination events considered definitive were those with statistically significant support (p&lt;0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) for at least 3 out of the 5 algorithms. RDP4 screens all possible sequence triplets/quartets to find recombinants and potential parents, which makes possible the analysis without reference sequences.
