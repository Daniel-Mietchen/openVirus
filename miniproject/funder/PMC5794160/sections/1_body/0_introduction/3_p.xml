<p>The genetic variability derived from the presence of non-B variants could affect management of HIV-1 infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the efficacy of viral load and resistance assays [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the speed of disease progression [

 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the emergence of drug resistance mutations [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the vaccine development [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, HIV-1 recombination is a powerful evolutionary force that occurs ten times more frequently than base substitutions [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and produces and maintains further variability by shuffling and combining viral genetic material. HIV-1 recombination can accelerate the adaptation to the host [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], improve viral replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and provide mechanisms to escape both the immune response and antiviral treatments [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At the same time, gene reshuffling derived by recombination can compensate the loss in viral fitness derived from these adaptations [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] HIV will continue to evolve and diversify, which will bring new challenges to prevention and treatment efforts.
