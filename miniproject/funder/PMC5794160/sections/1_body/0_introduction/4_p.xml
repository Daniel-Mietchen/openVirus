<p>Thus, the proper detection and description of HIV-1 variants in representative cohorts is essential, especially considering the worldwide emergence and transmission of recombinants. The coincidence of the increasing HIV-1 complexity in Western countries with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlights the potential of applying these techniques to routine surveillance of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology. Here, we aimed to identify URFs in a dataset consisting on HIV-1 nearly full-genome sequences obtained through NGS of samples taken in two major hospitals in London, UK. We describe their recombination patterns using a combination of bioinformatics tools, which include bootscanning and phylogenetic analysis of sequence sub-segments, considered the reference methodology for detecting HIV-1 variants since its first use [
