<p>HIV-1 subtype B is the prevalent variant in high-income areas like North America and Western Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the most studied strain despite only accounting for 12% of global infections. However, in the last decade, the remaining subtypes and recombinants (“non-B variants”, responsible for the remaining 88% of infections worldwide) have increased in prevalence and heterogeneity in developed countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The UK is no exception, and viral genetic diversity (especially involving novel recombinants) markedly increased in the UK HIV-1 epidemic between 2002 and 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This new heterogeneity has resulted in the description of an increasing number of CRFs in Western Europe, which traditionally were restricted to regional hotspots with great co-circulation of variants–like sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and parts of South America. These new European recombinants include CRF47_BF and CRF73_BG in Spain and Portugal [

 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], CRF50_A1D in the UK [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CRF56_cpx in France [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and CRF60_BC in Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as second-generation complex recombinant strains [
