<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shows a great genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which causes the emergence of multiple viral strains. HIV-1 is classified in four groups: M, O, N and P. HIV-1 group M drives the global pandemic, and includes 9 subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K), at least 88 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and countless unique recombinant forms (URFs), generated when cells are superinfected by HIV-1 virions from different subtypes/CRFs. CRFs are defined as inter-subtype recombinant lineages that derived from the same common ancestor, and for which at least three epidemiologically unlinked variants are monophyletic and share an identical genetic structure along their full genome. URFs are recombinants with different recombination breakpoints than those found in CRFs, and emerge after localised, isolated recombination events. URFs are responsible for at least 20% of HIV-1 infections worldwideâ€“a proportion that reaches 40% in some African countries [
