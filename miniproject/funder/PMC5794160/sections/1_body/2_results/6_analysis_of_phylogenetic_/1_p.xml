<p>We detected 31 phylogenetic clusters using the full sequence dataset. Of them, 25 were pairs (corresponding mostly to subtypes B (n = 11) and C (n = 4)), 4 were triplets (1 each for A1, B, F1, and CRF06_cpx) and 2 quadruplets (CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx). These clusters involved 70 sequences, 23.5% of the dataset. In order to explore the consistence of these clusters across different genes, we also examined clusters analysing the main HIV-1 genes independently: 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>. Seventeen (54.8%) of the 31 clusters detected in the full dataset were also found in the individual analyses of 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>. Their intra-subtype maximum genetic distance and bootstrap support values for each gene is shown in the 
 <bold>Table B</bold> in

 </bold>. The average genetic distance across the 17 clusters was 2.06% for the genome-wide analysis (range: 0.08–5.27%), 1.75% (0–5.19%) for 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 1.33% (0.03–2.96%) for 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 3.05% (0–8.92%) for 
 <italic>env</italic>.
