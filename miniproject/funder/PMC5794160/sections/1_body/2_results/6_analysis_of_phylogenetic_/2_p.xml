<p>Most of the inter-gene cluster disagreements (6/14, 43%) were due to the fact that not all sequences in a given cluster completely covered the 3 genes. In 4 (29%) cases the sequences were too divergent (above the genetic distance cutoff) in one of the genes: 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> in 2 cases (genetic distances of 6.0â€“7.6%), 
 <italic>gag</italic> alone (7.9%) in one case, 
 <italic>env</italic> alone (12.9%) in the last one. The last disagreement (7%) was due to the fact that the statistical support of the node was below the cutoff (boostrap = 88%) in the 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene tree. Finally, there were 3 cases (21%) in which certain sequences showed entirely different tree topologies according to the gene analysed. One of them involved a phylogenetic pair of pure F1 sequences that clustered very closely with a URF_02BF1 (MF109637, whose recombination pattern is described in

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192081.s001">S1 File</xref>
 </bold>) only in the 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene, which suggests that the former could represent the parental lineage involved in the generation of that URF. The other 2 cases of phylogenetic inconsistence corresponded to subtype B clusters in which presumably, as the RDP analysis suggested, intra-subtype recombination had modified their clustering pattern.
