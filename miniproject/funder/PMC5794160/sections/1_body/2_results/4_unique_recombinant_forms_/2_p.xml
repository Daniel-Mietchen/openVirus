 <bold>B/CRF50_A1D</bold> pair (accession numbers MF109354and MF109527, respectively). These two URF_50B sequences that formed a phylogenetic pair (genome-wide similarity = 96.2%) were classified as an A1/B/D recombinant by jpHMM, but after phylogenetic analysis of the recombinant segments, those assigned to A1 and D clustered with the recombinant CRF50_A1D (previously described in the UK [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), and shared the same breakpoints between A1 and D found in this CRF (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192081.g001">Fig 1</xref>
 </bold>). Therefore, they were reclassified as B/CRF50_A1D. The subtype B segment that covered the PR+RT region in 
 <italic>pol</italic> presented high similarity (&gt;98%) to UK “pure” subtype B sequences in both the UKHDRD dataset and GenBank, which suggests that these recombinants originated in the UK. A different URF_50B, presenting different breakpoints as those reported here, was already described in Foster et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (see below for more information on this recombinant sequence), suggesting that this CRF of Eastern African origin is actively recombining with local sequences.
