<p>The 32 URF sequences were further explored by analysing the parental lineages that generated them and their closest sequences in public sequence databases identified by BLAST. For those URF presenting breakpoints in the PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> region, genetically similar 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were searched within the UK HIV Drug Resistance database (UKHDRD). In the following paragraphs we provide a detailed explanation for the most frequent and/or complex URF. The rest of the URF analyses are detailed in the
