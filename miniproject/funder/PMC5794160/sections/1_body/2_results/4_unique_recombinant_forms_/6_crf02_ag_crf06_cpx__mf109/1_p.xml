<p>This URF presented segments of subtypes A1, G, C and J that corresponded in ML trees and SimPlot to the recombinant CRF06_cpx (which is made up by subtypes A1, C, G and J). Interestingly, subtype A1 fragments in this URF clustered within CRF02_AG and not CRF06_cpx (

 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes) the presence of further breakpoints cannot be ruled out. Recombinants between CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx have already been discovered in Western Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] probably introduced from Western Africa, a region where both CRF frequently co-circulate. Indeed, the closest GenBank sequences to this URF’s PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> region were “pure” CRF06_cpx sequences from Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal (96%).
