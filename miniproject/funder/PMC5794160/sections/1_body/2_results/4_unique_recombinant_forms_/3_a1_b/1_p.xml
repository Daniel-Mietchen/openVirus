<p>Two URF_A1B were identified, with one of them (MF109544) presenting a long gap between the A1 and B portions. The A1 segment was closest to sequences from Kenya (similarity = 93%), whereas no close GenBank sequences to the subtype B portion could be found. The other URF_A1B found (MF109371) presented a small A1 fragment in 
 <italic>pol</italic> (694bp-long) in a background of subtype B. Whereas the latter did not present high similarity close to any GenBank sequence in 
 <italic>gag</italic> or 
 <italic>env</italic>, the A1 fragment was intimately related to CRF50_A1D in the phylogenetic analysis, and particularly (similarity = 95%) to a B/CRF50_A1D recombinant sequence (accession number JN417238, see above) also described in the article by Foster and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] where this CRF is described. JN417238 and this newly described URF_A1B shared common A1/B breakpoints in the PR+RT region although the latter presented additional breakpoints absent in the URF_A1B; however, they did not cluster together in their common subtype B fragments. The PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> portion of both the URF_A1B described here and, especially, of JN417238 were genetically similar (98%) to an A1/B cluster already described in Canada that was identified through BLAST; we also found 5 GenBank A1/B sequences sampled in the UK which were very similar. Within the UKHDRD, we identified 13 more PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences circulating sharing breakpoints with this URF_A1B according to jpHMM. These 13 UKHDRD sequences were mostly sampled on 2011â€“2012 but the oldest one was sampled in 2006; and in all cases with available information, the patients had been born in the UK. According to the ML tree (

 </bold>), this A1/B lineage (and particularly JN417238, the URF_50B previously described) initiated the Canadian cluster that affected men-having-sex-with-men (MSM) population [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The clade also included 2 GenBank sequences from Albania and Korea, respectively, which lied basal to the UK/Canadian cluster, and points to a further international spread of this clade.
