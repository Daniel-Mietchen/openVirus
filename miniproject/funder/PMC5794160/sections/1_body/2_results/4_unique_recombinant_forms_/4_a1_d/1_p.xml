<p>We detected three URF_A1D sequences (MF109466, MF109548 and MF109564) with different recombination patterns. In all cases, the closest sequences in GenBank were sampled in Eastern Africa (Uganda, Kenya and/or Tanzania). Only one of them (MF109466) presented a recombination breakpoint in the PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> region, for which through BLAST we identified 27 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences in the UKHDRD and 21 in GenBank (from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, up to 96% of similarity) which showed a very similar A1/D breakpoint in the PR+RT region. The 27 UKHDRD sequences corresponded exclusively to patients born in Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe, and their samples were taken from 2001 to 2011. Both sets of sequences sampled in the UK and GenBank sequences sampled in Eastern African countries were interspersed in the tree (

One of the GenBank sequences from Kericho, Kenya (accession number KT022394) had a full-length sequence available which showed a recombination pattern that was very similar to that of this URF_A1D across the genome in the overlapping regions, only different at the 3â€™ end of the 
 <italic>env</italic> gene. The presence of two sequence gaps in our sample prevented further exploration of the relatedness of these 2 sequences.
