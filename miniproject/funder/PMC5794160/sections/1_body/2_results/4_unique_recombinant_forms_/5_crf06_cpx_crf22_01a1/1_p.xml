<p>We found 1 URF_0622 (MF109682) which was initially identified as a recombinant between subtypes A1, G and J and CRF01_AE by jpHMM. However, further analysis with SimPlot, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the recombinant segments, revealed that segments ascribed to subtype J and G that partially covered from 
 <italic>vif</italic> to 
 <italic>env</italic> actually corresponded to CRF06_cpx, and that the segments classified as A1 and CRF01_AE in 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>vif</italic> and 
 <italic>nef</italic> clustered very closely to CRF22_A101 â€“a recombinant lineage detected in Cameroon [

 <italic>pol</italic> region, which prevented from identifying more cases of this recombinant in the UKHDRD.
