<p>In order to explore the implications of using only the PR+RT partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence to study the HIV-1 subtype distribution, we extracted the 277 sequences (out of the total 365 sequence dataset, 75.9%) that covered this region and applied the COMET and SCUEAL subtyping tools. SCUEAL was used to make the results comparable to those from the UKHDRD reports [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The prevalence of pure subtypes in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (74.4% for COMET and 73.0% for SCUEAL) was similar to that found in the full-length ICONIC dataset (73.2%), with the only exception of an overestimation of subtype G by SCUEAL (7.0% using 
 <italic>pol</italic> versus 2.7% in the definitive results; chi-square test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Differences found in the proportion of recombinants (CRFs and/or URFs) were also not significant.
