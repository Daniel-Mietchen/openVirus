<p>Focusing on the 32 URF sequences, 26 covered the 1.3Kb PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> region, of which only 7 (7/26, 26.9%) presented a breakpoint in that region and were consequently identified as recombinants by both COMET and SCUEAL. The remaining 19 (19/26, 73%) URFs were therefore mostly considered as pure subtypes/CRFs when only the PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence was analysed. As the PR+RT fragment represents only ~15% of the size of the genomes analysed here, it is in fact detecting more recombinants than expected (26.9% versus 8.8% when analysing the genome data; chi-square test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008).
