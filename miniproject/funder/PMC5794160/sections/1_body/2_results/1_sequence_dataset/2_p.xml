 </bold> shows the alignment of the 375 sequences and the positions of the four primers used for amplification. Most of the sequence gaps corresponded to amplification failure of the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 4
 <sup>th</sup> amplicons. An in-depth analysis of the impact of missing nucleotide characters in NGS sequence data generated with the same sequencing protocol followed with the ICONIC samples has been previously published [
