<p>The pipeline generated sequences of at least 1Kb of length (median = 7.46Kb, IQR = 4.01Kb) for 375 out of the 420 ICONIC samples (89%), with 174 of the 375 (46.4%) sequences covering the full ‘clinical’ genome (i.e. from 
 <italic>gag</italic> to 
 <italic>nef</italic>). The rest of sequences (n = 201) had variable coverage.
