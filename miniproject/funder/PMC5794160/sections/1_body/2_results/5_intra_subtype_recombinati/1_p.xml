<p>We analysed the largest ‘pure’ subtype datasets (i.e. subtypes B and C with 149 and 77 sequences, respectively) for evidence of intra-subtype recombination using RDP4. A sequence was considered an intra-subtype recombinant if the recombination signal was statistically significantly supported by at least 3 of the methods implemented in RDP4. We found 20 subtype B sequences (13.4%) that were identified as recombinants with enough statistical support. For subtype C, 7 sequences (9.1%) were intra-subtype recombinants. This difference was not statistically significant.</p>
