<p>Importantly, we generated new sequences of several CRFs that remain poorly (n&lt;10) represented in public sequence databases, providing full-genome each of the following recombinants: CRF03_AB (only 3 genome sequences available in GenBank), CRF13_cpx (8), CRF18_cpx (5), CRF25_cpx (6) and CRF43_02G (4). Also, we provide partial genomes of CRF09_cpx, CRF19_cpx, CRF49_cpx and CRF60_BC (one each), which will provide new and invaluable material for the study of these recombinant lineages.</p>
