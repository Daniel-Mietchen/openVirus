<p>The HIV strains found were, ordered by frequency: subtype B (n = 149, 40.8%), subtype C (n = 77, 21.1%), CRF02_AG (n = 32, 8.8%), subtype A1 (17, 4.7%),CRF01_AE (n = 15, 4.1%), subtype G (10, 2.7%), CRF06_cpx (8, 2.2%), subtype D (7, 1.9%), subtype F1 (7, 1.9%) and 11 other CRFs (03_AB, 07_BC, 09_cpx, 13_cpx, 14_BG, 18_cpx, 19_cpx, 25_cpx, 43_02G, 49_cpx and 60_BC) of which one case (0.3% each) was found. In total, we found 14 different CRFs (n = 66, 18.1%). The remaining samples corresponded to multiple URFs (n = 32, 8.8%) that involved recombination between 12 different parental variants: 7 subtypes (A1, B, C, D, F1, G and J) and 5 CRFs (CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1 and CRF50_AD). The most frequent URFs were B/CRF01_AE (4 cases) and A1/D, B/C, and B/CRF02_AG (3 cases each). Their recombination patterns are shown in
