<p>The analysis of phylogenetic clusters did not identify large HIV-1 transmission networks, but the largest ones discovered here corresponded to recombinant variants (2 quadruplets of CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx respectively). We found disagreements between clusters detected using different viral genes (i.e. 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>) that in some cases highlight the fact that recombination can obscure the genetic relationships between sequences belonging to the same transmission network. This also evidences the lack of standardisation in the cluster definition when analysing genes other than 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and that will be needed with the increasing generation of full-genome datasets. In an attempt to help developing genetic distance cutoffs, we provide in 
 <bold>Table B</bold> in
