<p>In conclusion, the use of nearly full-genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, provided a more reliable description of CRFs (that would be otherwise misclassified) and permitted the detection of novel recombinants circulating in London. Whereas it is likely that some of the URFs were imported from abroad, our work suggests that a large proportion of them could have been generated locally.</p>
