<p>Matching the ICONIC sequences to the PR+RT 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences stored in the UK Drug Resistance Database allowed us to uncover new lineages of unique recombinants already circulating in the UK. Specifically, we detected an A1/B recombinant lineage circulating among UK-born patients whose oldest sequence was sampled in 2006. Another example was a larger A1/D clade that mostly involved patients born in Uganda and Kenya and sampled as far back as 2001, but also included many sequences from GenBank sampled in those Eastern African countriesâ€“which might indicate several introductions in the UK as opposed to local spread from a single one.
