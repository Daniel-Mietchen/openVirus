<p>Unfortunately, the low availability of HIV-1 full genomes in public databases prevented deeper exploration of the linkage between our dataset and non-UK epidemics, and also to provide more insights into the evolutionary history of the unique recombinants described here. Another limitation was the fact that not all our sequences were full-length genomes due to an unequal efficacy of the sequencing primers. In addition, although the study of HIV-1 strain distribution can provide valuable insights due to the different biological properties of certain subtypes, the growing heterogeneity of the viral epidemics will challenge the current HIV-1 strain classification.</p>
