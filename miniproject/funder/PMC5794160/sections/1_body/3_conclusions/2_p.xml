<p>Conversely, the use of longer sequences allowed for a more refined description of novel recombinants (URFs), since the accuracy on their detection using 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences relies on the presence of breakpoints within this short (~1Kb) genomic region. The 32 URFs that were detected using the full dataset involved recombination between 12 different parental strains, and some of them presented a very complex recombination pattern. Interestingly, 18 (56%) of the URF contained segments corresponding subtype B, the prevalent variant in Western countries. Four of these URFs (URF_01B) could have been introduced from South East Asia, where many similar recombinants have been described, and another 2 (a URF_BF1 transmission pair) from South America, where B/F1 recombinants represent a substantial proportion of the HIV-1 infections [

However, the remaining 12 URFs involving subtype B probably emerged in the UK (or at least in Western Europe) after introduction of non-subtype B variants which recombined with the local subtype B. The rest of the URFs (n = 14, 44%) were recombinant between HIV-1 variants that co-circulate in sub-Saharan Africa, so they could have been generated before been introduced to the UK. Some of them were particularly complex, and implied further recombination between recombinant lineages (the so-called “second-generation” recombinants), a phenomenon already detected among African migrants in Western Europe [
