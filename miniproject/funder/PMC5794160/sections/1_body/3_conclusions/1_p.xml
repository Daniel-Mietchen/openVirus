<p>The analysis of HIV-1 nearly full-genome sequences generated by the ICONIC project detected substantial variability in the London HIV-1 epidemic. The HIV-1 subtype distribution in our dataset is generally consistent with that reported in the last update (corresponding to 2010) for the whole UK based on analysis of 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The main difference lies on the prevalence of CRFs, which was 6.2% in that report in contrast to the 18.1% (3-fold higher) presented here. We demonstrate here how using the 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence alone, in this case using SCUEAL as Dolling and colleagues did, underestimated the proportion of CRFsâ€“other subtyping tools, such as COMET, will face other limitations depending on the exact subtyping algorithm. This highlights that analysis of nearly full-genome sequences is key to identifying already established recombinant lineages. In addition, CRF lineages that are traditionally very infrequent in Western countries but were identified in the present study (e.g. CRF19_cpx, CRF49_cpx, CRF43_02G and CRF60_BC) are generally absent in the reference sequence datasets that are used by automatised HIV-1 subtyping tools.
