<p>Recombination between different subtypes/CRFs happens frequently and its detection is relatively straightforward. However, the detection of recombinants between different virions of a same subtype is much more challenging due to their lower genetic diversity, and therefore remains understudied. We applied the methodology used by Kiwelu and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to the largest pure subtype datasets in ICONIC (subtypes B and C) and found similar intra-subtype recombination frequencies in subtypes B (13.4%) and C (9.1%).
