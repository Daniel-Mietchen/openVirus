  <p>Panel A) Recombination pattern (according to jpHMM) of the URF_A1B (accession number MF109371) discovered in the ICONIC dataset, the URF_50B full-length sequence (accession number KT022394) described by Foster and colleagues and a member of the A1/D Canadian cluster described by Brenner and colleagues (accession number GU592197). These 3 which presented high similarity in the PR+RT 
   <italic>pol</italic> region. B) Maximum-likelihood tree of the PR+RT 
   <italic>pol</italic> region (1,000bp) of the A1/B cluster of sequences with high similarity to the ICONIC URF_A1B. Tips corresponding to the UKHRD are in orange. Tip names show, for the GenBank sequences: subtype, sampling country, accession number and sampling year (not available for the Canadian sequences); for UKHDRD sequences: country of birth, ID and sampling year. Branches corresponding to the A1/B cluster are shown in blue. The ICONIC URF_A1B sequence is highlighted with an arrow. The tree is rooted to subtype A1 reference sequences. The diagram at the right shows the recombination pattern shown by the sequences in the cluster, according to jpHMM.
