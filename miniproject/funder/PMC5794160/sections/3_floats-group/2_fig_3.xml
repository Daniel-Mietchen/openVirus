  <p>Panel A) Recombination pattern (according to jpHMM) of the URF_A1D (accession number MF109466) discovered in the ICONIC dataset and the GenBank full-length A1/D sequence KT022394, which presented high similarity in the PR+RT 
   <italic>pol</italic> region. B) Maximum-likelihood tree of the PR+RT 
   <italic>pol</italic> region (1,000bp) of the A1/D cluster of sequences with high similarity to the ICONIC URF_A1D. Tips corresponding to the UKHRD are in orange. Tip names show, for the GenBank sequences: subtype, sampling country, accession number and sampling year; for UKHDRD sequences: country of birth, ID and sampling year. Branches corresponding to the A1/D cluster are shown in blue. The ICONIC URF_A1D and the GenBank sequence KT022394 are highlighted with arrows. The tree is rooted to a subtype B sequence. The diagram at the right shows the recombination pattern shown by the sequences in the cluster, according to jpHMM.
