The pipeline was applied to 420 HIV samples collected at University College London Hospitals NHS Trust and Barts Health NHS Trust (London) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge). Consensus genomes were generated and subtyped using COMET, and unique recombinants were studied with jpHMM and SimPlot. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML to identify transmission networks using the Cluster Picker.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>The pipeline generated sequences of at least 1Kb of length (median = 7.46Kb, IQR = 4.01Kb) for 375 out of the 420 samples (89%), with 174 (46.4%) being NFLG. A total of 365 sequences (169 of them NFLG) corresponded to unique subjects and were included in the down-stream analyses. The most frequent HIV subtypes were B (n = 149, 40.8%) and C (n = 77, 21.1%) and the circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG (n = 32, 8.8%). We found 14 different CRFs (n = 66, 18.1%) and multiple URFs (n = 32, 8.8%) that involved recombination between 12 different subtypes/CRFs. The most frequent URFs were B/CRF01_AE (4 cases) and A1/D, B/C, and B/CRF02_AG (3 cases each). Most URFs (19/26, 73%) lacked breakpoints in the PR+RT <italic>pol</italic> region, rendering them undetectable if only that was sequenced. Twelve (37.5%) of the URFs could have emerged within the UK, whereas the rest were probably imported from sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South America. For 2 URFs we found highly similar <italic>pol</italic> sequences circulating in the UK. We detected 31 phylogenetic clusters using the full dataset: 25 pairs (mostly subtypes B and C), 4 triplets and 2 quadruplets. Some of these were not consistent across different genes due to inter- and intra-subtype recombination. Clusters involved 70 sequences, 19.2% of the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The initial analysis of genome sequences detected substantial hidden variability in the London HIV epidemic. Analysing full genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, identified previously undetected recombinants.

HIV-1 is classified in four groups: M, O, N and P. HIV-1 group M drives the global pandemic, and includes 9 subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K), at least 88 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and countless unique recombinant forms (URFs), generated when cells are superinfected by HIV-1 virions from different subtypes/CRFs. CRFs are defined as inter-subtype recombinant lineages that derived from the same common ancestor, and for which at least three epidemiologically unlinked variants are monophyletic and share an identical genetic structure along their full genome. URFs are recombinants with different recombination breakpoints than those found in CRFs, and emerge after localised, isolated recombination events. URFs are responsible for at least 20% of HIV-1 infections worldwide&#x02013;a proportion that reaches 40% in some African countries [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>HIV-1 subtype B is the prevalent variant in high-income areas like North America and Western Europe [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the most studied strain despite only accounting for 12% of global infections. However, in the last decade, the remaining subtypes and recombinants (&#x0201c;non-B variants&#x0201d;, responsible for the remaining 88% of infections worldwide) have increased in prevalence and heterogeneity in developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The UK is no exception, and viral genetic diversity (especially involving novel recombinants) markedly increased in the UK HIV-1 epidemic between 2002 and 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This new heterogeneity has resulted in the description of an increasing number of CRFs in Western Europe, which traditionally were restricted to regional hotspots with great co-circulation of variants&#x02013;like sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and parts of South America. These new European recombinants include CRF47_BF and CRF73_BG in Spain and Portugal [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], CRF50_A1D in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CRF56_cpx in France [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and CRF60_BC in Italy [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as second-generation complex recombinant strains [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The genetic variability derived from the presence of non-B variants could affect management of HIV-1 infection [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], including the antiretroviral response [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the efficacy of viral load and resistance assays [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the speed of disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the emergence of drug resistance mutations [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the vaccine development [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, HIV-1 recombination is a powerful evolutionary force that occurs ten times more frequently than base substitutions [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and produces and maintains further variability by shuffling and combining viral genetic material. HIV-1 recombination can accelerate the adaptation to the host [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], improve viral replication [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and provide mechanisms to escape both the immune response and antiviral treatments [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At the same time, gene reshuffling derived by recombination can compensate the loss in viral fitness derived from these adaptations [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] HIV will continue to evolve and diversify, which will bring new challenges to prevention and treatment efforts.</p><p>Thus, the proper detection and description of HIV-1 variants in representative cohorts is essential, especially considering the worldwide emergence and transmission of recombinants. The coincidence of the increasing HIV-1 complexity in Western countries with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlights the potential of applying these techniques to routine surveillance of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology. Here, we aimed to identify URFs in a dataset consisting on HIV-1 nearly full-genome sequences obtained through NGS of samples taken in two major hospitals in London, UK. We describe their recombination patterns using a combination of bioinformatics tools, which include bootscanning and phylogenetic analysis of sequence sub-segments, considered the reference methodology for detecting HIV-1 variants since its first use [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Pipeline and study subjects</title><p>Within the ICONIC project, we have developed an automated and customisable high-throughput analysis pipeline to generate HIV clinical whole genomes, quantify minority variants and identify drug-resistance mutations (DRMs).

UCLH NHS Trust specimens were from a cohort of 4,700 patients under follow-up in London of which 75% of patients are men, 65% are men-having-sex-with-men (MSM) with a median age of 44 years and 20% are over 50. Almost all (97%) were already on treatment and the majority of tests (80%) were performed at virological failure or during treatment interruption pre restarting. Only 10&#x02013;20% of specimens included baseline samples at diagnosis. Specimens from Barts Health NHS Trust came from a cohort that includes 1,200 HIV genotypic resistance tests each year from a North East London patient cohort. The catchment area includes Barts Health NHS trust, the Homerton trust, and Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust with a prevalence of HIV ranging from 1.6 to 7.4 per 1,000 adults. North-East London&#x02019;s population is diverse: Tower Hamlets and Hackney have large MSM populations and Newham has the highest number of black Africans living with HIV in London. Most of the patients in the cohort are men (64%), with a median age of 41 years and 22% aged over 50. Approximately one fifth of samples tested are at baseline, the remainder tested because of viral escape or non-compliance.</p><p>Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen). RNA extracted from plasma samples was reverse transcribed and amplified by one-step RT-PCR using a set of 4 pan-HIV-1 primer set designed for the amplification of HIV-1 genomes of all groups and subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Amplicons were pooled for Illumina library preparation and sequenced applying next-generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Subtyping and recombination analyses</title><p>The consensus genomes were preliminary subtyped using a local implementation of COMET version 1.1.4 [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which included reference sequences of subtypes A1-H, J and K; CRFs 01&#x02013;29, 31&#x02013;40, 42&#x02013;47 and 49; and HIV-1 groups N, O and P. This method was applied to the full dataset but also independently to the principal structural genes (gag, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic>), extracted using GeneCutter (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/GENE_CUTTER/cutter.html">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/GENE_CUTTER/cutter.html</ext-link></italic>). This approach was followed in order to detect putative recombinant, i.e. those cases in which different genes disagreed in subtype or any of them yielded an unassigned result. Those cases were analyse in more depth using the jpHMM [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] online tool, which is capable of detecting and locating recombination breakpoints in HIV-1 sequences.</p><p>In those sequences where these tools confirmed the presence of recombination events, further analyses were applied using the program SimPlot version 3.5.1 [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which applies a bootscanning method. This consists of a sliding-window phylogenetic bootstrap analysis of the query sequence (using a window size of 300bp moving in 10bp increments) aligned against a set of reference strains to reveal breakpoints, which was later confirmed by performing phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (GTR+&#x00393; substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replicates) of the inter-breakpoint segments. For these, we incorporated sequences from the 2010 HIV subtype reference alignment downloaded from Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV database website [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In addition, to study the most likely geographical origin of the parental variants that generated the URF detected, we looked for genetically similar sequences from GenBank (retrieved using HIV BLAST (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html</ext-link></italic>)) for each recombinant segment.</p><p>Finally, we extracted the &#x02018;clinical&#x02019; PR+RT <italic>pol</italic> segment (covering the protease and the first 235 codons of the reverse transcriptase) of the URF sequences that presented breakpoints in this coding region to retrospectively find highly genetically similar sequences within the UK HIV Drug Resistance database (UKHDRD, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hivrdb.org.uk/">http://www.hivrdb.org.uk/</ext-link></italic>) through BLAST&#x02013;these sequences could represent recombinant lineages already circulating in the UK.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Analysis of intra-subtype recombination</title><p>Whereas inter-subtype recombination can be detected relatively easily, intra-subtype recombination is much more difficult to identify due to a greater sequence similarity between sequences of the same subtype/variant, and the lack of standardised methodology. For the largest pure subtype datasets, we aimed to detect intra-subtype recombination using the program RDP version 4 [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] following the approach described by Kiwelu and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In short, RDP4 uses 7 non-parametric recombination detection methods: RDP, GENECONV, modified Bootscan, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, SISCAN and 3SEQ. For each of these methods, the default RDP4 settings were used. The recombination events considered definitive were those with statistically significant support (p&#x0003c;0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) for at least 3 out of the 5 algorithms. RDP4 screens all possible sequence triplets/quartets to find recombinants and potential parents, which makes possible the analysis without reference sequences.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Analysis of phylogenetic clusters</title><p>In order to identify potential transmission clusters in the full dataset, we constructed maximum likelihood trees with RAxML (with the GTR+&#x00393; substitution model) and applying the Cluster Picker with a cutoff of 90% for node statistical support and &#x02264;6% for the intra-cluster genetic diversity.

Of them, 25 were pairs (corresponding mostly to subtypes B (n = 11) and C (n = 4)), 4 were triplets (1 each for A1, B, F1, and CRF06_cpx) and 2 quadruplets (CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx). These clusters involved 70 sequences, 23.5% of the dataset. In order to explore the consistence of these clusters across different genes, we also examined clusters analysing the main HIV-1 genes independently: <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic>. Seventeen (54.8%) of the 31 clusters detected in the full dataset were also found in the individual analyses of <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic>. Their intra-subtype maximum genetic distance and bootstrap support values for each gene is shown in the <bold>Table B</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192081.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>. The average genetic distance across the 17 clusters was 2.06% for the genome-wide analysis (range: 0.08&#x02013;5.27%), 1.75% (0&#x02013;5.19%) for <italic>gag</italic>, 1.33% (0.03&#x02013;2.96%) for <italic>pol</italic> and 3.05% (0&#x02013;8.92%) for <italic>env</italic>.</p><p>Most of the inter-gene cluster disagreements (6/14, 43%) were due to the fact that not all sequences in a given cluster completely covered the 3 genes. In 4 (29%) cases the sequences were too divergent (above the genetic distance cutoff) in one of the genes: <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> in 2 cases (genetic distances of 6.0&#x02013;7.6%), <italic>gag</italic> alone (7.9%) in one case, <italic>env</italic> alone (12.9%) in the last one. The last disagreement (7%) was due to the fact that the statistical support of the node was below the cutoff (boostrap = 88%) in the <italic>gag</italic> gene tree. Finally, there were 3 cases (21%) in which certain sequences showed entirely different tree topologies according to the gene analysed. One of them involved a phylogenetic pair of pure F1 sequences that clustered very closely with a URF_02BF1 (MF109637, whose recombination pattern is described in <bold>Supporting Results</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192081.s001">S1 File</xref></bold> and shown in <bold>Figure C</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192081.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>) only in the <italic>gag</italic> gene, which suggests that the former could represent the parental lineage involved in the generation of that URF. The other 2 cases of phylogenetic inconsistence corresponded to subtype B clusters in which presumably, as the RDP analysis suggested, intra-subtype recombination had modified their clustering pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The analysis of HIV-1 nearly full-genome sequences generated by the ICONIC project detected substantial variability in the London HIV-1 epidemic. The HIV-1 subtype distribution in our dataset is generally consistent with that reported in the last update (corresponding to 2010) for the whole UK based on analysis of <italic>pol</italic> sequences [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The main difference lies on the prevalence of CRFs, which was 6.2% in that report in contrast to the 18.1% (3-fold higher) presented here. We demonstrate here how using the <italic>pol</italic> sequence alone, in this case using SCUEAL as Dolling and colleagues did, underestimated the proportion of CRFs&#x02013;other subtyping tools, such as COMET, will face other limitations depending on the exact subtyping algorithm. This highlights that analysis of nearly full-genome sequences is key to identifying already established recombinant lineages. In addition, CRF lineages that are traditionally very infrequent in Western countries but were identified in the present study (e.g. CRF19_cpx, CRF49_cpx, CRF43_02G and CRF60_BC) are generally absent in the reference sequence datasets that are used by automatised HIV-1 subtyping tools.</p><p>Conversely, the use of longer sequences allowed for a more refined description of novel recombinants (URFs), since the accuracy on their detection using <italic>pol</italic> sequences relies on the presence of breakpoints within this short (~1Kb) genomic region. The 32 URFs that were detected using the full dataset involved recombination between 12 different parental strains, and some of them presented a very complex recombination pattern. Interestingly, 18 (56%) of the URF contained segments corresponding subtype B, the prevalent variant in Western countries. Four of these URFs (URF_01B) could have been introduced from South East Asia, where many similar recombinants have been described, and another 2 (a URF_BF1 transmission pair) from South America, where B/F1 recombinants represent a substantial proportion of the HIV-1 infections [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the remaining 12 URFs involving subtype B probably emerged in the UK (or at least in Western Europe) after introduction of non-subtype B variants which recombined with the local subtype B. The rest of the URFs (n = 14, 44%) were recombinant between HIV-1 variants that co-circulate in sub-Saharan Africa, so they could have been generated before been introduced to the UK. Some of them were particularly complex, and implied further recombination between recombinant lineages (the so-called &#x0201c;second-generation&#x0201d; recombinants), a phenomenon already detected among African migrants in Western Europe [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192081.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Matching the ICONIC sequences to the PR+RT <italic>pol</italic> sequences stored in the UK Drug Resistance Database allowed us to uncover new lineages of unique recombinants already circulating in the UK. Specifically, we detected an A1/B recombinant lineage circulating among UK-born patients whose oldest sequence was sampled in 2006. Another example was a larger A1/D clade that mostly involved patients born in Uganda and Kenya and sampled as far back as 2001, but also included many sequences from GenBank sampled in those Eastern African countries&#x02013;which might indicate several introductions in the UK as opposed to local spread from a single one.</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not have patient epidemiological data available for these samples to confirm whether subjects infected by URFs came from areas with co-circulation of HIV-1 strains or were infected in the UK. However, the HIV-infected population attended in the clinics included in the study mainly corresponded to men-having-sex-with-men (MSM), who traditionally have been mostly infected in the UK (e.g. 68% of MSM in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]).</p><p>The analysis of phylogenetic clusters did not identify large HIV-1 transmission networks, but the largest ones discovered here corresponded to recombinant variants (2 quadruplets of CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx respectively). We found disagreements between clusters detected using different viral genes (i.e. <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic>) that in some cases highlight the fact that recombination can obscure the genetic relationships between sequences belonging to the same transmission network. This also evidences the lack of standardisation in the cluster definition when analysing genes other than <italic>pol</italic>, and that will be needed with the increasing generation of full-genome datasets. In an attempt to help developing genetic distance cutoffs, we provide in <bold>Table B</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192081.s001">S1 File</xref></bold> the values found for the clusters that were consistent across genes.</p><p>Recombination between different subtypes/CRFs happens frequently and its detection is relatively straightforward. However, the detection of recombinants between different virions of a same subtype is much more challenging due to their lower genetic diversity, and therefore remains understudied. We applied the methodology used by Kiwelu and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0192081.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to the largest pure subtype datasets in ICONIC (subtypes B and C) and found similar intra-subtype recombination frequencies in subtypes B (13.4%) and C (9.1%).</p><p>Unfortunately, the low availability of HIV-1 full genomes in public databases prevented deeper exploration of the linkage between our dataset and non-UK epidemics, and also to provide more insights into the evolutionary history of the unique recombinants described here. Another limitation was the fact that not all our sequences were full-length genomes due to an unequal efficacy of the sequencing primers. In addition, although the study of HIV-1 strain distribution can provide valuable insights due to the different biological properties of certain subtypes, the growing heterogeneity of the viral epidemics will challenge the current HIV-1 strain classification.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of nearly full-genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, provided a more reliable description of CRFs (that would be otherwise misclassified) and permitted the detection of novel recombinants circulating in London. Whereas it is likely that some of the URFs were imported from abroad, our work suggests that a large proportion of them could have been generated locally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192081.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information.</title><p>Includes Supporting Results, Figuress A, B and C, and Tables A and B.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0192081.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the clinicians and scientists at University College London Hospital and Barts Health NHS Trust.
