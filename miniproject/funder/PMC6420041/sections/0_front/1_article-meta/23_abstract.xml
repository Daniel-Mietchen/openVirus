 <p>Understanding whether and how transmission patterns are revealed by branching patterns in phylogenetic trees for pathogens remains a challenging research question. Besides the diversification of the pathogen, branching patterns depend strongly on the host contact structure as it shapes opportunities for the pathogen to reproduce. However, the host contact network is often difficult to study, in particular as it evolves in time. In this paper we perform a simulation study on three different dynamic networks, on which we simulate transmission trees. We use a simple Erd≈ës-Renyi random network and two more realistic networks with skewed degree distribution, where one is also clustered. We convert transmission trees into phylogenetic trees and analyze them with different tree statistics like imbalance measures, counts of small substructures, and measures containing the branch lengths. We study the tree features with principal component analysis and with supervised learning methods, and find that network dynamics and network type can strongly influence the shape of phylogenetic trees. This implies that using phylogenetic trees from a mis-specified network type and dynamic can lead to poor phylodynamic estimation of transmission parameters. We illustrate this with HIV phylogenetic trees constructed from viral sequences of patients in the Dutch ATHENA cohort, and from sequences of the Los Alamos Sequence database.</p>
