<p>Imbalance measures are always anticorrelated with the counts of small substructures (pitchforks and cherries). The fact that network skewness increases tree imbalance (and decreases substructures) could be due to the fact that high heterogeneity in the network degree is passed on to high heterogeneity in the number of secondary infection, resulting in an imbalanced tree (measured e.g. by Sackin and Colless index). On the other hand, increased network clustering may have the opposite effect, as it results in fewer nodes being connected to hubs in the network, which may cause the infection tree and resulting phylogenetic tree to be more balanced and to exhibit more pitchforks and cherries. However, an imbalanced phylogenetic tree could in principle also result from long chains of person-to-person transmission, in which each individual infects exactly one other: imbalanced trees do not necessarily require heterogeneous contact numbers or heterogeneous numbers of secondary infections.</p>
