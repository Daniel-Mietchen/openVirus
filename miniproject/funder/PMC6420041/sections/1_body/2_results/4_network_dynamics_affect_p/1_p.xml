 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows a PCA of phylogeny features derived from skewed-clustered networks with same mean degree but different turnover rates (i.e. rates at which people enter and exit the system), and from a time-integrated static network of same mean degree

Higher population turnover of the network increases the following features of the simulated phylogenetic trees: Sackin index, Colless index, average ladder sizes, IL number, maximum height, average pathlengths, diameter, Wiener index, and betweenness, and decreases the number of cherries and pitchforks as well as maximum closeness.
