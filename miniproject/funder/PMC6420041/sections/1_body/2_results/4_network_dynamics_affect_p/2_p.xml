<p>Higher turnover gives similar results to a higher mean degree or a higher infection rate (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The static time-integrated network has no turnover, but contacts have a longer duration, presenting the opportunity to transmit comparably to a dynamic network with much higher turnover than the one used for the time integration. In dynamic networks, links get rewired often and therefore many opportunities for transmission exist. The static network has higher mean degree as the temporally existing links are accumulated (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Instead of resembling those from very low turnover, the phylogenies from static networks have therefore features similar to those from networks with very high turnover. This effect holds for different infection rates 
 <italic>Î²</italic>, but the higher the infection rate, the more the phylogenies from a time-integrated network differ from those from networks with low turnover.
