<p>The network structures become more distinct with a higher rate of infection per contact and with a higher rate of turnover (eg 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2, 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.1), and in particular the numbers of cherries and the path lengths become more distinct as these parameters increase. Differences in the path lengths and the imbalance between the networks are also more pronounced with higher 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>δ</italic>. In contrast, however, there are a few features for which differences are more pronounced at low infection rates (including the ‘ILnumbers’ and the Wiener index for clustered vs unclustered networks). In other words, given fixed values of the transmission and turnover rates, it is possible to separate, and estimate, the underlying network structure based on phylogenetic tree features, for example by discriminant analysis, classification methods, or by Approximate Bayesian Computation.
