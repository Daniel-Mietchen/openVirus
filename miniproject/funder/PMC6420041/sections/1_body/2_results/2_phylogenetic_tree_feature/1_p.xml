 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows a principal component analysis based on phylogenetic trees simulated on dynamic networks with three different topologies. Phylogenies from the Erdős-Renyi network differ strongly from the two others. This holds even for relatively small trees (100 tips), whereas for clustered and unclustered networks, the discrimination improves with the size of tree (up to 250 tips). The same results hold for a wide range of infection rates (
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.025 to 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2) and higher turnover rates (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.1). Overall, the discrimination between networks improves with tree size. The distinction between trees from different underlying networks improves if additional features are used that take into account the lengths of edges. Skewed and skewed-clustered network have a lower number of small substructures (cherries and pitchforks), and a higher value for all imbalance measures. Most network measures (except betweenness) are also positively correlated with imbalance measures.
