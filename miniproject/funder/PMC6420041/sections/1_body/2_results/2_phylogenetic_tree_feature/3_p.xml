<p>However, the details—which phylogenetic features point to which kinds of networks—are specific to the transmission and turnover rates, and mis-estimation seems likely if these are mis-specified. Furthermore, for some choices of parameters, the networks are no longer well-separated in the PCA analysis; for example, if 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.05 and 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.1 (so 
 <italic>β</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>δ</italic>), the clustered network overlaps with the random network, whereas if 
 <italic>β</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>δ</italic>, they do not overlap, but the two skewed networks (clustered and unclustered) begin to overlap.
