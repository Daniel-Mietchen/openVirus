<p>The network structure and dynamics both affect features of phylogenetic trees of pathogens spreading on the networks. However, the effects are modulated by the transmission rate and the turnover rate. These relationships are sufficiently strong as to disrupt the signal of the network type in the pathogen phylogeny. A summary of results for the different network structures is given in in the discussion and the trees are given in supporting information.</p>
