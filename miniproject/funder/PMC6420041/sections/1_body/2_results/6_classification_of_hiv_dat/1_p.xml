<p>We trained classifiers on phylogenetic trees simulated with different network hypotheses, in order to predict the network type for HIV clades from sequences of patients in the Dutch ATHENA cohort and from sequences of the Los Alamos Sequence database [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The Dutch sequences predominantly capture the Dutch national HIV epidemic (cite Bezemer PLoS Med), whereas the sequences in the Los Alamos database are from cases worldwide and capture many diverse HIV epidemics. Our network predictions are consistent with this: the higher the fraction of tips from the Netherlands, the more HIV trees are predicted to arise from skewed or skewed-clustered networks, rather than random (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>); this signal is consistent in the K-nearest neighbour and random forest classification.
