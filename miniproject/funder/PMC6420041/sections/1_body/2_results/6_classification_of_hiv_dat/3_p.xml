<p>It is not surprising that more HIV trees were predicted to have the higher infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2 when the classifiers were trained on the dynamic network. On dynamic networks, not all links are present at any moment, which slows down the outbreak. A higher infection rate could compensate to attain the same R0. This result was very robust even when fewer tree features were used to train the classifier. However, if only imbalance measures were used, a low fraction of HIV trees were predicted to have 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.05 by dynamic-network-based classifiers. This suggests that using a variety of tree features is important for specification of network parameters from phylogenies.
