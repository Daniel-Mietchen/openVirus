<p>We also trained the classifiers on simulated trees from a skewed-clustered network with two different infection rates (
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.05 and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2), in order to predict the infection rate for the HIV trees (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t007" ref-type="table">Table (7)</xref>. We did the latter both with trees from static networks and dynamic networks with turnover rate 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.1. For the static network, roughly two thirds of the HIV trees are predicted to have infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.05 and one third 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2. In contrast, all of the HIV trees are predicted to have the higher infection rate of 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.2 on the dynamic network.
