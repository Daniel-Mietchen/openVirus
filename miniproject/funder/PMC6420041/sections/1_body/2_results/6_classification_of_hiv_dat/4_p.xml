<p>We have also listed separate predictions for clades in which more than 50% or 70% of the tips are from the ATHENA dataset; these are geographically linked, may include more recent transmission and are likely to have a higher sampling density than background clades from the Los Alamos database. Compared to the whole set of 90 HIV clades, these clades are more likely to be classified to have come from a skewed (clustered) network and to have a high transmission rate (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). In contrast, clades with fewer Dutch sequences were classified predominantly to have a lower transmission rate if classifiers were trained using static networks, but a higher transmission rate using dynamic networks. The fact that the results differ considerably depending on the underlying network assumption indicates that a mis-specified network, via an incorrect turnover rate or indeed the assumption of a static network, can have a strong effect on predicted transmission rates.
