<p>Given the poor ability to predict 
 <italic>β</italic> when the mean degree and turnover are randomly sampled, we explored whether keeping these parameters fixed would improve the estimation: if we knew these parameters and had pathogen phylogenies, would we then be able to estimate the transmission rate in the context of dynamic networks? Here, the accuracy is only good in the case of the random network (0.7, 0.82 for KNN, random forests respectively). Random forests give consistently slightly higher accuracy, with an accuracy over 0.5 where (1) all three networks (skewed, skewed-clustered an random) were present in the training data, or (2) the model was trained on the skewed or random networks. If the network is mis-specified or skewed, neither approach is able to predict 
 <italic>β</italic>. We suggest that this may have adverse consequences for analyses using static or other assumed network models in phylodynamics; these may draw erroneous conclusions about the rate of transmission or other parameters due to mis-specification of the underlying network.
