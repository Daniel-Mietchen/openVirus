<p>Discrimination between skewed and skewed-clustered networks remains difficult, as these networks are quite similar. The difference between skewed and random networks is more pronounced (as also seen in the PCA analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In that sense our results are similar to the results in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], who successfully predicted contact rates with Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) on static networks, where the phylogenetic trees separate well in a PCA plot of extracted tree measures.
