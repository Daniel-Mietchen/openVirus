<p>For simulations with distributed values for

 <italic>δ</italic> and mean degree of the network, we calculated all of our features of phylogenetic trees and used these to train classifiers, which we then tested. We used K nearest neighbours (KNN) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] which classifies an object based the the class of the majority of its nearest neighbours, and random forests [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] which use decision trees to classify the test data. We simulated 1549 phylogenetic trees on the three types of networks, with random uniformly distributed values of the turnover and transmission rate parameters (both in [0.05, 0.15]) and mean degrees (in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). We trained classifiers on 1040 instances to classify from which type of network a phylogeny was derived. We compute the mean and standard deviation of the accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification is successful in the sense that it is possible to classify the dynamic network type based on the phylogenetic features, given a range of transmission parameters and turnover rates in the training data. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> lists the results when we choose the key parameters 
 <italic>β</italic> (transmission rate), mean degree and turnover 
 <italic>δ</italic> uniformly at random over the specified ranges. Both classifiers predict the network type with high accuracy, using the phylogenetic features. This means that even with the additional complications of dynamic networks and unknown underlying parameters, phylogenetic trees encode information about the nature of the network.
