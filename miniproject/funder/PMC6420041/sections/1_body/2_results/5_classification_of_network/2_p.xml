<p>We also asked how varying the underlying (and in general unknown) dynamic contact network would affect estimation of the transmission parameter 
 <italic>β</italic> (also in Tables 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Estimation of 
 <italic>β</italic> is much worse than estimation of the network, and strongly depends on the assumed network. The performance is best for random forests with either all three networks present in the data (accuracy 0.47) or with a single, correctly-specified, skewed or random network used to train the model (accuracy 0.55, 0.44 respectively). Mis-specification of the network worsens predictions.
