<p>Population turnover in dynamic networks has a measurable effect on pathogen phylogenies; phylogenetic tree features can discriminate between different turnover rates at which the underlying network is evolving. Overall, the higher the turnover, the higher the imbalance measures and the lower counts of small substructures. No single feature captures the differences between contact network hypotheses entirely, and a combination of many different features yields the best visual separation between the groups in a PCA plot. Features that take into account the branch length of the phylogenetic trees improve the separation slightly. Very different patterns are obtained from a static time-integrated network as compared to dynamic networks, on which transmission happens slower. This suggests that in the phylodynamic setting, static networks are a poor approximation for dynamic networks, highlighting the need for dynamic network models. This also highlights the need for investigating turnover and dynamics in empirical networks to obtain the data necessary to develop dynamic models. We illustrated this result by predicting the infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> of HIV trees, and showed that the predictions strongly underestimate 
 <italic>β</italic> if a static network is used instead of a dynamic one. Comparison to HIV data also showed that clades with tips predominantly from the Dutch sequence dataset with high sampling fraction of infected individuals are more likely to be predicted to have come from a skewed or skewed-clustered network than those with tips mainly from the even sparser sampled Los Alamos database.
