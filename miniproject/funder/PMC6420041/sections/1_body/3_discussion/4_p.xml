<p>Although the dynamic skewed-clustered network is likely to be a more realistic approximation to real networks than static or unclustered networks, it still might not be as clustered as a given real contact network. The details of the relevant network for a study of real data will depend on the pathogen and also on the nature of the community in which that pathogen is being studied. The dynamic models we have used here are still relatively simple and tractable, and real networks are likely to be even more heterogeneous.</p>
