<p>Nevertheless, in our simulations, phylogenies from skewed-clustered networks are slightly more similar to those from random networks than those from unclustered networks of the same degree distribution. Phylogenetic trees from outbreaks on the same static network, but with different infection rates or different mean degrees, can be distinguished clearly in PCA plots. This result holds also on dynamic networks, and suggests, in keeping with previous work, that phylogenetic tree features can be used to estimate epidemiological parameters. However, the relationships between the epidemiological parameters, networks and phylogenetic trees are complex. We tested the strength of some of these relationships using supervised learning methods, and found that both network mis-specification and variability in other parameters (modelling uncertainty about the values of these parameters) have a strong impact on the ability to estimate the transmission parameter. Our results indicate that consistent network mis-specification and parameter uncertainty may have an adverse impact on phylodynamic studies estimating parameters from data.</p>
