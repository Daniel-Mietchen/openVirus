<p>We used models of different human host contact networks to simulate outbreaks of pathogens, and convert the infection trees into phylogenetic trees. We showed that it is possible to discriminate with tree statistics between different contact network hypotheses, different turnover rates, different mean degrees and different infection rates. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> sumarizes the network effect on tree statistics. The underlying contact network hypothesis (random, skewed or skewed-clustered) is clearly identifiable in statistics of the simulated phylogenetic trees, if 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>δ</italic> are the same. This indicates that simple networks such as the Erdős-Renyi model are likely to be unsuitable models for human host contact networks where there is evidence for a skewed degree distribution and clustering.
