<p>Understanding whether and how the transmission patterns of a pathogen are revealed by branching patterns in pathogen phylogenetic trees remains a challenging research question. Alongside the stochastic diversification of the pathogen on the short time scales of an infectious disease outbreak, branching patterns in the pathogen’s phylogenetic tree also depend strongly on the underlying transmission pattern [
