<p>The duration of infectiousness and the time scale of the network dynamics must affect the relationship between pathogen phylogenies and network parameters. Clearly, no individual has thousands of contacts over a week; reports of degrees that are orders of magnitude higher than the average are from data aggregated over long time periods; where an infectious duration is of the order of weeks or a few months, the scale-free property is unlikely to hold. These issues are presented briefly in [
