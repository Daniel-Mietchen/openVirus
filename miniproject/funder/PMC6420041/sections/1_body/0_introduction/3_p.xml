<p>Recently there has been interest in using genetic data from pathogens, together with phylogenetic and phylodynamic tools, to estimate the parameters of human contact networks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is appealing, in that data now accessible with high-throughput sequencing technologies (pathogen sequences, at a level of resolution that makes detecting even small amounts of genetic variation feasible) can reveal information about a fundamental population-level structure (the network). Sequences can show patterns of descent, and pathogens transmitted directly from human to human need human contact networks to have descendants. Since networks are difficult to observe directly and phylogenetic trees in principle contain some information about them, researchers have used a variety of tools to relate pathogen phylogenetic trees to the underlying contact network’s degree distribution, connectivity and clustering [
