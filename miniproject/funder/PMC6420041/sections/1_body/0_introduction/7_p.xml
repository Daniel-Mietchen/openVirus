<p>Furthermore, many of the observations underlying reports of scale-free degree distributions in human contact networks are derived from reports of the 
 <italic>cumulative</italic> numbers of contacts that individuals have over a long period (for example over one year [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], or accumulated to date). Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to compare simulated transmission dynamics in models where individualsâ€™ degrees are modelled from observed 
 <italic>accumulated</italic> numbers of contacts to transmission where degrees are taken as the 
 <italic>instantaneous</italic> (or even shorter-term) numbers of contacts. The static network (with degrees modelled on data for the number of contacts accumulated over long time periods) can be a very poor approximation of the true dynamic network; outbreaks can spread faster in such a static network due to the potentially very high numbers of simultaneous contacts.
