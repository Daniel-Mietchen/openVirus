<p>The role of networks in epidemic spreading has been studied extensively in past decades [

The topology of the host contact network plays a crucial role in setting the epidemic threshold, the epidemic size and the most effective interventions. Network properties also play a role in determining which individuals are at high risk of infection. Naturally, modellers seek to inform simulated networks with individual-level data from real populations. Respondent-driven sampling [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], snowball sampling or questionnaires [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] are several approaches to gathering these data, but all are challenging: people do not always remember how many people they have been in contact with, and in some contexts (such as injection drug use or sexual behaviour), contact is stigmatized or even illegal. As a result, individuals may not wish to report contacts to public health practitioners.
