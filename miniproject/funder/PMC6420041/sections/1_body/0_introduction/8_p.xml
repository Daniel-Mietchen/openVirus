<p>In using phylodynamic tools to estimate network parameters from pathogen phylogenies, it is typically assumed that the contact network is static in time; one seeks network parameters that produce pathogen phylogenetic trees that are similar to observed trees, conditional on the static network assumption (and perhaps also on assumptions about the degree distribution, clustering patterns and other network attributes). Whatever the details, inferred quantities such as degree distribution, the average number of partners and the infection rate are influenced by assumptions about the network, including the static assumption.</p>
