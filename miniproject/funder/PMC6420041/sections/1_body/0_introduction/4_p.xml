<p>Studies have reported varying strengths of the effect of the contact network on the phylogeny. For example, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found a very weak influence of the network’s clustering coefficient when the degree distribution is held constant, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] studied the shapes of phylogenies from simulated genetic data and found a moderate influence of the underlying network degree distribution, though “clustering” in phylogenetic trees did not parallel the heterogeneity in the degree distribution, and network dynamics shape phylogenies as well. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found a relatively stong effect of the variance in degree distribution and of the average pathlength of the network on the shapes of phylogenies. Also, within-host viral diversity affects the link between network structures and phylogenies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], as do the basic reproduction number and other details of the process [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that details of timing of infection, in-host selection, selection at the population level and other factors may also affect the relationship between contact networks and phylogies.
