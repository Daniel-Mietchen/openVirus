<p>In this paper, we investigate the effect of human host network dynamics on pathogen phylogenies. Our study focuses on simulations, and on the relationship between network assumptions and estimates of transmission parameters. We compare simulated phylogenies from outbreaks on static and dynamic networks, and we explore the effect of the turnover rate at which individuals enter and leave the system. We also study the effect of the network characteristics on the phylogenies. For this, we use networks with binomial degree distribution and skewed degree distribution, as well as clustered and unclustered networks. We explore the effect of the infection rate and the mean number of contacts. We study how the features of the underlying networks affect phylogenetic trees with various tree statistics. Finally, we turn to phylodynamic inference of HIV transmission parameters and illustrate our main results using HIV sequence data from the Dutch ATHENA cohort and Los Alamos. In particular, we characterise the impact of alternative assumptions on human contact network dynamics on estimation of key transmission parameters including R0.</p>
