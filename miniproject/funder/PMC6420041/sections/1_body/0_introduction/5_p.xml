<p>Human contact networks are self-organizing systems with certain general characteristics; one approach to modelling human host networks is to perform simulations that are able to reproduce those characteristics. Key characteristics include a short average pathlength (small-world property) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a scale-free (or at least highly skewed) degree distribution [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In particular, networks with a skewed degree distribution have received much attention for epidemic spreading, as they yield significantly different transmission patterns from a homogeneously mixed population. Depending on the transmission pathway, there is evidence that networks can have an exponential degree distribution [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or a scale-free degree distribution, found in various social networks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and in human contact networks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The Barabasi-Albert model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in particular is a much-studied process by which scale-free degree distributions may emerge. It is based on the idea of preferential attachment: nodes attach preferentially to existing nodes that already have many links.
