<p>A person enters the network and gets connected to a person chosen at random. Further links are added between randomly chosen people in the network to keep the average degree constant. People exit the system at the given rate. When a person leaves the network, their links are broken. The degree distribution in this algorithm converges to a binomial degree distribution.</p>
