<p>It can be shown theoretically [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] that the degree distribution in this process converges to a power law degree distribution with an exponential cutoff; the cutoff strength increases with decreasing number of people (nodes), and also is increased when the mean degree is decreased. For mean degree â‰ˆ 3 and a network size of 1000 nodes, the cutoff is so strong that the degree distribution can always be approximated by an exponential distribution.
