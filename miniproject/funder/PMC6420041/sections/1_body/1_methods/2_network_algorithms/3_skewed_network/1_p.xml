<p>A person enters the network and forms a partnership (link) with one other person 
 <italic>j</italic>, where the probability to select someone as partner is proportional to that person’s current number of partnerships (degree). To maintain a constant number of links despite the fact that individuals leave the system, additional links are introduced. For this, a first person 
 <italic>i</italic> is picked with probability proportional to its number of contacts. Node 
 <italic>i</italic> is then linked to a second person 
 <italic>j</italic>, who is again picked with probability proportional to person 
 <italic>j</italic>’s number of contacts. People exit the system at a given rate, and their links are all broken. If a person is left without any links because their partners have left the network, they are connected to existing nodes, again with probability proportional to a node’s degree.
