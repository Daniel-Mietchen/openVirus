<p>We also compute time-integrated networks, i.e we let the networks evolve with entry and exit, and create (unweighted) networks of all nodes that have 
 <italic>ever</italic> been in the network, where two nodes are connected if there has 
 <italic>ever</italic> been a link between them. As a consequence, the time-integrated network has many more links than a dynamic network at a specific point in time. The degree distribution of the time-integrated networks has a higher mean and more than the degree distribution of the instantaneous networks. Both dynamic and time-integrated static networks have the same answer to the question “How many contacts have you had in a given time?”, so they can be modelled using the same source of input data (e.g. questionnaires [
