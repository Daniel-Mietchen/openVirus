<p>The stationary state of the degree distribution is again a power law with exponential cutoff, with a higher decay constant as in the skewed network (for low mean degree 
 <italic>d</italic> &lt; 3). At a given point in time, not all nodes in the network are necessarily connected to one component (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006761.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The clustering coefficient, or transitivity, is defined as the ratio of the number of triangles to the number of connected triplets [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Rules (i) and (ii) cause the transitivity to be higher than it is in the the skewed network (for all system sizes, here the transitivity is â‰ˆ 0.15).
