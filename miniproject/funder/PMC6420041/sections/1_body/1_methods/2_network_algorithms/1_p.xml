<p>We use an algorithm for a “skewed-clustered” network which generates a network with a skewed degree distribution and positive transitivity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To understand what these features add, we also use skewed (but not particularly clustered) networks, and an Erdős-Renyi random network. These all have a stationary average number of contacts and stationary degree distribution, while people are entering and exiting the network. This entry and exit happens with a turnover rate 
 <italic>δ</italic>, which is the ratio between the number of people entering per time step to the number of people in the network. Networks are simulated in discrete time. In each time step the following steps happen:
