<p>We used principal component analysis to study different types of networks, different mean degree and infection rate for a given network, as well as different turnover rates and a time-integrated static network (see all scenarios in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We also trained classifiers on the networks in order to predict infection rate, turnover rate and network type (see all scenarios in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
