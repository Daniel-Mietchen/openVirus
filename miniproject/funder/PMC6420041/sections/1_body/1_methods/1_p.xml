<p>We simulate the human contact network with the algorithms described in section. First, we allow the networks to converge to a stationary state in terms of degree distribution; in this stationary state, networks are still dynamic in the sense that people enter and exit. Then, an outbreak is simulated on the networks while they continue to evolve. One person is infected and, with a constant infection rate per contact, the infection can spread. The resulting infection trees are converted into a phylogenetic trees (see section). Unlike the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, our approach allows a skewed degree distribution to emerge while keeping the size and total degree fixed. Throughout, individuals enter and leave the network and links are formed and dissolved. In contrast, in the BA model, nodes and links are continuously added and remain in the network. We set a constant number of tips in our trees. We use tree shape and length statistics, detailed in section, to compare phylogenetic trees.</p>
