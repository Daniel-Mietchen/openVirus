<p>We use two approaches to understand how the underlying contact network affects the tree features. The first is to visualise the results using principal components analysis (PCA) on the matrix of features described above. The matrix values are scaled such that the mean is zero, and normalized such that variance is 1, as is standard in PCA. This visually illustrates the extent to which these features discriminate between phylogenetic trees derived from different contact networks. However, visual separation on a 2-dimensional PCA plot is a limited measure of how informative the features are of the contact network. Thus, we also explore this quantitatively using both K-nearest neighbours and random forest classification. We attempt to classify the network (random, skewed or skewed-clustered) based on the features. We assess accuracy in these binary and categorical classifications when the underlying network model correct, and when it is mis-specified. We also attempt to classify the transmission rate. For this goal we use trees from simulated outbreaks where we distributed the transmission rate
