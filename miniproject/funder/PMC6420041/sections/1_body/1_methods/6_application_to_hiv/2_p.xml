<p>From this tree we identify 90 non-intersecting clades in the specified size range 100-151, using a depth first search approach. The mean number of tips in the clades was 127. 86 out of 90 clades contained samples from the ATHENA cohort, with a fraction between 0.01 and 0.97. Overall, the clades we extracted contained 8326 sequences from the Los Alamos data and 3186 from the Dutch HIV-1 ATHENA cohort. We compared the HIV clades with simulated trees from different networks and to trees simulated on the same network, but with varying infection rates. We trained random forest and K-nearest neighbour classifiers on tree features from the simulated networks, and used the features from the HIV clades as a test set. The simulated trees (the training set) had 100 tips. We then used the classifiers to predict the network type or infection rate for the HIV clades.</p>
