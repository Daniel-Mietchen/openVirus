<p>Partial nucleotide HIV-1 polymerase sequences were obtained as described previously from patients in the ATHENA national observational HIV cohort in the Netherlands (by June 2015) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We used the first sequence per patient, with a minimum of 750 nucleotides length. No patient information was included in the analysis. Sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega 1.1.0 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and manually checked and adjusted. HIV-1 subtyping was performed with COMET v1.3 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and 6912 subtype B sequences were considered for further analysis. In addition we retrieved 19,459 HIV-1 subtype B sequences from the Los Alamos database (by September 2017) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], with a minimum length of 1000 nucleotides overlap to the ATHENA alignment. Excluding sites with less than 75% coverage, and with IAS resistant mutations 2015 removed This resulted in a sequence alignment of 1,128 nucleotides length [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Viral phylogenies were reconstructed with FastTree version 2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].
