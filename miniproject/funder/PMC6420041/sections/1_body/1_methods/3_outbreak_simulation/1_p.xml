<p>In our simulations, we begin with one infected individual who then infects neighbours at a constant infection rate per contact, after which the neighbours can infect their respective neighbours in the next time step, and so forth. Infected individuals stay infected throughout the simulation, modelling a long-term infection. This simulates an outbreak on these dynamic networks. There is at least one time step between an individual becoming infected and infecting a neighbour, and we model a positive time between any two infection events by adding a small positive time to the infection events of one iteration, such that they occur with equal time lapses.</p>
