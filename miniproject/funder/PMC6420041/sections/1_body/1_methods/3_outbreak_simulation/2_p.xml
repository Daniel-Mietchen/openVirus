<p>We extract what would be the “true timed phylogeny” of the pathogen given the transmission tree in our network, under the assumption that hosts carry a single pathogen lineage. To do this we form a binary branching tree in which each host corresponds to a tip in the phylogeny and branch lengths correspond to time. Since we know the true transmission tree and its timing, this can be done by tracking the infectors, infectees and the time between infection events. This is available in the 
 <monospace>getLabGenealogy</monospace> function in the R package PhyloTop [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006761.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The simulation of the outbreak is stopped after a time such that the phylogenetic trees all have the same number of tips.
