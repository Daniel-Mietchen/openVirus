  <title>Topologies of a dynamic skewed-clustered network (top), a dynamic skewed network (middle) and a dynamic random network (bottom) at one point in time.</title>
  <p>Turnover rate (probability to leave the network in one timestep) 
   <italic>Î´</italic> = 0.1. The inlays on the left show the pathlength distribution. The skewed network has a much shorter pathlength than the random network (for same mean degree), and skewed-clustered network has slightly longer average pathlength, but still shorter than the random network. This relationship holds for a wide range of mean degrees. The inlay on the right shows the counter-cumulative degree distribution in loglinear scale, which are power laws with exponential cutoff for the skewed-clustered network and skewed network (blue and red), and binomial for the random network (black).
