  <title>Tree features of the simulated phylogenies.</title>
  <p>Left: PCA plot of tree features from phylogenetic trees simulated on different networks: random (Erdős-Renyi), skewed and skewed-clustered. Each contact network has mean degree 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5, and all simulated trees have 500 tips. Parameters: infection rate 
   <italic>β</italic> = 0.05, population turnover = 0.03. Right: correlations between tree features, here most features are clearly correlated (blue) or anti-correlated (red). Simulated trees to figure (a) are found in supporting information.
