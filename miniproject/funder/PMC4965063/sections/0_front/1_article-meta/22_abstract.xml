 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Scientific consensus has now been reached that intrauterine Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in infection of the fetus and subsequent fetal death, congenital microcephaly, and/or Central Nervous System (CNS) malformations. Preliminary data suggest miscarriage and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) are most likely when maternal infection occurs early in pregnancy, but fetal abnormalities have been found in women infected with ZIKV during all three trimesters, indicating all trimesters are vulnerable. Like related 
  <italic>flavivirus</italic> infections, ZIKV transmission is likely to be seasonal. I propose that the risk of ZIKV infection to pregnant women can be reduced using a window of opportunity for conception that will align sensitive periods of gestation with the low-transmission season for ZIKV.
