<p>The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus—vectored by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>—spreading rapidly across the globe [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pregnant women infected with ZIKV risk severe fetal outcomes, including brain abnormalities—believed to be due to disruption of brain development caused by intrauterine infection—and death [

 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ZIKV was the suspected cause of the 2015/2016 outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and scientific consensus has now been reached that prenatal ZIKV infection causes microcephaly and other forms of brain abnormalities. Upon maternal infection, however, the risk of such fetal outcomes remains unknown [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In April 2016, the causal link between ZIKV and microcephaly was inferred via several independent lines of evidence, including (1) microcephaly and brain abnormalities in infants born to mothers with suspected or confirmed ZIKV infection during the first or second trimester of pregnancy, (2) the rare form of microcephaly in infants with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), distinguishing it from microcephaly resulting from other causes, and (3) birth defects occurring in women with travel-acquired ZIKV, coupled with the low probability that these events were coincident and not causal [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several reports from February to May 2016 have now provided strong evidence for the causal link. A retrospective study of the 2013/2014 ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia found a 14-fold increase in severe microcephaly in newborns and fetuses following the epidemic; amniotic fluid tested positive for ZIKV in 4 of 7 women sampled after identification of fetal abnormalities [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, in Brazil, 42 ZIKV-positive pregnant women were tested for fetal abnormalities. Adverse findings—including fetal death, microcephaly, and central nervous system (CNS) damage—were observed in 12 of the women. There were no abnormalities in ZIKV-negative women [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lastly, the complete ZIKV genome was recovered from the brain of a fetus with microcephaly aborted by an expectant mother infected during the 13th week of gestation [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on two newborns from Brazil with microcephaly who died shortly after birth, as well as two miscarriages; all tested positive for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to the epidemiological evidence, newly developed mouse models of ZIKV have demonstrated that ZIKV strains from French Polynesia and Brazil can infect the fetus via the placenta and cause intrauterine growth restrictions and/or fetal loss [

 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Culture models of early brain development have also shown ZIKV can cause neural cell death [
