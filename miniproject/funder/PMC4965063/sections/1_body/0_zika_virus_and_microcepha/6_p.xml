<p>These aspects of ZIKV biology can be integrated with incidence data and mathematical models to inform interventions, including reducing transmission (i.e., vector-to-human and sexual) via vector control and behavioral changes, planning pregnancy to avoid the high-transmission season, launching vaccines once developed, and reducing intrauterine transmission and pathology. Knowledge gap 3 (immunity) will be particularly important for understanding the recurrent epidemic dynamics of ZIKV and CZS. If ZIKV antibodies either wane or do not fully protect from infection, then we could expect women of childbearing age to be susceptible to ZIKV after their primary infection (which might occur during the first epidemic wave).</p>
