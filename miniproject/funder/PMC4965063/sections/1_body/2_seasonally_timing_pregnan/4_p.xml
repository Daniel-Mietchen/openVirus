 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002520.g003">Fig 3A</xref> shows the window of opportunity for conception when the high transmission season lasts 13 weeks and the fetus is susceptible during various periods of gestation. The window of opportunity depends on three key factors: (1) the timing of the transmission trough (i.e., the week(s) or month of the year when transmission is at a minimum), (2) the susceptible period of gestation, and (3) whether the severity of congenital ZIKV infection varies during the susceptible period of gestation. For example, it may be that the first two trimesters are susceptible to fetal abnormalities, but the first trimester is the most vulnerable. Knowing the distribution of susceptibility throughout the gestational weeks would impact the timing of planned conception. Assuming the period of susceptibility spans gestation weeks 1â€“20, with the first trimester being highly susceptible and therefore given high priority for protection, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002520.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref> show how the seasonal distribution of conception could be shifted and amplified to reduce ZIKV risk in Puerto Rico. In general, although tailoring conception seasonally will not alleviate risk of maternal exposure to ZIKV, it could reduce risk and provide an option for women as they wait for a ZIKV vaccine and/or clinical interventions. Planned seasonal conception would be an effective low-cost means of empowering women to protect themselves and their children.
