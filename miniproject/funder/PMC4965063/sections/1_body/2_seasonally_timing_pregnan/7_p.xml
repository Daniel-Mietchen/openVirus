<p>A key unknown is the susceptible period of gestation; when this period is determined, then seasonally planning pregnancy could be integrated into the growing portfolio of ZIKV interventions. The feasibility and acceptability of planning conception seasonally will need to be addressed regionally with careful consideration of women’s reproductive rights and personal values. An R-package including data used in this manuscript and a conception planning calendar is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s004">S4 Data</xref>. The conception planner requires user-defined (1) timing of the transmission trough, (2) susceptible weeks of gestation, and (3) a statement of whether the first trimester is particularly vulnerable. To increase the effectiveness of seasonally planning conception, vector control campaigns could be used to restrict the mosquito season, minimize the duration of the high-transmission season, and expand the window of opportunity for “safe gestation.” The integration of epidemiology and family planning can be an effective tool for seasonally timing conception to reduce women’s risk of ZIKV infection during pregnancy.
