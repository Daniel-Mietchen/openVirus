<p>At this time, there are insufficient data to predict the seasonal timing and frequency (i.e., annual, biennial, triennial, etc.) at which ZIKV epidemics will occur. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil peaked between July 12–18, 2015 [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which is out-of-phase with DENV epidemics in Brazil, which consistently peak around March [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This suggests the seasonal timing of DENV epidemics might not be useful in predicting the timing of ZIKV. Importantly, however, the first epidemic wave of ZIKV may not reflect ZIKV’s future recurrent epidemic timing. The first wave of the epidemic may differ from future recurrent epidemics because (1) clinical recognition and reporting of cases may lag far behind pathogen introduction, (2) the first wave occurs in a fully susceptible population, which will alter the epidemic growth curve and the time until susceptible depletion, and (3) the timing of epidemic onset will be influenced by pathogen introduction as opposed to recurrent epidemics in locations with unbroken transmission chains, the onset of which is influenced by the build-up of the susceptible population and seasonal transmission [
