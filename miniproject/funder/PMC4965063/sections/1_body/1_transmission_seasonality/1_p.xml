<p>Seasonality is a common feature of acute infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although infectious diseases are seasonal, the timing of the high-transmission season can (1) vary among pathogens within a country and (2) vary among countries/regions for a given pathogen [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The drivers of DENV, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV seasonality are likely some combination of vector phenology, climate conditions, and additional host or environmental factors. In general, climatic, physiological, and behavioral factors that influence transmission seasonality include those that impact host and/or vector susceptibility to infection, host/vector infectiousness, virus viability, the transmission-relevant contact rate among hosts/vectors, the density of hosts, and vector abundance [
