<p>A key reason for characterizing transmission seasonality and pinpointing the high transmission season is because its timing will affect the risk of microcephaly in birth cohorts. This is because births are seasonal across human populations, and there is a distinct birth pulse in most countries/regions that varies geographically in its seasonal timing [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002520.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows the birth seasonality in Puerto Rico, with the birth peak from Augustâ€“October. Due to birth seasonality, the percent of pregnancies experiencing a specific trimester is not evenly distributed throughout the year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002520.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). For any given country, the timing of the seasonal birth pulse relative to the ZIKV transmission season will therefore determine the fraction of pregnancies at risk for maternal infection and congenital ZIKV. For example, if a country has a birth pulse in which sensitive gestational periods coincide with the ZIKV season, more pregnancies in that country will be at risk than elsewhere. Fortunately, if access to contraceptives and family planning practices are proactively targeted for intervention, then the birth pulse could be intentionally shifted and amplified regionally to minimize the risk of intrauterine ZIKV infection for entire birth cohorts.
