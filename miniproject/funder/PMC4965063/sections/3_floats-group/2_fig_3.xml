  <title>Planning pregnancy to take advantage of the low ZIKV transmission season.</title>
  <p>(a) Window of opportunity for conception based on the region-specific transmission season and the susceptible period of gestation. The high-transmission season is marked in blue, and the transmission trough is indicated by the dashed line. The ZIKV-susceptible gestation period is unknown, but preliminary data suggest that all three trimesters are susceptible; however, the first two trimesters are particularly vulnerable. The six scenarios depict the window of opportunity for conception under different susceptible gestation periods. Scenario 1 is susceptibility during gestation weeks 1–20, similar to other congenital infections. Scenario 2 is susceptibility during weeks 1–26, i.e., the first and second trimester. Scenario 3 is susceptibility during weeks 1–40, all three trimesters. The A and B variants of each scenario indicate whether there is uniform susceptibility across the susceptible gestation period or if the first trimester is particularly vulnerable. Policy could encourage planned conception such that the susceptible gestation period is aligned with the transmission trough. This policy would minimize the risk of maternal exposure when the fetus is most vulnerable. The window of opportunity for conception varies depending on when (in the calendar year) the high-transmission season occurs. (b) Theoretical trajectory of conception in Puerto Rico if conception were seasonally planned. The percent indicates the monthly value based on pregnancies initiated that year. The transmission trough was assumed to be in April (based on the data in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002520.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). Gestation weeks 1–20 were assumed to be susceptible, with the first trimester being particularly vulnerable and given highest priority for protection. Conception was therefore encouraged in March, which had the effect of shifting and amplifying the birth pulse. The projection assumes that, each year, planned conception results in 3% of annual births that would have occurred in Jan., May., Jun., Jul., Aug., Sep., Oct., Nov., or Dec. being redistributed to Feb (0.5%), Mar (2%), and Apr (0.5%).
