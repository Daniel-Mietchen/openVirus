  <title>Seasonality of the ZIKV vector and birth seasonality.</title>
  <p>(a) Monthly abundance of trapped female mosquitoes engorged with blood-meal in Puerto Rico. Data from [
   <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], available in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s001">S1 Data</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s004">S4 Data</xref>. Mosquitoes were collected from 20 houses in heavily urbanized areas around San Juan Metropolitan area using battery-powered aspirators. Seasonal time series decomposition was used to extract the seasonal component of the time series (solid line). Red arrows indicate the inferred seasonal trough of engorged female mosquitoes, which occurred around April each year. (b) Monthly births in Puerto Rico for the years 2002–2008 and 2012–2014. Data from [
   <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], available in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s002">S2 Data</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s004">S4 Data</xref>. Time series from each year are stacked, with each line representing data from a single year. Births are seasonal around the world; the birth peak in Puerto Rico occurs around September each year. (c) Weekly reported DENV cases in Puerto Rico. Data are from [
   <xref rid="pbio.1002520.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], available in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s003">S3 Data</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s004">S4 Data</xref>. Red arrows indicate the inferred DENV transmission trough in April, which coincides with the trough in mosquitoes. (d) The seasonal distribution of pregnancies by trimester. The seasonal distribution of pregnancies by trimester was estimated based on the birth data from Puerto Rico. 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002520.s004">S4 Data</xref> is an R-programming package containing a function for calculating the seasonal distribution of pregnancies by trimester.
