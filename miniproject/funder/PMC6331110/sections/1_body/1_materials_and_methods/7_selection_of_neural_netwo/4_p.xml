<p>In 2014, Christian Szegedy, from Google, began to investigate methods to reduce the computational burden of deep neural networks[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In doing so, he focused on the efficiency of the architecture of the deep neural network (codenamed 
 <italic>Inception</italic>, later named 
 <italic>GoogLeNet)</italic>. This neural network was the winner of ILSVRC 2014, surpassing AlexNet, and was proclaimed the new paradigm for convolutional neural networks.
