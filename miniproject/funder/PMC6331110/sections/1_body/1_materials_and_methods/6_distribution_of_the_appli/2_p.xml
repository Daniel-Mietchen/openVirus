<p>To determine the best image distribution for training and validation, once the test sample size was already defined, the percentage of application images used in the training phase was defined as a factor, varying in four levels (either 30%, 40%, 50% or 60%), in a full factorial experiment. The objective was to evaluate statistically the best distribution of application images between the training and validation phases that would present the best classification accuracy for the intended application in entomology.</p>
