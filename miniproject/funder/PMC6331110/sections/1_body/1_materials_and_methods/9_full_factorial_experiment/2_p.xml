<p>Using the Minitab software, we created an experiment with four factors: the percentage of application images used at training, solver algorithm, learning rate, and LR decay function. The number of epochs and the seed was fixed. For the experiments, we defined the number of levels as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. During the next step, the formats of the selected parameters were defined as either numerical or text; the percentage of application images used at training and the LR were defined as numerical, and the solver algorithm and LR decay function were defined as text. The values for each level was defined based on the random experiments performed before.
