<p>Number of epochs and Seed were parameters defined as a constant value. The prior random tests showed that 200 epochs are enough to stabilize the training and validation phases. In case it generates overfitting it would be easily identified. Define the seed as a constant value was important to standardize the neural network weights initiation for all CNN and also, for each time we run the algorithm. The parameters evaluated in the full factorial experiment were: percentage of the application image used in the training phase; solver algorithm; the learning rate (LR); and learning rate decay function. The other parameters, such as the batch size, batch accumulation, learning rate step size, learning rate power, learning rate gamma, crop size and mean subtraction, were set according to pre-defined default for each network.</p>
