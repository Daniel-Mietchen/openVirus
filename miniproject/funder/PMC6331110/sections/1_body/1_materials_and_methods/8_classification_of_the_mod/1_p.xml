<p>The CNN algorithms requires the definition of several parameters prior to the training phase. Depending on the application, these parameters might have more or less influence on the classification results. Prior random tests were performed to understand which set parameters have more influence and should be statistically analysed as a factor in the full factorial experiment in order to stablish the best value. Other parameters with less influence on the results were set as default in the algorithm.</p>
