<p>The images in the dataset were extracted from the ImageNet platform and were also photographed with various cameras, including a Leica DMC2900 (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) coupled to a stereoscopic Leica M205C at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute of Entomology at FIOCRUZ (Rio de Janeiro–Brazil), a Canon Power Shot D30 (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to a Wild M3C stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) at SENAI CIMATEC (Salvador–Brazil) and Samsung J5 (Samsung, Seoul, South Korea) and Apple iPhone 7 (Apple, Cupertino, California, USA) mobile phone cameras. The images were collected at different resolutions and levels of quality to develop a classification method that utilized a wide range of images to prevent possible overfitting of the trained model. An average of 10 photographs of each specimen were taken at different angles and proximities.</p>
