<p>This work demonstrates that CNN's can be applied to the autonomous classification of mosquitoes to aid in the screening of possible vectors of arboviruses by health workers and other non-taxonomists. High accuracy of classification of mosquitoes using CNN's can be achieved using different neural networks. LeNet and AlexNet had inferior performances to that of GoogLeNet, which indicates that the use of more complex networks with more layers is necessary to improve accuracy. Taxonomic classification of insects can be performed automatically via the acquisition of image's features that differentiate one insect from another. Only by using both the genus and sex we achieved high accuracy in the identification of
