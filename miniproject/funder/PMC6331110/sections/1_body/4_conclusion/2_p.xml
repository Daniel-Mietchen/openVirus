<p>Our results provide information that is fundamental to the automatic morphological classification of a species of interest applying CNN to classify the adult mosquito in the environment it lives. In the critical discussion, the published works develop mainly a laboratory tool. In the taxonomy of adult mosquitoes, an epidemiological classification has a different implication. The application method we propose will be a robust epidemiological instrument for the rapid identification of focus of mosquitoes allowing the community to be part of the control of vector-borne diseases.</p>
