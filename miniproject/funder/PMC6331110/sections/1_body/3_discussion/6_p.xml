<p>Unfortunately, as mentioned previously, taxonomic identification of mosquitoes is a time-consuming and challenging process that requires trained specialists. The high variability also compromises this method of identification of the morphological and molecular characteristics found in members of the 
 <italic>Culicidae</italic> subfamily, which was the object of our study. Furthermore, molecular identification, although generally accurate, is costly and often impractical. Other disadvantages of molecular techniques are the high cost and time applied in the laboratory. In this way, developing countries, which are often the main endemic areas, do not have sufficient resources for investments in laboratories with high technologies.
