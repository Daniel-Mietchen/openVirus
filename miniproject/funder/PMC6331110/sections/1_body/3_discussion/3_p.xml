<p>In our work, we used over 4,000 mosquito images in this preliminary study of the use of CNN's for the identification of mosquitoes; with such a small sample size, we achieved an accuracy of 76.2% in the automatic recognition of species and gender for six classes of mosquito. However, it is very promising that we were able to distinguish 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes from other mosquitoes correctly. Our method was able to achieve 100% accuracy in classifying between 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, although 
 <italic>Culex</italic> was misclassified as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> 10% of the time during the test phase. In the recognition of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> female, which is the most important vector of arboviruses, we achieved 82% accuracy. It is essential to understand that it is a training process and every time we add a new species further training of the network will be necessary.
