<p>The importance of insects to transmit human diseases have motivated researchers to develop an arsenal of mechanical, chemical, biological and educational tools to help mitigate the harmful effects of insects. Batista et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reinforce that the efficiency of such systems depends on the knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of insects. In that work, the authors developed a sensor that can measure the wingbeat frequency of flying insects at a distance. However, the study collected data under laboratory conditions. Thus, future works would be required to obtain additional features for real-world deployment.
