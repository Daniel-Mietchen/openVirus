<p>Another challenge in the use of convolutional neural networks for image recognition with a limited number of images is the risk of overfitting. Application of different sets of images during the training, validation and testing phases may reduce the risk of overfitting[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, the use of different, randomly selected images during the testing phase, as demonstrated in our study, is a promising method to avoid overfitting. Limitations due to dataset size and its balance between the classes may explain the low accuracy achieved for some species classified individually in our study. We firmly believe that increasing the dataset for all three phases (training, validation and testing) and the use of different neural network architectures will improve the precision of automatic classification.
