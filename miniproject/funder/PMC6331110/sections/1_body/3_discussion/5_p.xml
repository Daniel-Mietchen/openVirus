<p>Taxonomists have been searching for efficient methods to meet real world insect identification requirements[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The correct identification of insects is critically important in entomological research, pest control, and insect-resource utilization for the development of effective control strategies for diseases transmitted by these vectors and can aid in preventing arbovirus infections in humans[

 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, identifying the vectors associated with pathogens is fundamental to understand the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This problem is recognized since the end of the last century, and computer-based recognition systems have been developed to identify insect species automatically, not only for mosquitoes, but also for wasps, moths, spiders, bees and others[
