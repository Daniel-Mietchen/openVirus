<p>Although there is progress in autonomous identification systems for insects, two inadequacies remain. First, some systems obtain high accuracy of identification for limited insect species but have very narrow functionality, because the source code for those computer programs must be rewritten when these types of system are tested with new morphological insect data. Second, some systems, can be used to identify different taxonomic groups of insects, but the accuracy is not sufficient due to high variations during processes of digitizing morphological features and insufficient powerful classifiers which only can search local optimizing solutions rather than the global optimizing solutions during computation[
