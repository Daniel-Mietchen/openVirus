<p>In another application of a convolutional neural network for the identification of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> wings and larva, Lorenz et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] used 17 species from the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genera to test the hypothesis that classification based on wing shape characteristics using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was more accurate than traditional classification using discriminant analysis. The ANN was able to correctly classify species with greater accuracy than the conventional method using multivariate discriminant analysis, with an accuracy varying from 86% to 100%. However, this study focus on parts of the body of the mosquito and requires the use of laboratory equipment.
