<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN's) to extract features from images of adult mosquitoes to identify 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> species in the field. Members of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> are well-known carriers and disseminators of arboviruses[
