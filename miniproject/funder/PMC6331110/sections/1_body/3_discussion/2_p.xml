<p>Sanchez-Ortiz et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] used a very similar CNN-like method as our study, but focused on the use of digital images of larva as input for a machine learning algorithm for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larva identification. The algorithm showed excellent performance, with 100% accuracy, in the identification of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larva; however, for other mosquito species, the misclassification rate was 30%. Additionally, the sample size used in this study was tiny. Although their review have a significant scientific contribution, it requires the use of laboratory equipment and do not address issues such as time and logistics required in the traditional classification method for capturing and analysing the samples.
