<p>Recently, new models that facilitate the automatic classification of mosquitoes have been developed. Some studies have attempted to classify mosquito species based on the frequency and harmonics of their wingbeats[

The development of a tool to support taxonomist and health workers in the field would be very helpful in accelerating the knowledge of which mosquito is circulating in the community and supporting health authorities in controlling harmful mosquitoes, once it will reduce the lag between the time the trap is placed and the taxonomic inspection occurs[
