In 2012, during the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which was the largest contest conducted in the object recognition field, a breakthrough in deep learning occurred when a convolutional network won the competition by reducing the state-of-the-art top-5 error rate from 26.1% to 15.3%[
