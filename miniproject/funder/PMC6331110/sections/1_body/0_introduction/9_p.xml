<p>It should be emphasized that correct identification of adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species is essential for both the recognition of the vectors involved in disease transmission and the development of fast and efficient control strategies[
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, we compared three CNN's, LeNet, AlexNet and GoogLeNet to evaluate the potential application of a Deep Learning technique to classify adult mosquito species in the field. The objective is to develop an epidemiological tool to be used in the real-world environment to facilitate the work of entomologists and health workers in the classification of adult mosquitoes of the species 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>. As showed, this tool would be very useful to reduce the time, to allow its use by less experienced expert and to capture preserved features of the body characteristics of the mosquito. Another objective of this work is to initiate a preliminary scientific study that would allow the community be part of the control of vector-borne diseases.
