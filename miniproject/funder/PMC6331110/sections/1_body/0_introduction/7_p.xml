<p>Within the field of image feature analysis, studies have been conducted to identify mosquitoes according to their life cycle stage (egg, larval phase, pupal stage and adult). Some studies have attempted to automatize the process of egg counting to assess the level of fecundity and thereby estimate the mosquito population size and conduct morphometric analysis[

The outlines of body parts, such as wings, are stable and diverse but have not been frequently used in conventional taxonomy due to difficulties with lexical descriptions[
