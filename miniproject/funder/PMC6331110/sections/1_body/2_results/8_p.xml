 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210829.g006">Fig 6B</xref> shows the results obtained during the training and validation phases for the AlexNet neural network. Using the previously selected parameters (200 epochs; seed of 10; 60% of application images used for training; NAG solver algorithm; 0.001 LR; sigmoid LR decay function), the network achieved an accuracy of 74.7%, and the validation and training losses were reduced by approximately 0.83 and 0.11, respectively. 
 <xref rid="pone.0210829.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the overall accuracy obtained during the testing phase (phase 3) for each of the mosquito species for the AlexNet neural network. The overall result of the testing phase was 51.2%.
