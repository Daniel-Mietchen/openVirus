 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210829.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the effects of the parameter combination (2
 <sup>nd</sup> level analysis) on the interaction of the parameters with one another. It is clear that a learning rate of ‘3’ (0.1) reduced the accuracy of the testing phase when combined with any of the other parameters. Consequently, this learning rate should not be used subsequent analysis. It was also confirmed that the solver algorithm ‘3’ (Adam) reduced the accuracy of the testing phase. However, the combination of a learning rate of ‘2’ (0.01) with solver algorithm ‘4’ (AdaGrad) obtained better results than the combination of a learning rate of ‘1’ (0.001) with the same solver algorithm (‘p value’ &lt; 0.00001). Overall, the learning rate of ‘1’ (0.001) produced the best results.
