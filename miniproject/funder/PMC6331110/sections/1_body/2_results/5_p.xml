<p>The best parameter combination was obtained in the 4-2-1-3 set, which resulted in the use of 60% of the application images during training (the NAG Solver algorithm; 0.001 LR and Sigmoid LR decay function). Therefore, this parameter set was used for the subsequent training of all three convolutional neural networks.</p>
