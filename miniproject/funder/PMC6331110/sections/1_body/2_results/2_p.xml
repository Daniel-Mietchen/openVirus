 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210829.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the effects of each parameter (1
 <sup>st</sup> level analysis) on the accuracy of the testing phase (phase 3). In this analysis, the use of the solver algorithm ‘3’ (Adam) and a learning rate of ‘3’ (0.1) significantly reduced the accuracy of the mosquito image classification. However, a learning rate of ‘1’ (0.001) was an important parameter that was used (‘p value’ &lt; 0.00001). Almost every parameter had a significant influence on the results of the performance of the trained neural network (‘p value’ &lt; 0.05), with the exception of the interaction between ‘% application images (train) * Solver’ and ‘% application images (train) * LR Decay Function’ (‘p value’ &gt; 0.05).
