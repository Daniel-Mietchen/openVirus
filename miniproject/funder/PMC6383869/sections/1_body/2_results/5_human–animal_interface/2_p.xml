<p>Human-driven landscape change could influence rodent host behavior and the composition of reservoir communities in such a way as to impact pathogen transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The major consequences of landscape alteration are habitat loss and changes in species composition due to the loss of specialist species and the increase in generalist species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and these consequences either increase or decrease the risk of disease transmission at the human–animal interface. For example, HFRS epidemics in China peaked in autumn and winter in the area where the dominant hantavirus is the

 <italic>Rattus</italic>-borne SEOV saw epidemic peaks in spring [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. These two distinct rodent species have different breeding sites with special landscape attributes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], which changes the epidemiological characteristics of hantavirus disease. Human disturbance also affects survival probabilities and reproduction of rodent hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Another consequence of landscape alteration is loss of biodiversity, which is considered to affect the transfer of pathogens among species and influence the risk of infection to humans. Biodiversity loss may result in increased hantavirus infection prevalence in host populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], affecting the dynamics of SNV in the US, Choclo hantavirus in Panama, and PUUV in Europe [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. For some directly transmitted and vector-borne zoonotic diseases, it has been hypothesized that increased species diversity would result in a lower pathogen prevalence in competent hosts and therefore lower risk of infection to humans by a mechanism called the “dilution effect” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], although there is still a debate about the (positive or negative) relationship between biodiversity and zoonotic disease transmission, e.g., SNV and deer mice system in America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. To our knowledge, few attempts have been made to evaluate this effect with regards to HTNV/striped field mouse system in China. Further testing of this theory is therefore still required. Another human-driven landscape change is induced by urbanization (i.e., urban expansion). However, the relationship between the diffusion of zoonotic pathogens and urbanization is complex because of the contrasting effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006901.g004">Fig 4</xref>): cities with faster economic growth may attract more immigrants and reach their endemic turning points later (endemic turning point defined as point at which incidence changes from increasing to decreasing), whereas economic growth that contributes towards improvements in the living conditions may decrease contact between rats and humans [
