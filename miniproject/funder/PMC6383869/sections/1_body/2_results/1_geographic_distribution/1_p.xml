 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The major hantavirus disease burden in the Old World is HFRS, and in the New World it is HPS. HTNV in Asia, PUUV and Dobrava virus in Europe, and Seoul virus (SEOV) worldwide are the causative agents of HFRS. SNV, ANDV, and related viruses have been identified as causative agents of HPS in the Americas [
