<p>The geographic distributions of hantaviruses reflect the distributions of their reservoir hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and our knowledge of the host associations of hantaviruses is expanding. For example, the hantavirus isolated in Africa, Sangassou virus, was recently found in the African wood mouse (
 <italic>Hylomyscus simus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Although, in general, each hantavirus has been considered to be associated with a specific reservoir host, there have been cases that suggest rodent host expansion (e.g., pathogens that can infect multiple host species) for both HTNV and SEOV in China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. This challenges the strict rodent–virus coevolution theory and demonstrates that at least some hantaviruses can infect other susceptible rodents in addition to primary hosts, expanding the number of potential animal hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. These cases raise the question as to what role undetected or potential hosts play in hantavirus ecology and further influence the risk of human infections—a question largely ignored in the past and an area of further research. Further research is also needed to clarify the relationships between diversity and prevalence across types of ecosystems and host species, in particular, as the dilution effect on prevalence dynamics has broad potential applicability in predicting virus prevalence among rodent hosts.
