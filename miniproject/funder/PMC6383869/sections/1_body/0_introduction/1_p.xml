 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They can cause serious diseases in humans, with some outbreaks resulting in case fatality rates of 12% (for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS] in Europe and Asia) and up to 40% (for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] in the Americas), depending on the hantavirus type and the resulting clinical syndrome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hantavirus disease came to global attention when two major outbreaks were reported during the last century. The first, an HFRS outbreak, occurred during the Korean War (1950 to 1953), when more than 3,000 United Nations troops fell ill [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, the number of countries reporting human cases of hantavirus infection is still on the rise [
