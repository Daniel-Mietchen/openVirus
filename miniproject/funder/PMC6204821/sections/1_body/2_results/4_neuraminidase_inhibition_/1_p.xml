<p>We performed a functional assay to analyze neuraminidase activity with all the seven extracts that inhibited influenza infection in more than 80%. IC50 is the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the influenza NA enzymatic activity. Thus, lower IC50 values imply in higher NA inhibition activity. Two of them, extracts from the cyanobacteria 
 <italic>Leptolyngbya</italic> sp. (5) and microalga Chlorellaceae (21) inhibited influenza A NA activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> lower than 210 and 20 µg/mL, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Figs. 1A</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">1F</xref>). The HPLC and mass spectrum of extracts 5 and 21 are shown 
 <italic>S01-1</italic> and 
 <italic>S01-2</italic>, respectively. The mass spectrum of extract 5 (
 <italic>S01-3</italic>) indicated the presence of chlorinated compounds m/z = 214.9850 and 232.9946. On the other hand, the mass spectrum of extract 21 (
 <italic>S01-4</italic>) exhibited signals that indicated the presence of peptides, terpenes and/or alkaloids.
