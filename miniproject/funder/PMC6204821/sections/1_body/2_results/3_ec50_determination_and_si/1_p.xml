<p>We determined the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for seven marine extracts that 
 <italic>inhibited</italic> in more than 80% the replication of both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-WT and A(H3N2)-WT in the screening assay. The selective index (SI) is determined by the ratio between CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub>, and represents the relative effectiveness of the investigational product in inhibiting viral replication compared to inducing cell death. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of five extracts was less than 100 Âµg/mL with SI higher than 10.0 (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The oseltamivir carboxylate (OST-car) was used as positive control with 177,667 and 66,625 SI for A(H1N1)pdm09-WT and A(H3N2)-WT, respectively. The SI values between a pool of molecules (extracts) and a molecule chemically defined (OST) are incomparable.
