<p>After cytotoxicity analysis, we tested anti-influenza activity with all the extracts produced, EtOAc and n-BuOH. For this purpose, MDCK-infected cells were treated with 200 µg/mL of each extract. After 48 hpi, the supernatants were harvested and the influenza neuraminidase activity was analyzed. We observed that 17 extracts (16 in EtOAc and 1 in n-BuOH) inhibited the replication of influenza A strains, A(H1N1)pdm09-WT and A(H3N2)-WT. Seven of them (41%) resulted in more than 80% of inhibition (

Despite this, an EtOAc extract obtained from another filamentous green alga was able to produce satisfactory inhibitory effects (

 <italic>Staurastrum</italic> sp.) and four out of six EtOAc extract from Scenedesmaceae family (
 <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Desmodesmus</italic> sp.) were capable of inhibiting influenza replication with different magnitudes (
