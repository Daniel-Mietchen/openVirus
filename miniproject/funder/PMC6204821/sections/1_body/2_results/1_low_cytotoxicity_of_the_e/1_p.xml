<p>The cells viability was the first analysis conducted, extracts with high cell toxicity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were disregarded from the antiviral analysis. All the extracts produced were tested at 1Â mg/mL in MDCK cell cultures. As control, we exposed MDCK to DMSO in the same proportion as we used in the extracts test, 1.0% V/V in culture medium, which did not affect the cells viability. The results showed that redox mitochondrial activity of the tested cells with extracts was inhibited at most by 20% after 48 h of exposure. Approximately 60% of extracts in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (n-BuOH) solvent showed 90% of cell viability (
