<p>The OST is the main antiviral used in clinics against Influenza A and B. The pressure imposed by this drug has led to the selection of resistant mutants (

 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the search for new anti-influenza compounds that inhibits both types of influenza and their resistant strains or lineages is extremely important. Therefore, we tested extracts from
