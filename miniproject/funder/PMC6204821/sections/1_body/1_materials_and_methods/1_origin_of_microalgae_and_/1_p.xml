<p>Microalgae and cyanobacteria strains used in this study belong to the Culture Collection of Microalgae at UFRJ (CCMR, Marine Phytoplankton Laboratory, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). These strains were isolated by single-cell sorting in a flow cytometer (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Fistarol et al., 2018</xref>) and are maintained in culture by successive transfers to fresh liquid medium at 3–6 week intervals, depending on the species. All 26 strains used here are originated from fresh (Paraguaçu River and Shallow Lake System of Lençois Maranhenses) and marine water (Guanabara Bay estuary and Abrolhos coral reefs) biomes in Brazil (

The field experiments were approved by Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA), Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio) and Sistema de Autorização e Informação em Biodiversidade (SISBIO), approval number: 35854-2. The access to genetic heritage was approved by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), approval number: 010339/2014-0; and Sistema Nacional de Gestão do Patrimônio Genético e do Conhecimento Tradicional Associado (SisGen), approval number: A03D5C4.
