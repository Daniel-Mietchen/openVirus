<p>Initially, we performed a screening to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the extracts. MDCK cells (2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight. Then, the monolayers of cells were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09-WT or A(H3N2)-WT at 400 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per well during 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After, the viral suspension was removed and the monolayers were treated with 200 µg/mL of each extract. There is no established protocol or concentration for the anti-influenza screening of crude extracts of natural products. There are papers that use 2 mg/ml as the maximum concentration, while others use 100 µg/ml (

For this purpose, the supernatants were diluted 1:5 in NA-Star buffer and the neuraminidase activity was analyzed in triplicate by the NA-StarTM assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The antiviral activity of the extracts was calculated with respect to virus control only.
