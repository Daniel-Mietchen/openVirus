<p>For extracts with high influenza inhibition (80%) in the screening test, we performed a functional antiviral assay to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the NA enzymatic activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). Wild-type and resistant strains of influenza A and B were tested against different concentrations of extracts (400 − 12.5 or 200 − 6.25 µg/mL), OST-car (1,000 − 0.01 nM) was used as control. This assay was done using the NA-Star™ assay kit (Life Technologies, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (
