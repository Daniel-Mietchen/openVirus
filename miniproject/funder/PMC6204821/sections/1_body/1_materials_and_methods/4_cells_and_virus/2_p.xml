<p>The viruses were grown and titrated according to WHO manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2011</xref>). The virus titration was performed by 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay. We analyzed the inhibitory effect of the extracts against influenza A strains and B lineages, OST-sensitive (Wild type—WT) and resistant (mutant): A/California/04/2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09-WT); A/Perth/261/2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09-H275Y); A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (A(H3N2)-WT); B/Phuket/3073/2013 Yam (WT); B/Brisbane/60/2008 Vic (WT); B/Perth/211/2001 Yam (WT) and B/Perth/211/2001 Yam (D197E). All the viruses were kindly provided by the International Society for Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses Diseases-Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) and CDC –IRR.
