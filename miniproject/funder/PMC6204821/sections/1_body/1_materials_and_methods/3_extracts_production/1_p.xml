<p>All the microalgae and cyanobacteria cultures (cells and culture medium) were frozen, thawed and filtered through cheesecloth. The filtrate was extracted three times with ethyl acetate (added ratio 1:1 of volume) and three times with n-butanol (added ratio 1:1 of volume). The organic layers were concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness. A total of 38 extracts were produced, 26 in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 12 in n-butanol (n-BuOH). The crude extracts were stored at −20 °C until analysis. The extracts from one to 12 strains were obtained in the first batch with both solvents. After the screening test for anti-influenza activity, the second batch of extracts was produced from 13 to 26 strains, and they were solely obtained with ethyl acetate. Dried extracts were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a final concentration of 100 mg/mL for the

However, we could not identify any compounds, but the chemical profiles of the active extracts were preserved. Thus, the procedure must be repeated on a larger scale for the more active anti-influenza extracts. The chromatograms and mass spectra for extracts 5 and 21 are provided in the
