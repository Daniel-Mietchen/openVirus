<p>Half maximal effective concentration was determined for the extract that inhibited influenza replication in more than 80%. MDCK cells were seeded and infected as described above. After 1 hpi, the viral suspension was removed and the monolayers were treated with different extract concentrations (400 − 12.5 µg/mL). Oseltamivir carboxylate (100 − 3.2 µM) (OST-car; kindly donated by Hoffman-La Roche Inc., Basel, Switzerland) was used as a control. For influenza titration, the supernatants were harvested at 48 hpi, and the influenza virus was titrated by TCID50/mL using MDCK cells (5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates) through the Reed and Muench method (

 <sub>50</sub>) for the extracts and reference compound (OST-car).
