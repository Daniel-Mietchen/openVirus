<p>One hundred microliters of 2.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> MDCK cells were seeded into the 96-well culture plates (flat bottom) and grown for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere, then, the extracts were added with a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in DMEM. Control cells were treated with 1.0% DMSO, which did not affect the growth of the cells. The extracts were diluted in culture medium DMEM, the DMSO final concentration was equal to 1.0% (v/v). After 48 h of cells incubation with extracts or vehicle (DMSO), a freshly prepared XTT (Sigma) solution was added, as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions. The XTT is a colorless or slightly yellow compound that is reduced to formazan (bright orange) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells, as described before (

 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Scudiero et al., 1988</xref>). The cell viability was calculated by the comparison between absorbance (A475 nm–A660 nm) from treated (A) and untreated (B) cells using the formula: A/B × 100. Tests were carried out performing three replicates (
