<p>In this study we tested anti-influenza activity of extracts derived by microalgae and cyanobacteria collected from Paraguaçu River, Shallow Lake System of Lençois Maranhenses, Guanabra Bay estuary and Abrolhos coral reefs. We found seven extracts, in ethyl acetate solvent, that inhibit seasonal influenza A and B replication in MDCK cells in more than 80%. Two extracts from 
 <italic>Leptolyngbya</italic> sp. (cyanobacteria) and Chlorellaceae family (microalgae) inhibited influenza A and B replication and neuraminidase activity, from OST-sensitive and resistance strains and lineages. Thus, these organisms are important for bioprospecting in antiviral research.
