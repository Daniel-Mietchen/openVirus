<p>The most important class of antiviral recommended for the control of influenza epidemics and eventual pandemics is the Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NAIs), particularly oseltamivir (OST) and zanamivir (ZAN). These compounds are active against all influenza A subtypes and the two major influenza B lineages. Thus, the emergence of NAIs resistance could be a major clinical concern. Although most currently circulating influenza A and B strains are susceptible to NAIs, the pressure imposed by OST has led to the selection of OST-resistant mutants, with a prevalence of 1–2% in different countries (

Reports have shown single or multiple substitutions or deletions in the NA gene, which can promote a phenotype cross-resistance to the two main NAIs (oseltamivir and zanamivir) used in clinics, mostly in immunocompromised individuals (
