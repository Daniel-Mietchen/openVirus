<p>The influenza A virus belongs to 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. The genomic single stranded RNA (RNAss) is octa-segmented, negative-sense, surrounded by a helical capsid with externally lipoprotein envelope, in which glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are inserted (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Camp et al., 2013</xref>). Frequently, minor modifications in these envelope proteins may alter the affinity of vaccine antibodies or inactivate them, preventing recognition of the virus by the immune system, causing repetitive influenza outbreaks worldwide. However, in rare moments the combination of the eight genomic segments (reassortment) can occur, such as between influenza animal and human subtypes. This event, named antigenic shift, can result in strains capable of causing large regional or global pandemic outbreaks (
