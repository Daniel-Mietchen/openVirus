<p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the antiviral activity of natural extracts against influenza A and B, oseltamivir-sensitive and resistant strains and lineages. The 38 extracts were obtained from microalgae and cyanobacteria cultures isolated from fresh (Paraguaçu River and Lençois Maranhenses Lakes) and marine water (Abrolhos Bank and Guanabara Bay) biomes in Brazil. We evaluated these extracts for cellular toxicity, influenza replication and neuraminidase activity. The extracts presented low cytotoxicity, and 17 of them inhibited influenza replication in more than 80% 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, with two inhibiting neuraminidase activity from influenza A and B OST-sensitive and resistant. These data contribute to the knowledge of the biotechnological potential of Brazilian biomes, which are underexplored for antiviral research and bioprospecting.
