<p>As mentioned before, there are several cellular factors described as restricting the replication of influenza virus (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Villalon-Letelier et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, despite the inhibitory effect against neuraminidase activity, the extracts may have molecules capable of inhibiting different stages of the viral replicative cycle, and/or they can activate host cell restriction factors, but these effects will still be investigated. Thus, microalgae and cyanobacteria are important marine and freshwater microorganisms for bioprospecting in antiviral research. The microorganisms evaluated in this study were collected in Brazil, but they are not exclusively Brazilian. It may be relevant to compare the metabolites production of the same taxonomic groups collected in different parts of the world.
