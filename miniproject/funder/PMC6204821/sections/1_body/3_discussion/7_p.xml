<p>The Chlorellaceae family, mainly 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> genus, produce a broad spectrum of carotenoids with different anti-angiogenic activities, cardioprotective, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and others (

Furthermore, retinoids, products of carotenoid metabolism, inhibit mumps virus replication preventing the infection of healthy cells by induction of a retinoid inducible gene I (RIG-I), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and interferon (
