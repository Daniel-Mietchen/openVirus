<p>In screening assay we observed that seven extracts were able to inhibit seasonal influenza A replication viruses in more than 80%, five of them with SI higher than 10. Aqueous and methanolic extracts of cultured cyanobacteria of Microcystis and Spirulina genus inhibit influenza replication with SI comparable to ethyl acetate extract from

 <italic>Gyrodinium impudium</italic>, inhibits influenza A infection with SI higher than 200, but not influenza B (
