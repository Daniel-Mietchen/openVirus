<p>In addition, two extracts from 
 <italic>Leptolyngbya</italic> sp. (cyanobacteria) and Chlorellaceae family (microalgae) inhibited the replication and neuraminidase activity of influenza A and B viruses, including OST-sensitive and resistant strains and lineages. These results were similar to that observed for a water extract of 
 <italic>Taxodium distichum</italic> (Cupressaceae family), which presented excellent efficacy against both influenza viruses, particularly OST-resistant clinical isolates and swine-origin influenza strains (
