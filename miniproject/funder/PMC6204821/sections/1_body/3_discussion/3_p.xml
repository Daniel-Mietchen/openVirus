<p>Cyanobacteria are a promising yet underexplored source for novel natural products, including antiviral compounds. More detailed screening studies have identified antiviral activities on sulfoglycolipids and lectins (

Antiviral compounds extracted from microalgae are mainly polysaccharides. Polyunsaturated aldehydes, carotenoid, terpenes, and alkaloids are other bioactive molecules produced by microalgae (
