   <italic>Leptolyngbya sp</italic>. and Chlorellaceae extracts inhibit influenza A and B OST-sensitive and -resistant viruses.
  </title>
  <p>The NA activity of the influenza A and B OST-sensitive and -resistant viruses were measured in the presence of different concentrations of extracts using a chemiluminescent substrate, NA-star kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). (A and B) Extract 5 (400 − 12.5 µg/mL). (C and D) Extract 21 (200 − 6.25 µg/mL). (E and F) OST carboxylate (1,000 − 0.01 nM), the reference compound was used as control. The results were obtained in relative luminescence units (RLU), but were converted to a percentage of the control for normalization of the data displayed. These experiments were performed three times and the means were expressed in the graphs.</p>
