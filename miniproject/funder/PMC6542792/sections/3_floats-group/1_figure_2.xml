  <p>Mammalian Vero E6 cells are more efficiently infected with ZIKV than mammalian SK-N-SH and mosquito C6/36 cell lines. SK-N-SH (
   <bold>a</bold>), Vero E6 (
   <bold>b</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>) C6/36 cells were infected with ZIKV-UG, ZIKV-FP and ZIKV-BR strains at an MOI 0.1 and immunolabeled with flavivirus group antigen antibodies (red) at 12 hpi and 84 hpi. Cells were also counterstained with DAPI (blue). Mock infected cells were used as negative controls (Control), labeled with primary and secondary antibodies and do not show any ZIKV labeling. The percentages of ZIKV positive SK-N-SH, Vero E6 and C6/36 cells at 12 hpi and 84 hpi are depicted in graphs (means ± SEM; One Way ANOVA, *p &lt; 0.05). Data were collected from one experiment done in duplicates. The results are based on a total of 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells plated per group, counted in sixteen independent fields of view (The number of cells counted per strain: 2352–4976 SK-N-SH, 1381–2947 Vero E6 and 2918–5624 C6/36). The percentage of infected cells was determined by calculating the number of immunolabeled cells versus the percentage of all DAPI stained nuclei representing single cells.
