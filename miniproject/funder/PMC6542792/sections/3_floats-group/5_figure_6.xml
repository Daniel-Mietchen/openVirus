  <p>ZIKV Infection of Mosquito C6/36 Cells Does Not Affect the Mobility of DiD-ZIKV-laden vesicles. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Mosquito C6/36 cells infected with DiD-labeled ZIKV-BR at 12, 36, and 84 hpi. DIC images (left panels), fluorescent micrographs depicting punctate signals of DiD-labeled ZIKV-BR-laden vesicles (middle panels), fluorescent micrographs depicting DiD-labeled ZIKV-BR-laden vesicles with superimposed vesicle trajectories (right panels). Scale bars, 10 µm. Circles denote the starting positions of the vesicle trajectories (white lines). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Graphs represent the TL and MD of vesicles in C6/36 cells infected with strains ZIKV-BR, ZIKV-FP, and ZIKV-UG. The TL and MD of vesicles remained similar at all hpi; ZIKV-BR, p = 0.081 (TL), p = 0.532 (MD); ZIKV-FP, p = 0.767 (TL), p = 0.838 (MD); ZIKV-UG, p = 0.063 (TL), p = 0.465 (MD). The number of vesicles analyzed is denoted on the graphs. 5–9 cells per time period and per strain were analyzed. Data were collected from one experiment done in duplicates and are represented as means ± SEM (One Way ANOVA, *p &lt; 0.05).
