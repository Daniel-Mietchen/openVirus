  <p>Speed of Endocytotic ZIKV-FP-Laden Vesicles Decreases the Most in Astrocytes. In astrocytes, the average speed of ZIKV-BR- and ZIKV-UG-laden vesicles significantly increased with longer hpi, whereas the speed of vesicles laden with ZIKV-FP significantly decreased. In neurons, the average vesicle speed exhibited the most prominent increase at 36 hpi, regardless of the virus strain, and then declined the most in ZIKV-FP-laden vesicles. In neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, the average speed of vesicles increased until 36 hpi, whereas in Vero E6 cells, the speed of virus-laden vesicles either decreased or remained unchanged. The number of analyzed cells is the same as in Figs 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, S2 and S3. Data were collected from one experiment, performed in duplicates and are represented as means ± SEM (One Way ANOVA, *p &lt; 0.05). The average speed was calculated for the same vesicles as shown in Fig.
