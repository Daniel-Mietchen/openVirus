  <p>Human fetal astrocytes are more efficiently infected with ZIKV than neurons. Human fetal astrocytes (
   <bold>a</bold>) and human fetal neurons (
   <bold>b</bold>) were infected with ZIKV-UG, ZIKV-FP and ZIKV-BR strains at an MOI 0.1 and immunolabeled with flavivirus group antigen antibodies (red) at 12 hpi and 84 hpi. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Mock infected cells were used as negative controls (Control), labeled with primary and secondary antibodies and do not show any ZIKV labeling. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The percentages of ZIKV positive astrocytes and neurons at 12 hpi and 84 hpi are depicted in graphs (means ± SEM; One Way ANOVA, *p &lt; 0.05) and they were determined by calculating the number of immunolabeled cells versus the percentage of all DAPI stained nuclei representing single cells. Data were collected from one experiment done in duplicates. Results are based on a total of 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells plated per group, counted in sixteen independent fields of view (The number of cells counted per strain: 858–1805 astrocytes and 4882–5765 neurons). (
   <bold>d</bold>) The purity of cells cultures was tested by immunolabeling astrocytes and neurons with specific markers (GFAP and βIII Tubulin, recpectively). The percentage of GFAP positive astrocytes and βIII tubulin positive neurons were determined by calculating the number of immunolabeled cells and presented as the percentage (means ± SEM) of all cells (DAPI stained nuclei representing single cells). Cells were counted in twelve separate fields of view for each cell type (The number of cells counted per strain: 414 astrocytes and 4287 neurons), data were collected from one experiment performed in duplicates (10
   <sup>4</sup> cells plated per sample).
