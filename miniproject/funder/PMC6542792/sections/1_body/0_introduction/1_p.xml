<p id="Par2">Last Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics in French Polynesia, South and Central America, and the Caribbean have been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of different neurologic disorders in adults, such as the Guillain-Barré syndrome, myelitis, encephalitis, and neuralgia

 </sup>. However, it is particularly worrying that ZIKV may be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus, causing deleterious consequences, such as fetal growth restriction, death, and several abnormalities of the CNS

 </sup>. Macroscopic pathologic changes in ZIKV-infected brain are first observed at the mid-gestation period and include microcephaly, cerebral atrophy, small cerebellum and brain stem, agyria, hydrocephalus, and calcifications in the neocortex and the subcortical white matter

 </sup>. These features reflect the fact that the physiology and/or morphology of ZIKV-infected neural cells in the fetus must have been altered at some point after infection. For example, activated microglial cells and macrophages, diffused reactive astrocytes, and granular ZIKV assemblies in neuronal structures have been detected in ZIKV-infected fetal brain

 </sup>. However, how the function of infected cells is altered remains an open question. In general, ZIKV infection of neuronal and skin cells can arrest cell-cycle progression, affect differentiation and proliferation, and appears to alter the immune response and cell death, which together likely contribute to arrest fetal brain growth
