<p id="Par4">In this study, we tested the hypothesis that astrocytes are the key target for ZIKV infection, as reported for another member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which affects astrocytes in the rodent brain to become a reservoir for TBEV

 </sup>. We report how human astrocytes respond to ZIKV infection in terms of the extent of viral infection, release of productive virus, host cell survival, and intracellular traffic of ZIKV-laden endocytotic vesicles. We compared their responses to neurons and to selected mammalian and mosquito cell lines.
