By this time, the astrocyte population is already abundant and their infection may contribute to further expansion of microcephaly, which may have originated in ZIKV infection of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neural stem cells (NSC), or radial glia cells (RGC) in which ZIKV infection has already been confirmed

Astrocytes have many critical roles in the functioning of neurons; e.g., they provide metabolic support for neuronal networks, integrate synaptic transmission, modulate the integration of neurons into networks, and regulate synaptogenesis, brain microcirculation, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier
