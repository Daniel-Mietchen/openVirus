<p id="Par5">During the ZIKV epidemics in Micronesia (2007), French Polynesia (FP, 2013–2014), other South Pacific islands (2014–2015), and in Latin America and the Caribbean (BR, 2015–2016), strains originating from the Asian ZIKV lineage were found circulating in the human population

 </sup>. Here, we used two Asian-lineage ZIKV strains ZIKV-FP (2013) and ZIKV-BR (2016), which are responsible for the latest international outbreaks causing neuropathology

 </sup>, and the African lineage ZIKV-UG #976 (1947), to test their infectivity rate, release, effects on cell viability, cytopathologic effects (CPE), and the mobility of ZIKV-laden endocytotic vesicles in mammalian (SK-N-SH and Vero E6) and mosquito (C6/36) cell lines, as well as in human fetal astrocytes and neurons.
