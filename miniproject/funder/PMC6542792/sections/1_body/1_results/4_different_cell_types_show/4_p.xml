<p id="Par15">In summary, these data show that ZIKV-UG strain infected significantly more cells in the majority of cell types studied. Among five cell types tested, astrocytes showed the highest initial infection rate, while Vero E6 were the most susceptible to ZIKV infection, judging from the results at 84 hpi. Among human primary cells isolated from neural tissue, astrocytes were considerably more permissive for ZIKV infection than neurons. The difference was obvious already at 12 hpi, and increased further at 84 hpi.</p>
