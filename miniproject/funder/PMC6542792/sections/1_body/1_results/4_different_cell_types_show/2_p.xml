<p id="Par13">Cells were infected at an MOI 0.1 and immunolabeled against flavivirus group antigen antibodies. The infection rates in cell lines SK-N-SH, Vero E6 and C6/36 were low at 12 hpi in all three ZIKV strains tested (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While in SK-N-SH cells the percentages of infected cells with different ZIKV strains were similar, ZIKV-UG had significantly higher infection rate than ZIKV-BR in Vero E6 cells, and ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG infected significantly higher percentage of C6/36 cells than ZIKV-FP (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, significantly higher infection rates were detected at 84 hpi, when compared to infection after 12 hpi (Mann-Whitney test; p &lt; 0.001). ZIKV-UG induced the highest infection rates at 84 hpi in all cell lines; the highest percentage was measured in Vero E6 cells, where almost all cells were infected (Fig.
