<p id="Par14">In human fetal astrocytes the infection rates at 12 hpi were significantly higher than in cell lines studied (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05; Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At this time point, ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG infected significantly more astrocytes than ZIKV-FP (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). At 84 hpi the percentages of infected cells were significantly higher, compared to those at 12 hpi (Mann-Whitney test; p &lt; 0.001), however, they were lower than in cell lines at 84 hpi (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similarly, as at 12 hpi, also at 84 hpi ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG strains infected significantly more astrocytes than ZIKV-FP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The lowest infection rates after 12 hpi were measured in human fetal neurons and they remained low after 84 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). While there were no differences among infection rates of ZIKV strains at 12 hpi, ZIKV-UG infected significantly more neurons at 84 hpi than ZIKV-FP and ZIKV-BR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To ascertain the purity of astrocyte and neuronal cultures we immunolabeled them with antibodies against astrocyte marker GFAP and neuronal marker βIII Tubulin. The results revealed that 99.3 ± 0.3% of astrocytes and 98.3 ± 0.5% of neurons were positive for respective markers (means ± SEM).
