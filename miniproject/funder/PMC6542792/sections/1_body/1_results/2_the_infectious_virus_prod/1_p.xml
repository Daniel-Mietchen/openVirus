<p id="Par6">First we assessed ZIKV infection kinetics in selected mammalian SK-N-SH and Vero E6 plus C6/36 mosquito cell lines. The increase in infectious virus production was measured at an MOI 0.1 after several hours post infection (12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 hpi). Productive ZIKV replication of strains ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG in the form of released infectious virions was detected at 18 hpi, while the productive replication of ZIKV-FP was delayed in all cell lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a

 </xref>). The reproducible plaque counts in all three cell lines were observed at earliest at 18 hpi, however, at 84 hpi there was no significant difference in the concentration of infectious viral particles among different strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a
  <sub>i</sub>
 </xref>). In general, viral titers of all three ZIKV strains reached approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (pfu)/ml in the culture medium after 72 hpi in all cell lines and remained high until the end of the experiment at 84 hpi. At 18 hpi a few plaques were produced by ZIKV-FP; however, their number was too low to accurately determine the virus titer.
