<p id="Par7">Then we tested how the infectious virus production affects cell viability. We determined cell viability by two different assays; Reliablue cell viability reagent, measuring metabolic activity of living cells (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b

  <sub>i</sub>
 </xref>, the survival of mammalian cell lines, infected with ZIKV strains at an MOI 0.1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b
  <sub>i</sub>
 </xref>) and MOI 1 (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c
  <sub>i</sub>
 </xref>), were severely affected. Both mammalian cell lines, SK-N-SH and Vero E6, show somewhat similar rate of decline in cell survival at the same MOI. Among ZIKV strains it appears that ZIKV-UG affected the viability of SK-N-SH cells more than the other two strains at both tested MOIs, while in Vero E6 cells ZIKV-BR affected the viability more than ZIKV-UG and ZIKV-FP at an MOI 0.1, while at an MOI 1 only ZIKV-FP was less detrimental for cell survival. The viability of mosquito C6/36 cells was unaffected by ZIKV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b
  <sub>i</sub>,c
  <sub>i</sub>
 </xref>). The survival rate of cell lines measured with Reliablue reagent was higher from the one measured with trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), however, all the trends remained the same. Although the same number of cells and the same MOI (0.1) was used in both viability tests, certain differences between the two methods may be accounted to errors that may occur for instance due to poor dispersion of cells and cell loss during cell dispersion with Countess Automated Cell Counter counting. On the other hand, Reliablue Cell Viability Assay, though not error-free (e.g. possible high background in control wells), appears to be more reliable.
