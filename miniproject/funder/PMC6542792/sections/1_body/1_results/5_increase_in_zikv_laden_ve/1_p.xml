 </sup>. While still unclear, the interaction between the virus and the cytoskeleton may affect virus traffic from the plasma membrane. To test whether ZIKV strains can affect the mobility of endocytotic vesicles by which they are transported, we measured the movement of ZIKV-laden vesicles and determined the travel length (TL), net maximal displacement (MD) of vesicles and their speed. We infected cells with DiD-labeled ZIKV strains (DiD-ZIKV) and checked if the mobility of endosomes was affected after 12, 36, and 84 hpi. Inside the cells, DiD-ZIKV aggregated into vesicular structures in astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The vast majority of these intracellular fluorescent vesicular structures contained DiD-ZIKV particles and not unspecific DiD dye, that was confirmed by co-labeling with the ZIKV-antibody-positive patient’s serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The trajectories of vesicle movements in astrocytes and neurons are represented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–d</xref>. Interestingly, in astrocytes we observed differences in mobility parameters depending on the ZIKV strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). While the speed of endocytotic ZIKV-laden vesicles after 12 hpi was similar or slightly higher in comparison to the speed of endocytotic vesicles in uninfected, unstimulated, astrocytes

 </sup>, later during the infection changes in the vesicle speed were noticed. Endocytotic vesicles loaded with ZIKV-BR or ZIKV-UG became more mobile as a function of time; TL, MD, and speed were significantly increased (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) after prolonged infection. In contrast, vesicles carrying ZIKV-FP showed progressively more confined and slower movements during the infection period; their mobility almost halved by the end of the experiment (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In neurons, vesicles laden with ZIKV strains showed increased mobility at 84 hpi versus 12 hpi (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). ZIKV-FP- and ZIKV-UG-laden vesicles showed decreased mobility as a function of hpi only in neuronal processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In contrast, in mosquito C6/36 cells, in which ZIKV infection did not compromise survival, the trafficking dynamics of ZIKV-laden vesicles remained unaltered throughout the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In these cells, the intracellular signal of internalized ZIKV particles differed compared with other cell types; it was predominantly diffused with scattered assemblies of vesicular structures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
