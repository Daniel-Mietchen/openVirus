<p id="Par20">In summary, we compared the effects of infection of the Asian-lineage ZIKV strains ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-FP; and the African-lineage strain ZIKV-UG on selected cell types. The results revealed resistance of astrocytes to ZIKV-induced cell death, considering their role in massive production of ZIKV versus neurons. Neurons proved to be the poorest producers of all ZIKV strains. In the majority of cell types, the infection rate of ZIKV-UG strain was the highest. All ZIKV strains triggered differences in trafficking of ZIKV-laden endocytotic vesicles in practically all cell types studied, except in mosquito cells, where ZIKV infection failed to induce cell death.</p>
