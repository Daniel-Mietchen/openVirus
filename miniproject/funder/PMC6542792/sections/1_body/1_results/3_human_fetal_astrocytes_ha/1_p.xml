<p id="Par9">To determine cell responses of human astrocytes and neurons to infection with selected ZIKV strains, we performed measurements of infectious viral particle production and viability of host cells, as described for cell lines. At 12 hpi we have already detected the increase in viral RNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), but infectious viral particles, collected in the supernatant at this time point did not produce countable plaques (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a
  <sub>ii</sub>
 </xref>). Higher quantity of infectious viral particles was observed in astrocytes (over 6-logarithmic units), further implying that astrocytes are an important source of infectious virus in the brain. On the other hand, the production of infectious virus was the lowest in neurons, where only 2-logarithmic units increase was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a
  <sub>ii</sub>
 </xref>). Thus, human neurons appear to be the poorest ZIKV producers among the cells tested. Additionally, we detected a difference between the growth rates among the three ZIKV strains in astrocytes and neurons, respectively. However, the overall production of ZIKV strains was lower in neurons than in astrocytes and ZIKV-FP in particular increased marginally over time in neurons. Similarly, as measured in cell lines, strains ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG induced the formation of the first plaques at 18 hpi, ZIKV-FP production was the slowest of all strains and there was also no significant difference in the production of infectious viral particles among the three strains at 84 hpi.
