<p id="Par10">To study the effect of infectious virus production on cell viability, we infected cells with two different MOI (0.1 and 1) and measured cell survival. Both, astrocytes and neurons, survived better when they were infected at an MOI 0.1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b
  <sub>ii</sub>
 </xref>) than at an MOI 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c
  <sub>ii</sub>
 </xref>). The viability of neurons was affected more than that of astrocytes. Roughly half of astrocytes were still viable at 84 hpi (MOI 0.1, ZIKV-BR, ZIKV-UG), when measured with Reliablue Cell Viability Assay. Measuring the cell survival with trypan blue exclusion assay produced slightly lower yields (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), as observed for cell lines. At both MOI (0.1 and 1) ZIKV-FP affected cell viability of astrocytes less than ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG, similar as in VERO E6 cells. In neurons we did not observe any difference among strains in respect of cell survival.
