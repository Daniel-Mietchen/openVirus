 </sup>. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were plated at the concentration of 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/500 μl/well in a 24, well plate, 24 h before inoculation. The medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS twice, and incubated with serial dilutions of collected supernatants, in medium without FBS. After 90-min incubation under slight agitation, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS twice, and cultured with 1.5% carboxy-methil-cellulose (CMC), supplemented with 2% FCS. After 5 days, cells were fixed overnight with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 1% violet crystal for 1 h. Plaques were counted and virus yield was calculated and expressed as PFU/ml. All experiments were performed in triplicates.
