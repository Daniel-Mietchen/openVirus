<p id="Par39">The percentage of ZIKV infected cells was determined by immunolabeling the infected cells with primary mouse monoclonal anti-flavivirus group antigen antibodies (1:600; clone D1-4G2-4-15; Sigma) and secondary Alexa Fluor 564-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:600, Life Technologies). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% PBS/BSA and incubated on cells for 2 h (primary) or 45 min (secondary) at 37 °C. At the end of the immunocytochemistry staining, the cells were washed in PBS and covered with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
