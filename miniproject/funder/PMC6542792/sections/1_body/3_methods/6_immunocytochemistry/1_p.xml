<p id="Par37">Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT), and permeabilized with Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT. Non-specific background staining was reduced by incubating the cells in blocking buffer containing 3% BSA and 10% goat serum in PBS at 37 °C for 1 hr. The infection with DID-labeled ZIKV was confirmed by staining the cells with serum from a patient infected with ZIKV (infected in Brazil in 2016) (1:128 diluted in PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the cells were rinsed in PBS and stained with secondary antibodies (1:200 Fluoline G, BioMerieux, Lyon, France) at 37 °C for 30 min.</p>
