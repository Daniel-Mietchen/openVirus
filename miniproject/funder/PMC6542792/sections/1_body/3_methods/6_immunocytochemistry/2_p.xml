<p id="Par38">The purity of human astrocyte and human neuronal cultures was confirmed by labeling with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies against GFAP (1:200; Sigma) and neuron-specific β-III Tubulin (1:100; Chemicon) followed by secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 564-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:600, Life Technologies). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% PBS/BSA and incubated on cells for 2 h (primary) or 45 min (secondary) at 37 °C. At the end of the immunocytochemistry staining protocols, the cells were washed in PBS and covered with Slowfade Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen).</p>
