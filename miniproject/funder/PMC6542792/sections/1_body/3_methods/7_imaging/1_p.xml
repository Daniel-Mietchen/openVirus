<p id="Par40">Imaging of fixed and live cells was performed with a laser confocal microscope (LSM 780, Zeiss, Germany) using air (20×/NA 0.8 M27) and oil-immersion objectives (40×/NA 1.3 and 63×/NA 1.4). A He/Ne laser was used (633 nm) for excitation of DiD dye; the emission light was filtered with a long-pass filter with the cut off below 650 nm. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate was excited by argon laser (488 nm), and the emission light was collected through a band-pass filter (505–530 nm). Alexa Fluor 564 dye was excited with the He/Ne laser (546 nm), and the emission light was filtered with a long-pass filter with a cut-off below 560 nm. DAPI was excited with the diod laser (405 nm) and the emission light was filtered with a band-pass filter (417–477 nm). In live cells, the mobility of vesicles that expressed DiD fluorescence of ZIKV was recorded. Time-series images were recorded at 2 s intervals for a total recording time of 2 min.</p>
