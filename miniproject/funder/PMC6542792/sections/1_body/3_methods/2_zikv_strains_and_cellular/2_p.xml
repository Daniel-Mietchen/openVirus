<p id="Par32">For the experiments, all cells were plated onto two-chambered coverslips (µ-Slide 2 Well; Ibidi, Germany, Martinsried) 48 h before infection with ZIKV strains (unlabeled and DiD-labeled) at an MOI of 0.1. Before inoculation, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS, and ZIKV was added to the cells in a low medium volume (600 µL). ZIKV was allowed to adsorb to an 80% confluent cell monolayer for 1 h at 37 °C or 28 °C (C6/36). Following adsorption, the monolayers were washed with PBS twice and grown in fresh growth medium. Control samples were incubated with the corresponding culture growth media (mock condition). Supernatants for RT-qPCR and plaque assay were collected at 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 h post infection (hpi), and cell viability was assessed either with a trypan blue exclusion test on Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) or a Reliablue Cell Viability Reagent (ATCC 30-1014) that measures cell metabolic activity. In brief, cells were plated at the concentration of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/100 μl/well in a 96 well plate, 24 h before inoculation. At each inoculation time point (12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 h) the medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS twice, and 100 µL of the virus was inoculated. At 84 h post infection 10 µL of Reliablue reagent was added with a multichannel pipet. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C (or 28 °C for C6/36) a fluorescent signal (excited at 540 nm and emission gathered at 600 nm) was read on the fluorescence plate reader (Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Reader, BioTek). Each plate included several control points: wells with only medium (background), wells with non-infected cells (negative control) and cells treated with 1% Triton (positive control). To account for the background, the average RFU values of the medium-only wells were subtracted from the results. To calculate the percentage of viability, each infection time point was plotted against negative control. All experiments were performed in triplicates in two individual experiments with MOI 0.1 or MOI 1.
