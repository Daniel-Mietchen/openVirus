<p id="Par34">Supernatants for RT-qPCR were collected at 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 hpi. Total nucleic acid was extracted from the cell-culture supernatants using an EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 400 µL of supernatant was used for the extraction and was eluted into 60 µL of AVE buffer. For quantification of ZIKV RNA we used two different quantitative RT-PCRs: a RealStar Zika Virus RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) and LightMix Modular Zika Virus Assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on an ABI7500 Fast platform (Thermo Fischer Scientific). All molecular tests were performed in duplicates, including 10-fold standard curve of WHO Zika virus standard.</p>
