 </sup>. Briefly, ZIKV strains were grown for 4 days on Vero E6 cells. The supernatant was centrifuged twice at +4 °C (10 min at 3,200 × 
 <italic>g</italic> and 5 min at 20,800 × 
 <italic>g</italic>) to ensure that all cells were removed from the supernatant. The supernatant was then mixed with 50 µM fluorescent lipophilic Vybrant DiD labeling solution (DiD; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and incubated for 2 hr at 37 °C. The unbound dye was removed by buffer exchange into Hepes 145 buffer (50 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl [pH 7.4] in Illustra NAP-5 columns; GE Healthcare). The infectivity of DiD labeled viruses was verified with plaque assay according to the protocol described above. The DiD labeling did not influence virus infectivity. Labeled virus was diluted to a concentration of 5.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and stored at −80 °C until the infection experiments.
