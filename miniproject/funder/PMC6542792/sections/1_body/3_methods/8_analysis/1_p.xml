<p id="Par41">The mobility of fluorescently labeled ZIKV-containing vesicles was analyzed by ParticleTR software (Celica Biomedical, Slovenia). Vesicle mobility parameters, travel length (TL, the total length of the vesicle pathway), maximal displacement (MD, maximal net distance of the vesicle movement), and speed were calculated as described
