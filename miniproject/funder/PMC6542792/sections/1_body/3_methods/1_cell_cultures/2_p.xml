<p id="Par28">Human fetal neurons (20 gw), cryopreserved immediately after tissue dissociation, at passage 0 (P0), were acquired from Innoprot (Spain). Neurons were thawed and plated directly onto poly-D-lysine (Sigma)-coated chambered coverslips (µ-Slide 2 Well; Ibidi, Germany) for use in the experiments within the following three days. They were maintained in complete neuronal medium (Innoprot) at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>/95% air.
