<p id="Par27">Human fetal cortical astrocytes (20 gw) were obtained from Innoprot (Derio, Spain). They were cryopreserved at passage one and checked for cell culture purity by GFAP immunofluorescent staining by the provider prior to shipment. Upon delivery they were grown for one passage (4 days) in cell-culture flasks and plated onto chambered coverslips (µ-Slide 2 Well; Ibidi, Martinsried) for use in the experiments within the following three days. They were maintained in complete astrocyte medium (Innoprot) at 37 °C in 5% CO
