<p id="Par26">In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of astrocytes to be the main ZIKV source in the CNS, as they massively produce and release ZIKV, and are resilient to a high virus production. Neurons, on the other hand, appear to suppress the production of virus and also have lower infection rates. Variabilities among different ZIKV strains are visible at several steps of the viral cycle, such as different production and infection rates, infection and trafficking of endocytotic ZIKV-laden vesicles. Future studies are needed to highlight the strain-specific relationships between the cytoskeleton and altered vesicle trafficking.</p>
