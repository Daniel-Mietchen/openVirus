<p id="Par23">While astrocytes are massively infected by the ZIKV strains and they vigorously produce ZIKV, they appear to be more resistant to ZIKV-induced cell death. Cell survival data of astrocytes are similar to the observation from another study where cell survival of human fetal astrocytes decreased to similar levels after 4 days post infection, however, it is noteworthy that a large proportion of astrocytes remained viable

 </sup>. One has to be careful when comparing different viability data of human astrocytes, since there is some variability among different sources, different donors and different strains

 </sup>. Astrocytes appear to be important reservoirs of ZIKV and thus are compelling targets for next-generation drug therapies. Certain pool of human fetal astrocytes can even establish persistent infection with ZIKV, further supporting the theory that these cells can serve as a reservoir for ZIKV persistence in the fetal brain
