<p id="Par21">Motivated by the latest ZIKV outbreak, interest in the effects of ZIKV infection on neuronal cells, especially in the prenatal stage, has increased considerably. Several studies have addressed the issue of which cells are predominantly affected in the fetal brain. It has been shown that ZIKV infects human NPCs, NSCs, RGCs, microglial cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, neurons, and astrocytes

 </sup>. However, it is unclear how infected fetal neuronal cells respond to infection with different ZIKV strains. The focus of our study was, therefore, to compare the responses of primary human fetal astrocytes and neurons to infection with low passages of the Asian-lineage strains ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-FP, and of the African-lineage strain ZIKV-UG. We also compared the responses to ZIKV infection from human astrocytes and neurons with the responses from several cell lines.
