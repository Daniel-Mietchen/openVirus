<p id="Par25">In addition to the differences between strains regarding their production rate and infection, we have identified a novel property in their effect on endocytotic trafficking that differs between ZIKV strains. Whereas ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG strains on average enhanced endocytotic vesicle mobility in astrocytes and neurons, ZIKV-FP-laden vesicles decreased their mobility, especially in astrocytes. It remains to be highlighted in detail how specific ZIKV strains, and other flaviviruses, i.e. TBEV
 <sup>

 </sup>, manipulate the trafficking machinery of endocytotic vesicles. In general, endocytotic transport can be altered by different expression of cytoskeleton proteins, Rab and Rho GTPases that regulate intracellular trafficking, and actin and microtubule assembly

 </sup>. Viruses hijack a number of proteins that enable intracellular vesicle trafficking, such as actin, tubulin, dynamin, and Rho GTPases, and by their manipulation, they may alter the mobility of vesicles

 </sup>. In addition to subverting host cell proteins, viruses also alter lipid signaling mechanisms that are responsible for entry, replication, egress and trafficking of virions in the host cell

 </sup>. ZIKV strains may manipulate endocytotic trafficking differently through rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (as e.g., after TBEV infection) or at the transcriptional level with the upregulation of cytoskeleton-linked proteins (actin, tubulin, dynamin, and Rho GTPases) as was shown for West Nile virus

 </sup>. Moreover, a recent study showed that genes involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle-mediated transport are differentially expressed in human peripheral neurons infected with ZIKV strain from the 2015 Puerto Rico Zika outbreak
