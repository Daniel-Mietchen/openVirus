<p id="Par24">When looking at the level of different strains, it is obvious that the infection rate of ZIKV-UG was the highest in practically all cell types tested, except in human fetal astrocytes where infection rate of ZIKV-BR was similar. This observation is slightly different from the observation in human adult astrocytes, where at an MOI 0.1 African ZIKV strain infected more cells than Brasil ZIKV strain

 </sup>. Lower infection rates at longer times post infection of ZIKV strains in astrocytes versus SK-N-SH, Vero E6 and C6/36 cells can reflect several possibilities; for example the difference in the amount of AXL surface receptor that was shown to be lower in astrocytes than in human lung carcinoma cell line

 </sup>, or the ability of astrocytes to induce rapid upregulation of type I IFNs and thereby restricting viral replication and spread

 </sup>. The function of Axl receptor is still debated, as whether it functions as ZIKV entry receptor or if it promotes ZIKV infection in human astrocytes by antagonizing type I IFN signaling

 </sup>. In addition to that, virus strain itself may affect cell infection rate, as we observed in the case of ZIKV-FP, where cell infection rate was the lowest among all strains in the majority of cell types tested. Moreover, ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-UG initiated production and release of infectious virus particles more rapidly than ZIKV-FP. This finding is similar to the results of another study, in which ZIKV-FP was reported to infect a lower number of astrocytes than an ArB41644 ZIKV strain of African lineage (Bangui, Central African Republic, 1989), had lower production, and induced milder cell death
