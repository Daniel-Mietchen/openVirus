 <p id="Par1">Malformations of the fetal CNS, known as microcephaly, have been linked to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Here, the responses of mammalian and mosquito cell lines, in addition to primary human fetal astrocytes and neurons were studied following infection by ZIKV strains Brazil 2016 (ZIKV-BR), French Polynesia 2013 (ZIKV-FP), and Uganda #976 1947 (ZIKV-UG). Viral production, cell viability, infectivity rate, and mobility of endocytotic ZIKV-laden vesicles were compared. All cell types (SK-N-SH, Vero E6, C6/36, human fetal astrocytes and human fetal neurons) released productive virus. Among primary cells, astrocytes were more susceptible to ZIKV infection than neurons, released more progeny virus and tolerated higher virus loads than neurons. In general, the infection rate of ZIKV-UG strain was the highest. All ZIKV strains elicited differences in trafficking of ZIKV-laden endocytotic vesicles in the majority of cell types, including astrocytes and neurons, except in mosquito cells, where ZIKV infection failed to induce cell death. These results represent a thorough screening of cell viability, infection and production of three ZIKV strains in five different cell types and demonstrate that ZIKV affects vesicle mobility in all but mosquito cells.</p>
