Indeed, the pulp is also used to reveal past and ancient infections in the field of paleomicrobiology. The present study aimed to detect the presence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a small community (approximately 400 inhabitants) in the Amazon region of Brazil (Nossa Senhora do Perpetuo Socorro, Vizeu, Para, Brazil) and standardize a technique for the detection of the virus in the dental pulp. Serum samples were collected from 48 patients whose teeth were clinically recommended for surgical extraction. The group comprised an equal number of males and females, mostly agriculture workers and housewives, respectively. The majority (64.6%) received less than one minimum wage and were ill educated (less than four years of school years). An enzyme immune assay was used to detect antibodies to HCV and the 9 (18.8%) positive samples were submitted to nucleic acid extraction in the blood (using the EXTRAzol) and the pulp (QIAamp DNA Micro Kit e kit RNeasy Plus Micro). The pulp was removed using a modified protocol without the use of liquid nitrogen. Nucleic acid was found in 8 of the dental pulp, but in 7 of the blood samples. Sequencing of one of the samples showed the presence of genotype 1. Conclusions: A novel simplified methodology for the extraction and amplification of HCV nucleic acid was successful to detect the presence of persistent infections of the virus within the dental pulp tissue. The protocol may be helpful to detect past and ancient infections and to better understand the natural history of HCV.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishak</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by grants from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

Approximately 170 million persons are thought to be persistently infected [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and at least 80% will develop severe diseases including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In Brazil, the prevalence of HCV is around 1% to 2% in the general population, but it ranges from 0.9% to 2.4% in the North region of the country [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and it reaches more than 30% among injecting drug users [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

The majority (64.6%) survived with less than one minimum wage. Both sexes referred their first sexual relation around 16 years old, 65.5% never used condoms and all were heterosexuals. One was a sexual partner of an injecting drug user and one was infected by HIV-1.</p><p>Most males (58.3%) worked in agriculture and 41.6% of the females were housewives; the number of school years was less than four among 45.9% and 33.3%, respectively. More than 90% of men and women were born in the State of Para and the majority was married (50% and 79.1%, respectively).</p><p>The presence of antibodies to HCV was detected in 9 (18.8%) of the 48 individuals investigated.

The population is clearly deprived of health care and access to medical services, to general health information, and sexual guidance directed to avoid infections not only by sexual and blood transmitted agents, but also to non infectious diseases.</p><p>Despite of any information they are able to obtain, it is generally difficult to understand either simple or complex data, as formal education (number of school years) is low, which is a common finding in most rural areas of the country, but is even worse in the Amazon region of Brazil. A clear indication is their sexual initiation early in life and the lack of condom use, an enhancing risk factor for the dissemination of infections.</p><p>It is a common procedure nowadays by dental practitioners the refusal of tooth removal, but the clinical situation of the patients examined urged immediate action. Among the most common reasons for tooth removal, included excrutiating tooth pain, signs of heavy bacterial infection and severe inflammation of the gums. Again, their understanding of simple information was in prejudice of their lack of formal education and further impaired by the absence of financial resources from their familial income to direct towards oral and dental welfare.</p><p>The presence of antibodies was detected in a high proportion of persons, contrary to what is generally seen in most parts of the world, in Brazil (1&#x02013;2%) and in the Amazon (0.9&#x02013;2.4%) region [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a small community in the State of Para, in the municipality of Cameta, the prevalence of antibodies to HCV was found to be 8.8% and viral RNA was detected among 62.5% [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of the positive samples which was still lower than in the present study. Sexual transmission of the virus could explain its large dissemination as it is a probable risk factor involved in the North region [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>It is relevant to mention that the presence of nucleic acid was detected in most of the samples, whatever the origin of the biological material. Indeed, the dental pulp yielded one more sample than in the sera. To exclude the possibility of contamination, the sample was sequenced and further described as genotype 1, which is the most common genotype present in the North region of the country [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The reason for this is still not clearly explained, but higher replication rates in the pulp tissue cannot be discarded. Persistence of HCV is not commonly high among individuals with antibodies, and this finding was unusual. There is no other mention to such a high prevalence of virus persistence [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>So far, the present study was the first to our knowledge to detect HCV nucleic acid from the dental pulp. The standardization of a simple methodology to remove the dental pulp was also successfully achieved. Some other approaches refer immediate removal of the pulp, following the tooth extraction. Glick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] refer tooth extraction of an HIV-1 patient and the immediate removal of the pulp for nuclei acid detection at the same day, and the finding of a high concentration of proviral DNA. Tran-Hung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggest to collect the pulp within 24 hours after dental extraction and used sterile resin for the removal. Mahmoudpour et al. [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] isolated <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> from dead root canals of patients with or without symptoms. Removal of the pulp used an absorbent paper cone, which clearly causes a considerable loss of the pulp tissue, although this was not, apparently, a cause on impairment.</p><p>In the present study, as a consequence of the distance to the laboratory, the teeth were all placed in PBS for transportation and later (24 to 48 hours) frozen at -70&#x000b0;C. Apparently, there was no prejudice with this procedure for the amplification of HCV nucleic acid. Apparently, there was no external contamination and the loss of pulp tissue was reduced to a minimum (most of them weighed more than 5g). It is preferentially required that the operator has some knowledge of the tooth anatomy and to be skilled with the use of files and burs.</p><p>For the extraction of RNA the pulp was not frozen in liquid nitrogen before grinding. Freezing the sample (after weighing) at -70&#x000b0;C was sufficient to successfully obtain positive results during the procedure. This is a simplification of the method which provides a safer procedure, avoiding the use of a potential hazard.</p><p>The dental pulp is largely vascularized and therefore infectious agents present in the blood can easily reach the dental tissue both in humans and other animals [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The tissue has been used as a common source for the recovery of nucleic acid from past and ancient infections such as <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> from the teeth of skeletons dating from the XVI and XVII centuries [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The entry of infectious agents into the tooth and, particularly, the dental pulp, seems to trigger the activation of several pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), as an important tissue devoted to the innate immune system [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of nucleic acid has been used to detect ancient molecules from different infectious agents which are used also to delineate historical patterns of infections and ancient migrations of human populations around the world. This new field of study, paleomicrobiology, started with the description of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> DNA in an ancient skeleton and since then it helped to identify and characterize infectious agents and their geographical dissemination according to what is found in paleo specimens [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Description of some viruses has already been reported such as human papillomavirus and HTLV-1 in tissues dated from the IV and XV centuries respectively [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the influenza virus strain (H1N1) from 1918 in paraffin-embedded biopsies [<xref rid="pone.0165272.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is important to mention that these agents represent viruses which are maintained as a proviral genome and an RNA virus which shows a short replication cycle and an apparently short or absent viremia in the human host. It is important to point that HCV establishes a persistent infection in a small proportion of the infected persons, but without integration of its nucleic acid.</p><p>A novel simplified methodology for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acid of HCV from the dental pulp was standardized and the rate of success was higher than using serum, plasma or whole blood. The protocol was able to detect the presence of persistent infections of the virus within the dental pulp and is readly accessible; it may be used in a combined approach with archeology to detect past and ancient HCV infections in order to better understand the origin, emergence, evolution and dissemination history of HCV.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the individuals who participated in the present study.
