<p>So far, the present study was the first to our knowledge to detect HCV nucleic acid from the dental pulp. The standardization of a simple methodology to remove the dental pulp was also successfully achieved. Some other approaches refer immediate removal of the pulp, following the tooth extraction. Glick et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] refer tooth extraction of an HIV-1 patient and the immediate removal of the pulp for nuclei acid detection at the same day, and the finding of a high concentration of proviral DNA. Tran-Hung et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggest to collect the pulp within 24 hours after dental extraction and used sterile resin for the removal. Mahmoudpour et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] isolated 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> from dead root canals of patients with or without symptoms. Removal of the pulp used an absorbent paper cone, which clearly causes a considerable loss of the pulp tissue, although this was not, apparently, a cause on impairment.
