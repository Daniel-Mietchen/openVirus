<p>In the present study, as a consequence of the distance to the laboratory, the teeth were all placed in PBS for transportation and later (24 to 48 hours) frozen at -70Â°C. Apparently, there was no prejudice with this procedure for the amplification of HCV nucleic acid. Apparently, there was no external contamination and the loss of pulp tissue was reduced to a minimum (most of them weighed more than 5g). It is preferentially required that the operator has some knowledge of the tooth anatomy and to be skilled with the use of files and burs.</p>
