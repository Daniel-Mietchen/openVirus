<p>A novel simplified methodology for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acid of HCV from the dental pulp was standardized and the rate of success was higher than using serum, plasma or whole blood. The protocol was able to detect the presence of persistent infections of the virus within the dental pulp and is readly accessible; it may be used in a combined approach with archeology to detect past and ancient HCV infections in order to better understand the origin, emergence, evolution and dissemination history of HCV.</p>
