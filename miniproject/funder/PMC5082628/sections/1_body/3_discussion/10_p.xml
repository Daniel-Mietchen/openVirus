<p>The dental pulp is largely vascularized and therefore infectious agents present in the blood can easily reach the dental tissue both in humans and other animals [

The entry of infectious agents into the tooth and, particularly, the dental pulp, seems to trigger the activation of several pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), as an important tissue devoted to the innate immune system [
