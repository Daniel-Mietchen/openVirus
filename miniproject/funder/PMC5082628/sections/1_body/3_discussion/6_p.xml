<p>It is relevant to mention that the presence of nucleic acid was detected in most of the samples, whatever the origin of the biological material. Indeed, the dental pulp yielded one more sample than in the sera. To exclude the possibility of contamination, the sample was sequenced and further described as genotype 1, which is the most common genotype present in the North region of the country [

Persistence of HCV is not commonly high among individuals with antibodies, and this finding was unusual. There is no other mention to such a high prevalence of virus persistence [
