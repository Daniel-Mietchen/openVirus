<p>Description of some viruses has already been reported such as human papillomavirus and HTLV-1 in tissues dated from the IV and XV centuries respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the influenza virus strain (H1N1) from 1918 in paraffin-embedded biopsies [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is important to mention that these agents represent viruses which are maintained as a proviral genome and an RNA virus which shows a short replication cycle and an apparently short or absent viremia in the human host. It is important to point that HCV establishes a persistent infection in a small proportion of the infected persons, but without integration of its nucleic acid.
