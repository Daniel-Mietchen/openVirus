<p>The final phylogenetic tree was obtained by majority-rule consensus and then edited using graphic resources found in the FigTree software [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nucleotide sequences obtained from the National Center of Biotechnology Information were added to the alignment and used to construct the phylogenetic tree. The nucleotide sequence obtained in this study was deposited in the National Center of Biotechnology (#KU955710).
