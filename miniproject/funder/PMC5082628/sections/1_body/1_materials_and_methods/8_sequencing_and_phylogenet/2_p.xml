<p>Nucleotide sequences were edited and aligned using BioEdit software [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The final alignment was performed using Modelgenerator software [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] aiming to select, according to the corrected Akaike information criterion, the best model to apply for the phylogenetic analysis. These parameters were used in the PHYML program version 2.4.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to infer trees by the maximum-likelihood method. The statistical reliance of the tree topologies was evaluated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
