<p>After molecular diagnosis of viral infection, positive samples were selected for amplification of the 5â€™UTR of HCV as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0165272.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The product of the amplification was run on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and then visualized with ultraviolet light. The amplified fragment was sequenced in both directions according to Sanger
