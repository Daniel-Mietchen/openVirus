<p>To the column it was added 700 μL of RW1 buffer and centrifuged for 15 seconds at 14,000 rpm and the filtrate was then discarded. RPE buffer (500 μL) was added to the column and centrifuged for 15 seconds at 14,000 rpm to wash the membrane of the column and the filtrate was discarded. Ethanol, 80%, was added (500 μL) to the column and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 14,000 rpm and the filtrate was discarded. The column was placed in a 2mL tube and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm and the filtrate was discarded. The column was finally placed into a 1,5mL tube added 14 μL of RNAse free water directly in the center of the column membrane and centrifuged for 1 minute at 14,000 rpm for elution of the RNA.</p>
