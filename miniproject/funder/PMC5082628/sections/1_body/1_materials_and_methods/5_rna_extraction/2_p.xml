<p>Extraction of nucleic acid of the pulp was performed using RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, Austin, Texas,USA) without the use of liquid nitrogen. The sample was weighed (less than 5 mg), frozen to -70°C, ground with a sterile cutting spoon, and without thawing added 350 μL of RLT plus buffer. The lysate was placed into a QIAsheredder spin column inside a 3mL tube and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was carefully transferred to the gDNA Eliminator spin column, which was placed in a 2mL tube and centrifuged for 30 seconds at 14,000 rpm. Ethanol, 70%, was added (350 μL) to the filtrate, homogenized and transfered to the RNeasy MinElute spin column which was placed into a 2mL tube and centrifuged for 15 seconds at 14,000 rpm. The filtrate was then discarded.</p>
