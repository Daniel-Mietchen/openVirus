<p>The dental pulp was removed with the aid of a sterile spherical diamond round bur (KG Sorensen, Cotia, Brasil) and carborundum disks, maintained under refrigeration with cold water. The pulp was removed using sterile Hedstroen files (Maillefer Dentsply, Switzerland) with different calibers (#15 to #40) and a cutting spoon. The dental crown was cut by the pulpar chamber when needed; spherical round bur helped the access to the pulp tissue. Nucleic acid extraction was performed after removal of the pulp, under refrigeration. The pulp was frozen (-70Â°C), weighed (no more than 5mg was used), treated with RNAlater and completely grounded</p>
