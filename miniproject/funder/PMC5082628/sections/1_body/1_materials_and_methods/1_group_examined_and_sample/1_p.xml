When the clinical situation required surgical removal of any tooth, the patient was invited to join the study. In case of acceptance, the patient answered a questionnaire (for demographic, social and cultural information), and had a blood sample (5 mL) collected before surgical removal of the tooth. All patients were required to be older than 18 years, be a resident of the village, have a clinical indication for surgical tooth removal and the dental pulp had to be in good anatomical and microbiological conditions.</p>
