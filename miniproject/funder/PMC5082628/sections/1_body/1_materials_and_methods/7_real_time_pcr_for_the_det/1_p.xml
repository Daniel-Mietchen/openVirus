<p>The amplification of the 5’UTR region consisted of a reaction with a volume of 25 μL with 8.75 μL of water, 12.5 μL of the mix and 0.75 μL of assays and 3 μL of cDNA. GAPDH was used as an internal control using the same protocol, excluding cDNA. The amplification reaction was performed in a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR Systems (Life Technologies, USA), using the following protocol: one cycle of 50°C for 2 minutes, one cycle of 95°C for 10 minutes (for the initial denaturation), 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute, using the following primers: HCV_NCR5-C93F (5’- GCTCAATGCCTGGAGATTTGG -3’), HCV_NCR5-C93R (5’- CTTTCGCGACCCAACACTAC -3’) and probe HCV_NCR5-C93M2 (5’- [FAM]-TCGGCTAGCAGTCTCG -3’) were used as previously described [
