<p>Confirmed Zika cases were 3.7 times more likely in dengue na誰ve compared to non-na誰ve people. Also, dengue total infections were 22.2 times more likely in dengue na誰ves compared to non-na誰ves, this could be a reflection of inapparent infections that were missed in the population, and/or secondary infections that were not detected. The other incidence rate ratios estimated were not significant. This is a very interesting finding given the current interest in potential cross protection of dengue and Zika antibodies. It may be that recent, within two years, dengue infection may be protective against symptomatic Zika. Our results are consistent with recent publications available on this topic but do not prove the cross-protection and more research needs to be done [
