<p>The content of the article should be analyzed based on some limitations. Although the exploratory and comprehensive design of the study allowed a more profound analysis of the complexity of the phenomenon studied (fieldwork of ACE), the generalization of the results to other context, should be done with caution, moreover the results should not be extrapolated. The sampling technique employed in this study was non-probabilistic (convenience) sampling. The ACE who were present on the data collection day and who accepted to participate in the focus group were included in the study. Factors related to subjectivity and personalities made it difficult to extract information about categories and characteristics using qualitative data analysis, however this limitation was minimized by employing the Iramuteq software.</p>
