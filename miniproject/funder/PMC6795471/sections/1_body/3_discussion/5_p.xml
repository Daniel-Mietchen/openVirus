<p>The results of this research suggest that the work of ACE is not recognized; moreover, these workers suffer from insecurity, lack of resources and training. It can therefore be inferred from the findings that the work of ACE is not properly evaluated. In the same line of research, Donateli and collaborators (2017) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] designed a logical model of health surveillance. In this model, hiring and training of human resources were considered managerial functions, mainly of the health surveillance coordinator. As previously mentioned, this does not correspond to reality. The most common situation is training programs conducted by an experienced ACE within the work environment. Despite having experience, he/she may not have the appropriate skills to perform these trainings, for instance, effectively convey to beginners and inexperienced colleagues how to properly perform tasks related to the job.
