The focus groups were organized aiming to broaden and deepen the discussion and analysis of ACE perception of their performance in relation to attributions, work processes, training, continuous education, and evaluation. All the workers, irrespective of municipality, recognize their role in disease prevention and health promotion, however they suffer from a reductionist stigma associated with their profession. Also, internal and external factors such as infrastructure, resources, administrative management, and the work process affect the quality of service delivered and job satisfaction. Practice challenges include incompatible demands such as refusal by residents and high sense of insecurity related to violence. The respondents reported that success of their activities depend on the population.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The recurrence of epidemics demands effective vector control policies.

Recurrent epidemics highlight the need for effective endemic disease control and prevention, as well as health education. Therefore, our study analyzed the perception of Endemic Disease Control Agents (ACE) about their professional performance and presented a deepened discussion about the factors that enhance and impair their work in the field. Our investigation identified four categories of factors that influence the performance of ACE: work practice and routines, challenges in the practice of the profession, work assessment, and job satisfaction. These findings reinforce ACE and professional qualification as fundamental for the prevention and control of arboviruses. Thus, measures must be put in place to promote the recognition and appreciation of these professionals. Also, the implementation of actions and allocation of resources to this sector may improve the quality of service provided, which would consequently reduce the impact of these still neglected diseases on the health and living conditions of the population.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCTI/CNPQ/UNIVERSAL 14/2014 &#x02013; Process number 457912/2014-6</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004901</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Process number CDS-APQ-01207-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7123-8388</contrib-id><name><surname>Donateli</surname><given-names>C&#x000ed;ntia Pereira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Finance Code 001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7123-8388</contrib-id><name><surname>Donateli</surname><given-names>C&#x000ed;ntia Pereira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors thank to National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ), process number 457912/2014-6, to Minas Gerais State Foundation for Research Development (FAPEMIG), process number CDS-APQ-01207-14 and to Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior &#x02013; Brasil (CAPES) &#x02013; Finance Code 001, for the financial support granted to this work.

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, mortality related to Dengue in 2015 increased by 48.7% [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, its epidemic has spread worldwide, and approximately 50% of the world&#x000b4;s population reside in areas with the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the preventable of Dengue is 99%, elevated mortality rates have been reported worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A high number of co-circulating DENV serotypes in a given region is a key indicator of hyperendemicity and increased frequency of severe forms of Dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The rising impact of arboviruses is mainly due to their high transmission, besides the capacity to adapt to new environments and hosts. These characteristics are conducive for epidemics in tropical and subtropical countries, such as Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although Dengue is listed among the World Health Organization (WHO) priority goals, its maintenance on the list of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has been questioned because of the funding and increasing scientific output related to Dengue over the past 20 years [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, Dengue fever satisfies one of the important criteria of NTD (diseases that affect urban population in densely populated and impoverished tropical areas), thus requires effective community-based interventions, especially primary prevention [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The recurrence of arbovirus epidemics is related to activities that modify and transform the environment such as climate change, deforestation, urbanization, disordered occupation, displacement, and population transfer which contributes to the spread of the virus. [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Environmental modifications, in addition to the lack of basic sanitation, favor the transmission of pathogen to urban areas which contribute to the increased infestation and spread of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Over the years, Brazil has been faced with continuous increase in the frequency and magnitude of epidemics. The period between 2010 and 2015 marked the greatest transmission of the disease in the country, with a record of six million probable cases."[<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to data from the Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin (Week 11), up until March 16, 2019, 229,064 probable cases of Dengue have been reported in Brazil. During this period, the state of Minas Gerais recorded the highest incidence per 100000 inhabitants in the Southeast region (261.2 cases /100000 inhabitants) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This information indicates the need for health and environmental services to collaborate in order to strengthen health surveillance and ensure continuous and timely actions.</p><p>According to the National Guidelines for Health Surveillance [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], integration is mandatory for the development of comprehensive care, work protocol consistent with local reality and desired outcomes. Due to the rapid changes and diversity in global epidemiological scenarios, a broader set of players in public health surveillance activities has been shown as a recipe for success [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Actions related to the integration and strengthening of health surveillance are fundamental for the control and reduction of health risks. Not only do arboviruses impact infected individuals and the society, they also increase the expenditure of the Unified Health System (SUS) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the event of the co-circulation of viruses with similar symptoms, as in Brazil&#x000b4;s triple epidemic, Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya that occurred in 2016, the lack of appropriate and confirmatory laboratory tests creates uncertainties about the actual epidemiological scenario being experienced [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The prevention of arboviruses depends on effective measures for the control of endemics and health promotion. Considering that the size of Brazil is close to that of a continent, the municipalization of health actions facilitates decision making at the municipal level as regards the best way to handle epidemics. In addition, it allows a close monitoring of vector control teams and their actions. In the case of endemic disease epidemics, regional and macro-regional entities (state) play an important role in the articulation of vector control programs [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In 2017, the Ministry of Health through the National Policy of Primary Health Care (PNAB) proposed the integration of Primary Health Care and Health Surveillance as an essential condition for the identification of the network of casualties and elements of the health-disease process. [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The 2017 PNAB made it possible to include endemic agents in Primary Health Care, collaborating with community health agents in the control of vectors and the management of the environment [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>However, the effectiveness of the proposed actions is undermined by challenges related to professional practice in this field. Although there are actions aimed at personal protection and mosquito control in Brazil, factors such as the lack of knowledge of the population about the actions of ACE, unpreparedness for professional practice, and precarious working conditions, e.g., infrastructure, run counter to the importance of the role played by these health environment professionals. These factors influence the recurrence of epidemics and the emergence of new arboviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The fight against the emergence and re-emergence of arboviruses demands multiple intersectoral interventions and policies, and the involvement of society as being accountable for its health. Brazil must prioritize policies that invest in the availability of resources, qualification of surveillance actions, control and eradication of vectors, and restructuring of the health system, especially with regard to decisions that directly impact the population [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In order to understand the context associated with cyclical epidemics of arboviruses in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, the objective of this study was to examine the factors that enhance and impair the endemic disease control agents&#x02019; field work, based on their own perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Overview of study methods</title><p>This study is a qualitative study which employed the focus group technique. The sampling technique of this study was non-probabilistic (convenience) sampling involving 65 ACE aged between 23 and 57 years. Via focus group discussions, we were able to facilitate in-depth discussions focused on the perception of ACE regarding their own performance. By using focus groups, we were able to generate evidence to support opinion assessment and interact with professionals of the Unified Health System (SUS). In order to clarify the findings, it was essential to understand the actions of the agent in the fight against <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and prevention of arboviral infections in Brazil.</p><p>In this research, the concept of performance encompasses not only the attributions of ACE, but also broadly covers job qualification, evaluation and professional valorization.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>The state of Minas Gerais is divided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) into twelve mesoregions, covering 66 microregions. The Zona da Mata mesoregion of Minas Gerais consists of seven geographic microregions: Ponte Nova, Manhua&#x000e7;u, Vi&#x000e7;osa, Muria&#x000e9;, Ub&#x000e1;, Juiz de Fora, Cataguases. In the last census, the largest municipality had a population of 57,390 inhabitants and population density of 121.94 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> while the largest city had a population of 516,247 inhabitants and a demographic density of 359.59 inhabitants / km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>This study is a subset of the project "Health Surveillance: evaluation of disease prevention and health promotion practices in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais". The first study of this project evaluated and classified health surveillance in the Zona da Mata region, Minas Gerais, as intermediate, indicating its fragmented performance in the reorganization of health practices. [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. After this stage, the need arose to analyze ACE perception of their professional performance, among workers that did not participate in the previous study. The initial quantitative phase consisted of the application of a structured questionnaire, where all ACE from the seven municipalities (n = 321) participated. After the quantitative analysis, we felt the need to deepen discussions on different subjects highlighted by ACE. For this purpose, we chose the focus group method as propitious for the exploration of these subjects.</p><p>The present study employed a non-probabilistic sampling method, which involves the selection of ACE according to interest and willingness to participate, following a strict focus group methodology based on eight to ten ACE per municipality. The main fieldwork in this profession includes carrying out treatment with insecticides and monitoring of surroundings with the objective of reducing mosquito breeding sites, especially during home visits as well as strategic areas such as abandoned lands and construction sites.</p><p>The focus groups were held at the workplaces of ACE located in the premises of the environmental surveillance and zoonoses department in the municipalities of the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais: Cataguases, Juiz de Fora, Manhua&#x000e7;u, Muria&#x000e9;, Ponte Nova, Ub&#x000e1;, and Vi&#x000e7;osa. Eligibility was based on the following criteria: male or female 1) willing and able to provide informed consent, 2) professional field practice experience, and 3) willing and able to complete a 60-minute focus group.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Development of the focus groups</title><p>The ACE were informed about the objectives and goals of the study and their participation before receiving the informed consent forms. All participants signed the informed consent form prior to any study activity.</p><p>In each municipality, one focus group was formed, totaling seven focus groups for the seven included municipalities. Data collection took place in the second semester of 2017. The data collection process involved the participation of a researcher/moderator, an observer and ACE. The moderator facilitated the focus group discussion using a focus group guide developed by the research team and to capture the perception of the participants about the topic "Performance of endemic disease control agents (ACE) in the Zona da Mata mesoregion of Minas Gerais".</p><p>The focus group guide had five questions to explore the main themes of interest: 1) How do you perceive the role of the endemic disease control agent in health promotion and disease prevention? 2) Are there inherent challenges in the practice of the profession? If yes, what are they? 3) Are there difficulties related to the training process for fieldwork?

The perception of ACE about the community is related to the lack of education and knowledge of residents on how to keep their property safe from mosquito foci. Blaming the population for the low efficiency in solving problems identified and low effectiveness of actions ruins the relations between the subjects. These findings corroborate with studies that address the importance of education, preventive practices and co-responsibility of the population and public authorities for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> control [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It requires collective adherence on the part of all the players involved to change the health profile of the country and advance in the reduction of health inequalities, considering empowerment and education as precursors of this change.</p><p>The endemic disease control agents are in direct contact with the community and environment and their work involves multiple risks. The perception of danger was reported for contact with insecticides and pesticides, falls from heights, and violence. Another study [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] portrays these same risks related to health, in its expanded concept, and the work of ACE, emphasizing the interference of social interaction with urban violence and its various contours such as drug trafficking, physical and verbal aggression during the visits, and the health repercussions in the lives of these workers.</p><p>Moreover, the ACE feel there is a lack of regulation regarding their autonomy and recognition of their role in the health of the population. Actions such as the dissemination of their work in communication channels would increase the credibility and acceptance by the residents, resulting in fewer refusals and higher productivity. Recognition by the population is not enough, managers and coordinators need to give ACE a listening ear and include them in the decision-making processes to promote efficiency and problem solving skills.</p><p>Therefore, in this sector, communication and dialogue between both parties is indispensable. Bulletins or reports should be discussed and evaluated, most importantly there must be a feedback system that conveys failures and possible improvements that can be made. In this sense, there is room to promote meetings where employees are aware of their weaknesses and strength. Also, both parties can share their experiences and daily practices, all of which can improve the quality of service delivered [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The results of this research suggest that the work of ACE is not recognized; moreover, these workers suffer from insecurity, lack of resources and training. It can therefore be inferred from the findings that the work of ACE is not properly evaluated. In the same line of research, Donateli and collaborators (2017) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] designed a logical model of health surveillance. In this model, hiring and training of human resources were considered managerial functions, mainly of the health surveillance coordinator. As previously mentioned, this does not correspond to reality. The most common situation is training programs conducted by an experienced ACE within the work environment. Despite having experience, he/she may not have the appropriate skills to perform these trainings, for instance, effectively convey to beginners and inexperienced colleagues how to properly perform tasks related to the job.</p><p>Studies that evaluated the knowledge of health professionals or high school students about arboviruses identified gaps [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. According to the studies, the professionals need to be continuously trained and qualified for the control and management of arboviruses. According to Corrin, et al. (2017) the lack of knowledge is a barrier to individual protective attitudes and joint interventions against the mosquito [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, the actions of ACE need to be strengthened through communication and dissemination. In the study of Fritzell et al. (2016) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], school intervention, television and social media were cited as adequate communication tools to promote public health messages.</p><p>The triple arbovirus epidemic in Brazil resumed the debate on the failure of local actions to eradicate <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, significantly blamed on limited capacity of municipal planning and management of health surveillance [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Although the decentralization of disease control has allowed the municipality to expand its actions, the control and prevention of infectious diseases heavily relies on mandatory notification issued in the Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SINAN) [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, work in this field depends on constant case notification and investigation, data transmission to other levels, and the construction of databases and information systems [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The compartmentalization of surveillance has impaired necessary integration with networks within the Unified Health System (SUS), which results in limited response to local needs and problems [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Vector control strategies of the government have been based on top-down approaches coupled with vertical programs [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and chemical-dependent model for the control of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], despite report indicates the contrary: isolated vector control initiatives do not promote behavioral changes [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>ACE are recruited through a civil service examination and/or proof of qualification. The contract of ACE is determined by the period established to meet a temporary demand [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The temporal nature of the job implies high turnover of the professionals, which undermines the bond of ACE with the community. In addition, although ACE are residents of the city in which they work, they are not always allocated to their neighborhoods. By simply allocating ACE to areas they reside, the sense of security of both ACE and residents will increase, reducing resident refusals, and creating a stronger bond between both parties.</p><p>Employee training is highlighted as fundamental for an integrated and effective work. Training programs should be continuous, and structured to improve employee skills, most importantly, cover topics relevant to the practice of the profession. According to a study conducted in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais [<xref rid="pntd.0007741.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], factors such as the lack of investment in professional training, low salary, precarious employment relationship, and poor working conditions largely contribute to the fragile professional identity of ACE. This scenario is equally alarming as the emergence and reemergence of arboviruses that have plagued the country for years.</p><p>It emphasizes that health surveillance service and actions need to undergo a complete reorganization, with the main priority being the recognition of the functions of ACE in direct and continuous contact with the community, land inspection and vulnerability mapping. Therefore, ACE integrates the community and health service, which is important for the implementation of effective arbovirus prevention and control actions that require multilevel engagement. They are also capable of having a broader perspective of health determinants as well as environmental related-health risks, both in the individual and collective sense.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations</title><p>The content of the article should be analyzed based on some limitations. Although the exploratory and comprehensive design of the study allowed a more profound analysis of the complexity of the phenomenon studied (fieldwork of ACE), the generalization of the results to other context, should be done with caution, moreover the results should not be extrapolated. The sampling technique employed in this study was non-probabilistic (convenience) sampling. The ACE who were present on the data collection day and who accepted to participate in the focus group were included in the study. Factors related to subjectivity and personalities made it difficult to extract information about categories and characteristics using qualitative data analysis, however this limitation was minimized by employing the Iramuteq software.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Future challenges in relation to epidemics, neglected diseases, and vector control are innumerous. Thus, an in-depth knowledge of the actions of ACE provides an important insight into the experiences and perceptions of this workforce in the face of the epidemiological scenario in Brazil characterized by disease threats and increased demands. The present study shows the inadequate analysis of the work process of ACE. Our findings reveal that ACE suffer from the lack of recognition, low efficiency of actions, and devaluation.</p><p>Clearly, the society and government need to restructure their approach to urban health problems. The recurrence of epidemics indicates that public policies have not been effective as they should be. Therefore, understanding and acknowledging the fundamental role of ACE in the identification of risk factors and health protection could contribute to the effective eradication and control of epidemics. Approaches such as practical solution to challenges, valorization of this workforce, employee training, establishment of reliable assessments methods and cost-effective interventions do not only improve service quality but also contribute to the fight against health problems, and consequent improvement of the health status of the population.</p><p>In view of the above, more studies are needed to design and evaluate the professional performance of ACE in other locations and populations. We also suggest that studies use triangulation, in order to consolidate the conclusions of the phenomenon studied as well as identify similar or additional factors related to this subject of extreme relevance to public health.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants for their time and significant contributions.
