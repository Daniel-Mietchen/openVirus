<p id="Par13">In the model, infection acutely boosts an individual’s titer, which then wanes slowly over one year, potentially leaving a long-term boost that does not wane. To increase accuracy in modeling these acute boosts, we took advantage of 112 PCR-confirmed infections and pre- and post-infection titers from this study to fit the mean and standard deviation of the titer rises (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Discussion). The acute boost was higher for H3N2 than for H1N1pdm09 in both children and adults, but there was no significant difference in boost sizes by age in either subtype (Supplementary Table 5). We found evidence of an antibody ceiling effect, whereby individuals with higher pre-infection titers have smaller boosts (see Supplementary Discussion). After fitting this sub-model to describe the relationship between infection and short-term titer changes, we then fixed its parameters to fit the full model of titer dynamics to all 706 individuals. For children and adults, the full model estimates the contribution of HI-correlated and non-HI-correlated factors to protection (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>), the magnitude of the long-term titer boost, the 50% protective titers (for Eqs. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>), and the rate of waning of non-HI-correlated protection (for Eqs. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Additionally, because some subjects in the study belong to the same household, we estimate the contribution of infected household members to an individual’s force of infection, relative to that of the community. Simulating from the maximum likelihood estimates of the best model yields additional information, including the typical duration of protection after infection, attack rates in different epidemics, and the odds ratios of infection from one epidemic to the next (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). These simulations are also useful for checking how well the model reproduces different features of the data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).
