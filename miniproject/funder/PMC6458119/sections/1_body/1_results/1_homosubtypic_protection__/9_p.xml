 <sub>adults,H1N1pdm09</sub> = 0.1, 95% CI (0.07, 0.12)). This result suggests that early in life, protection against influenza virus infection is dominated by immune responses that correlate well with HI titer, such as antibodies to the top of the HA head. However, over time, other immune responses dominate, such that time since infection becomes a better predictor of protection than HI titer. This result is consistent with the observation that more children than adults in this study have detectable baseline HI titers, and children have higher mean baseline HI titers, to circulating strains (Supplementary Fig. 1; “Methods” section).
