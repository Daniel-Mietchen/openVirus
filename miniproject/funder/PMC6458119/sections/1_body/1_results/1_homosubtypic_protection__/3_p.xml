<p id="Par8">To characterize the role of these antibodies in protection, we tested a simple hypothesis about the dynamics of susceptibility after infection: protection from infection could be associated with HI titer, the time since last infection (a potential correlate of other antibody and broader immune responses), or a mixture of the two. We define an individualâ€™s susceptibility to a subtype as the probability of infection given exposure. Rewriting the hypotheses mathematically, we propose the susceptibility of an individual

 <italic>q</italic>

  <italic>i</italic>,
