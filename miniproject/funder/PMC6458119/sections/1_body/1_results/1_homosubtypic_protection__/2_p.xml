 </sup>. Neutralizing antibodies against the dominant surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), can target different sites on them, and the specificity of the antibody response appears to change with immune history and age

 </sup>. HI assays measure antibodies to HA but not NA, and they disproportionately measure anti-HA antibodies that attach near the receptor binding site toward the top of the HA globular domain.
