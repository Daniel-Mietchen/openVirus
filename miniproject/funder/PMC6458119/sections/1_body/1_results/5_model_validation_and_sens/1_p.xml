<p id="Par23">In addition to comparing the models’ results to other estimates of population-level incidence and protection between epidemics, we investigated the model’s ability to match other features of the data. The best-fit models reproduce the observed distributions of 1−, 2−, and 4-fold titer rises, considering all individuals’ trajectories together (Supplementary Discussion; Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). However, the models tend to overestimate how much an individual’s titer varies over time (Supplementary Discussion; Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). This suggests the model might not be fully capturing individual heterogeneity in infection risk and/or the response to infection, although individuals’ trajectories appear reasonable by eye (Supplementary Figs. 10, 11). Beyond estimating the factors that correlate with protection, we examined the robustness of our model to other assumptions. Our results are robust to changes in the initial conditions, namely, how recently individuals are assumed to have been infected (see Supplementary Discussion). Results also do not change with an alternate scaling of the community influenza intensity to account for increased surveillance during the 2009 H1N1pdm09 pandemic (see Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Figs. 12 and 19). Additionally, our assumptions about the m]easurement error are consistent not only with values estimated by others

 </sup> but also with the error estimated from replicate titer measurements in the data (see Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Fig. 20).
