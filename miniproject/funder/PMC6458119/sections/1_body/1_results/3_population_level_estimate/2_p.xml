<p id="Par20">The simulated infections reproduce other estimates of protection over time. We estimated the odds ratios of protection between epidemics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We find evidence of inter-epidemic H1N1pdm09 protection for children between 2009 and 2011, consistent with a previous analysis of this trial that used ≥4-fold titer rises to indicate infection

 </sup>, and between 2011 and 2013. We also find evidence of protection for adults for the same two inter-epidemic periods. Protection against H3N2 in both children and adults occurred between 2010 and 2012 and between 2012 and 2013. The point estimates of the odds ratios inferred from ≥4-fold titer rises in children are lower than those inferred from latent infections in this model, suggesting that past infection may protect more against large titer rises than infection per se.
