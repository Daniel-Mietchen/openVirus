<p id="Par19">Despite being fitted to individuals’ titers, the models recover reasonable population-level patterns of infection for both subtypes. From the simulated latent infections, we inferred the annual incidence and the cumulative epidemic incidence in children and adults (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Because the models assume that the community-level, subtype-specific influenza intensity affects an individual’s infection risk (Methods, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="">7</xref>), it is unsurprising that periods of high monthly incidence in the simulated study population match those in the community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the absolute monthly incidence in the study population is effectively unconstrained, emerging from the estimated subtype-specific scaled transmission rate,

 </sub> (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. 21), and protection parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results nonetheless match estimates from other populations. The cumulative incidences of individual H1N1pdm09 epidemics range from 7 to 12% in adults and 10–17% in children (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For H3N2, the cumulative epidemic incidences range from 4–12% in adults and 6–23% in children. Estimates of cumulative seasonal influenza incidence in the United States are 5–20% based on combined serology and viral infection (of influenza A and B)

 </sup> and 3–11% based on symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections of influenza A

 </sup>. Converted to annual rates, the simulated annual incidences are similar, ranging from 5–17% in adults and 7–29% in children. We estimate that for both subtypes, the daily within-household intensity (the increased risk of transmission given that at least one member in the household is infected) is roughly 5%, or ~25% over an average five-day infectious period (

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. For example, for a young child at the peak of a H1N1pdm09 epidemic, the daily risk of transmission from the community is approximately 2.1% per day. Therefore, our results suggest that the within-household transmission rate is at least twice as high as the maximum community-level risk. The same is true for H3N2.
