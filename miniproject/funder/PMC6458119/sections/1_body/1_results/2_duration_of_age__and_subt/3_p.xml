 <sub>adults,H1N1pdm09</sub> = 8 (95% CI (1,12), Supplementary Fig. 2) implies that most individuals (i.e., even individuals with titer &lt;10, the lower limit of detection by HI assays) benefit from minor additional protection after infection. When we plot the latent susceptibility after each infection with each subtype, we see that the individual trajectories in Fig.

 <xref rid="Equ10" ref-type="">10</xref>). The contribution of HI-correlated protection to the post-infection protection dynamics of H1N1pdm09 creates mild individual-level variability arising from differences in pre-infection titers. In aggregate, adults’ susceptibility to H1N1pdm09 thus wanes with a half-life of approximately 6.4 y (95% quantile: (4.8, 6.7)), reflecting a significantly slower loss of protection than for H3N2. Infection in adults produces only a small durable titer boost to H1N1pdm09 (

Because susceptibility in children depends only on HI titer, the dynamics of individual protection are sensitive to pre-infection titers and differences in the magnitude of the acute boost post-infection. For both H1N1pdm09 and H3N2, we estimated substantial variation in the short-term titer dynamics after PCR-confirmed infection (see Supplementary Discussion). The variability arises both from stochastic variation in the magnitude of the short-term titer boost and from the antibody ceiling effect (Supplementary Tables 1 and 5). Protection in children wanes with a median half-life of ~7.1 y (95% quantile: (2.8, 8.8)) for H1N1pdm09 and 3.5 y (95% quantile: (1.4, 5.2)) for H3N2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>); thus, the duration of protection in children is similar to adults’ against H1N1pdm09, but shorter against H3N2.
