<p id="Par16">To estimate the duration of protection in adults, we simulated from the fitted models for each subtype. Using 1000 replicate simulations, we tracked the latent susceptibility after infection. For each individual at any time, this susceptibility is given by the weighted average of two components, one set by the titer and the other by the time since infection (Eq.
