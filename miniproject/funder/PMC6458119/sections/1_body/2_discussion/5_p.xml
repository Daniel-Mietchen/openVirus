<p id="Par28">Broadly, our results estimate several years of protection after infection with influenza A in children and adults, and suggest that this protection is associated with different immune responses, which are consistent original antigenic sin. These results underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the factors that determine the variable response to infection among individuals, and for better correlates of immune protection. They also underscore the utility of longitudinal cohorts and mechanistic models to investigate the dynamics of influenza.</p>
