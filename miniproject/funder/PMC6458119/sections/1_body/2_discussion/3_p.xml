<p id="Par26">We find minimal evidence that HA imprinting and heterosubtypic immunity affect susceptibility to infection. Previous analyses of HA group-level imprinting have suggested that imprinting reduces the rate of severe disease and death

If the model were estimating protection from symptomatic, medically attended infections instead, a stronger effect might have been supported. In the same vein, heterosubtypic immunity, for which there is good evidence
