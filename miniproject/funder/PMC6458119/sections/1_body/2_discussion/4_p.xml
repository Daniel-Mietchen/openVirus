<p id="Par27">This work has several limitations. We return again to the concept of heterogeneity. Though our models support substantial variability in the short-term titer boost after infection, our data lack multiple PCR-confirmed infections from the same people. Thus, we cannot distinguish the nonspecific variability at each infection

 </inline-formula> from consistent differences between individuals, which might be expected if people persistently target different sites on HA, NA, and other proteins. However, the statistically indistinguishable acute titer boosts in children and adults indicate that despite adults’ low baseline HI titers, we were not systematically underestimating their rate of infection. Although our results provide insight into differences between children and adults, we have obviously not modeled the evolving response in individuals over a lifetime, spanning infancy to old age. We thus cannot resolve how age-related phenomena interact with immune history to affect the response to infection.
