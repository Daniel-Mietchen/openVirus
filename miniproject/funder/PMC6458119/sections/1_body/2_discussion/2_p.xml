<p id="Par25">We estimated that protection in both children and adults wanes with an average half-life of 3.5–7 years, lasts longer against H1N1pdm09 than H3N2, and lasts slightly longer in adults compared to children against H3N2. These timescales are consistent with the estimated decay of immunity over 2–10 years due to antigenic evolution in population-level models

 </sup>. Responses may be more durable to H1N1pdm09 compared to H3N2, and in adults compared to children for H3N2, because the epitopes that are targeted are relatively more conserved. In contrast to adults, the dependence of protection on HI titer in children leads to substantial variation in susceptibility over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This heterogeneity may well extend to adults but is difficult to identify without much longer time series or other immune assays. The models’ tendency to overestimate individuals’ titer variation over time suggests that important differences between individual responses could be missing (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Longer observation periods and more complete observations of the immune response can help separate these factors from behavioral or environmental differences in infection risk.
