<p id="Par24">Our results suggest that protection against influenza A has different origins in adults and children. In children, the HI titer is a good correlate of protection, and infection durably boosts titers against H1N1pdm09. In adults, time since infection is more strongly correlated with protection than the HI titer, and infection is associated with small to no long-term changes in titer. HI assays primarily measure antibodies to epitopes on the top of HA, and not epitopes on the sides of HA or on the stalk. Thus, these results suggest that children tend to produce antibodies that target the head of the HA, which could mediate protection, whereas adults rely on antibody responses to other sites or potentially other forms of immunity for protection. This model is consistent with the concepts of antigenic seniority and original antigenic sin. Antigenic seniority refers to the phenomenon that individuals’ highest antibody titers to influenza are to strains that circulated in childhood

 </sup>, and original antigenic sin is the process by which antibody responses to familiar sites are preferentially reactivated on exposure to new strains

 </sup>. With time, these familiar sites may be the ones that are most conserved. On HA, these sites would tend to be away from the fast-evolving epitopes near the receptor binding domain, and would not be readily detected by HI assays. Consistent with this view, epidemiological studies have shown that levels of stalk-directed antibodies increase with age

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, and that vaccination with a partially antigenically novel influenza virus boosts responses to conserved sites, including the stalk
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. Our model shows that these differences are persistent and relate to protection. In adults, the time since last infection better correlates with protection than HI titer because their antibodies to the top of the HA head tend to be antigenically mismatched. Compared to children, more of their protection derives from other responses.
