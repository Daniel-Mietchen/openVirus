 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(0), depend on the time of most recent infection, which may have occurred before entry in the study. To initialize the latent states for each individual, we draw the time of the most recent infection from the density of subtype-specific flu intensity, 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>), in the seven years before the first observation. In this way, we account for known epidemic activity in Hong Kong before the beginning of the study (Supplementary Fig. 5). For children less than 7â€‰y old, the distribution is truncated at birth, and the density includes the probability that the child is naive to influenza infection. For sensitivity analysis, we fitted the models using other assumptions about the density from which we drew the time of most recent infection (see Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).
