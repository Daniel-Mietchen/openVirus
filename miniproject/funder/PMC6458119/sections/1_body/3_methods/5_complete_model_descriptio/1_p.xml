<p id="Par34">The model simulates the titer and infection dynamics for each individual. Briefly, an individual’s instantaneous infection rate or force of infection, 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>

  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>), is determined by the rate of exposure to infectious contacts in the community and household and by the individual’s susceptibility, defined as the probability of infection per infectious contact. Infections occur stochastically and can change the latent titers. Simulating the model generates a latent titer for each individual at each observation. The measurement model then calculates the likelihood of each observed titer given the contemporaneous latent titer. The log likelihood of the model under any set of parameters is then the sum of the log likelihoods across individuals, which are the sums of the log likelihoods across observations. The titer and infection dynamics are described in this section.
