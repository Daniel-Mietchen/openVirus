<p id="Par62">We calculate the probability that an individualâ€™s first influenza A infection was with a particular subtype (H1N1, H3N2, or H2N2) or that the individual was naive to infection at each year of observation. We assume that the first infection occurred between the ages of 6 months and 12 years, as infants are protected by maternal antibodies for the first six months of life
