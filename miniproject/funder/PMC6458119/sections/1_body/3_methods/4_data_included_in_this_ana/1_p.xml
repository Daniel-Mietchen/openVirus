<p id="Par33">We fitted models to HI titers from 706 individuals (including 114 children ≤15 y old at enrollment) from 337 different households that were not vaccinated as part of the study and reported no vaccination at any season during follow-up. We excluded individuals with any missing vaccination information. Individuals in this subset were sampled at a median of 6.6 months over a median 5.0 years of follow-up. Households ranged in size from 1 to 5 members (median = 2 members). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> gives the number of samples over the study among children and adults. Among children, the median age at enrollment was 11 y, and the age range was 3–15 y. Among adults, the median age of enrollment was 43 y, the age range was 16–77 y, and 89% of adults were between 25 and 55 y. We fitted sub-models to data from 50 individuals (including 29 children ≤15 y old at enrollment) with PCR-confirmed H3N2 infection and 78 individuals (including 42 children ≤15 y old at enrollment) with PCR-confirmed H1N1pdm09 infection (see Supplementary Discussion). No individuals had multiple PCR-confirmed infections. The data for this analysis are the date of the subtype-specific PCR-positive nasal swab and the closest titer measurements surrounding the positive swab. For H3N2, the median time between the pre-infection titer measurement and the PCR-positive swab was 5.3 months, and the median time between the PCR-positive swab and the post-infection titer measurement was 2.6 months. For H1N1pdm09, the median time between the pre-infection titer measurement and the PCR-positive swab was 2.4 months, and the median time between the PCR-positive swab and the post-infection titer measurement was 6.6 months. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> shows the number of PCR-confirmed infections by subtype in adults and children over time.
