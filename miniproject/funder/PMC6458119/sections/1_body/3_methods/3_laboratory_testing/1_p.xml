 </sup>. The antibody titer was taken as the reciprocal of the greatest dilution that gave a positive result. Sera from year 1 (2009–2010) and year 2 (2010–2011) were tested against A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009-like (H3N2). In years 3–5 (2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014), sera were tested against the same H1N1pdm09 strain and against A/Victoria/361/2011-like (H3N2). Sera from consecutive years were tested in parallel, such that duplicate titer measurements exist for sera sampled during the middle of the study. For this analysis, we used the first titer measurement obtained for any serum sample. Nose and throat swabs were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza A and B viruses using standard methods, as described previously
