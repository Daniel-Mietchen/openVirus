<p id="Par57">The titer and infection dynamics of each individual are modeled as a partially observed Markov process (POMP). The model for each subtype is a panel POMP object, or a collection of the individual POMPs with shared age- and subtype-specific parameters. We use panel iterated filtering (PIF) to fit the models
