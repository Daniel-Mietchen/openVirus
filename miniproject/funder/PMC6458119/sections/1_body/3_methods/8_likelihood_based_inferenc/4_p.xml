<p id="Par60">For each model, we initialize the iterated filtering with 100 random parameter combinations. We perform series of successive 50-iteration MIF searches, with the output of each search serving as the initial conditions for the subsequent search. We use 10,000 particles for each MIF search. The likelihood of the output for each search is calculated by averaging the likelihood from ten passes through the particle filter, each using 20,000 particles. We repeat the routine until additional operations fail to arrive at a higher maximum likelihood.</p>
