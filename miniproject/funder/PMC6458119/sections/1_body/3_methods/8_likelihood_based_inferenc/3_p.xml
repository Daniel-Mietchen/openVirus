<p id="Par59">Within each PIF iteration, filtering, or weighted particle re-sampling, occurs once for all observations from each individual. One PIF iteration is one pass of the weighted re-sampling over all individuals. Damped perturbations to the parameters occur between iterations. As the amplitude of the perturbations decreases, the algorithm converges to the maximum likelihood estimate
