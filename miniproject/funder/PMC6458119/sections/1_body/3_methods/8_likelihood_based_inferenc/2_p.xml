<p id="Par58">Iterated filtering uses sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate the likelihood of an observed time series. In SMC, a population of particles is drawn from the parameters of a given model to generate Monte Carlo samples of the latent dynamic variables. To evaluate the likelihood of a parameter set, SMC is carried out over the time series for each individual, generating a log likelihood for the corresponding panel unit. The log likelihood of the panel POMP object is the sum of the individualsâ€™ log likelihoods.</p>
