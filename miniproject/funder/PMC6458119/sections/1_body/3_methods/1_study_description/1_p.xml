 </sup>. The study tracked individuals in 796 households, each of which included at least 1 child aged 6–17 y that had no contraindications against the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). One eligible child 6–17 y of age per household was randomized to receive either a single dose of TIV or saline placebo, regardless of influenza vaccination history. In vaccinated individuals, sera was collected at baseline prior to vaccination (August 2009—February 2010) and 1 month after vaccination. In all individuals, sera was collected after enrollment in the autumn of 2009 and again each subsequent autumn, and each spring for at least 25% of participants. Participants were invited annually to continue enrollment. Individuals reported receipt of the influenza vaccine outside of the trial annually.
