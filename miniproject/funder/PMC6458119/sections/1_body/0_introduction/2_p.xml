<p id="Par4">A major challenge is uncertainty about the nature of acquired immunity. Antibodies are the primary means of protection against influenza and impose strong selection on its surface proteins

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Antibody responses to influenza are highly cross-reactive, in that antibodies induced by infection or vaccination with one strain often protect against infections with related strains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The hierarchical nature of this cross-reactivity, in which memory responses to conserved antigens tend to dominate over responses to new epitopes, is known as original antigenic sin

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. It might underlie the phenomenon of imprinting, in which primary infection with one influenza subtype protects against severe disease and death with other subtypes that are closely related phylogenetically
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. But the specificity and duration of protection after seasonal influenza infection have been difficult to estimate, partly because the relationship between antibody titer and protection appears complex, and also because longitudinal observations of antibody titers and infections are rare. The most common measure of anti-influenza antibody is the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and HI antibody titers are an established correlate of protection

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. The HI titer corresponding to 50% protection against infection, commonly cited as 40
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, although measurement error, long intervals between titer measurements, and variable titer changes after infection complicate inferences. Recent models have made progress by incorporating measurement error

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, and using titers to historic strains to measure the intervals between infections
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, attack rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, and the breadth of the response over time
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. But the relatively short periods of observation in these studies have made it difficult to estimate some basic quantities in the response to infection, namely, how long protection lasts, and whether antibody titers adequately reflect the strength of protection against infection in individuals over time.
