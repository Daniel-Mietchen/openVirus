<p id="Par5">Longitudinal cohorts provide relatively unobscured observations of the dynamics of infection and protection, and mechanistic models allow hypotheses about these dynamics to be tested. We fit stochastic mechanistic models to influenza antibody titers collected over five years from a large household cohort study including children and adults. These models account for pre-existing immunity, variation in the response to infection, and the possibility that the HI titer is not a good correlate of protection from infection. Their flexibility allows many previous assumptions to be relaxed. For both influenza A subtypes, we estimate the duration of within-subtype and cross-subtype protection, the relationship between HI titer and protection, and the effect of early childhood influenza exposures on infection risk later in life. The dynamics inferred from these individual-level models are remarkably consistent with the epidemiological dynamics of the larger population, and they also support immunological theory of how the antibody response to influenza changes with age.</p>
