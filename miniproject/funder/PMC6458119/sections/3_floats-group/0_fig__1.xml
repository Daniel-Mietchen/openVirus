  <p>Schematic of modeling approach. Steps 1 and 2 are performed for each subtype. Step 1: Model fitting. 
   <bold>a</bold> First, the sub-model of short-term post-infection titer dynamics is fitted to a subset of the data. This subset includes the time of PCR-confirmed infection and the immediate pre- and post-infection titers. The mean and standard deviation of the acute titer boost and the meanâ€™s dependence on pre-infection titer (the antibody ceiling effect) are fitted. 
   <bold>b</bold> Next, fixing the parameters associated with short-term titer dynamics (
   <bold>a</bold>), the full model is fitted to titers from the entire cohort. The contribution of HI-correlated and non-HI-correlated protection, the titer waning rate, the 50% protective titer, and the long-term boost after infection are estimated. Step 2: Model predictions and validation. 
   <bold>c</bold> The duration of protection and inter-epidemic protection are estimated from simulating population-level dynamics from the best-fit model in 
   <bold>b</bold>. From the latent infections and susceptibility for each individual, we track the loss of protection after infection. We also estimate the cumulative epidemic incidence and the odds ratios (OR) of protection between epidemics. 
   <bold>d</bold> Simulation enables additional checks of the model. We compare the simulated and observed distributions of 
   <italic>n</italic>-fold titer rises and coefficients of titer variation among individuals
