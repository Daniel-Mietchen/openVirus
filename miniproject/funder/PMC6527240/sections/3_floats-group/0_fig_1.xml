  <title>The typing tools’ web interface.</title>
  <p>The web interface provides users a portal to run classifications on their sequences and to visualize the classification results (A). The typing report presents information about the sequence name of the query sequence, the nucleotide length of the sequence, an illustration of the position of the sequence in the virus’ genome, the species assignment and the genotype assignment. A detailed report is provided for the phylogenetic analysis that resulted into this classification. All results can be exported to a variety of file formats (XML, CSV, Excel or FASTA format). The detailed HTML report (B) contains information on the sequence name, length, assigned virus and genotype, an illustration of the position of the sequence in the virus’ genome and the phylogenetic analysis section. The phylogenetic analysis section shows the alignment and constructed phylogeny: the query sequence is always shown at the top of the phylogenetic tree.</p>
