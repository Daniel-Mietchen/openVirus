  <p>Firstly (A), the viral species is determined using BLAST. When the submitted sequence is a 
   <italic>Zika virus</italic>, a Neighbor joining tree is constructed to determine the Zika genotype (B). When the submitted sequence is a 
   <italic>Chikungunya virus</italic>, a Neighbor joining tree is constructed to determine the Chikungunya genotype (C). When the submitted sequence is a 
   <italic>Dengue virus</italic>, the serotype is determined using another BLAST invocation (D). Based on the inferred serotype, a serotype specific Neighbor joining tree is constructed to determine the Dengue genotype (E, F, G, H).
