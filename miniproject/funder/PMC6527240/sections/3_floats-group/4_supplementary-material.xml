  <title>Recombination analysis for the DENV whole genome sequences.</title>
  <p>The bootscan results for the ten whole genomes of DENV that could not be classified at genotype level are shown. Boot-scanning analysis was performed using a window length of 1500 base pairs and a step size of 100 base pairs. The different colours represent the genotypes for each serotype. The X-axis represents the nucleotide position in the genome and the Y-axis represents bootstrap results in percentages. In total, 7 DENV-sero1 sequences were analysed and 1 sequence for each of the other serotypes, i.e. DENV-sero2, DENV-sero3 and DENV-sero4. We only found sequence AY496879 to be a recombinant of DENV genotype 3I and 3II. The other sequences are outliers (i.e. JF262783, KF744408, EF457905) or clades of outliers (i.e.: AF298807, KF864667 and KF184975 form an outlier clade; EU179860, KF289073 and JQ922546 form an outlier clade).</p>
