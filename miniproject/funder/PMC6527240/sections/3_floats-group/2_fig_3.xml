  <title>Investigating the suitability of sub-genomic regions for genotyping through boot-scanning.</title>
  <p>This plot was constructed using bootstrap results from Neighbor Joining trees (1000 bootstrap replicates), performed on the dataset of the indicated reference strains. The boot-scanning method uses a sliding window of a 1500 base pair segment that moves with steps of 100 base pairs along the genome. The X-axis represents the nucleotide position in the genome, and the Y-axis represents bootstrap support in percentages. The light-grey rectangular area marks the location of the envelope gene in each graph. The inset color code shows the genotypes defined in each virus species. For ZIKV (A), this is African and Asian. For CHIKV (B), this is Asian Caribbean (A-C), West African (WA) and East-Central-South African (ECSA). For DENV (C-F), the genotype is visualized by a Roman numeral. Only genotypes which showed less than 100% bootstrap support across the genome are shown.</p>
