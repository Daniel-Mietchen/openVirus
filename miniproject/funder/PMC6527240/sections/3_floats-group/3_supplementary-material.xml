  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the DENV-sero1 outliers.</title>
  <p>All full genome DENV-sero1 sequences were assigned to genotype-level using manual phylogenetic analysis and classification by the automated typing tool. In total, seven full genomes of DENV-sero1 could not be classified at genotype level by either classification method. These seven sequences are visualized in a phylogenetic tree of the WGS datasets, colored according to genotype. (1I in blue, 1II in green, 1III in red, 1IV in yellow, 1V in pink) It can be seen that a divergent cluster of six genomes (AF298807, KF864667, KF184975, EU179860, KF289073 and JQ922546 in black) form an outlier clade and one genome (EF457905 in black) can be considered an outlier. However, note that these seven genomes could be properly assigned to serotype 1.</p>
