  <title>Evaluation of the automated phylogenetic method to classify DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV whole-genome genomes.</title>
  <p>The new classification method consists of 2 parts: determining the species (and for DENV also the serotype) using a BLAST procedure, followed by determining the genotype using an automated phylogenetic method. Our method was able to assign all sequences in the whole-genome validation dataset to the right species and DENV serotype. Therefore, in this table, we focus on the classification performance with respect to genotype assignment, based on the output of the BLAST step (i.e. a dataset of the proper species and serotype). The classification results were compared to manual phylogenetic analysis. Column names: TP = total positives, TN = total negatives, FP = false positive, FN = false negative, SENS = sensitivity, SPEC = specificity, ACC = accuracy.</p>
