<p>A dataset of previously published envelope sequences from GenBank [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was compiled. This dataset consists out of 4,118 DENV sequences, 2,531 CHIKV sequences and 413 ZIKV sequences and contains DENV sequences for each of the four known serotypes: DENV-sero1 (n = 1688), DENV-sero2 (n = 1317), DENV-sero3 (n = 897) and DENV-sero4 (n = 216). The list of GenBank accession numbers for this global envelope dataset is available in the Supporting Information section (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007231.s008">S2 File</xref>). In the remainder of this manuscript, this dataset will be referred to as 
 <bold>Global-ENV</bold>.
