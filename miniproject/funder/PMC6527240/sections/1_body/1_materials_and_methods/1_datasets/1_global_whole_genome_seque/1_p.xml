<p>A dataset of previously published whole-genome sequences from GenBank [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was compiled. This dataset consists out of 4,118 DENV sequences, 653 CHIKV sequences and 413 ZIKV sequences and contains DENV sequences for each of the four known serotypes: DENV-sero1 (n = 1688), DENV-sero2 (n = 1317), DENV-sero3 (n = 897) and DENV-sero4 (n = 216). The list of GenBank accession numbers for this global whole-genome dataset is available in the Supporting Information section (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007231.s007">S1 File</xref>). In the remainder of this manuscript, this dataset will be referred to as Global-WG.
