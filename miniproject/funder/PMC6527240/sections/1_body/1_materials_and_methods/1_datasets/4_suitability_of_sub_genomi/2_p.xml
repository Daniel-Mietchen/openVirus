<p>The first was a boot-scanning method, using a sliding window approach exploring the range between 200 and 2,000 nucleotides. All windows across the genome were used for the construction of Neighbor joining trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The aim was to find the size and segments of the genome that would correctly classify a query sequence with a bootstrap support of &gt;70%.</p>
