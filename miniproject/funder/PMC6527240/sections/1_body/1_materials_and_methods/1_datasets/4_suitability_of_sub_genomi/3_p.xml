<p>The second method involved the calculation of the phylogenetic signal present in each of the DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV genes, using the same set of reference sequences. To compute the phylogenetic signal, the TreePuzzle software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] implementation of the likelihood-mapping method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] was used. Only between-genotype quartets were evaluated. Quartet puzzling essentially is a three-step procedure, first reconstructing all possible quartet maximum likelihood trees (maximum-likelihood step), then repeatedly combining the quartet trees to an overall tree (puzzling step), and finally computing the majority rule consensus of all intermediate trees giving the quartet puzzling tree (consensus step).
