<p>The initial step in the selection of reference strains for our method involved the identification of highly divergent but equidistant whole-genome sequences that are representative for the diversity within the different DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV genotypes, by screening all published complete genome sequences in our 
 <bold>Global-WG</bold> dataset. For example, we normally start by selecting 5â€“10 sequences that represent the diversity of each virus genotypes. Sequences that met these selection criteria were quality controlled for the presence of insertions, deletions, frame shifts and non-IUPAC characters using VIRULIGN [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For DENV, we used the reference sequences that are included with the VIRULIGN software, for ZIKV, we used the reference sequence presented in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and for CHIKV we constructed a new reference sequence from NC_004162 that we added to the VIRULIGN repository. Sequences that pass the quality control were aligned using MAFFT [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using PAUP* (i.e. Neighbor Joining), MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) and PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] using GTR+G+I. Sequences that gave consistent topologies using all three tree inference methods were retained as potential reference sequences (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Supporting Information</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007231.s003">S1 Table</xref>) and used in the next step of the evaluation process.
