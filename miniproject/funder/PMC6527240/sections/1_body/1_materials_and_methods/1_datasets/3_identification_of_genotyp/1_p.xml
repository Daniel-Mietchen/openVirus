<p>To identify the viral genotypes, a multiple sequence alignment was constructed with the MAFFT alignment software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] per virus species, using the 
 <bold>Global-WG</bold> dataset. Each alignment was edited manually until a codon-correct alignment was achieved in all genes. The next step in this exploration involved a phylogenetic analysis using PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood, 1000 bootstrap replicates) and MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. With this approach, four main DENV clades (i.e. serotype 1 to 4) and 19 genotypes (i.e. 1I, 1II, 1III, 1IV, 1V, 2I, 2II, 2III, 2IV, 2V, 2VI, 3I, 3II, 3III, 3V, 4I, 4II, 4III and 4IV) were identified. These findings are in agreement with the current consensus in DENV classification [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For CHIKV, three phylogenetic clades can be distinguished: The East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype, the Asian-Caribbean genotype and the West African genotype. The West African genotype being more divergent and less widespread than the ECSA genotype and the Asian-Caribbean genotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ZIKV, as well, can be classified into two genotypes. The African genotype, originally identified in Uganda in 1947 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], is found in many African countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Asian genotype was identified in Malaysia in 1966 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this genotype has recently caused the worldwide epidemic in Asia and the Pacific [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and is responsible for the epidemic in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
