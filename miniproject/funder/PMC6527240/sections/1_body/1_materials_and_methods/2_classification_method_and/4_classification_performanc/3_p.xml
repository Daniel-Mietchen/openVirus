<p>Each of the sequences considered for evaluation was assigned using both the gold standard and the here described automated method. The gold standard, a manual classification consists of performing an assignment using both Bayesian (i.e. MrBayes, assignment with posterior &gt; 90% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) and Maximum likelihood (i.e. PhyML, 1000 bootstrap replicates, assignment with &gt; 70% of replicates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) phylogenetic analysis. When the assignments generated by both the Bayesian and Maximum likelihood technique match, the classification is confirmed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
