<p>Our method involves a viral classification pipeline, drawing inspiration from the one described previously to classify HIV, hepatitis C virus and human T-lymphotropic virus sequences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The classification pipeline presented here consists of two classification components. The first classification component enables species and sub-species assignments. The classification analysis subjects a query sequence to a BLAST analysis against a set of reference sequences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A query is assigned to a particular type when BLAST reports an assignment with a score that exceeds a predefined threshold.
