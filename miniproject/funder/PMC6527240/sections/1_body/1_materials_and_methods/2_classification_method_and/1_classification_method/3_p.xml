<p>The alignment is produced using the profile alignment option in the ClustalW software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], such that the query sequence is added to the existing alignment of reference sequences. Subsequent to the alignment, a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree, with 100 bootstrap replicates, is constructed. The tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation, as implemented in the PAUP* software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The query sequence is assigned to a particular genotype if it clusters monophyletically with that genotype clade with bootstrap support &gt;70%. If the bootstrap support is &lt;70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned.
