<p>In case the submitted sequence was assigned either as ZIKV or CHIKV, a Neighbor joining tree is inferred to determine the respective ZIKV or CHIKV genotype. Only for DENV, another BLAST procedure is invoked to assign the serotype first. Based on the inferred serotype, a serotype specific Neighbor joining tree is constructed to determine the Dengue genotype.</p>
