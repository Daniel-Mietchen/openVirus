<p>The ArboTyping tool implements a classification pipeline that consists of a BLAST-based species assignment and phylogenetic assessment to identify subspecies (i.e. genotypes) with respect to a set of reference strains, as exemplified for other virus species by previous work [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To enable accurate classification, a set of reference sequences that cover the extent of diversity within species and subspecies, was carefully selected.
