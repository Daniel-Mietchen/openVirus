<p>There were, however, 10 sequences that could not be classified using the manual classification procedure: further analyses show that these 10 sequences consist out of 3 outlier sequences, 2 clades of outlier sequences (3 sequences in each outlier clade) and 1 recombinant sequence. As these outliers have been previously identified [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], these results need to be further investigated to assess whether these outliers form new genotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
