<p>In this manuscript, we focus on the classification of consensus sequences on the species and sub-species level. However, Genome Detective, the framework in which our tools are integrated, is also a virus discovery toolchain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Genome Detectiveâ€™s user interface allows users to supply raw next-generation sequence reads that can be automatically assembled into a consensus and passed to the ArboTyping tool. Details on the methods used to assemble reads in Genome Detective and an extensive validation using raw NGS reads can be found in [
