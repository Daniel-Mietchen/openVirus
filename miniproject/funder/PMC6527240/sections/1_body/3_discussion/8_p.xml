<p>In conclusion, the new method presented here allows the fast, accurate and high-throughput classification of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV species and genotypes. Species can be classified using different sequencing products (i.e. whole-genome sequences, envelope sequences and individual next-generation sequencing reads) and genotypes can be classified most confidently when using envelope sequences or whole-genome sequences. This method accommodates the need to consistently and accurately classify DENV/CHIKV/ZIKV sequences, which is essential to implement epidemic tracing and to support outbreak surveillance efforts. Additionally, we present a solid framework that has the potential to serve as the foundation for many other arbovirus classification tools. These tools are also useful to be integrated in data management environments [
