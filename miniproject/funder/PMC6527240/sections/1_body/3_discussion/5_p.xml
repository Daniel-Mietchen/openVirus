<p>However, whole-genome sequences are currently not routinely available and the suitability of the different genomic regions was evaluated with respect to their use for classification. Since the envelope gene is a popular target for phylogenetic classification, there is a large availability of envelope sequences in public databases. Therefore, the performance of the ArboTyping tool was evaluated on a large dataset of envelope sequences (i.e. 
 <bold>Global-ENV</bold> dataset). For these envelope sequences, a classification performance close to the toolâ€™s performance on whole-genome sequences was reported.
