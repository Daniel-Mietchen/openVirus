<p>Emerging infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens still represent a major threat to public health worldwide, as recently demonstrated by outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Yellow Fever virus. Fast and accurate real-time monitoring of outbreaks and surveillance of on-going epidemics is crucial to anticipate viral spread and to design effective prevention or treatment strategies. To this end, an accurate and reliable method for the classification of ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV arboviruses was developed: The ArboTyping tool.</p>
