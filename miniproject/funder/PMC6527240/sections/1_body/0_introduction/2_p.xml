<p>Monitoring virus genotype diversity is crucial to understand the emergence and spread of outbreaks, both aspects that are vital to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Both DENV and CHIKV epidemics are associated with a mortality and morbidity that puts a significant economic burden on the affected regions [
