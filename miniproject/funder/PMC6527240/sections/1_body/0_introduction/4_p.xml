<p>A new computational method for the identification of DENV/CHIKV/ZIKV sequences, with respect to species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype), is presented. The classification method is implemented in the Genome Detective software tool, which was validated on a large dataset by assessing the classification performance of whole-genome sequences, partial-genome sequences and products from next-generation sequencing methods. Furthermore, the suitability of different genomic regions for virus classification was evaluated.</p>
