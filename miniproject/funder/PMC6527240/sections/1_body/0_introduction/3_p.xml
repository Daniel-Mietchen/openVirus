<p>However, methods that consistently classify arbovirus sequences at the level of species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype) are currently lacking. Additionally, whole genome sequences are often not available in routine clinical settings, forcing the use of shorter gene sequences to classify at viral species or sub-species level. It has however insufficiently been explored which genomic regions are most suitable for accurate classification.</p>
