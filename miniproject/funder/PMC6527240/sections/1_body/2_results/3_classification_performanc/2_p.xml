<p>Only ten of 4118 DENV whole-genomes could not be classified at the genotype level, either by manual phylogenetic analysis or by our automated method. Notably, the seven sequences (AF298807, KF864667, EU179860, JQ922546, KF184975, KF289073, EF457905 of DENV-Sero1 were outliers in the phylogenetic tree (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Supporting Information</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007231.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We tested all ten sequences for recombination using boot-scanning (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec019">Supporting Information</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007231.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and the recombination detection program RDP4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007231.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We only found sequence AY496879 to be a clear recombinant of DENV genotype 3I and 3II. The two other sequences (DENV-Sero2 KF744408 and DENV-Sero3 JF262783) were also identified as a divergent outlier.
