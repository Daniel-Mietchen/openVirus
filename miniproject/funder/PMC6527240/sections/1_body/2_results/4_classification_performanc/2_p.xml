<p>For DENV, most of the genotypes were classified with great accuracy (i.e. specificity and sensitivity 
 <italic>&gt;</italic> 99%) using the envelope gene. The exception was DENV-sero2 genotype IV, of which 41 envelope sequences were available and for which 33 were correctly identified (i.e. sensitivity 80.49%, specificity 100%). The CHIKV sequences covering the E1 region were accurately classified for all three genotypes (i.e. 100% sensitivity and specificity). All the ZIKV envelope sequences were classified with 100% sensitivity and specificity. For a detailed overview of the DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV assignment performance refer to Supporting Information
