<p>Since a good phylogenetic signal was reported for the DENV and ZIKV NS5 region and the CHIKV E2 region, a classification analysis was performed for these regions as well. For the DENV NS5 region a sensitivity of 57,48% and specificity of 31,35%) was observed. Nearly all ZIKV NS5 sequences were correctly assigned to the African genotype (i.e. sensitivity of 97.72% and specificity of 100%). This indicates that the ZIKV NS5 region might also be used for genotype classification. For CHIKV, the E2 region showed perfect accuracy, similar to the E1 region (i.e. specificity and sensitivity of 100%). However, our previous boot-scanning support showed that the genetically variable E2 region may cause problems for some strains to be correctly identified as ECSA genotype.</p>
