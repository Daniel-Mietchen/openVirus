<p>For DENV, the only sub genomic region that supports confident genotype assignment across the four different serotypes was the envelope gene. For CHIKV, the envelope region E1 was the only region that allowed consistent assignment. The boot-scanning analysis showed that for ZIKV, segments of around 1,200â€“1,500 base pairs support the genotype assignment with bootstrap &gt; 70% (
