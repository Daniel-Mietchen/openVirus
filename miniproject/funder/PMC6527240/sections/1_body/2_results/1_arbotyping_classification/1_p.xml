<p>An efficient method to classify virus sequences with respect to their species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype) was developed. This method was implemented in Java and this implementation was integrated in an easy-to-use web interface. A detailed description of the method and its implementation can be found in the ‘Classification method and implementation’ Methods subsection.</p>
