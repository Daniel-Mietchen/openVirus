   <bold>A</bold>) Epidemic curve for the 2015TN outbreak, which was divided into six stages as labeled in the figure. The y-axis is log-transformed to show more clearly the incidence in in emerging stage (I) and illustrate exponential growing pattern in rapidly growing stages (II and III). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Estimated time-varying reproductive numbers through the course of the 2015TN outbreak. The curves denote the population-level
