 <sub>0</sub> = 1 as a useful threshold for ensuring the development of an outbreak, referred to as the epidemic threshold
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> and assessing the resources required to contain the outbreak, e.g., determining what proportion of people should be vaccinated
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for a possible outbreak in public health practice. The value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is estimated from the initial growth rate of an epidemic based on mechanistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. For example, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> has been estimated at approximately 1.5 for 2009 H1N1 influenza
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, at 3 for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, and at 12–18 for historical measles outbreaks
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. As an epidemic unfolds, however, the depletion and recovery of the susceptible population cause fluctuating effective transmissibility, so the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. Moreover, when an epidemic occurs in a realistic contact network, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> can also fail to characterize the transmission potential at the initial stage
