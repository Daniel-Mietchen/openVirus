Temporal weighting functions account for the fact that infected cases can only transmit the disease effectively within a certain time window (the generation interval). When only temporal weighting is considered, our method is equivalent to the renewal equation, assuming homogeneous mixing. The spatial weighting function, on the other hand, accounts for the decaying chance of transmission when the distance between individuals increases. The value of spatially adjusted

Data from dengue epidemics in southern Taiwan are used to demonstrate the ability of this method to identify early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission.
