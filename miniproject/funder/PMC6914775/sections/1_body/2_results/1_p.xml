<p id="Par20">The incidence of the 2015TN dengue outbreak are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>. The outbreak emerged in May with a handful of sporadic cases and finished the next January with a total of 22,784 cases. We divided the outbreak into six stages: emerging (I), growing (II and III), peak plateau (IV), and decaying (V and VI), to depict the spatiotemporal evolutions of the outbreak. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> shows the Adjusted

 </sub> of the outbreak. These 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> curves are median or mean estimates of the adjusted and non-adjusted individual reproductive numbers, summarizing the temporal evolution of population-level transmission potential. Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> provides further information: the shaded area represents the interquartile range (IQR) of adjusted individual reproductive numbers, reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential. In contrast, individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in Non-Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>. This indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential. The distributions of Adjusted

 </sup> in these stages are also multimodal and right-skewed, which indicates that some incident cases could have higher transmission potential (i.e. super-spreaders).
