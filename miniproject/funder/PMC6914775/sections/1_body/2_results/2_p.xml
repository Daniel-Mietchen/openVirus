 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> shows the spatial distributions of incident cases in these stages. We can identify the linkages between time-varying reproductive numbers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) and spatial-temporal distributions of incident cases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,C</xref>) in different stages. In the emerging stage, the irregular growth of Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> reflects the initial growth of the outbreak with a sporadic distribution of incident cases and a small emerging cluster (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Subsequently, in the growing stages (from stage II to III), the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>); the larger IQR of the individual reproductive numbers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). In the stage of peak plateau (stage IV), Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> dropped under the epidemic threshold (&lt;1), indicating that the outbreak was contained. The spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding. In sum, the time-varying reproductive numbers, Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> and Non-adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold. The Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> can further reflect the timing of epidemic expansion when the IQR of individual reproductive numbers increases.
