<p id="Par27">The effective reproductive number of dengue as estimated in past studies reflected an averaged overall epidemic trend, which did not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of transmissibility. Hsieh

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> estimated the effective reproductive number at the initial stage of the 2015TN outbreak to be 6.84, which is similar to our averaged estimates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Hsieh’s study also showed that Kaohsiung consistently possessed lower effective reproductive numbers (from 1.29 to 2.87), implying that Tainan city may have epidemiological characteristics, such as a lack of herd immunity, that make it more prone to dengue transmission than Kaohsiung. Internationally, Guzzetta

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> reported that the time-varying reproductive number of non-endemic urban cities in Brazil is much smaller than the estimates from Tainan and Kaohsiung cities (maximum

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
