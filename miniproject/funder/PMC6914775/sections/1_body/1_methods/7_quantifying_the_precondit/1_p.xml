<p id="Par18">To explore the phenomenon of spatial expansion, two types of spreaders are of interest: 
 <italic>early spreaders</italic> and 
 <italic>succeeding spreaders</italic>. Early spreaders are defined as those cases that trigger a new cluster (by introducing the disease into an unaffected area). There are usually few or no cases of the disease, and the cluster tendency is low until several early spreaders emerge. Succeeding spreaders are defined as those cases that were infected by early cases nearby. Although there is a clear distinction between the two spreaders in theory, most individuals lie on a spectrum between these two extremes. We have therefore quantified this property according to the clustering tendency at the location and time immediately before the emergence of that spreader. In other words, clustering tendency is used as the measure for the precondition of a dengue case, and the median clustering tendency is used as the cutoff to classify all dengue cases. If the precondition clustering tendency is higher than the median, the case is categorized as a succeeding spreader; otherwise, it is characterized as an early spreader.
