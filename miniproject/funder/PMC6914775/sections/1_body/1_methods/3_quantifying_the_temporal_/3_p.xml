<p id="Par12">Importantly, the generation interval, also known as generation time, is the period between the infection of an infector and the infection of its infectees. It is a fundamental parameter reflecting the natural history of pathogens. Since the generation interval may vary between individuals, it can be described by a probability distribution, 
 <italic>g</italic>(
 <italic>a</italic>), where 
 <italic>a</italic> is a time interval. Therefore, the function can be regarded as the transmission weight between a pair of cases whose observed generation interval equals 
 <italic>a</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The representation of transmission weight (also referred to as transmission likelihood

 <italic>g</italic>(
 <italic>a</italic>) is the basic component of the process of estimating effective reproductive numbers in the renewal equation and the following proposed method. The generation interval of dengue, in particular, is composed if four periods: host incubation, vector incubation, host infectious period and vector infectious period
