<p>Results from the EFAs indicated disparate factor loadings between young women and young men (see

 <xref rid="pone.0221554.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). After examining the gender specific factor loadings only 8-items remained for young women and 9-items for young men. Of the remaining items, six were the same for young men and women. Within the gender specific modified versions of the SRPS Cronbach alphas increased to 0.67 for young women and 0.70 for young men. Responses across the modified scales remained normally distributed. Gender-specific CFAs confirmed that fit indices were significantly better using modified scales among both young men and women (data not shown).
