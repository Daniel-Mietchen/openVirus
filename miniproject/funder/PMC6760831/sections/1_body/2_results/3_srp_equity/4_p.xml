 </bold> shows unadjusted and adjusted associations between a number of socio-demographic, sexual behaviour, and relationship practices. In unadjusted models among women, socio-demographic factors including having a higher education, living in formal housing, having no household hunger, having no children, having a longer relationship with their primary partner, and having an age-similar primary partner were associated with greater SRP equity. After adjusting for potential confounders, only higher education, length of relationship and age difference with primary partner remained. For men, age, living in Soweto, higher education and income were associated with SRP equity in unadjusted models. In adjusted models, only younger age, site (Soweto), and higher education remained associated with SRP equity.
