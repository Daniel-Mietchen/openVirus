 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. From November 2014 to April 2016, trained youth research assistants recruited participants through community outreach in areas where youth frequent (e.g. clinics, shopping areas, community centres). Recruitment in Soweto was conducted within the PHRUâ€™s HIV testing and counselling clinic, while in Durban study participants were recruited through a public clinic located near the MRU. Recruitment in Soweto occurred from November 2014 to April 2015, while Durban recruitment occurred from September 2015 to April 2016. Participants were followed-up at 3 months (Durban only), 6 months, 12 months and 18 months (Soweto only).
