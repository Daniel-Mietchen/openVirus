<p>Sexual relationship power equity was measured using a 13-item South African adolescent adaptation of Pulerwitz’ SRPS [

 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Using a 4-point Likert scale, participants were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with each scale item (‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’). Scale items were gender-specific with statements for women examining women’s perceptions of their primary partner’s controlling behaviours (e.g. “
 <italic>my partner expects me to do everything for him</italic>”), and similar to other South African studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], examined young men’s perceptions of their own controlling behaviour towards their primary partner (e.g. “
 <italic>I expect my partner to do things for me like my ironing and cooking</italic>”). For both young men and women, the SRPS score was summed across the 13 items with possible scores ranging from 13–52. Items denoting SRP inequities (e.g. 
 <italic>“My partner becomes jealous when I wear things that make me look too beautiful”</italic>) were reversed coded so that a higher SRP score denoted greater SRP equity. Consistent with guidance from Pulerwitz et al. 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we divided each participant’s total scale score by the number of items included in the scale, yielding a mean score for each participant. For participants with less than 2 missing responses, we imputed the median score for any missing scale responses. Note, only one missing response was noted for young women meeting the criteria to respond to the SRPS at the 6-month follow-up.
