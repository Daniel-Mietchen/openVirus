<p>We assessed whether SRP equity was independently associated with two HIV-risk factors, specifically condom use at last sex with primary partner and IPV (perpetration–men; experience–women). Experiences of IPV were assessed by asking young women if they have been threatened or physically hurt by their partners in the last 6 months, and men’s reported perpetration of IPV by asking if they threatened or physically hurt any partner in the last 6 months.</p>
