<p>We assessed 
 <bold>demographic variables,</bold> including age (16â€“25 years), sexual orientation (Lesbian, gay, bisexual [LGB] vs. heterosexual), housing (formal housing vs. informal housing [reconstruction development program (RDP) housing, shack, hostel or outdoors]), personal monthly income (Less than 400ZAR, 401 to 1600ZAR, and 1601ZAR or more), and any full-time, part-time, or self-employment at time of interview. Education was assessed by asking participants if they were currently in school or not and then what was or is the highest level of education they have achieved (less than high school, completed high school only, currently in school or completed some post-secondary). Participants reported if they have ever had children and if so how many (1 or more vs. none).
