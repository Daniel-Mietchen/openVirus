<p>After checking assumptions of normality, in order to assess the content validity of the scales we used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression to examine the crude and adjusted associations between a number of a priori factors that have been previously found to be theoretically and empirically associated with SRP equity among women and men and gender specific scales, adjusting for site, education, current employment and age. If the variable of interest (e.g. education) was being tested, models adjusted for all other potential confounders (e.g. site, current employment and age).

Data analyses were conducted using STATA version 13 [
