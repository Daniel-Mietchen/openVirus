<p>Findings from this study demonstrate the gendered nature of SRP equity and provide descriptive details into potential differences in relevant items for measuring the construct of SRP equity across genders. As such, future research needs to critically examine the gendered constructions of SRP equity, in order to accurately develop, validate and use appropriate measures within quantitative surveys. Moreover, in order to meet international targets aimed at improving the lives of young men and women globally, gendered determinants of SRP equity and pathways from SRP equity to important sexual health outcomes such as HIV need to be further explored using context specific measures informed by young people.</p>
