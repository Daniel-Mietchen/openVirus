<p>As expected, we also found that women with higher SRP equity were less likely to have been threatened or physically hurt by their partner in the last 6 months. Numerous studies among young South African women have found that women with lower SRP equity were more likely to experience IPV [

 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], we did not find an association between SRP equity and condom use with primary partners. Given that the SPRS asks specifically about respondentsâ€™ primary partners, the scale itself does not capture different forms of relationships (e.g. casual, transactional) that may have be more susceptible to SRP inequities and in turn reduced agency in condom use negotiation. In a 2016 South African study, Harrison and colleagues found that young women with higher SRP equity were less likely to use condoms. The authors hypothesize that young women with greater SRP equity may chose less risky primary sexual partners, and that within primary partnerships, the desire for intimacy and trust may influence condomless sex more than SRP inequities [
