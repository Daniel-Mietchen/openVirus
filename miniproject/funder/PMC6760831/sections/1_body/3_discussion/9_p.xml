 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], there is no published evidence describing the adaptation process. Within these studies there exists differences in the number of items used and no record of which items were included in the scale, making comparability across studies challenging. When using adapted versions of the SRPS as the primary exposure or outcome variable in a study we recommend that researchers include a list of the items included and detail any modifications that were made from the original scale asked within their survey. This would allow researchers to compare across studies which items may be best suited for measuring the construct of SRP equity within specific contexts. This transparency in measures should be further supplemented with additional mixed-method research that seeks to examine how SRP equity measures are perceived by young people in the current era. Creating capacity for youth insight may help to increase the internal consistency and validity of SRP equity measures within youth surveys, gender-transformative studies and programs. Furthermore, youth-engagement and insight into appropriate and relevant indicators is necessary for achieving the SDGs, including ending AIDS (SDG target 3.3) and gender-based violence (SDG target 5.2) by 2030, for young men and women within diverse contexts [
