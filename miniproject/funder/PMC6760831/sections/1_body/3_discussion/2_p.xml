<p>Of the total 13 SRPS items included in AYAZAZI, EFAs and CFAs indicated important gender differences in measuring the latent construct of SRP equity. For both young men and women many of the scale items had low factor loadings, and ‘questionable’ Cronbach alphas within the overall scales for young men and women, as well as the modified scale for women. Only the modified scale for young men resulted in an ‘acceptable’ Cronbach alpha (0.70) [

Low factor loadings indicate that some of the items included within the scale are potentially not accurately measuring the latent construct of SRP equity. Given that the items are being asked to a cohort of young people who are for the most part not living with their primary partners, items such as ‘I expect my partner to do things for me like ironing and cooking’, may be less relevant than for those who don’t live with their partner. It is also important to note that the wording for items across genders were at times quite different. For example, item 9 for women states “My partner always wants to know where I am” while for men states “I like to know where my partner is most of the time”. Item differences across genders, the use of absolute terms such as always and never (item 5), and cross-cultural interpretations may have resulted in participant confusion or misinterpretation. In conducting cognitive interviews on the SRPS among couples in Malawi, Conroy and colleagues found that respondents had difficulty distinguishing between real and hypothetical situations [
