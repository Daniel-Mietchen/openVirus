<p>Although internal consistencies for modified scales were higher for young men than young women, few of the factors tested against the scale were found to be associated with SRP equity for young men. Results indicate that SRP equity was greater among younger aged men, those with higher education levels, and those living in Soweto compared to Durban. To our knowledge no study to date has examine socio-demographic factors associated with the SRPS among young South African men, however previous research has found associations with lower education and increased likelihood of IPV perpetration [

 <xref rid="pone.0221554.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In our study, very few young men reported perpetrating IPV, as such this model had very low statistical power. As indicated by our findings, it may be the case that as men get older, they may begin to exert more controlling behaviours in their relationships. As such, future research among young South African men is needed to explore the ways in which SRP equity may function to reproduce behaviours that affect sexual relationship experiences at different ages. Moreover, programming aimed at fostering more positive gender attitudes and SRP equity for men should begin while they are young.
