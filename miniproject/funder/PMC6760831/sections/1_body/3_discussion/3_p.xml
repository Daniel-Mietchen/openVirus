<p>Context specific gender norms and the terrain of gender equity in South Africa may be why we found differences in factor loadings by gender. Items surrounding jealousy (e.g. “my partner gets jealous when I wear clothes that make me look too beautiful”) had the lowest mean SRP equity scores for both men and women, indicating that jealousy may be common and an important element of SRP inequity for young people in South Africa. The two items that loaded on the scale for women but not for men tended to be related to decision-making power inequities (e.g. “My partner has more to say than I do about important decisions that affect us” and “My partner lets me know that I am not his only girlfriend”), while the three items loading for men and not women were more related to surveillance (“I like to know where my partner is most of the time”, “I like my partner to be home when I come and check on her, “it bothers me when she is not there”, and “I am quite comfortable when my partner greats men she knows”). These findings are consistent with documented gender power dynamics within South Africa that emphasise how young men who struggle to obtain socially approved ways of achieving identity, often use control in relationships with women to achieve some sense of identity [
