<p>The findings from this exploratory study are the first to present gender-stratified descriptions of psychometric properties and validity of a SRPS for young South African women and men growing up in settings highly impacted by HIV. Although the AYAZAZI study took a youth-engaged approach, the studyâ€™s original objectives were not specifically related to SRP equity. As such, due to time and resource restraints we did not pilot and assess the SRPS with youth during the development of the survey. However, in conducting this secondary analysis on the validity of the SRPS within our cohort, we have identified a number of gaps in the current measure which we are currently exploring using qualitative follow-up interviews with AYAZAZI participants. The youth-engagement approach to the study was unique and allowed for participants and interviewers to build rapport over time, however it may also introduce some limitations. For example, reporting of sensitive questions including SRP equity, violence, and condom use may be subjective to social desirability and recall bias [

Given the cross-sectional nature of our study we are unable to determine a directionality of effect between SRP equity and explanatory factors. Although we adjusted our multivariate analyses for potential confounders that have been previously used to examine the validity of the SRPS within the development of the original scale [
