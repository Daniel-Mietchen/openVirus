<p>Our results highlight important gender differences in the functioning of a South African SRPS used within a youth-engaged HIV prevention study. EFAs and CFAs found that items loading onto the latent construct of SRP equity were different for young men and women, resulting in two gender-specific modified scales. Using these modified scales, we further found gender-specific associations with socio-demographic, sexual behavioural and relationship characteristics. Young women and men who were currently in school or who had completed some post-secondary education had greater SRP equity compared to youth with a less than high school education. For women being in an age-disparate partnership, and being with their primary partner for two or more years (vs. less than 12 months) was associated with lower SRP equity. For young men, the only other factor associated with higher SRP equity that was not associated with SRP equity for women was living in Soweto versus Durban. SRP equity was not independently associated with condom use at last sex with primary partners for young women or young men. However, young women with lower SRP equity were more likely to have reported experiencing IPV in the last 6 months.</p>
