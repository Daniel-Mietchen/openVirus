<p>In order to improve SRP equity for young women and men within the context of South Africa, we need reliable and valid measures that are grounded in the lived realities of youth who are disproportionately affected by HIV.

Given the gendered nature of SRP equity, we expected to identify important differences in factors associated with SRP equity by gender.
