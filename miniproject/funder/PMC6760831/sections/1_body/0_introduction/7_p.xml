<p>Within quantitative research, including gender transformative programming, a majority of studies examining the determinants and outcomes related to SRP equity have used a South African modification of Pulerwitzâ€™ 2000 SRP scale (SRPS) [

Important details of scale reliability and validity across genders is a key knowledge gap in understanding whether or not current scales are accurately measuring the construct of SRP equity within the lives of young men and women growing up in South Africa today. Recent evidence has described the adaptation and psychometric properties of the SRPS among young Kenyan women [

Moreover, no published evidence has examined the ways in which the construct of SRP, as well as scales used to measure these constructs, function differently for young South African men and women of the same age and within the same population. This includes details regarding the specific scale items used and the psychometric properties of these scales. These data gaps across studies utilizing different adaptations of the SRPS further limit cross-study comparisons, including the ability to make inferences on the effectiveness of gender transformative programming.
