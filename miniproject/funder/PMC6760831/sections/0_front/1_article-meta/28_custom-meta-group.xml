  <meta-value>Data are available on request. The de-identified dataset cannot be publicly shared as we do not have community or REB approval to do so. Data can be made available for researchers and trainees who meet criteria for accessing confidential study data. Criteria for accessing data are 1) being added as an AYAZAZI researcher or trainee to the SFU research ethics board application and 2) signing the AYAZAZI Data Sharing and Collaboration Agreement. Researchers interested in replication and/or verification of results may also qualify for accessing the data. Data requests should be emailed to 
   <email>AYAZAZIresearch@gmail.com</email>. All emails requests will be assessed by the AYAZAZI data access committee.
