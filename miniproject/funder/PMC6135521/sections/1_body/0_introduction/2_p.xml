<p>Zika infections have been reported in eleven of the twenty-five Peruvian departments [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]—both along the coast and in the Amazon basin—and in June of 2016, the first cases of Zika infection were reported in Iquitos, the capital of the Loreto region in the northern Amazon basin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There have been numerous health campaigns in Iquitos to control the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector and improve knowledge and preventive practices related to dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as all four serotypes have been circulating in Iquitos since 1990 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and now, Zika. The health campaigns include emergency fumigation, ongoing larvicide application, and health promotion focused on eliminating unused water containers that may become mosquito oviposition sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The local regional health authority has led public health campaigns to prevent Zika transmission (via radio, pamphlet, and billboards) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but these have not been prolific or remarkably different to existing dengue campaigns, and have not focused on the possible sexual transmission. Condom use is the recommended and most effective method for preventing Zika infection through sexual contact [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], particularly with recent evidence of the important role of sexual transmission of Zika and viral persistence in bodily fluids [
