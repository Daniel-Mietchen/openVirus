<p>Despite being aware of Zika in their community, a great majority of FGD participants reported no changes in their preventative practices. Furthermore, some of the preventative practices routinely used for mosquito control reported in FGDs were not effective for preventing the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector as these practices centered around preventing bites from nighttime biting mosquitos; this was consistent with findings from a survey-based study in Iquitos in 2015 that found that only 18.6% of participants knew that the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> bite during the day, despite years of dengue health promotion [

Despite low levels of knowledge about the vector, FGD participants were very knowledgeable about the symptoms of Zika and were able to distinguish Zika symptoms from those of dengue, mainly based on the type of rash. This was also consistent with dengue study findings that found low knowledge about the dengue vector and its transmission, but higher knowledge of dengue symptoms [

Based on suggestions from FGD participants, existing DIRESA teams that implement larviciding and fumigating campaigns could engage with household members and give short educational sessions during their routine house visits carried out at 3 month intervals. Our FGD participants were keen for new health information to prevent sickness in their homes and suggested that larvicide and fumigation teams are well placed to provide health education.
