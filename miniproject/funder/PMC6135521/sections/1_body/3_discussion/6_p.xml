<p>This article should be viewed in light of some limitations. The focus groups were completed until saturation was reached, but the sample size was small and only completed with women from one district of Iquitos. The response rate was not recorded; recruitment consisted of our local research assistant walking through a selected neighborhood in the district and recruiting women between ages 20–35 who were available to meet for the focus group at specific times. In order to elicit opinions on sexual and reproductive health from all participants, future studies could hold a small educational session following the FGDs and then discuss participants’ opinions on sexual health practices and preventative methods once they had acquired the new knowledge. This would have the added benefit of completing some community education sessions alongside data collection.</p>
