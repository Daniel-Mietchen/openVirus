<p>The FGDs were completed one year after the first confirmed case of Zika was detected in Iquitos, when the epidemic was at its end. While there was considerable concern about the possible microcephaly or neurological impact of Zika among public health officials, there have been no cases of Zika-related microcephaly reported in Peru to date [

In contrast, during the last major dengue outbreak (2010â€“2011), deaths and high hospitalization rates raised much concern among the population of Iquitos and were highly reported in the news and media. Whilst there was some media exposure to Zika, it was relatively scarce, and was not associated with fatalities or the severe birth defects observed in Brazil [

We found that the FGD participants were aware of the emergence of Zika within their region, making them feel at risk, but not fearful, of Zika. They may not be fearful because of the general mild symptom presentation of Zika that was observed in Iquitos (e.g., more rash, but less fever, than with dengue), because of a lack of understanding about the possible neurological effects of the virus, or simply because the communities are accustomed to similar arboviruses. A recent survey on Zika in Honduras revealed a similar lack of knowledge regarding association between Zika and potential neurological outcomes, as well as a low risk perception among the community [
