<p>In conclusion, our findings show that whilst individuals were able to identify some aspects of Zika, such as the symptoms and the mosquito transmission route, as well as the risks for fetal development, the knowledge regarding other aspects of Zika were limited, most notably the sexual transmission and the risk for neurological complications among adults. Perceived severity associated to Zika was consistently low within this study population, which may be partly due to the mild or delayed clinical presentation that was observed in Iquitos. Our findings reveal that the women in this study were especially receptive to health information, and keen to increase their knowledge in order to keep their families healthy. There is an opportunity to improve the knowledge within this at risk population regarding potential neurological outcomes, the sexual transmission pathway, and the most effective preventative methods. Further studies are needed to design and evaluate educational innovations to provide individuals in Zika prevalent regions with quality health information and practices to contribute to the prevention of infection during this epidemic.</p>
