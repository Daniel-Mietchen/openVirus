<p>The most common responses, stated in all six FGDs, regarding ways to prevent transmission of Zika virus were to use mosquito bed nets and to maintain general household cleanliness. Other reported methods used for mosquito prevention included use of mosquito coils and/or repellent, and emptying water containers to reduce breeding sites. One pregnant woman relayed the advice she had received at a talk at her local health post on preventing transmission of Zika, which included “
 <italic>not to have [sexual] contact without protection</italic>, 
 <italic>to take care of ourselves</italic>, 
 <italic>to sleep with a mosquito net</italic>, 
 <italic>to have a clean house</italic>.” When prompted, nearly all FGD participants reported that they had not changed their individual or household preventative practices in response to the Zika outbreak. A few women in each FGD explained that preventative practices were meant for general mosquito elimination, not to target a specific vector borne disease.
