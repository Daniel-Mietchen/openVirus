<p>When participants were asked to share their understanding of treatment for Zika, women mentioned that there “
 <italic>was nothing</italic>” that could be done and it was something “
 <italic>one has to fight with refreshments [keeping hydrated]</italic>.” Despite this, two or three participants in each FGD mentioned “
 <italic>paracetamol and chlorphenamine</italic>” (anti-histamine) as a common remedy for Zika infection. The refreshments refer to juices from local fruits including malba (a local plant), lemon, and coconut, primarily used for keeping hydrated and reducing fever. Many participants in three of the six focus groups also discussed covering body surfaces with malba leaves to lower body temperature. Healthcare seeking was rarely reported. One participant went to the health post and was diagnosed with Zika, based on clinical signs, without a blood test. Another pregnant participant described regular blood draws to check for Zika as a part of her prenatal care. However, the majority of women felt that symptoms were primarily controllable by using home remedies and paracetamol (available without prescription) as listed above, and hence, seeking healthcare was not common.
