<p>All participants from all FGDs knew that infected mosquitos transmit Zika virus, but only one or two participants from each focus group knew that the dengue and Zika virus vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, bites during the day. In fact, almost all respondents described the mosquito that transmits Zika to “
 <italic>sleep during the day</italic>” and “
 <italic>give problems at night</italic>.” Very few knew about the sexual transmission route: a few participants in three of the six FGDs mentioned this transmission mechanism. In one FGD, a woman suggested that Zika was transmissible through “
 <italic>sexual relations</italic>,” and the other women laughed and shook their heads in disagreement.
