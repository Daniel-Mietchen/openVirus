<p>Almost all focus group participants correctly and consistently named the most common symptoms, including rash, mild fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, and red eyes. In all of the FGDs, participants distinguished Zika by its distinctive rash or “
 <italic>welts</italic>” made up of individual bumps grouped tightly together, which spreads all over the body. The rash was noted as the most common way to differentiate Zika from other similarly presenting illnesses in every FGD. These symptoms were frequently compared to those of dengue fever without prompting from the facilitators. One participant described the differences: “
 <italic>it was similar to dengue</italic>, 
 <italic>but it was different</italic>, 
 <italic>because it covers you in welts</italic>, 
 <italic>it made you itchy and you felt a fever and the children could not sleep</italic>. 
 <italic>That was the difference</italic>.” When asked about duration of symptoms, responses varied, ranging from 3 to 8 days.
