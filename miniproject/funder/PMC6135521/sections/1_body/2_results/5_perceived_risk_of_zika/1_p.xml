<p>About half of the participants in each FGD knew someone who had experienced Zika virus infection; those who knew someone reported knowing this based on symptom recognition, most commonly the presence of the distinguishable rash. In Iquitos, some laboratory testing was done by the 
 <italic>Instituto Nacional de Salud</italic> (National Institute of Health), but diagnosis was also provided at local health centers without a laboratory diagnosis. A women voiced that there had been “
 <italic>a lot of Zika</italic>” and they [she and fellow Iquitos residents] felt they were at risk of Zika, but “
 <italic>the truth is that here in this area</italic>, 
 <italic>as it is a jungle area</italic>, 
 <italic>we are already accustomed to it</italic> [Zika]” because 
 <italic>“there will always be that little animal</italic>, 
 <italic>the mosquito</italic>.
 <italic>”</italic> And that they had learned not to be afraid of Zika, 
 <italic>“If we are afraid we will be self-conscious in the house</italic>: 
 <italic>I cannot go out</italic>, 
 <italic>I cannot go for a walk because Zika is everywhere</italic>.
 <italic>”</italic> The women explained that pressures of mosquito-borne illnesses, such as “
 <italic>going on a walk and suddenly feeling with discomfort that we can contract [Zika]</italic>,” was not a lifestyle they wanted to face. The women appeared to acknowledge the risk of Zika infection, but chose not to live in fear of something they could not control. The fatalistic attitude expressed by the participants was also evident in their head nodding and strong agreement with each other, as noted by the notetakers.
