<p>Participants expressed more concern for vulnerable populations, such as children and pregnant women, at risk for contracting Zika virus. Women feared more for children than other family members due to their perceived weaker immune systems and higher susceptibility to high fevers and other symptoms of Zika. When prompted to discuss gender differences relating to Zika, two groups suggested that women were more at risk for mosquito bites than men because their “
 <italic>defenses are a little lower</italic>” and they spend more time at home, while men are generally in air conditioned rooms at work or in more rural areas with a lower presence of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito. Although none of the participants reported knowing anyone with fetal complications from an infected pregnant mother, in five out of six FGDs, participants expressed concern for pregnant women exposed to Zika because of potential effects on fetal development including “
 <italic>small heads</italic>” and “
 <italic>missing limbs</italic>.” One pregnant woman said, 
 <italic>“It mainly affects the babies and the pregnant mothers</italic>…. 
 <italic>let’s say</italic>, 
 <italic>if they get Zika</italic>, 
 <italic>it can be risky for your baby</italic>. 
 <italic>That is</italic>, 
 <italic>it can be born with abnormalities</italic>.
 <italic>”</italic> There was awareness in five of the six groups of risks for developing fetuses, but no one mentioned neurological disorders associated with adults, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome.
