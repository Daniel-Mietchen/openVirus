<p>A codebook was developed prior to data collection based on themes included in the guide. Once the team had reached saturation—the point where the same topics are emerging in each group [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]–on the main themes being explored, the codebook was edited to reflect additional identified topics. Two researchers coded the discussions using Dedoose version 7.6.13, a web application for managing, analyzing, and presenting qualitative and mixed method research data [
