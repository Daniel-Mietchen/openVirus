<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a local non-governmental organization, Asociación Benéfica PRISMA (CE1425.17), and Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (#1040307). Since the FGD with each group of women would only be carried out once and there was no reason to document the participants’ names except if we used a written informed consent, the two IRBs approved the use of verbal consent for participants. Prior to starting the FGDs, all participants gave verbal informed consent to participate and to be audio-recorded. All participants were provided with a copy of the consent document, which included contact information for the IRBs and the PI of the project. All members of the research team completed human subjects training.</p>
