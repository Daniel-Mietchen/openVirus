<p>Iquitos is the most populated city of the Peruvian Amazon basin (population of 545, 000) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006708.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], because Punchana has been previously identified as the district in Iquitos where dengue outbreaks start and having the highest dengue seroprevalence rates overall [

There are no cases to date of neurological disease in Peru as a direct cause of Zika, however surveillance remains critical [
