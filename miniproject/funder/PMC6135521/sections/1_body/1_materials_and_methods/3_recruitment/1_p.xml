<p>Because of our interest in focusing on women’s knowledge and preventive practices, particularly during childbearing years, and because women are more likely to discuss certain topics, such as family planning, in a single sex setting, only women were recruited for FGDs. Purposive sampling was used to recruit women from the Punchana district. This region was selected as there are affiliated research projects in this district and there is known dengue and Zika transmission. Women of prime childbearing years (20–35) were approached near their homes by a local field worker who has worked in this district before and invited those who met inclusion criteria of age and gender, and who were available at the time, to participate in the FGDs. Once enough women were recruited for the FGDs, recruitment stopped. The research team covered transportation costs to and from the FGD sites.</p>
