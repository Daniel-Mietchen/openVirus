 <p>Zika virus is an arthropod-borne viral disease that has recently caused epidemics in many Latin American countries and is associated with adverse neurologic outcomes and fetal complications. Although the infection is typically mosquito-transmitted, infection is also possible via sexual transmission. This study uses focus group discussions to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices of women of childbearing age at risk for Zika in Iquitos, Peru, where Zika had arrived one year earlier (in 2016). We found that most women knew Zika is transmitted via mosquitoes, but few knew it could also be transmitted through sex. We also found that women were aware about the link between Zika and newborn microcephaly, but none mentioned the possible neurologic impact on adults. We also found that very few women had changed their behaviors to prevent getting infected with Zika. By identifying gaps in Zika knowledge, attitudes, and prevention methods, we can improve health promotion and ensure the preventive messages are relevant for those most at risk.</p>
