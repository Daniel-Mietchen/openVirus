2,PMC7080275,understanding the transition of epidemic to endemic dengue transmission remains a challenge in regions where serotypes co circulate and there is extensive human mobility  french polynesia  an isolated group of 117 islands of which 72 are inhabited  distributed among five geographically separated subdivisions  has recorded mono serotype epidemics since 1944  with long inter epidemic periods of circulation  laboratory confirmed cases have been recorded since 1978  enabling exploration of dengue epidemiology under monotypic conditions in an isolated  spatially structured geographical location  a database was constructed of confirmed dengue cases  geolocated to island for a 35 year period  statistical analyses of viral establishment  persistence and fade out as well as synchrony among subdivisions were performed  seven monotypic and one heterotypic dengue epidemic occurred  followed by low level viral circulation with a recrudescent epidemic occurring on one occasion  incidence was asynchronous among the subdivisions  complete viral die out occurred on several occasions with invasion of a new serotype  competitive serotype replacement has been observed previously and seems to be characteristic of the south pacific  island population size had a strong impact on the establishment  persistence and fade out of dengue cases and endemicity was estimated achievable only at a population size in excess of 175 000  despite island remoteness and low population size  dengue cases were observed somewhere in french polynesia almost constantly  in part due to the spatial structuration generating asynchrony among subdivisions  long term persistence of dengue virus in this group of island populations may be enabled by island hopping  although could equally be explained by a reservoir of sub clinical infections on the most populated island  tahiti  dengue virus is the most significant arthropod borne virus infecting man  understanding how long dengue virus can persist in populations of varying size is key to understanding its epidemiology  this is  however  impossible to achieve in settings where dengue is endemic  because of continued human movement and is further complexified by the occurrence of several co circulating serotypes  by contrast  french polynesia  an isolated group of 72 inhabited islands in the south pacific  has had intermittent majoritarily monotypic dengue epidemics since the 1940s and offers a unique opportunity to address questions of viral persistence  turnover and the importance of spatial sub structure in determining dengue epidemiology  collating and analyzing a database of laboratory confirmed dengue cases from across french polynesia over a 35 year period we were able to show that dengue virus die out can occur with or without replacement by a new serotype  monotypic transmission of dengue viruses fails to be maintained within small island populations but can persist for years among isolated islands connected via air and sea links  this remarkable long term persistence of dengue virus in french polynesia could be maintained by asynchronous viral transmission among connected islands and or by repeated seeding from a reservoir of sub clinical infections in the most populated island  tahiti
3,PMC7194918,the recent global pandemic created by the coronavirus sars cov 2  started in wuhan  china in december 2019  has generated panic  both in term of human death  4 5  of infected patients identified through testing  and the global economy  human sufferings seem to be continuing  and it is not clear how long this will continue and how much more destruction it is going to cause until complete control is achieved  one of the most disturbing issues is covid 19 treatment  although a large number of medications  previously used successfully with other viruses  including chinese herbal medicines and anti malaria drugs   are under consideration  there remain questions as to whether they can play a satisfactory role for this disease  global attempts are ongoing to find the drugs for the treatment of this virus but none of the antiviral drugs used for treatment of other human viral infection is working and hence attempts to find new drugs are continuing  here the author is proposing that 5 fluorouracil  5 fu  which when used on its own is failing as an antiviral agent due to the removal of this compound by proof reading ability exceptionally found in coronaviruses  the author here is proposing to test 5 fu in combination with a number of deoxynucleosides on animal models infected with this covid 19  should encouraging results ensue  therapies could then be tried on patients
4,PMC7258708,discriminating between patients with microbial infections that cause secondary immune effects from those with the same infection who have primary immune deficiency disease can be difficult  there are many microbes that temporarily  stun  innate and or adaptive immunity during a primary infection  the common result of temporary inhibition  or permanent depletion of host immunity during some primary infections is the development of superinfections of other microbes that cause significant morbidity  and on occasion  mortality  in addition  microbes that cause persistent infection  such as the human immune deficiency virus  deplete effective immunity over time and can also lead to secondary infections with other microbes ultimately leading to death if not appropriately treated  in some cases  such as influenza virus infection  mortality can be dramatic due in large part to acquired secondary bacterial infections  many microbes manipulate host immunity and thereby inhibit the ability of patients to combat secondary microbial infections  the overall survival of patients primarily infected with some viruses  parasites  or bacteria  is closely linked to the ability of secondary infections to take advantage of the immune modulation induced by the primary infection  herein we discuss some of the secondary immune defects caused by select viruses  measles  influenza  hiv1  htlv   parasites   leishmania  malaria   and bacteria

6,PMC7122469,acute respiratory infection  ari  is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide  aris are caused primarily by viruses and bacteria that are often co detected in respiratory specimens  although viral bacterial co infections are frequently reported in children with ari  their clinical significance and the mechanisms leading to ari are not well understood  the respiratory tract is a reservoir of a diverse community of microorganisms  including both commensals and potential pathogens and there is growing evidence that the interactions between viruses and bacteria play a key role in the development of ari  a better understanding of the interactions between viruses and bacteria in the respiratory tract may enhance insight into the pathogenesis of ari  and potentially reveal new prevention and treatment strategies  this chapter summarizes the current knowledge on viruses  bacteria and viral bacterial interactions in childhood ari and the possible mechanisms by which these interactions may lead to disease
7,PMC7150051,within the ecosystems  the balance is important since the populations maintain their size and the food habits that are constant over time  in contrast  the disappearance of natural sources or the alteration of habitat at different levels can cause major changes in the very structure of the ecosystem  alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming  climatic changes  which together with globalization  increased trade  the shortening of distances thanks to transport  the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances  in many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes  which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance  different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses  currently  some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors  such as dengue virus  zika virus  and chikungunya virus  have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations  it is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the united states and the european union with a great impact on public health  the clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome  encephalitis  hemorrhagic fever  and even death  vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects  such as mosquitoes and ticks  wild birds are reservoirs for the west nile virus  small wild mammals such as rodents  bats  and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses  and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown
8,PMC7107203,in december 2019  several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in wuhan  china  on 7 january 2020  the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus  later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus  2019 ncov   genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019 ncov homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus  as of 29 january 2020  the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in china and 77 patients in other countries  it is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019 ncov can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact  this finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread  the clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections  making it difficult to diagnose  given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals  it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible or the virus may cause a serious pandemic  therefore  a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus  in this article  we present such an approach to managing 2019 ncov related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at west china hospital in chengdu  china

10,PMC7155909,patients with covid 19 may require intubation and critical care management  this comprehensive review summarizes management recommendations in critical care and perioperative settings  based on current understanding of coronavirus biology and acute respiratory distress syndrome pathophysiology  healthcare systems worldwide are responding to coronavirus disease 2019  covid 19   an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  sars cov 2  virus  patients with covid 19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure  necessitating intubation and intensive care management  healthcare providers  and particularly anesthesiologists  are at the frontline of this epidemic  and they need to be aware of the best available evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with covid 19 and to keep themselves safe while doing so  here  the authors review covid 19 pathogenesis  presentation  diagnosis  and potential therapeutics  with a focus on management of covid 19 associated respiratory failure  the authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics  treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome  and recent publications on covid 19  as well as guidelines from major health organizations  this review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with covid 19
11,PMC7300956,this article is protected by copyright  all rights reserved  global powerhouses with tried and tested health systems have struggled to contain the covid 19 pandemic  one is left to wonder what will be left of africa  the second most populous continent after asia  which is torn by civil wars  hunger  and diseases like aids and tb and  in recent years  the ebola virus disease  evd   the majority of countries  health systems  already dependent on donor aid  are ill equipped and under resourced to deal with the raging pandemic  there is a lack of isolation and intensive care infrastructure  ventilators  and financial resources to bankroll the fight against covid 19 pandemic  however  there is some cause for optimism  for example  in west africa where infrastructure like diagnostic testing facilities  intensive care units  surveillance  and systems for reporting emergencies used during the evd outbreak of 2013 2016 can be leveraged to fight the covid 19 pandemic  further  a number of african countries have responded swiftly by activating the necessary political and financial tools to combat the pandemic  technical support from continental bodies like the africa centres for disease control and global development partners has improved the capacity of the continent to handle the pandemic  in this article  the authors unpack  review  and share a perspective on africa s capacity to contain and control the covid 19 pandemic and review the current response
12,PMC7245076,dengue virus  denv  is a global health threat  causing repeated epidemics throughout the tropical world  while low herd immunity levels to any one of the four antigenic types of denv predispose populations to outbreaks  viral genetic determinants that confer greater fitness for epidemic spread is an important but poorly understood contributor of dengue outbreaks  here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 denv2 outbreak in puerto rico  we found that five amino acid substitutions in the ns5 protein reduced viral genomic rna  grna  replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus rna  sfrna   a byproduct of host 5  3  exoribonuclease activity  the resulting increase in sfrna relative to grna levels not only inhibited type i interferon  ifn  expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism  but also enabled sfrna to compete with grna for packaging into infectious particles  we suggest that delivery of sfrna to new susceptible cells to inhibit type i ifn induction before grna replication and without the need for further de novo sfrna synthesis could form a  preemptive strike  strategy against denv  dengue affects approximately one half of the world s population  while it causes regular and cyclical outbreaks throughout the tropical world  the molecular mechanisms that determine its epidemic potential remain poorly defined  the present work provides insight into the molecular determinants of epidemiologic fitness  which is critical for surveillance to identify dengue virus strains with a potential to cause outbreaks  this will allow for better implementation of control measures to intercept impending outbreaks before many lives are affected
13,PMC6919591,since 2009  syphilis has been increasing in new york state  nys  excluding new york city  nyc  among men with a history of male to male sexual contact  msm   because msm make up a disproportionate number of new hiv infections  this study aims to  1  establish yearly rates of early syphilis diagnosis  2  assess factors associated with early syphilis diagnosis  and 3  describe missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis of syphilis among msm living with diagnosed hiv msmlwdh  in nys  excluding nyc  a cohort of adult msmlwdh alive in 2013 were followed through 2016 to identify individuals with at least one early syphilis diagnosis between july 2014 and december 2016  early syphilis diagnosis rates were calculated for 2015 and 2016  crude relative risks and 95  confidence intervals were calculated to determine associations between available covariates and both syphilis diagnosis and missed opportunities  missed opportunities were defined as reports of an hiv related laboratory test within a given window corresponding to syphilis staging where syphilis testing was not performed at the same time  of 7 512 msmlwdh  50 0  were non hispanic white  85 4  aged  35  and 320 4 3   had an early syphilis diagnosis  yearly rates were  1 838 100 000  and 1 681 100 000 in 2015 and 2016  respectively  persons who were non hispanic black  living with diagnosed hiv for less than three years  aged  45  and were always virally suppressed or always in hiv care were significantly more likely to have a syphilis diagnosis  over half of individuals had evidence of a missed opportunity for earlier syphilis diagnosis  syphilis stage at diagnosis  older age  and syphilis diagnosis not concurrent with an hiv related laboratory test were associated with a higher likelihood of having a missed opportunity  this study supports high interrelatedness of the syphilis and hiv epidemics among msm  since syphilis can impact hiv viral load suppression status  efforts to end the hiv epidemic need to be coupled with syphilis elimination efforts

15,PMC7263071,by 21st may 2020  sars cov 2 had caused more than 5 million cases of covid 19 across more than 200 countries  most countries with significant outbreaks have introduced social distancing or  lockdown  measures to reduce viral transmission  so the key question now is when  how  and to what extent  these measures can be lifted  data from multiple countries show that current restrictions on behaviour barely contain the spread of covid19  resuming 20  of the currently excluded contact between individuals looks sufficient to restart the epidemic s progression in many countries  publically available data  on daily numbers of newly confirmed cases and mortality  were used to fit regression models estimating trajectories  doubling times and the reproduction number  r  the estimates of r  intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity  these data suggest that few countries could have even 1 week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic  similarly  restoring 20  of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries
16,PMC6988270,genomic surveillance during ebolavirus outbreaks to elucidate transmission chains and develop diagnostic tests is delayed by the laborious development of variant specific laboratory assays  we developed a new protocol combining 31 parallel pcr assays with illumina minion based sequencing  allowing generic ebolavirus genomic surveillance  validated using cell culture derived ebola  reston  sudan and ta  forest virus at concentrations compatible with patient viral loads  our approach enables pre emptive genomic surveillance of ongoing and future ebolavirus outbreaks irrespective of variant divergence

20,PMC7265527,here  the authors implement a mathematical model that describes how baloxavir antiviral induced inhibition of influenza virus replication in infected individuals affects the spread of the virus during epidemics  suggesting that both the scaling up and acceleration of treatment would avert substantial influenza morbidity and mortality every year  influenza viruses annually kill 290 000 650 000 people worldwide  antivirals can reduce death tolls  baloxavir  the recently approved influenza antiviral  inhibits initiation of viral mrna synthesis  whereas oseltamivir  an older drug  inhibits release of virus progeny  baloxavir blocks virus replication more rapidly and completely than oseltamivir  reducing the duration of infectiousness  hence  early baloxavir treatment may indirectly prevent transmission  here  we estimate impacts of ramping up and accelerating baloxavir treatment on population level incidence using a new model that links viral load dynamics from clinical trial data to between host transmission  we estimate that  22 million infections and  6 000 deaths would have been averted in the 2017 2018 epidemic season by administering baloxavir to 30  of infected cases within 48 h after symptom onset  treatment within 24 h would almost double the impact  consequently  scaling up early baloxavir treatment would substantially reduce influenza morbidity and mortality every year  the development of antivirals against the sars cov2 virus that function like baloxavir might similarly curtail transmission and save lives

108,PMC6711314,the critical step in the emergence of a new epidemic or pandemic viral pathogen occurs after it infects the initial spillover host and then is successfully transmitted onwards  causing an outbreak chain of transmission within that new host population  crossing these choke points sets a pathogen on the pathway to epidemic emergence  while many viruses spill over to infect new or alternative hosts  only a few accomplish this transition and the reasons for the success of those pathogens are still unclear  here  we consider this issue related to the emergence of animal viruses  where factors involved likely include the ability to efficiently infect the new animal host  the demographic features of the initial population that favour onward transmission  the level of shedding and degree of susceptibility of individuals of that population  along with pathogen evolution favouring increased replication and more efficient transmission among the new host individuals  a related form of emergence involves mutations that increased spread or virulence of an already known virus within its usual host  in all of these cases  emergence may be due to altered viral properties  changes in the size or structure of the host populations  ease of transport  climate change or  in the case of arboviruses  to the expansion of the arthropod vectors  here  we focus on three examples of viruses that have gained efficient onward transmission after spillover  influenza a viruses that are respiratory transmitted  hiv  a retrovirus  that is mostly blood or mucosal transmitted  and canine parvovirus that is faecal oral transmitted  we describe our current understanding of the changes in the viruses that allowed them to overcome the barriers that prevented efficient replication and spread in their new hosts  we also briefly outline how we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and variability in order to better anticipate these events in the future  this article is part of the theme issue  dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover
109,PMC7115234,there is increasing interest in the development of new   universal  influenza vaccines  uivs  that  unlike current vaccines  are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains  as well as against novel pandemic viruses  while the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of uivs  it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences  using mathematical modelling  we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences  first  by reducing the amount of infection induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it  a seasonal uiv programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination  second  the more successful a future uiv programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza  the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant  these risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future uiv vaccine  namely  the use of a combined vaccine formulation  incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets  and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection induced immunity  in the absence of large scale trials of uivs  disease dynamic models can provide helpful  early insights into their potential impact  in future  data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches

347,PMC7193772,understanding the dynamics of pathogen transfer in aquaculture systems is essential to manage and mitigate disease outbreaks  the goal of this study was to understand recent transmission dynamics of salmonid alphavirus  sav  in norway  sav causes significant economic impacts on farmed salmonids in european aquaculture  sav is classified into six subtypes  with norway having ongoing epidemics of sav subtypes 2 and 3  these two viral subtypes are present in largely distinct geographic regions of norway  with sav2 present in trondelag  sav3 in rogaland  sogn og fjordane  and hordaland  and m re og romsdal having outbreaks of both subtypes  to determine likely transmission routes of norwegian sav an established nanopore amplicon sequencing approach was used in the current study  after confirming the accuracy of this approach for distinguishing subtype level co infections of sav2 and sav3  a hypothetical possibility in regions of neighboring epidemics  twenty four sav3 genomes were sequenced to characterize the current genetic diversity of sav3 in norwegian aquaculture  sequencing was performed on naturally infected heart tissues originating from a range of geographic locations sampled between 2016 and 2019  phylogenetic analyses revealed that the currently active sav3 strains sampled comprise several distinct lineages sharing an ancestor that existed  15 years ago  95  hpd  12 51 17 7 years  and likely in hordaland  at least five of these lineages have not shared a common ancestor for 7 85 years  95  hpd  5 39 10 96 years  or more  furthermore  the ancestor of the strains that were sampled outside of hordaland  sogn of fjordane and rogaland  existed less than 8 years ago  indicating a lack of long term viral reservoirs in these counties  this evident lack of geographically distinct subclades is compatible with a source sink transmission dynamic explaining the long term movements of sav around norway  such anthropogenic transport of the virus indicates that at least for sink counties  biosecurity strategies might be effective in mitigating the ongoing sav epidemic  finally  genomic analyses of sav sequences were performed  offering novel insights into the prevalence of sav genomes containing defective deletions  overall  this study improves our understanding of the recent transmission dynamics and biology of the sav epidemic affecting norwegian aquaculture
348,PMC7182526,recently  a novel coronavirus  sars cov 2  coronavirus disease 2019  covid 19  has emerged  rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community  many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies  where early diagnosis of covid 19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population  thus  rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain covid 19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future  immediately after its initial characterization  chinese and american centers for disease control and prevention  cdcs  rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of covid 19  mostly employing real time polymerase chain reaction  rt pcr  methods  however  such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts  requiring upwards of 4 8 h to process  these requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests  loop mediated isothermal amplification  lamp  is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid  and do not require expensive reagents or instruments  which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection  studies have shown the successful application of lamp assays in various forms to detect coronavirus rna in patient samples  demonstrating that 1 10 copies of viral rna template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection   100 fold more sensitive than conventional rt pcr methods  importantly  studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of lamp methodology in the detection of sars cov 2 rna at significantly low levels  particularly following numerous improvements to lamp assay protocols  we hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced lamp protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of covid 19  without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results  herein  we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings  to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating  we hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly  and confirmed for viability with clinical samples  before being rolled out for mass diagnostic testing in these current times
349,PMC7284455,the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  sars cov 2  emerged in wuhan  china and rapidly spread worldwide  with a vast majority of confirmed cases presenting with respiratory symptoms  potential neurological manifestations and their pathophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly established  in this narrative review  we sought to present the neurological manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019  covid 19   case reports  case series  editorials  reviews  case control and cohort studies were evaluated  and relevant information was abstracted  various reports of neurological manifestations of previous coronavirus epidemics provide a roadmap regarding potential neurological complications of covid 19  due to many shared characteristics between these viruses and sars cov 2  studies from the current pandemic are accumulating and report covid 19 patients presenting with dizziness  headache  myalgias  hypogeusia and hyposmia  but also with more serious manifestations including polyneuropathy  myositis  cerebrovascular diseases  encephalitis and encephalopathy  however  discrimination between causal relationship and incidental comorbidity is often difficult  severe covid 19 shares common risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases  and it is currently unclear whether the infection

351,PMC7225364,zoonotic infections are an imminent threat to human health  pangolins were recently identified as carriers and intermediate hosts of coronaviruses  previous research has shown that infection with coronaviruses activates an innate immune response upon sensing of viral rna by interferon induced with helicase c domain 1  ifih1   also known as mda5  here  we performed a comparative genomics study of rna sensor genes in three species of pangolins  ddx58 rig i  a sensor of cytoplasmic viral rna and toll like receptors  tlr  3  7  and 8  which bind rna in endosomes  are conserved in pangolins  by contrast  ifih1 a sensor of intracellular double stranded rna  has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins  likewise  z dna binding protein  zbp1   which senses both z dna and z rna  has been lost during the evolution of pangolins  these results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals  including humans  we put forward the hypothesis that loss of ifih1 and zbp1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins
352,PMC7236586,the aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about sars cov 2 infection and covid 19 disease in pregnant women  because the epidemic began in china  most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there  the studies used to prepare this review article are the first non randomized studies containing small groups of examined women  they do not provide clear indications  but show that in an epidemic situation  special care should be taken in pregnancy management  making decisions about termination of pregnancy  and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences  further analysis is needed on the incidence of covid 19 among pregnant women and its consequences  this will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies  during any epidemic of infectious diseases  pregnant women constitute an extremely sensitive group due to altered physiology and immune functions  and thus altered susceptibility to infection  with regard to the management of pregnant covid 19 patients  in addition to the treatment of the infection itself  which is not that different from generally accepted principles  it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child  questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy  how to terminate the pregnancy  the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta  isolation of the newborn after birth  and breastfeeding

354,PMC7151430,hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the world health organization  who  to avoid contracting covid 19  unfortunately  these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content  science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments  despite this  no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of covid 19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors  it is therefore extremely important  that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air  and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the sars cov 2 virus  in particularly removal of the virus laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation
355,PMC7127664,the global virus network  gvn  was established in 2011 to strengthen research and responses to emerging viral causes of human disease and to prepare against new viral pandemics  there are now 52 gvn centers of excellence and 9 affiliate laboratories in 32 countries  the 11th international gvn meeting was held from june 9 11  2019 in barcelona  spain and was jointly organized with the spanish society of virology  a common theme throughout the meeting was globalization and climate change  this report highlights the recent accomplishments of gvn researchers in several important areas of medical virology  including severe virus epidemics  anticipation and preparedness for changing disease dynamics  host pathogen interactions  zoonotic virus infections  ethical preparedness for epidemics and pandemics  one health and antivirals
356,PMC7117787,there are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of covid 19 as a new emerging epidemic  in addition  usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable  however  misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic  accordingly  our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus  mode of transmission  incubation period  infectivity  pathogenicity  virulence  immunogenicity  diagnosis  surveillance  clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities

359,PMC7206557,the 2014 ebola outbreak in three african states transformed the virus into a social reality in which media representations contributed to globalised hysteria and had rhetorical effects  this study investigated representations of the ebola virus disease in south african news reports  march 2014 june 2015   four discourses were found to operate within the globalised social context  threat to humanity  predation  invasion  and conspiracy  the south african reportage framed ebola as a predator and criminal rather than using stock warfare imagery  representations indicated alignment with phobic high income countries and colonial hegemony
360,PMC7139442,a variety of emerging infections are of interest to transfusion medicine clinicians  but zoonotic pathogens  those maintained in nonhuman hosts and transmitted to humans  have dominated recent discussions  especially emerging acute viral infections that can or might spread around a shrinking globe with unprecedented speed  in an infected human or an infected vector or reservoir host  further  advanced pathogen discovery techniques  e g   metagenomics  allow the identification of potential pathogens before their recognition as clinically relevant to transfusion medicine  in the aftermath of our experiences with hiv and posttransfusion hepatitis  our windows for response to such agents and infections have contracted rapidly  these characteristics pose difficult challenges for our development of surveillance and control regimes capable of timely  but appropriately nuanced  responses  this monograph surveys a selection of such agents  exploring their apparent relevance to transfusion medicine  closing with a framework for an ongoing approach to their surveillance  recognition  threat evaluation  and mitigation
361,PMC7164895,viruses can infect all cell based organisms  from bacteria to humans  animals  and plants  they are responsible for numerous cases of hospitalization  many deaths  and widespread crop destruction  all of which result in an enormous medical  economical  and biological burden  each of the currently used decontamination methods has important drawbacks  cold plasma  cp  has entered this field as a novel  efficient  and clean solution for virus inactivation  we present recent developments in this promising field of cp mediated virus inactivation  and describe the applications and mechanisms of the inactivation  this is particularly relevant because viral pandemics  such as covid 19  highlight the need for alternative virus inactivation methods to replace  complement  or upgrade existing procedures
362,PMC7120695,mathematical models when applied to infectious disease data can provide extremely useful insights into the possible future impacts of potential emerging epidemics and how they might be best controlled or mitigated  modelling  which is like any other hypothesis driven approach  aims to develop a better understanding of biological phenomena  however  diseases processes generally  and particularly those related to transmission  will in many cases be imperfectly understood or too complex to systematically describe  so models will necessarily be simplifications of the overall system  it is essential  therefore  that models are designed carefully and used appropriately  key to this is identifying what specific questions a model might be expected to answer and what data is available to inform the model  a particular type of model might be fine for one particular situation but highly inappropriate for another  it is also important to appreciate and communicate what simplifications and assumptions have had to be made and how this might affect the robustness of the modelling results  it is also particularly important to understand that models frequently make what can be hidden assumptions about underlying processes because of the way they have been constructed and these assumptions also need to be carefully considered and made explicit  particularly for non expert audiences  this chapter  therefore  provides a brief introduction to some of these aspects of epidemic modelling for those that might be less familiar with them

374,PMC7286272,cardiopulmonary resuscitation  cpr  in sars cov 2 associated disease  covid 19  patients poses a unique challenge to health care providers due to the risk of viral aerosolization and disease transmission  this has caused some centers to modify existing cpr procedures  limit the duration of cpr or consider avoiding cpr altogether  in this review  we propose a procedure for cpr in the icu that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protection equipment  ppe   highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high risk patients may prompt them to decline cpr  we recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow medication delivery from outside the patients  rooms  during cpr  this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay  the use of a mechanical compression system for cpr further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health care providers  ecmo should be reserved for patients with few comorbidities and a single failing organ system  reliable teleconferencing tools are essential to facilitate communication between providers inside and outside of the patient s room  general principles regarding the ethics and peri resuscitative management of covid 19 patients are also discussed
375,PMC7300792,a  david napier has been studying immunology and immunologists for more than three decades  in this article  he argues that the medicalization of viral epidemics has distracted us from the importance of their true social drivers  that is  the behaviour of people when they are together   what epidemiologists call human herds  on their own  viruses cannot  invade  us  our cells bring them to life and make them infectious through our social actions  confusing viruses with invasive microbes not only leads us to misuse antibiotics  but fosters xenophobic responses towards outside carriers   as even our neighbours become categorical  others  in the face of a foreign threat  indeed  new work in viral epidemiology indicates that many viruses have infectious potential long before an epidemic develops  it is not only changes within viruses that cause epidemics  but also the condition of human herds   how we behave socially   that ignites the rapid circulation of viral information

524,PMC7194513,this concise manuscript aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the coronavirus disease 2019  covid 19  pandemic  this targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered covid 19 heroes  that is  brave volunteers  as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis or affinity column  derived antibodies  both are sterilised and pathogen inactivated for substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody  this include for use in critically ill covid 19 patients and as a preventative measure  in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available  this would be a small step forward  while we are waiting to produce an effective  validated vaccine and witnessing increasing demands for testing and self isolation which are the two most effective current strategies  in line with this concept  some methodological aspects of the use of the uvc sterilization of ffp  cryoprecipitate depleted ffp or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against covid 19 are highlighted  the plasmapheresis procedure is  of course  particularly targeted to male donors  who consist of about 75   of the covid 19 population and who are able to undergo multiple double  or even triple plasmapheresis procedures  moreover  as some of these donors have already been in an induced hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and dvt  this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of dvt  repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selected covid 19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability  the recipients of such a derived ffp product would benefit from the two to 3 doses of viral inactivated antibodies  which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage  so  this practice would be a double edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients

528,PMC7126544,the 2019 ncov is officially called sars cov 2 and the disease is named covid 19  this viral epidemic in china has led to the deaths of over 1800 people  mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state  this is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years  following sars in 2002 2003 and mers in 2012  while human strains of coronavirus are associated with about 15  of cases of the common cold  the sars cov 2 may present with varying degrees of severity  from flu like symptoms to death  it is currently believed that this deadly coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the huanan market in wuhan  a city in hubei province  bats  snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of cov isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from sars cov 2 infected patients  extreme quarantine measures  including sealing off large cities  closing borders and confining people to their homes  were instituted in january 2020 to prevent spread of the virus  but by that time much of the damage had been done  as human human transmission became evident  while these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the spanish flu  earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective  lessons learned from sars resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy  however  it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges  the costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects  as the virus has led to significant sociological  psychological and economic effects globally  unfortunately  emergence of sars cov 2 has led to numerous reports of asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world
529,PMC7212070,coronavirus disease 2019  covid 19  is an on going pandemic attributed to a novel virus named sars cov 2  comparing the statistics of incidence and death rates between nations reveals that there is discrepancy amongst countries in these regards  even between countries that share borders  we herein present information from the literature indicating how cross protection against covid 19 conferred by the encephalitis vaccine could be the reason for lower fatality rate in the countries where immunization against encephalitis is widespread or included in national programs  this may pave the way for arriving at efficient prevention strategies as well as vaccine development
530,PMC7252625,recent studies have shown that the ebola virus might persist in body fluids of survivors of the disease  clinical research in which body fluids  semen  vaginal fluids  blood  sweat  tears  breast milk and rectal fluids  are sampled play an increasingly important role  specifically in light of growing evd epidemics  the success of these studies  e g  how many participants are recruited in a study and how many are staying until the end of a study  is highly dependent on the participants  cooperation and understanding of testing programs  however  until now there has been only little research on how studies and testing programs in which body fluids are sampled are perceived and understood by study participants  in this study we were therefore interested to understand how study participants perceived the sampling and collection of body fluids and how their cultural or religious background may influence the willingness to participate and stay in a clinical study  we conducted one to one interviews and focus group discussions with 93 former study participants of a viral persistence study  we found that overall study participants conceived the testing of their body fluids positively and saw it as a useful means to know their status  however  some study participants were ambivalent and sometimes reluctant towards sampling of certain body fluids  especially semen  blood and vaginal fluid  due to religious or cultural reasons  self sampling was described by study participants as a highly unusual phenomenon  participants explained that the collection of certain body fluids would make men weak and powerless  especially the sampling of semen   or women dizzy and sick  especially blood   rumors indicated that some participants mistrusted the study aims  in the course of the sampling exercise  study participants often felt that they had to transgress cultural and intimate boundaries  we conclude that it is important to understand the potential importance some of these perceptions have on the recruitment of study participants and the acceptability of studies  the understanding of the socio cultural context of clinical research is relevant for the programmatic planning of such research

533,PMC7282799,the current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic covid 19 is one of the greatest challenges we face in this generation  computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic  such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the sars cov 2 virus  the seir model is a well known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as ebola  sars  mers  and influenza a  this paper presents a modified seirs model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility  where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes  death  recovery  and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility  the model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population  time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures  as well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response  owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by covid 19  the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported  such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood  the model is verified using two case studies based on the real world data in south korea and northern ireland

535,PMC7019415,the risk of emergence and or re emergence of arthropod borne viral  arboviral  infections is rapidly growing worldwide  particularly in africa  the burden of arboviral infections and diseases is not well scrutinized because of the inefficient surveillance systems in endemic countries  furthermore  the health systems are fully occupied by the burden of other co existing febrile illnesses  especially malaria  in this review we summarize the epidemiology and risk factors associated with the major human arboviral diseases and highlight the gap in knowledge  research  and control in sudan  published data in english up to march 2019 were reviewed and are discussed to identify the risks and challenges for the control of arboviruses in the country  in addition  the lack of suitable diagnostic tools such as viral genome sequencing  and the urgent need for establishing a genomic database of the circulating viruses and potential sources of entry are discussed  moreover  the research and healthcare gaps and global health threats are analyzed  and suggestions for developing strategic health policy for the prevention and control of arboviruses with focus on building the local diagnostic and research capacity and establishing an early warning surveillance system for the early detection and containment of arboviral epidemics are offered
536,PMC7167217,novel coronaviruses  covs  are zoonotic pathogens  but the first human to human transmission has been reported  covs have the best known genome of all rna viruses  and mutations in the genome have now been found  a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan  china  was first reported to the who country office in china on 31 december 2019  this study aims to report early findings related to covid 19 and provide methods to prevent and treat it
