    "OBJECTIVE:Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease with potentially devastating and long-term sequelae, such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Given the mortality risk, prevalence of VTE, and limited access to diagnostic imaging, clinically relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and prognostication are needed. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the data on clinically applicable biomarkers that best indicate acute VTE and chronic PTS. METHODS:We reviewed the medical and scientific literature from 2001 to 2019 for VTE biomarkers. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and review articles were included. Primary basic research papers with no clinical applicability, opinion papers, institutional guidelines, and case reports were excluded. RESULTS:We highlight the diagnostic value of D-dimer alongside other promising biomarkers, including cellular adhesion molecules, P-selectin, cytokines (interleukins 6 and 10), fibrin monomer complexes, and coagulation factors (factor VIII). CONCLUSIONS:High-sensitivity D-dimer remains the most clinically established VTE biomarker. Current research endeavors are under way to identify more precise biomarkers of VTE and PTS."
