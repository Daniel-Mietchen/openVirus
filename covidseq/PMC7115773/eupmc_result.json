    "Tracheobronchial masses encompass a broad spectrum of entities, ranging from benign and malignant neoplasms to infectious and inflammatory processes. This article reviews the cross-sectional findings of tracheal tumors and tumor-like entities, correlates imaging findings with histologic pathology, and discusses pearls and pitfalls in accurately diagnosing and classifying tracheal tumors and mimics."
