    "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, caused by a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Majority of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14Â days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS. Diagnosis of MERS is based on a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), obtained from a respiratory specimen. The mainstay of management of MERS-CoV infection is supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy for MERS-CoV infection at present, although several modalities of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation."
