The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Serial chest radiographies (CXRs) were obtained from viral exposure until death or discharge in 35 patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Radiographic scores were calculated by multiplying a four-point scale of involved lung area and three-point scale of abnormal opacification, in each of the six lung zones. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to identify optimal day and radiographic score for the prediction of respiratory distress, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess significant predictive factors for intubation or tracheostomy. Among 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; median age: 48 years), 25 demonstrated abnormal opacity on CXR (MERS pneumonia), whereas no abnormality was detected in 10 patients (MERS upper respiratory tract infection). Seven patients required ventilator support (intubation group) and three of them eventually expired. The average incubation period was 5.4 days (standard deviation, &#x000b1;2.8; range, 2&#x02013;11). Patients in the intubation group had a higher incidence of diffuse lung involvement, higher radiographic scores, and fibrosing sequela on follow up study compared with those in the non-intubation group. However, patients&#x02019; age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.726 for the radiographic score on day 10 with an optimal cutoff score of 10 for prediction of intubation, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 67%. Our study suggest that MERS patients with radiographic score &#x0003e; 10 on day 10 from viral exposure require aggressive therapy with careful surveillance and follow-up evaluation.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>CoV, coronavirus</kwd><kwd>CXR, chest radiography</kwd><kwd>CT, computed tomography</kwd><kwd>ER, emergency room</kwd><kwd>ROC, receiver operating characteristic</kwd><kwd>URI, upper respiratory tract infection</kwd><kwd>AUC, area under the ROC curve</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwd0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)</kwd><kwd>Chest radiographic score</kwd><kwd>Chest radiograph</kwd><kwd>Prognostic indicator</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0025">Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute viral respiratory disease, caused by a novel virus called MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the first reported case of MERS in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1888 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, resulting in 670 deaths across 27 countries, have been reported to the World Health Organization [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first case of MERS in Korea reported on May 20, 2015, was that of an individual who had developed the disease after traveling to the Middle East countries. Subsequently, this case led to the largest transmission cluster of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases in Korea [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among these 186 cases, 36 were treated in our institution.</p><p id="par0030">Imaging plays a crucial role in making a diagnosis and monitoring disease progress, and chest radiography (CXR) remains the most commonly used imaging modality. Because MERS can be transmitted through direct or indirect exposure to MERS-CoV, infection control in health care facilities is a critical issue [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. Patients diagnosed with MERS should be moved to an institutional isolation care unit and personal protective equipment is mandatory for health care workers who handle these patients. Thus, CXR would play a pivotal role in the evaluation of patients with several infectious diseases, including MERS, because it is rapid and easily accessible, compared with computed tomography (CT). Indeed, we relied on the findings of sequential CXR while managing the 36 patients with MERS-CoV infection in clinical practice. However, there is still limited information about the prognostic implication of CXR findings in patients with MERS. Thus, the aim of this study was two-fold. First, we were to describe the serial radiographic characteristics of MERS-CoV pneumonia by analyzing radiographic scores. Second, we tried to identify the earliest cutoff value of radiographic score, which can be considered as a potential prognostic indicator of fatal outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="par0035">The institutional review board approved the study (IRB 2015-07-195), and informed consent was waived for the use of patients&#x02019; medical and imaging data.</p><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study population and exposure</title><p id="par0040">On May 27, 2015, a 35-year-old Korean man visited the emergency room (ER) of our institution with fever, productive cough, and dyspnea. After 2 days (May 29), he reported that he had met another patient with MERS approximately 10 days ago, at a different hospital. The patient was immediately transferred to an isolation care unit. The MERS-CoV infection was confirmed by a sputum assay on May 30. During his stay in the ER, numerous individuals were in contact with him directly or indirectly. Individuals with a possibility of exposure to this virus were quarantined and laboratory tests were conducted if symptoms were noted during the observational period. Consequently, 81 cases of MERS-CoV infection resulting from the exposure at the ER were confirmed, resulting in a total of 90 cases of MERS-CoV infection diagnosed at our institution [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among the 90 patients, 36 were hospitalized in the isolation care unit of our institution. One patient with underlying stage-four lymphoma was not included in this study, as this condition could adversely affect the prognosis. Thus, 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS were included.</p><p id="par0045">We identified the exact time of exposure, symptom onset, and laboratory-diagnosis of MERS in every patient. In addition, all data, including age, sex, premorbid conditions, symptoms, laboratory findings, clinical course and survival outcome were collected from patient electronic medical records.

The parenchymal abnormality on CXR was graded on a 3-point scale: 1, normal attenuation; 2, ground-glass attenuation; and 3, consolidation. The ground-glass opacity was defined as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consolidation appears as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Several studies have discussed the imaging findings of MERS pneumonia. However, most of them focus on the CT findings rather than CXR [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite the availability of high resolution CT images, CXR is still the most important and commonly used modality in diagnosis and monitoring of highly contagious diseases such as MERS. Our study highlights the clinical implication of radiographic scores as a prognostic indicator in patients with MERS. As the average time to radiographic abnormality was 9.2 days (SD, 2.8 days) from viral exposure, prompt detection of CXR abnormality and acquisition of radiographic score is vital in the management of patients with MERS pneumonia.</p><p id="par0125">Das et al. [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also have reported about the clinical impact of chest radiographic score as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with MERS. One of unique findings of our study is that we identified the optimal time point and cutoff radiographic scores in patients with MERS pneumonia which could be used as an indicator of respiratory distress. In addition, out study demonstrated that patients&#x02019; age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between intubation and non-intubation groups in patients with MERS pneumonia. These results are in contrast with the previous reports, including one by Das et al., which suggested that geriatric immunocompromised patients with MERS are at higher risk of fatal outcomes [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. We found out that development of MERS pneumonia, rather than final outcome, was more frequently noted in patients with comorbidities. Indeed, none of the patients with MERS URI had premorbid conditions. We think that it can explain one of the mechanisms that patient&#x02019;s comorbidities had finally led to poor prognosis in previous reports. Current study emphasizes the importance of careful CXR monitoring in patients with MERS-CoV infection, regardless of patients&#x02019; age and premorbid conditions.</p><p id="par0130">One of the unique issues of Korean MERS outbreak is the so-called, super-spreaders, who resulted in extremely high human-to-human transmission rate. A total of 136 cases (73.1%) among 186 MERS patients of Korean outbreak, were actually transmitted from only three patients [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent report by Ko et al., specified the presence of radiographic abnormality, indicating MERS pneumonia in all three patients suspected of super spreading the infection [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, careful evaluation of CXR for detecting pneumonia is critical in the control of MERS outbreak. Additionally, prediction of respiratory failure is also important to avoid urgent intubation or tracheostomy, which can increase the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. The average incubation period of MERS was estimated to be about 5.4 days, and could extend up to 11 days. The results of the current study support the efficacy of two-week quarantine system in patients with virus exposure [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="par0135">All of the patients of intubation group in our study showed remaining opacity as fibrosing sequela on follow-up CXR. Ajlan et al. [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] described the organizing pneumonia pattern of MERS pneumonia, with predominance of airspace opacities in the subpleural and basilar lung regions. In addition, Kim et al. recently reported a case of treated organizing pneumonia in patient with MERS-CoV infection [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We can assume that fibrotic changes leaving linear or patchy opacities on follow up CXRs may have resulted from organizing pneumonia. Further studies are required to identify the radiological and pathological evolution of MERS pneumonia.</p><p id="par0140">There were several limitations in this study. First, it was a retrospective study and might have limited power in identifying prognostic factors. Second, although the radiographic score &#x02265; 10 on day 10 had the largest predictive power for respiratory failure, it was not found to be statistically significant on multivariate analysis. We think that a small number of study population was a major drawback of our result, which hindered statistical significance. As there is limited number of patients with MERS, we hope that external validation of our radiographic scoring system would be performed by other MERS-CoV research group to establish a role of radiographic score as a prognostic indicator in MERS pneumonia. Third, daily CXRs were not available in most cases, as CXR scans were obtained on every other day in the recovery phase. To overcome the issue, we applied 3-day moving average value of radiographic scores to minimize the potential error. Lastly, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of radiographic score might not be sufficiently high enough. We admit that CXR may not be the most efficient diagnostic or prognostic tool for patients with MERS. However, we should not overlook the clinical utility of CXR as an indispensable modality for patients with this highly contagious disease.</p><p id="par0145">In conclusion, MERS has threatened the public health not only with its high transmission rate, but also with high fatality and mortality. We suggest that radiographic scores can play a vital role in the management of patients with MERS because of the ability to predict respiratory distress necessitating ventilator support. Patients with radiographic score &#x02265; 10 on day 10 from viral exposure are in need of aggressive therapy with careful surveillance and follow-up evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec0075"><title>Declarations of interest</title><p id="par0150">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ajlan</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahyad</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jamjoom</surname><given-names>L.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alharthy</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Madani</surname><given-names>T.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: chest CT findings</article-title><source>AJR Am.
