It has become a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries, especially in regions of conflict and political instability. Currently, there are only limited drug treatments and no available licensed vaccine; thus, the need for more therapeutic interventions remains urgent. Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding a 15 kDa sandfly (<italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic>) salivary protein (PpSP15) and recombinant nonpathogenic <italic>Leishmania tarentolae</italic> secreting PpSP15 have been shown to induce protective immunity against <italic>Leishmania major</italic> in mice, demonstrating that PpSP15 is a promising vaccine candidate. In this study, we developed a fermentation process in yeast with a yield of ~1g PpSP15/L and a scalable purification process consisting of only 2 chromatographic purification steps with high binding capacity for PpSP15, suggesting that PpSP15 can be produced economically. The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the purified PpSP15 indicated that the protein was of high purity (&#x0003e;97%) and conformationally stable between pH 4.4 and 9.0.

). The binding capacity of each chromatographic step was also determined, as this information will facilitate upscaling the process. The low purity of PpSP15 (64.6%) in the FS as determined by densitometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1b</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) was likely due to heavy contamination with host cell impurities or degraded PpSP15 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1a</xref>, lane 1). To purify PpSP15 more efficiently, the FS was first filtered through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter and then concentrated 3-fold by TFF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1a</xref>, lane 2) to reduce the volume and thus processing time. Owing to the high theoretical <italic>pI</italic> of PpSP15 (pI&#x000a0;= 9.1), cation exchange chromatography was chosen, and thus, the concentrated FS was further buffer exchanged using the same filtration device. It is noted that only 3.3 to 4 diavolumes were required to reduce the sample conductivity to the level of binding buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6), and 95% of the protein was recovered. After buffer exchange, the FS was loaded onto a cation exchange column (IEX) made from SPXL resin. The binding capacity was determined as 52 mg/mL SPXL at a flow rate of 149.3 cm/h on a column with a BH of 14.5 cm. In the IEX step, 92% of PpSP15 was recovered from the TFF step; the purity of PpSP15 in the SPXL pool increased to 93.4%, suggesting that most of the impurities, that is, host cell proteins, were removed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1a</xref>, lane 3). The conductivity of the SPXL pool was then adjusted to ~200&#x000a0;ms/cm by adding ammonium sulfate to 2 M and the sample was loaded onto an HIC column containing Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow High Sub (PS6FF) to remove small impurities from 3 to 14 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1a</xref>, lane 4). It is noted that even though approximately 486 mg of PpSP15 were bound to the column during loading, it did not bind very tightly to this column and approximately 411 mg was being eluted during the wash step, leaving only 75 mg being eluted at the elution step (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;S2a</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S2b</xref>). When SPXL pool containing only 75 mg of PpSP15 was loaded, no or very little of PpSP15 was observed in the wash step (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;S2c</xref>). Thus, binding capacity was reported as remaining PpSP15 after the wash step per unit volume of PS6FF resin, that is, 75 mg/5 mL PS6FF resin or 15 mg/mL PS6FF at a flow rate of 25.6 cm/h with a residence time of 5.8&#x000a0;min.

In this study, we have generated a recombinant <italic>P.&#x000a0;pastoris</italic> X33 construct for recombinant PpSP15 protein production, developed and optimized an upstream process at the 10 L scale, and developed a scalable downstream process consisting of IEX and HIC chromatographic steps.

Thus, a recombinant yeast construct for the development and optimization of the upstream fermentation process was generated. The optimized process added a glycerol fed-batch step after the initial depletion of the glycerol in the basal salts medium, increasing cell density before induction. This additional step increased overall protein yield by 27.6%.</p><p id="p0130">With respect to the downstream process development, owing to a high protein <italic>pI</italic> (9.1), cation exchange chromatography was logically selected as the capture step. First, the conductivity of FS was lowered by diafiltration. To reduce processing time, a 10 kDa cutoff Pellicon&#x000ae; 3 cassette was being tested; however, PpSP15 was found to permeate through the cassette, and thus, a 3 kDa cutoff Pellicon&#x000ae; 3 cassette was selected. However, instead of direct diafiltration, the FS was first concentrated 3-fold to (1) reduce the processing time required for diafiltration and cation exchange chromatography and (2) lower the volume of buffer required for diafiltration. PpSP15 in this concentrated and buffer-exchanged FS was further purified with a 14.5 cm BH IEX column at a flow rate of 149.3 cm/h using a step elution at 30% elution buffer. An additional elution step with a linear gradient from 30% to 100% elution buffer was applied to remove the bound host cell protein in the column after the target protein had been recovered. However, because gradient elution is undesirable in large-scale production, we plan to replace this step with a step elution with 100% elution buffer in future scale-up experiments. After the IEX step, it was noticed that approximately 7% of low-molecular-weight impurities were still present, and these impurities were further removed by hydrophobic HIC. During the first few trials of HIC, Butyl Sepharose High-Performance resin was tested, but it did not show enough binding affinity to PpSP15. Hence, a stronger HIC resin, Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub (PS6FF), was chosen. By using PS6FF resin, impurities were reduced by an additional 3% and the purity of PpSP15 reached &#x0003e;97%. It was noted that typically the BH should be maintained while upscaling; however, the PS6FF column used during this development phase had a BH of 2.5 cm, and hence scaling up was not practical and required optimization. For future studies to scale up the process, we intend to pack a column with a BH between 10 and 20 cm and maintain the current residence time of 5.8&#x000a0;min to keep the binding capacity similar. Based on the binding capacity of PpSP15 to SPXL resin (52 mg/mL) and PS6FF resin (15 mg/mL), the minimal CVs of both resins to purify this antigen and the estimated amount of purified antigen were calculated (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S3</xref>). For a typical 10 L fermentation process, approximately 4.5 L of FS is obtained. With the initial yield of 994 mg of PpSP15/L of FS, it will require an SPXL column with a CV of more than 86 mL and a PS6FF column with a CV of more than 260 mL to capture all the PpSP15 during purification. With 79% of high overall recovery, we expect to collect approximately 785 mg of purified PpSP15 per litter of FS.

For future upscaling, we plan to replace the dialysis step with diafiltration using 3 kDa Pellicon&#x000ae; cassettes.</p><p id="p0135">With respect to protein characterization, several biophysical and biochemical assays were performed to study the characteristics of this protein. It is well known that the recombinant proteins expressed in yeast can potentially be heavily N-glycosylated,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>

<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> an N-glycosylation assessment screening for the presence of the consensus sequence for N-glycosylation, AsnXxxSer/Thr/Cys (where Xxx can be any amino acid except proline) was conducted.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> In the PpSP15 sequence (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>), there are 9 Asn residues, but only Asn22 is followed by Ser24. However, the amino acid in between Asn22 and Ser24 is Pro23, thus Asn22 is most likely not glycosylated. SDS-PAGE gels and the mass spectrometry also indicated the absence of N-glycans. Other more sensitive and specific assays were also applied to study the purity/impurity, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE and anti-PpSP15 western blot and anti-<italic>P.&#x000a0;pastoris</italic> X33 HCP western blot. The results suggested that only trace amounts of HCPs and product-derived impurities, degraded PpSP15, were present in the purified PpSP15 sample. Moreover, no detectable aggregation was found, which was also supported by DLS and SE-HPLC. Indeed, its low binding affinity to the HIC column explaining this protein is likely highly hydrophilic. In addition, when comparing the PpSP15 sequence to PdSP15 and its crystal structure,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> after excluding the signal peptide, it was predicted that all 6 cysteine residues in PpSP15 form disulfide bridges, and thus, no free cysteine residue should be present to form intermolecular disulfide bridges. These findings suggest a low tendency for PpSP15 to aggregate, a desirable property for long-term stability. The secondary structure analyzed by far-UV CD indicated PpSP15 as a highly alpha-helical protein (62.6% alpha-helix and 7.5% beta-sheet). This result was consistent with the secondary structure of its homolog, PdSP15 (PDB ID 4OZD), (66% helix), which further validated the assay. Finally, pH screening using a thermal shift assay was conducted to determine the proper pH system to maintain PpSP15 stability. It is noted that the onset temperature and melting temperature remained constant between pH 4.4 and 9.0; however, a lower melting temperature was observed at both pH 3.1 and 3.7, suggesting instability of PpSP15, which further indicates buffer formulations at a pH lower than 4.4 should be avoided.</p><p id="p0140">In conclusion, the production process for recombinant PpSP15 as a leishmaniasis vaccine antigen candidate has been developed. The upstream production process was optimized and generated approximately 1 g PpSP15 per liter of FS. The tag-free recombinant PpSP15 protein was able to be purified by a 2-chromatographic-step purification process, which involved an ion-exchange column and a hydrophobic interaction column, and the binding capacities for both chromatographic steps were determined. Even though some minor adjustments will be required, the process is suitable for further upscaling and studies of process recovery and process reproducibility. Characterization of PpSP15 showed that the protein was highly pure with a well-defined structure. Future studies should be focused on understanding long-term stability and stability under different stresses as these pieces of information along with the ongoing preclinical study will inform whether there is a path forward for manufacturing an economical vaccine for this neglected tropical disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref
