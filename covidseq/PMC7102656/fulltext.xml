Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0025"><list-item id="li0165"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0165">The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0170"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0170">COVID-19 results in respiratory illness, but some patients can have cardiac injury.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0175"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0175">Patients with underlying cardiac disease have worse outcomes with COVID-19.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0180"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0180">ACHD patients may be at increased risk of worse outcomes with COVID-19.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0185"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0185">No treatment exists currently, the focus is on supportive care and prevention.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0190">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel betacoronavirus that was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in December of 2019.

The betacoronaviruses are able to infect human hosts through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
). ACE2 is a membrane-bound protein that is expressed in many human cells, including vascular endothelia, renal tissue, cardiovascular tissue, and small intestine epithelia [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on studies investigating both SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it was shown back in 2015 that circulating bat coronaviruses have the potential for human emergence using human ACE2 as a receptor into host cells [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that this novel betacoronavirus has a very similar receptor binding domain/motif to the SARS coronavirus [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor to enter human cells. Recent genetic sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 shows an 80% similarity to SARS and a 50% similarity to MERS coronavirus, making SARS-CoV-2 the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans, as well as the third coronavirus with bat origins [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Possible mechanisms of cardiac injury with COVID-19.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>3.2</label><title>Human-to-human transmission</title><p id="p0205">SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be transmitted via human-to-human contact with an estimated R<sub>0</sub> of between 2 and 3 [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets, contact, and entry through ocular tissue [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Fecal shedding has been seen in up to 30% of patients for up to 4&#x02013;5&#x0202f;weeks after onset of symptoms, but it is unclear if this correlates with infectivity. Since ACE2 is also expressed in intestinal epithelia and live virus has been detected in the stool of patients with COVID-19, transmission via the fecal-oral route is theoretically possible, but has not been confirmed in epidemiologic studies as of yet [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The first stage is the replicative stage, when SARS-CoV-2 is replicating over the course of several days and the patient presents with relatively mild symptoms. Unlike other human coronavirus infections, COVID-19 does not commonly present with upper respiratory symptoms like rhinorrhea [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One study showed that a sizeable proportion (18%) of patients who are infected with COVID-19 may not exhibit any symptoms at all [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Most symptomatic patients with COVID-19 will present with fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. They will have findings of pneumonia on chest X-ray and computed tomography scans of the chest [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Most symptomatic patients suffer a mild respiratory infection requiring supportive care like supplemental oxygen. Patients can also develop gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, lymphopenia is seen commonly in patients with COVID-19 and may be a poor prognostic factor [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p id="p0225">The second stage is the adaptive immunity stage, when the body develops an antibody response to the virus. This leads to falling titers of the virus and resolution of symptoms in most patients. There is a minority of patients, however, that become critically-ill and have a high risk of mortality. Around 10% of patients will have worsening of disease requiring intensive care (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
). They can suffer from ARDS, viremia, acute cardiac injury, multi-organ failure, and secondary bacterial infections [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A) Proportion of patients and their comorbid conditions that were diagnosed with COVID-19.

Compared to adult patients, children diagnosed with COVID-19 seem to have less severe disease. Over 90% of the cases were mild or moderate in nature. Young children, especially infants, however, seemed to be more susceptible to severe disease than older children; 10% of patients under 1&#x0202f;year of age had severe or critical disease.

It should be noted that there are cases of negative initial testing that later repeated as positive, as this may be due to low viral titers early in the infection. One shocking reality is that in many countries, including Western nations like the United States, lack widespread testing capability. At the time of the writing of this manuscript in the third week of March 2020, testing in Los Angeles is woefully unavailable for the vast majority of potentially infected patients. Drive-through testing is not available for days and in-hospital testing is limited to the highest risk subsets.

Studies so far have not detailed in a granular fashion the risk of individual cardiovascular complications in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. While no studies on COVID-19 have included patients with congenital heart disease, it stands to reason that patients with congenital heart disease could be considered at higher risk for complications from COVID-19. Certain adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are likely at higher risk than others. Based on the ACHD Anatomy and Physiological Stage Classification, any patient with complex congenital heart disease (Anatomy Stage III) or Physiological Stage B, C, or D symptoms could be considered high risk for complications related to COVID-19 infection on the basis of decreased functional reserve [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>

This desire to minimize risk of infection must obviously be weighed against the necessity of in-person visits for some patients, e.g. those with decompensated congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. The advent of wearable technology and wide availability of blood pressure, heart rate, and oximetry equipment for home use can be a reasonable substitute for in-clinic vital sign measurements. Additionally, the video function can allow a clinician to inspect the patient visually, albeit in a far less comprehensive manner when compared to the traditional physical examination. Hand-held and easily sterilized echocardiographic equipment can also be a &#x02018;handy&#x02019; substitute for traditional comprehensive echocardiography, and the inevitably higher rate of exposure in a frequently visited echo lab. At least in the short term, these social distancing approaches to the practice of clinical medicine will have to suffice for the majority of our patients.

Symptomatic relief with antipyretics, use of supplemental oxygen and management of comorbid conditions are the cornerstones of therapy. The use of antiviral, immune modulating, or antibiotic therapies is at this point not considered standard of care. Controlled trials are ongoing, and we are all anxiously awaiting results and recommendations for treatment of COVID-19.</p><p id="p0325">Some patients with COVID-19 may experience cardiac injury and arrhythmias [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and employment of echocardiography and cardiac enzymes would seem paramount in this setting [<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Myocardial injury may occur due to a variety of mechanisms, from direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes, hypoxia due to severe pneumonia leading to ischemic cardiac tissue, or an overwhelming inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and myocardial dysfunction (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This leads to troponin leak and elevations in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). While laboratory assessment for cardiac injury is not recommended on a routine basis, patients who show signs and symptoms of myocardial injury (ST-segment changes on an electrocardiogram for example), acute coronary syndrome (chest pain), unstable arrhythmias, or heart failure should be evaluated thoroughly. Differentiation between normal cardiac function with increased metabolic demand, acute coronary syndrome, and fulminant myocarditis will be important as each of these clinical scenarios will require a different treatment algorithm. For patients who are deteriorating, judicious use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been successful at supporting patients through critical illness [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

More studies will be needed to help parse out which patients will benefit from such therapies.</p><p id="p0330">In terms of medical treatment options, there are currently over 50 studies in various stages of development related to treatment of COVID-19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="ir0005">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, accessed March 20, 2020). Given the novel nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there are no known effective therapies at this time, but the therapies being studied include antiviral (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) and anti-inflammatory (tocilizumab, steroids) agents.

As the pandemic progresses and resources start to become strained, we may be asked to ration certain measures such as intensive care unit beds, mechanical ventilation and extra-corporeal support. It is our sincere hope that it will not come to this in the majority of countries. This concern further underscores the dire importance of slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to allow health care systems to appropriately prepare and manage this crisis without having to resort to rationing of the highest levels of care. Importantly, the clinical need for imaging, invasive and surgical interventions must be weighed against the risk of infecting healthcare workers who may lack the appropriate personal protective equipment at this point in time.

ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II, and generates angiotensin 1&#x02013;7, which is a potent vasodilator [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In animal models, the ARBs have been shown to increase cardiac ACE2 expression after chronic (&#x0003e;28&#x0202f;days) treatment [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on studies of the original SARS coronavirus, viral binding to ACE2 leads to ACE2 downregulation, which results in excessive production of angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and decreased quantities of the vasodilator heptapeptide angiotensin 1&#x02013;7, which can contribute to lung injury and stimulation of the RAAS pathway. Counterintuitively, while ARBs increase the number of ACE2 receptors available for SARS-CoV-2 binding, the overall effect of ARBs may protect against lung injury by reducing angiotensin II production by ACE and by increasing the production of vasodilator angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 is not yet known and remains unproven.
