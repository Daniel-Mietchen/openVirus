    "Evolution in paediatric HIV management has changed the incidence and prevalence of opportunistic infections and a major reduction has been shown for most opportunistic infections with antiretroviral therapy use in lower and middle-income countries, especially in the first year of treatment. However, the high prevalence of disease still requires adequate management of opportunistic infections, to improve patient quality of life and the impact on burden of disease. Lower CD4 counts were associated with chronic infection and increased risk of opportunistic infections in patients, but some studies have shown that even children with high CD4 counts may have opportunistic infections.This chapter reviews common opportunistic infections that may infect HIV positive children and adolescents, particularly in sub Saharan Africa."
