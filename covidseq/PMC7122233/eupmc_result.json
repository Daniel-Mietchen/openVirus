    "The rationale to investigate the role of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in cancer relies on the fact that the heptapeptide inhibits the growth of several cell lines. The first studies showed that Ang-(1-7) accelerated hematopoietic recovery in the peripheral blood and bone marrow after chemotherapy and inhibits lung cancer cell growth through the activation of Mas receptor. In this chapter, we summarize studies on the role of Ang-(1-7) in different types of cancer, especially lung, breast, prostate, hepatocellular cancers and in gliobalstoma multiforme (GBM). The antitumor effect of Ang-(1-7) was due to reduction of angiogenesis, cancer-associated fibrosis, osteoclastogenesis, tumor-induced inflammation, and metastasis as well as inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation. In clinical trials, Ang-(1-7) was well tolerated with limited toxic or quality-of-life side effects and showed clinical benefit in cancer patients with solid tumors. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm safety, to determine doses and clinical indications."
