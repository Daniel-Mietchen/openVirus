    "Adverse events and adverse drug reactions are common in clinical practice. Side effects range from the common to the rare and may be confused with other mucocutaneous manifestations resulting from several medications to treat infections, other medical conditions, and in the clinical setting of oncologic treatment. The objective of this chapter to review current data on adverse drug reactions, here classified as (i) severe adverse drug reactions, (ii) uncomplicated cutaneous adverse drug reactions, and (iii) adverse drug reactions caused by chemotherapy drugs, particularly those cases whereby the dermatologist is requested to issue a report and asked to comment on the safety and viability of readministration of a specific drug. We describe aspects associated with these events, presenting a detailed analysis of each of them."
