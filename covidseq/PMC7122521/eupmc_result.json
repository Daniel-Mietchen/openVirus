    "Nanotechnology involves the production, manipulation, and use of materials ranging in size from less than a micron to that of individual atoms, is an emerging field of modern science, and utilizes nanoscaled systems. Nanoparticles (NPs) are being viewed as fundamental building blocks of nanotechnology. Although nanomaterials may be synthesized using chemical approaches, it is now possible to include the use of biological systems such as bacteria, fungi, and plants. Currently, silver nanoparticles have shown great importance due to its large surface ratio and unique properties with myriad activities applicable in a number of applied sectors including microbial resistant applications (antibacterial/antifungal/anticancer/antiviral), water treatment, protective dressings, catalysis, and optical devices. This chapter encompasses the fabrication methods and dispersed applications of silver nanoparticles."
