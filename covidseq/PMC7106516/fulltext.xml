The dispersion of different human communities around the globe has exposed each population to different infectious agents, exerting a <bold>selective pressure</bold> (see <xref rid="glos0010" ref-type="glossary">Glossary</xref>) on them; thus, adaptation to the new environment has favored the selection of the most beneficial genetic variants for the host. As a result, infectious agents have caused the expansion of alleles behind the induction of either protection or tolerance to these diseases; heritable variations, that increased the survival to deadly infectious agents, may have been naturally selected before the hosts had the opportunity to reproduce [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Natural selection driven by pathogens is probably more remarkable for those infectious agents that have been among us for a longer time, namely the causative agents of well-known diseases such as leprosy, smallpox, malaria, or tuberculosis. The genetic imprint of pathogen-driven selection depends on the length and the virulence of the infections and also the geographical distribution.</p><p id="p0040">The human genome presents more than 5000 <bold>genetic loci</bold> with traces of selective pressure [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This group includes more than 300 immune-related genes with functional variations between populations, which are probably behind the variability of responses to immune-related diseases reported nowadays [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides natural selection, other evolutionary mechanisms, such as <bold>genetic drift</bold>, greatly influence the frequencies of the genetic variants found within diverse populations throughout the world [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<xref rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>

Mutations, genetic drift, migration, and environmental selective pressure are among the fundamental processes behind the evolution of humans. The influence of these mechanisms in the diverse communities that were mobilized and then became isolated, as well as severe external factors such as epidemics, caused successive genetic bottlenecks in populations (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> in main text) [<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Human evolutionary studies are currently considered under &#x02018;<bold>modern synthesis</bold>&#x02019;, which merges Darwin's ideas of natural selection with theoretical population genetics and Mendelian principles, stating that evolution occurs via small genetic changes that are regulated by natural selection [<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These beneficial adaptations subsequently expand within the members of a population and become evident in the ancestral specificity and the geographical distribution of the advantageous alleles in the genomes of contemporary humans<italic>.</italic>

These events limit the genetic variation of a population and can lead to genetic drift.

In this review we offer a novel perspective on the role of infectious diseases as agents of natural selection and as forces behind the evolutionary pressure encountered by human ancestors and modern humans in their migrations around the globe. Specific genetic variants selected throughout different periods of human history may have influenced immune responses of present-day populations against pathogenic microorganisms and may have played a role in the development of certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Examples of Evolutionary Pressures Providing Protection in African Populations</title><p id="p0050">The majority of experts agree that Africa is where our species originated. Genetic studies conducted in diverse contemporary populations suggest connections with ancestors that lived on the continent up to 350 000 years ago [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Malaria</title><p id="p0055">Pathogens have played a central role as agents of natural selection from those very early days. Among various infectious diseases, malaria has exerted the highest evolutionary pressure on the communities across the African continent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>
) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Populations remaining in sub-Saharan Africa have been exposed to malaria for such long periods of time that their genetic structures have been shaped by the severity of malaria (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> sp.) infections. In 1954, Allison described that sickle cell disease distribution was confined to Africa and was associated with the geographical presence of malaria [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This finding led to the more recent description of the existence of mutations in the Hemoglobin-B (<italic>HBB</italic>) gene as a result of natural selection driven by evolutionary pressure for protection against malaria [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
). Similarly to <italic>HBB</italic>, some areas of West Africa with a high incidence of malaria present a high frequency of Hemoglobin-C (<italic>HBC)</italic> in their populations, which is associated with a 30&#x02013;93% decrease in the possibility of developing the disease [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is also the case for the <bold>Duffy antigen receptor gene</bold> (<italic>DARC</italic>) in erythrocytes and <bold>single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</bold> in human leukocyte antigen (<italic>HLA</italic>), which have been associated with protection against <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria in certain areas of Africa where this disease is endemic [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another example of natural selection driven by evolutionary pressure for protection against malaria are <bold>thalassemia (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;)</bold> pathologies, a group of hemoglobin disorders that presents an incidence of up to 30% among communities of West Africa [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The human <italic>CASP12</italic> T<sup>125</sup>C SNP, expression of which is restricted to the African subcontinent, South America, and certain areas of Asia, can modulate immune and inflammatory responses to malaria by antagonizing interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling in innate immune cells; moreover, caspase 12-deficient mice (<italic>Casp12</italic>

However, others have questioned these findings, given that caspase 12-deficient mice also lack caspase 11 expression, so the effects observed might not be specific to caspase 12 [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Main Genetic Adaptations to Malaria.</p><p>Malaria is one of the greatest causes of morbidity and mortality in the history of humanity. Most human populations with a long history of endemic malaria have evolved genetic adaptations to malaria parasites due to the strong selective pressure that this infection has exerted. Since the parasite infects erythrocytes, the evolutionary pressure has selected genetic variants that affect red blood cells and, therefore, the survival of the parasite as well. Genetic variants conferring resistance to the disease have spread through human populations over time, including several abnormal hemoglobins that protect against malaria but usually cause erythrocyte-associated diseases in the populations where these adaptations are prevalent.

This long-standing relationship between humans and MTB probably underlies the large variety of immune-related factors that modulate susceptibility to MTB infection, including vitamin D receptor (VDR), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (SLC11A1), TIR Domain Containing Adaptor Protein (TIRAP), HLA, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

From these early migrations, local populations such as the Denisovans and Neanderthals evolved [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These lineages were not geographically isolated, but lived side by side with modern humans and interbred with them, leaving a genetic footprint in their common progeny. Accordingly, 1&#x02013;4% of the genome of European and Asian populations is thought to derive from these now-extinct hominid lineages [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0070">Neanderthals spent close to 600 000 years adapting to their environment and their immune systems were shaped by the infections they faced. By interbreeding with archaic humans, modern humans incorporated these advantageous adaptations in the genome of their descendants. This was highlighted by different studies that showed that the introgression of diverse genes related to immune functions, such as the <bold>OAS cluster</bold>, TLR1, or the <bold>histocompatibility complex</bold> from Denisovans and Neanderthals shaped the genetic landscape of present-day Eurasian, but not African, communities. Genomic sequences and expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines from 421 individuals of European and African ancestry confirmed that the <italic>TLR1&#x02013;TLR6&#x02013;TLR10</italic> genetic loci, presenting signs of local positive selection and repeated introgression from both Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], showed a significantly higher expression in individuals carrying archaic-like alleles than in individuals carrying the nonintrogressed modern human alleles [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The expression of these genes has shaped human immune responses against different types of pathogens.

The most accepted scenario argues that HIV originated in simians and was transmitted to humans in West Africa in the 1920s, likely due to local ingestion of ape meat infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus. Around 1960, the virus reached wide parts of the continent and finally spread overseas thanks to a group of Haitian professors coming back from Africa. In the following decades, the virus spread worldwide and generated the pandemic we now know. Today, there are approximately 37 million people worldwide living with HIV-1/AIDS [<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. CCR5 is a receptor of chemokines that plays a fundamental role in HIV-1 pathogenesis and it is also one of the most promising targets to restrict the infection, since mutations in this receptor turn individuals resistant [<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].

These studies highlight certain genetic links to inflammatory predisposition/manifestation. However, increased proinflammatory activity is a double-edged sword. In the absence of regular pathogen challenges that require maintained modulation of the balance between inflammation and suppression of the immune response, the organism can overreact to inflammatory stimuli and trigger exacerbated responses. For instance, descendants of African populations generally present higher susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune syndromes such as inflammation-associated carcinomas, lupus, asthma, and multiple sclerosis (MS), the overall prevalence of which is up to three times higher in individuals with African ancestry relative to individuals with European ancestry [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">There are extensive differences in immune cell gene expression between Americans with African and European ancestry.

Viruses can also influence the severity of infections caused by other viruses.

However, these conditions may have reduced the exposure to viral and microbial agents that help the immune system to develop tolerance during childhood. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the lack of exposure to microbial agents in the early stages of life is related to a higher risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions, based on the fact that children that are exposed to higher amounts of microbial stimuli (e.g., by growing on farms) are less prone to develop allergies and asthma [<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

The number of studies of the potential role of epigenetic inheritance in shaping the human immune system is still scarce. However, different experiences undergone by certain communities indicate that these mechanisms might be important. For example, the babies of pregnant women who suffered during the early stages of pregnancy (the effects of the Dutch Hunger Winter in 1944), 60 years later showed reduced DNA methylation marks in several genes that control metabolism and cell differentiation during development, such as <italic>IGF2</italic>, <italic>PIM3</italic>, <italic>TXNIP</italic>, <italic>ABCG1</italic>, <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, and <italic>METTL8</italic>, compared with their siblings [<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].

These specific genetic variants are able to boost the host response against pathogens by improving the sensing of microbial ligands but can also lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system responds to endogenous ligands and induces abnormal responses targeted against the host&#x02019;s own tissues. Of note, it is very difficult to assign certain variants, a specific role in the protection or induction of autoimmunity. To assign changes in the genetic landscape of human populations to certain diseases is an extraordinary challenge. Moreover, our species is in constant evolutionary interaction with various microorganisms and viruses. Populations of bacteria and their viruses (phages) undergo, under natural conditions, reciprocal evolution in terms of resistance and infection; this, in turn, also affects the evolutionary traits of our immune system.

However, these methods also have limitations associated with the difficulty in linking gene variations to clinical phenotypes and disease, the generation of false positives, or the high number of samples necessary to reach reliable conclusions. Expanding the heterogeneity of populations studied for immune gene association studies relevant to disease will be key, as generally, a large focus is placed on certain European or American communities, thus generating results that are difficult to extrapolate to other populations.</p><p id="p0175">The knowledge of the evolutionary and genetic basis of human immune traits and their impact on diverse pathologies (e.g., autoimmunity, infections, inflammatory diseases, cancer) increasingly suggests that the genetic basis of disease may be derived from a large number of rare variants of modest effect. The mechanisms described here acquire special importance in the current scenario of world globalization, in which the migration fluxes and the admixture of different populations are reaching unprecedented levels, allowing faster expansion of advantageous alleles. However, these processes may also accelerate the spread of new epidemics, as seen in the cases of HIV infection, or more recently, SARS-CoV, Ebola, and chikungunya viruses; as well as the emergence of multiresistant bacteria and fungi, such as methicillin-resistant <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> or <italic>Candida auris</italic>.
