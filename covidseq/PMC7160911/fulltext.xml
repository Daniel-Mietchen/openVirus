it to spread rapidly around the world. Attempts at slowing the
pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of
diagnostic tests performed. We propose that the olfactory
epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate
tissue for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages,
prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as
compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here
we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the
likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple
non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium
express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that
facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation.
This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported
cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover,
the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be
considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we
discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may
initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease.
We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on
additional aspects of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the nervous system,
especially in the olfactory pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>ACE2 expression</kwd><kwd>TMPRSS2 expression</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>respiratory epithelium</kwd><kwd>olfactory epithelium</kwd><kwd>viral brain infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>cn0c00172</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>cn0c00172</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Fast, Sensitive, and Reliable Tests Are Critical to Slow down a
Pandemic</title><p>An important factor accelerating the spread of COVID-19 is the high infectivity
of this virus. It is related to extraordinarily ability of spike
glycoprotein to bind to host receptor with much higher affinity as compared
to related SARS-CoV virus. Lower thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
has also been suggested as a factor contributing to its high
infectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Although SARS-CoV-2 testing is
currently very efficient, public health care systems do not have the
capacity to test all the citizens. Thus, the identification of infected but
asymptomatic people should be one of the priorities and this should be done
as early as possible. Currently, assays that are based on real-time RT-PCR
technique are recommended for early detection of the virus. Theoretically,
procedures based on RT-PCR are able to detect even a small number of viral
RNA particles in biological samples. However, in practice, due to several
technical factors, there must be much more viral load in the biological
material collected to achieve a reliable diagnosis. Typically nasal and
pharyngeal swabs as well as sputum are used as the starting biological
material for SARS-CoV-2 testing. It is assumed that this strategy is very
efficient in diagnosing infected individuals 5&#x02013;7 days after onset of
symptoms. Unfortunately, it is less efficient in detecting SARS-CoV-2 within
1&#x02013;4 days after symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore,
other types of biological samples should be identified to detect SARS-CoV-2
more efficiently about the time of infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 Affinity to the Respiratory Epithelium in the Nasal Cavity Is
Likely Moderate</title><p>Because the nasal cavity is the main gate for SARS-CoV-2 entrance, epithelial
cells located within this area can be considered as appropriate clinical
sample for early virus detection. The nasal cavity contains three main types
of mucosa: squamous, respiratory, and olfactory epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Importantly, all these cells are
easily accessible for collection by medical staff. According to some gene
expression data deposited in databases such as GEO and MGI, respiratory
epithelial cells (RECs) express both of the SARS-CoV-2 human proteins
required for host cell entry, namely, ACE2 and TRMPSS2 transmembrane
proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>).
On the other hand, recent single cell RNaseq studies in humans showed only
TMPRSS2 expression in RECs without detecting ACE2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Other
RNaseq studies showed rather low levels of ACE2 in RECs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup>
However, according to the mouse atlas, in embryonic RECs, ACE2 expression
was clearly shown by in situ hybridization but TMPRSS2 expression was not
examined by this approach. Taken together, current data suggest that RECs
present in the nasal cavity express rather low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
proteins as compared to epithelial cells located at lower parts of the human
respiratory pathway. However, it should be emphasized that the expression
data in RECs are clearly incomplete and require further detailed
examination. Before drawing a final conclusions about SARS-CoV-2 affinity to
these cells, different aspects such as age-dependence and possible effects
of pathological conditions on ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression should also be
addressed, preferably at cell-type resolution.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Diagram of human nasal cavity with respiratory and olfactory

and Brain Entrance</title><p>Another suitable source of biological samples for early SARS-CoV-2 detection is
the olfactory epithelium (OE), which is easily accessible within the nasal
cavity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Recent reports
indicate that total anosmia or partial loss of the sense of smell are early
markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon may be caused by different
and yet unidentified factors, e.g., &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d; initiated
in some patients or direct damage of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)
located in the olfactory epithelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). The latter possibility is particularly
likely due to the fact that cells located in the OE express both protein
receptors required for effiecient SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Several
data sets deposited in gene expression databases show relatively high
expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human and murine olfactory mucosa
(<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). In mammals, OE is
a continuously regenerating multilayer structure containing both neuronal
and non-neuronal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>).
The key question is whether ACE2 and TRMPSS2 expression in the OE is
neuronal or non-neuronal or whether it occurs in both cell types. Neuronal
expression of host receptors will likely facilitate SARS-CoV-2 brain
infection through the uptake into ciliated dendrites/soma and subsequent
anterograde axonal transport along the olfactory nerve. Non-neuronal
expression of ACE2/TRMPSS2 may possibly establish nasal cavity OE as a virus
reservoir. Three major RNaseq transcriptome studies conducted in human and
murine OE consistently suggest non-neuronal expression of
ACE2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Hence, ACE2 expression is not clearly detected in
mature ORNs, which are the only OE neurons connected to the brain.
Expression of TMPRS2 seems to be higher compared to that of ACE2 and takes
place likely in both neuronal and non-neuronal OE
cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> One state-of-the-art RNaseq study showed
intriguingly mosaic TMPRSS2 expression which occurs only in subpopulation of
mature ORNs, even though the majority of other genes were more evenly
expressed in these neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> It suggests that some
olfactory neurons in the OE may be more vulnerable for viral infection than
other morphologically similar ORNs. Moreover, expression of murine ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 evaluated by microarrays has a tendency to increase with age (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>). If it is true in humans,
then in elderly people the OE may be more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2
accumulation. However, it should be remembered that although ACE2 is a
mandatory factor for viral entry into the cell, TMPRSS2 can probably be
replaced by other proteases from this family such as TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11A,
11D, and 11E1. Of these proteases, only TMPRSS4 is also present in the OE,
likely in immature neurons and in non-neuronal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Basic organization of the olfactory epithelium (OE). Olfactory

the major site of infection, the brain was also involved in some patients.
In addition, it was shown in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 that
SARS-CoV infected the brain through ORNs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Genetically
modified mice express only human ACE2 and not human TMPRSS2. This may
additionally suggest that murine ORNs express endogenous TMPRSS2, because
both proteins are required for efficient infection. Intriguingly, there was
an approximately 60 h delay from the time of nasal infection until SAR-CoV
virus detection in the olfactory bulb. During that time the virus likely
replicated and accumulated in different OE cells, because its subsequent
transport to further parts of the brain required a relatively short time of
an additional 12&#x02013;20 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The results from
transgenic hACE2 mice indicate that SARS-CoV probably uses
transneuronal/transsynaptic routes employing axonal transport in the brain
and this can also be true for SARS-CoV-2. It is known for other viruses,
e.g., rabies virus, that they can hijack existing vesicular axonal transport
machineries to spread within the brain. There is very recent evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 enters early and late endosomal compartments in non-neuronal
cells; thus, it may possibly be directed to the vesicular axonal pathway in
neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> However, it should be remembered that the
hACE2 mouse is an overexpressor model with expression of human ACE2
controlled by human keratin K18 promoter. For this reason, alternative and
more physiological knock-in models for SARS-CoV-2 studies in the nervous
system would be desirable. Alternatively to the olfactory axonal route,
SARS-CoV-2 may pass from non-neuronal OE cells directly to cerebrospinal
fluid surrounding olfactory nerve bundles, located near the cribriform
plate. Once in cerebrospinal fluid, the virus could reach most of the brain
areas including <italic>medulla oblongata</italic> where cardiorespiratory
controlling nuclei are located.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Brain infection in COVID-19 patients is currently being seriously considered
because of many reports of neurological impairments such as stroke, epilepsy
,and encephalitis. The ACE2 expression in glia and in neurons in the brain
is low but also well documented. But the specific sites where SARS-CoV-2
enters the brain are not clearly identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Mature
olfactory neurons present in the OE are probably one such place. However,
SARS-CoV-2 virus must first invade high ACE2-expressing yet unidentified
non-neuronal OE cells and then pass to low-ACE2-expressing mature ORNs to be
finally transported along olfactory axons to the brain. A good candidate for
such cells is specialized glia known as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs).
OECs were previously shown to enhance human herpesvirus-6 replication and
accumulation in the OE before virus infected the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup>
Many studies have already shown that this type of glia cells can supply
axons with macromolecules by way of exosomes and this could be a mechanism
of ACE2-independent virus transfer from OEC to ORN axons.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Olfactory Neurons in OE May Mediate Antiviral Responses</title><p>It is known that the nervous system can shape responses of the innate immunity
system. ORNs which are located with direct contact with the external
environment are ideally suited for that role. Recetly it was shown in fish
that ORNs initiate ultrarapid immune responses after binding rhabdovirus
surface glycoprotein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The virus binding results in
neuronal activation and proinflammatory effects in OE but inhibits
inflammation in the brain. As a consequence, some neurons undergo apoptosis,
which may inhibit the reception of olfactory stimuli for some time. This
data reveals the possible universal role of ORNs as first line viral sensors
and initiators of antiviral protective immune responses. Based on the above
conclusion, there is an exciting possibility that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ORNs
initiates that kind of rapid immune response. Induction of the innate immune
system through ORNs does not necessarily have to be mediated by ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, but it may require additional yet unidentified host protein(s) with
the ability to transmit intracellular signaling. From this point of view,
infected people who show signs of olfactory dysfunctions may actually
represents those individuals with faster and/or stronger immune response and
better body mobilization against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it
will be interesting to examine groups of patients with and without olfactory
dysfunction and correlate it with the severity of their symptoms and
percentage of recovery. Intriguingly, older patients which are known to be
much more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also those who have their
sense of smell compromised simply because of their age. Reduced numbers of
ORNs in older people can potentially slow down their early immune response
and, consequently, lead to more severe COVID-19 symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title><p>There are many reasons to urgently start thorough studies on the role of the OE
in SARS-CoV-2 binding, accumulation, and brain infection and of
participating in the early response of the immune system. Primarily, the OE
may possibly serve as a tissue source for early virus detection to minimize
false-negative test results. Analyzing viral loads in OE may also improve
virus detection in asymptomatic individuals. Second, it should be noted that
brain infection may cause delayed and long-lasting neurological impairment
even in patients who no longer show respiratory symptoms and are currently
considered recovered. Therefore, there is a need to establish which cell
types in the OE bind and accumulate virus particles and whether the virus is
transferred between OE cells. The large-scale transcriptomic data are only
an approximation, and they lack the necessary resolution which can only be
achieved by in vivo studies focused on single proteins. The transgenic hACE2
mouse together with epidemiologic COVID-19 data suggest a very dangerous
phenomenon that hypothetical coronavirus with more neurotropic properties
could be much more deadly to humans. By examining complex interactions of
SARS-CoV-2 with the cells present within the OE, we could be better prepared
for that type of virus. Future studies should also investigate how
age-related differences affect SARS-CoV-2 actions in the OE. Finally, the
scenario that the OE/ORN is involved in mediating the rapid response of the
immune system is well worth investigating and must be experimentally
verified. Epidemiological data should be collected to search for potential
correlation between olfactory dysfunction and COVID-19 symptoms as well as
severity.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="funding-statement" id="notes1"><p>This publication has been supported by a grant of Polish National Science
