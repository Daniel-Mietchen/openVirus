The priorities are 2-fold in the management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection or persons under investigation (PUI): (1) caring for the range of asymptomatic to critically ill pregnant and postpartum women; (2) protecting health care workers and beyond from exposure during the delivery hospitalization (health care providers, personnel, family members).

The goal of this review is to provide evidence-based recommendations or, when evidence is limited, expert opinionfor anesthesiologists caring for pregnant women during the COVID 19 pandemic with a focus on preparedness and best clinical obstetric anesthesia practice.</p><sec><title>CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF COVID-19 INFECTION IN PREGNANCY</title><p>In principle, the clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection in China have been consistent with those reported among nonpregnant adults, with better maternal and neonatal outcomes with COVID-19 infection compared with the 2002&#x02013;2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak from SARS CoV 1 infection.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection in a large data set in nonpregnant patients from China were fever (99%), fatigue (70%), cough (59%), shortness of breath (31%), myalgias (35%), headache (6.5%), sore throat (17%), diarrhea (10%), nausea (10%), and vomiting (4%).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> An additional manifestation noted among patients with COVID-19 infection is the sudden loss (or reduction) of the sense of smell and taste, which is currently recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery as part of screening for COVID-19 infection.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>In pregnancy, presentation of COVID-19 infection appears similar, but many of these nonspecific symptoms may be attributed to symptoms of pregnancy and labor.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For example, signs of latent labor may include myalgias and diarrhea; preeclampsia can present with headache; shortness of breath is perceived during pregnancy and labor; and chorioamnionitis may cause tachycardia and fever, thus,leading clinicians to overlook COVID-19 infection as a possible diagnosis. In addition, women infected with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic until their admission in labor and beyond,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which in itself poses a significant risk of exposure for their family members (including the newborn) and all providers involved in their clinical care.</p></sec><sec><title>CONSIDERATIONS FOR TESTING ON ADMISSION</title><p>Screening criteria for COVID-19 infection usually include the following: (1) fever, (2) cough or shortness of breath, (3) diarrhea, and (4) any possible exposure to COVID-19. However, because women with COVID-19 infection may be asymptomatic at the time of admission and because some may present with overlapping pregnancy symptoms, universal screening may miss pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in communities with a high prevalence or high projected infection rate (eg, New York, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Miami).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Universal testing with real-time reverse transcriptase&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) may improve case detection in high prevalence communities. However, current assays may return false-negative results if the viral load is low or if specimen collection is incomplete.</p><p>The goals of COVID-19 testing specific to pregnant patients admitted to labor and delivery units are 2-fold: (1) to prevent vertical transmission and ensure separation of the neonate after birth and (2) to protect health care workers by ensuring use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Besides the unclear sensitivity of RT-PCR testing, the time for nucleic acid detection varies between 6 and 8 hours or longer depending on availability. Therefore, management of women on Labor and Delivery Units located in a community with a high prevalence of COVID-19 infection should err on the side of caution.</p><p>For purposes of clinical management and PPE use, women may therefore be categorized as follows (1) COVID-19 negative, (2) asymptomatic, (3) symptomatic (persons under investigation [PUI]), and (4) personally positive for COVID-19 testing. This information should be made available to all health care providers and updated at all times as it may change during the course of labor (from asymptomatic to symptomatic or, if tested, once the result becomes available).</p><p>Women who are COVID-19 positive (or high-risk PUI) should ideally be placed in an isolation room. Airborne infection isolation rooms (single-patient negative-pressure rooms with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour), if available, should be used if performance of aerosolizing procedures is anticipated. In general, isolation rooms suitable for droplet and contact precautions are recommended.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Strategies for exposure mitigation and cohorting, as well as considerations for transportation of patients who are PUI or COVID-19 should follow the same recommendations as for general patient cases.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>SYSTEMS PREPARATION</title><p>A multidisciplinary team of anesthesiologists, obstetricians, labor and delivery nurses, neonatologists, critical care experts, infectious disease and infection control experts, employee health services, environmental health services, and telemedicine services should create and implement protocols to support the management of patients with COVID-19 infection in the setting of a Labor and Delivery Unit. A side-by-side comparison of recommendations from many professional societies for labor and delivery units is presented in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For institutions with multiple labor and delivery sites, consideration should be given to designating 1 institution to care for patients with COVID-19 infection. This proved useful in managing patients during the SARS epidemic and for cases in the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13"

Therefore, ongoing assessment of both maternal and fetal statuses are key to balance risks of prolonged labor versus cesarean delivery. It is unclear whether uterine decompression improves maternal respiratory status and how the potential benefit balances against the known operative risks in the setting of COVID-19. On the other hand, prolonged maternal hypoxemia may ultimately cause fetal acidemia, leading to a more urgent cesarean delivery.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Routine monitoring should include frequent vital signs (tailored to the current clinical status and adjusted as necessary) with the addition of continuous pulse oximetry and strict input and output measurements to assure fluid restriction. Pulse oximetry goal should be an oxygen saturation &#x02265;95%. Early warning criteria systems specific for obstetric patients may aid in early detection and prompt escalation of care.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Women requiring supplemental oxygen, who develop increasing oxygen requirements or worsening hypoxia (pulse oximetry [Sp<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>] &#x0003c; 95%), should have prompt arterial blood gas analysis with frequent clinical reassessment to guide the requirement for escalation of care and mechanical ventilation. High-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation may be considered as temporizing measures but are generally discouraged due to the potential for greater aerosolization. In addition, increasing oxygen requirements serve as a marker of disease progression, with increasing risk of atelectasis and pulmonary consolidation. It is recommended to perform early endotracheal intubation in a controlled manner minimizing exposure to health care workers and equipment with airborne precautions in an urgent/emergent situation.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>One of the frequent complications of patients with COVID-19 is acuterespiratorydistresssyndrome(ARDS).

All health care workers in the room should wear contact (impervious gown and gloves) and droplet (surgical mask and eye protection) precautions. The patient should wear a surgical mask at all times to limit droplet spread, and the number of personnel present during placement of neuraxial labor analgesia should be minimized but with assistance readily available.
