<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para30">Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a zoonotic viral respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS is under active surveillance scrutiny by WHO, and so far there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent disease and viral spread. MVA-MERS-S, a novel vaccine candidate based on the recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine vector platform, has been reported to be safe and immunogenic in mice and dromedary camels. We searched <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs30">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> on Aug 23, 2019, with the keywords &#x0201c;MERS&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;vaccine&#x0201d;; five studies were listed. Except for one study that evaluated immunoglobulins as treatment against MERS, the other four tested MERS vaccine platforms. Three of these vaccine platforms were to be tested in phase 1 trials: ChAdox1, MVA, and a DNA vaccine, with the latter progressing to a phase 1/2a trials. The DNA vaccine phase 1 trial was done in the USA and a phase 1/2a study was recently initiated in Seoul (South Korea). The first human data on a MERS vaccine candidate were published in July, 2019, presenting the safety and immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine candidate GLS-5300. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity data of the first MVA viral vector vaccine candidate against MERS proceeding to clinical trials.</p><p id="para40">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para50">This study provides comprehensive results of a phase 1 trial testing an MVA vector-based vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV-S protein. The study reveals a benign safety profile of MVA-MERS-S and provides first insight into the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Participants who received the high dose of 1&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU) experienced mild-to-moderate adverse events and showed seroconversion, and 91% of these patients showed T-cell responses. The low-dose group (1&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>7</sup> PFU) showed a similar safety profile, seroconversion in 75% of participants, and T-cell immunity in 83% of participants.</p><p id="para60">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para70">In the aftermath of the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa in 2013&#x02013;16, WHO has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens, including MERS-CoV. The data presented here support the further clinical development of the candidate vaccine MVA-MERS-S and add critical insight into the field of vaccine research against coronaviruses and other emerging pathogens.</p></boxed-text>
</p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para80">Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness under active surveillance by WHO, and, in 2015, it was placed on the list of priority diseases with high epidemic potential that warrant urgent research and development of countermeasures.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> As a disease of the lower respiratory tract in humans, MERS can progress rapidly from unspecific, influenza-like symptoms to severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.</p><p id="para90">The causative agent of MERS is MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Dromedary camels serve as reservoir hosts, and the majority of primary human cases can be traced back to close or frequent contact with dromedaries. Additionally, human-to-human transmission is amplified in health-care settings, adding health-care workers to the populations at high risk.</p><p id="para100">As of Jan 31, 2020, 2519 cases have been reported, with 866 deaths in 27 countries, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 34&#x000b7;3%.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Large MERS outbreaks occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2014 (255 cases and 93 deaths)<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and in South Korea in 2015 (186 cases and 38 deaths).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although transmission is predominantly reported from the Arabian Peninsula, there is a high risk of exporting cases to areas outside the Middle East as a result of travel. So far, supportive therapy, isolation of patients, and contact tracing remain the main pillars of MERS treatment and prevention, highlighting the urgent need to develop countermeasures such as vaccines to block transmission and combat potential future disease outbreaks.</p><p id="para110">The development of MERS vaccine candidates has been challenging because the determinants of protective immunity remain incompletely understood and the limited number of MERS cases has made it difficult to do efficacy trials. Although optimal animal models for the identification of protective immune correlates for MERS are still scarce, current mouse models suggest a crucial role for antibodies and T cells in the induction of protective immunity.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In humans, one study showed a positive correlation of CD4 T-cell responses and neutralising antibodies with severe disease progression, and a positive correlation of strong virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses with reduced morbidity;<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> conversely, another study reported a positive association between early CD8 T-cell responses and disease severity in acute MERS-CoV infection.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> A role of antibodies in protection was shown in mice that received convalescent sera from survivors.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The animal and human data underline that a MERS vaccine candidate should preferentially induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and that the timing and dose of a vaccine could be crucial for protection.</p><p id="para120">In this study, we used the recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vaccine vector platform, which has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> MVA vaccine candidates have demonstrated a favourable safety profile in various populations and disease settings.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 subunits and mediates viral attachment to host cells, entry, and membrane fusion.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> It is a target for neutralising antibodies and, therefore, vaccine development.

Adverse events were classified as mild (no interference with activities of daily living), moderate (interference with daily living activities, but pose no substantial or permanent risks to the participants), or severe (considerably affect daily living and clinical status). Adverse events were assessed and categorised on the basis of whether they were solicited (expected and therefore predefined in the protocol) or unsolicited events. Solicited events included both local (pain, induration, redness, haematoma, and swelling at injection site) and systemic adverse events (fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, loose stools, abdominal cramps, and nausea). Unsolicited adverse events were all other events not defined as solicited and all events that arose between days 14 and 28 as well as after day 42 (14 days after the booster vaccination). The occurrence of serious adverse events was monitored throughout the study. A serious adverse event was defined as any event that results in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospital admission or caused prolongation of an existing hospital stay, resulted in persistent disability, or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Adverse events were listed and graded by study personnel according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 67&#x02013;68</xref>).</p><p id="para200">Serum was analysed at days 0, 28, 35, 42, 56, 84, and 180 to evaluate humoral immune responses.

A phytohemagglutinin pool and a cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and influenza peptide pool (JPT Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany) served as positive controls, and serum-free medium (Cellular Technology) supplemented with dimethyl sulphoxide served as negative controls. A response was defined as positive when two criteria were met: first, more than 50 spot-forming cells (SFCs) per million PBMCs; and second, the number of SFCs per million PBMCs was more than four times higher than the baseline (day 0) value.

However, it should be noted that although animal studies indicate a crucial role for antibodies in protection against MERS, the human data available from MERS-CoV-infected individuals so far did not reveal a clear and strong correlation between MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses and MERS-CoV viral load.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p><p id="para520">Reports on individuals with MERS-CoV infection revealed predominantly T-cell responses as opposed to antibody responses in survivors as well as exposed dromedary camel workers.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Although it has not yet been determined that T-cell responses are crucial for MERS-CoV clearance in humans, animal models have provided evidence that T cells support viral clearance in mice.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In this study, we detected vaccine-induced T-cell responses against MERS-CoV spike, which were present even before the second immunisation. Responses persisted until day 180 in a third of study participants (seven [32%] of 22 participants), suggesting that vaccine-induced T-cell responses were maintained slightly longer than humoral immune responses (three [14%] of 22 participants). We observed stronger and more robust T-cell responses in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. Although this finding was not significant, it might be considered in future studies that focus on dose finding when including a larger number of participants. However, the exact contribution of T-cell immunity to vaccine-induced or natural protection against the disease and viral clearance remains to be determined and needs further investigation.</p><p id="para530">To complement our analyses on vaccine-induced immunity to the MERS-CoV spike antigenic insert of the vector vaccine, we also investigated vector immunity to the MVA backbone. MVA-specific humoral responses against the MVA vector were assessed post-hoc using a virus neutralisation test assay against wild-type MVA to address their potential effect on MERS-CoV spike-specific antibodies. Although MVA-specific neutralising antibodies were induced, no correlation with MERS-CoV-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed. Currently, there is no strong evidence that induced or pre-existing MVA-specific immunity interferes with vaccine-induced immune responses when using MVA as a vector. Our study and the trial using MVA-H5-sfMR<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> show that MVA-based vaccines can elicit antibody responses against the antigenic insert following the second and third immunisation, despite the induction of anti-vector immunity after the prime injection. The exact impact of pre-existing immune responses against MVA requires further investigation in future studies.</p><p id="para540">Rapid induction of vaccine-induced immunity following single-shot vaccination schemes is considered to be particularly useful in outbreak scenarios; however, MVA-MERS-S showed no induction of strong MVA-MERS-S-specific immune responses following a single prime vaccination, which might reduce its direct applicability in acute outbreak scenarios. In the context of limited human data on correlates of protection, it is currently challenging to predict whether MVA-MERS-S is suitable for rapidly evolving epidemic situations, because it remains unclear which specific parameters are relevant for the defence against MERS-CoV. It is conceivable that homologous MVA prime&#x02013;boost vaccination might not be the final and optimised vaccination schedule for MVA-MERS-S. Different strategies including heterologous prime&#x02013;boost regimens should be evaluated in future trials. Several MERS vaccine candidates are currently being tested in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is funding five different vaccine platforms, with MVA-MERS-S, ChAdOx1, and DNA being the most advanced. In the first MERS vaccine trial in humans reported to date, which investigated a DNA-based vaccine (GLS-5300),<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> a homologous prime&#x02013;boost&#x02013;boost regime was used. Similar to our study, the authors observed a favourable safety profile and induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. Although seroreactivity and cellular responses were largely maintained over the study period of 60 weeks, neutralising antibodies were detectable in only 48% of vaccine recipients, peaked about 2 weeks after the second boost, and rapidly declined.</p><p id="para550">Additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether heterologous prime&#x02013;boost vaccination schedules with a MVA-MERS-S, ChAdOx1, or DNA prime and a boost with MVA-MERS-S can induce immune responses protective against MERS-CoV infection or can at least favourably modulate the MERS disease course.</p><p id="para560">Further studies are warranted to improve our detailed understanding of the role of antibody titres, neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies, and cellular immune responses in both natural and vaccine-induced protective MERS-CoV-specific immunity, to further enhance and accelerate strategic vaccine development against MERS. The ultimate assessment of vaccine efficacy will be challenging because outbreaks are unpredictable and the number of MERS cases has been relatively low.</p><p id="para570">Although the data presented here make a valuable contribution to the MERS vaccine agenda and enterprise, the study also has limitations. The restricted number of study participants in this phase 1 trial limits the generalisability of results and necessitates follow-up studies in larger cohorts. The study did also not include an additional late boost, which induced strong and increased antibody responses in a previous MVA-H5-sfMR trial.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> This early study format also did not allow for data generation on antibody dependent enhancement in the context of MERS-CoV infections, which has been previously discussed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Future studies in animal models, possibly including adoptive transfer experiments with sera derived from vaccinated individuals, as well as clinical trials will need to address this crucial aspect.</p><p id="para580">In conclusion, the phase 1 trial investigating the candidate vaccine MVA-MERS-S showed a benign safety profile and provides the first evidence of humoral and cellular immunogenicity induced by this candidate vaccine in humans. The data generated so far support its further development as a MERS vaccine candidate for homologous or heterologous vaccination schemes, possibly involving other viral vector vaccines. In 2018, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations included MVA-MERS-S in its funding portfolio to support scalable manufacturing and further clinical development to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in larger cohorts and endemic areas. The favourable profile of MVA-MERS-S might also make useful contributions for the development of future vaccine strategies against other coronavirus pathogens, such as the recently emerged SARS coronavirus 2. However, crucial knowledge gaps remain to be addressed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec100"><title>Data sharing</title><p>Individual participant data will be shared, including data dictionaries.
