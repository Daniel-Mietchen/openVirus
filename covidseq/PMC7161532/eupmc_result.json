    "OBJECTIVE:The study aimed to develop and validate a percentage body fat (%BF) prediction equation using SFT for Sri Lankan adults. METHODS:Healthy adults (≥18 years) were randomly selected and SFT was measured in five areas (triceps, biceps, calf, suprailliac and subscapular). Body composition analysis was evaluated by Deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution. Prediction equation for %BF was derived by linear-regression-analysis. RESULTS:Study population included 170 adults (Males: 32.9%; age: 43.2 ± 12.6 years). Final equation for %BF (r = 0.715, p < 0.001) correlated significantly D2O dilution derived %BF. CONCLUSIONS:The equation is suitable for estimation of %BF in Sri Lankan adults and is possibly appropriate for other South-Asian populations."
