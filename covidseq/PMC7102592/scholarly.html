Abstract</div> <p>Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO <sub>2</sub>)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO <sub>2</sub>), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0005">The clinical efficacy and safety evaluation of medical interventions are usually based on the measurement and analysis of certain clinical outcomes. However, studies have found that the outcomes used in clinical research are frequently inconsistent, nonstandard, irrational, or inessential, weakening the scientific and practical nature of research results and leading to research waste <a href="#b0005">[1]</a>, <a href="#b0010">[2]</a>, <a href="#b0015">[3]</a>. In order to overcome these problems, experts in evidence-based medicine and clinical research methodology have put forward strategies to develop core outcome sets (COSs). A COS refers to an agreed-upon standard set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. A COS is helpful to regularize outcomes adopted in clinical trials, so as to improve the practicability, comparability, and transparency of the results <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. In 2010, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative <a href="#fn2">†</a> was launched to promote research on COS by developing methodological guidelines. Thus far, a series of guidelines and handbooks have been published, including the COMET Handbook (version 1.0) <a href="#b0025">[5]</a>, the COS-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD) <a href="#b0030">[6]</a>, the COS-STAndards for Reporting (COS-STAR) <a href="#b0035">[7]</a>, and the COS-STAndardised Protocol Items (COS-STAP) <a href="#b0040">[8]</a>. </p> <p id="p0010">Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hundreds of clinical trial protocols have been registered and have begun subject recruitment. By 20 February 2020, 228 protocols were already listed in two clinical trial registries <a href="http://www.chictr.org.cn">www.chictr.org.cn</a> <sup>‡</sup>, <sup>‡‡</sup>. However, there were some deficiencies in the registered clinical trial protocols, especially in outcomes, such as nonstandardized descriptions, significant heterogeneity, subpar clinical value, and ambiguous measure points. Hence, it is necessary to develop a COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID), which is the aim of this study. </p> <p id="p0015">Researchers are encouraged to apply the COS-COVID for the evaluation of different interventions (either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical therapies) in clinical trials on COVID-19. A full spectrum of COVID-19 classifications is covered, ranging from mild and ordinary to severe and critical types, in addition to rehabilitation period. The COS-COVID can be used not only in clinical trials, but also in systematic reviews/meta-analyses, guidelines, and other research on evidence evaluation and decision-making for COVID-19. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Participants</div> <p id="p0025">In order to guarantee quality and efficiency in the development of the COS-COVID, a steering group with participants from different stakeholder groups was set up. This group comprised 20 members, including scholars in Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, and clinical pharmacology; statisticians; and medical journal editors. The participants were selected based on their specialty, recognition, and region. The clinical doctors within this group are experts in the field of respiratory and critical medicine, and have experience in the clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19. Experts on behalf of different interest groups participated in the whole research process. A coordination group, which was responsible for research process coordination and data analysis, was also established. </p> </div> <div class="informationsources" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Information sources</div> <p id="p0030">The two clinical trial registries <a href="#fn4">‡</a> <sup>,</sup> <a href="#fn5">††</a> were comprehensively searched to retrieve the outcomes used in clinical trials from 1 December 2019 to 12 February 2020. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case series, and cohort studies aimed at evaluating different interventions for COVID-19 were included. Studies that included suspected cases, diagnostic tests, and syndrome surveys were excluded. Clinical trials from the registries were screened by two reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A predesigned Excel spreadsheet was used to extract data, including design type, intervention, patient, outcome, and so forth. Information on outcomes, which was extracted by two authors independently, included the outcome name, measurement method, measurement time point, and data type. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. </p> <p id="p0035">The extracted outcome information was sorted by similarity. Duplicated outcomes were excluded, nonstandard outcomes were standardized, and synonym outcomes were merged. The process was carried out by two researchers independently, and the differences were resolved by discussion. </p> <p id="p0040">The outcomes obtained after data cleaning were assigned to seven different categories: clinical symptoms, physical and chemical detection, viral nucleic acid detection, quality of life, significant events, disease process, and safety indexes. In order to generate a preliminary list of outcomes for consensus, all the outcomes in each region were voted on for inclusion or not. An outcome would be removed from the preliminary list when 75% of the voting members voted it to be unnecessary. The remaining outcomes formed the preliminary list of outcomes. According to the different classifications of COVID-19, outcomes in the preliminary list were divided into five types: mild, ordinary, severe, critical, and rehabilitation period. </p> </div> <div class="consensusprocess" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.3</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

There was no conflict of interest among the different stakeholders. Before discussion on each outcome, the results of the two rounds of Delphi survey were shown to the participants of the meeting. Based on the Delphi survey results and discussion, the participants voted anonymously for each outcome, following the criteria of clinical value, clinical feasibility, and stability of indicators in different classifications of COVID-19. Each outcome that met the consensus standards was included in the final COS. At the end, the COS-COVID consisted of one outcome for mild (time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), four outcomes for ordinary (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for severe (composite events, length of hospital stay, PaO <sub>2</sub>/FiO <sub>2</sub>, duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function), as shown in <a href="#t0025">Table 5</a> . <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="t0025"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 5</span>  </div></p><p>The COS for clinical trials on COVID-19.</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Type (No.)</th> <th>Outcome</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Mild (1)</td> <td>Time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity <a href="#tblfn1">a</a> (d) </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ordinary (4)</td> <td>Length of hospital stay <a href="#tblfn2">b</a> (d) <br /><br />Composite events (total number of patients diagnosed as the types of severe <a href="#tblfn3">c</a>, critical, and all-cause death) <br /><br />Score of clinical symptoms <a href="#tblfn4">d</a> <br /><br />Time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Severe (5)</td> <td>Composite events (total number of patients diagnosed as type critical and all-cause death) <br /><br />Length of hospital stay (d) <br /><br />PaO <sub>2</sub>/FiO <sub>2</sub> <br /><br />Duration (d) of mechanical ventilation <br /><br />Time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Critical (1)</td> <td>All-cause mortality</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rehabilitation (1)</td> <td>Pulmonary function</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="table-wrap-foot_UNKNOWN"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">a</span> <p id="np005">Negativity: two consecutive negative results (sampling interval of at least 24 h) of the 2019-nCoV nucleic acids tests of respiratory pathogens. </p> </div> </div> <div class="table-wrap-foot_UNKNOWN"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">b</span> <p id="np010">Discharge standards: ① normal body temperature for more than three days; ② significant recovered respiratory symptoms; ③ lung imaging showing obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; ④ negativity of nucleic acids tests performed twice. </p> </div> </div> <div class="table-wrap-foot_UNKNOWN"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">c</span> <p id="np015">Severe type (meeting any of the following): ① respiratory rate ≥ 30 times·min <sup>-1</sup>; ② oxygen saturation &amp;lt;93% at a rest state; ③ PaO <sub>2</sub>/FiO <sub>2</sub> ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); ④ patients with &amp;gt;50% lesions progression within 24–48 h in pulmonary imaging.

Perspectives</div> <p id="p0105">This was a fast COS study conducted under special requirements and in a special environment. Nevertheless, the study was rigorously conducted and reported according to the COS-STAD and COS-STAR. The COS-COVID was accomplished on time and with clinical significance. We hope that all clinical trials and research on evidence transformation for COVID-19 can refer to the COS-COVID during protocol design and decision-making. </p> <p id="p0110">Three points must be illustrated for the rational application of the COS-COVID. First, although the COS is the minimum, it is not the only index that should be reported in every clinical study. Studies with different purposes can add other outcomes if necessary. Second, the COS is not equivalent to the primary outcomes. According to the main purposes of different studies, one or more outcomes in a COS can be selected as the primary outcomes. Third, there is no restriction on the treatment course and measure point in a given trial. However, they should be well-defined and based on scientific and feasible principles. For COVID-19, more than two weeks of treatment course are suggested. Safety outcomes were not included in the COS-COVID, because different drugs might have different adverse reactions. In addition, we suggest that researchers report all adverse events encountered during clinical trials. </p> <p id="p0115">There are several limitations in this study. First, the development of the outcome pool was only based on clinical trial protocols listed in two registry platforms. Doctors and patients were not consulted to collect indicators. Therefore, there is a potential risk of missing important outcomes. Second, due to the prevalence of new infectious diseases, patients were not invited to join in the survey and consensus process. As a result, patients’ opinions may not have been fully reflected. Third, the number of representatives for different stakeholders may not be fully adequate. The fact that the majority of the experts were from China weakens the regional representation. Fourth, the process of consensus was conducted via conference calls instead of through face-to-face meetings, which may have led to insufficient discussion and affected the consensus results. Finally, the current understanding of COVID-19 is still incomplete and in the process of being established, so the relevant evaluation outcomes and COS must be updated with the process of practice. Furthermore, we wish to strengthen communication with relevant international academic organizations to promote the application and update of the COS-COVID. </p> </div> <div class="COI-statement" title="COI-statement"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
