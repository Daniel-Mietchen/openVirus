    "Erythema multiforme in its most extreme form has traditionally been divided between toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. These two life-threatening skin diseases are now considered part of the same spectrum of disease. They can be differentiated by clinical and histological criteria. We can also now predict which patients are apt to have the most guarded prognosis. Treatment by multiple agents is imperfect, but offers a better chance of a good outcome than ever before."
