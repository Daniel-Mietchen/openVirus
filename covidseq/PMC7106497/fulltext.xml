Recent modelling studies have shown a significant risk of infection from as low as one oocyst [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].<boxed-text id="b0005"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Impact of Cryptosporidiosis</title></caption><p id="p0005">Cryptosporidiosis is a significant diarrhoeal disease in both people and animals worldwide. Young children and people with compromised immune systems are very vulnerable to disease and the importance of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in human health was first recognised during the AIDs epidemic in the 1980s [<xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. From 2007 to 2017 the global prevalence of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in HIV/AIDS patients was 10.9% [<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A large-scale epidemiology study involving 22 500 children in sub-Saharan Africa and south east Asia found that <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> was a major cause of severe diarrhoea in very young children and was the only gastrointestinal pathogen presenting a significant risk of death [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is also recognised as an important food-borne pathogen [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], being responsible for more than 8 million cases of food-borne illness annually [<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p id="p0010">Burden of disease studies, focussed on acute illness, estimate 4.2 million <bold>disability adjusted life years</bold> lost in children under 5 years [<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], with longer term sequelae, including growth faltering and cognitive defects. Disease impact studies in high-income countries found longer term impacts following acute infection involving persistent abdominal pain, myalgia/arthralgia and fatigue [<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], irritable bowel syndrome [<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and a recent study has shown a strong association between <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection and human colon cancer [<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Cryptosporidiosis is a major diarrhoeal disease in neonatal calves and other animals. In the cattle industry, production losses associated with the disease include death of the calf, costs incurred in the diagnosis, treatment and supportive therapies employed, and the extra costs of feed and husbandry for the animals to reach market weight [<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Cattle infected with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and monitored from birth to 210 days showed a correlation with infection and a lower live weight gain along with poorer production performance [<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Long-term production impacts on growth and carcase weights following acute cryptosporidiosis in lambs was also reported on Australian sheep farms [<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with contaminated water supplies can result in significant economic and health impacts. The large waterborne outbreak in Wisconsin affected 403 000 people and was estimated to cost USD 96.2 million [<xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In Sweden it was estimated that 50 000 sick leave days were attributed following a waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreak where the attack rate was 45% of 60 000 residents [<xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Detection of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> oocysts in public water supplies often results in condemnation of supplies, public notices to boil water, and provision of bottled water. In a recent waterborne outbreak in Ireland a boil water notice was put on for 158 days, affecting over 120 432 people and costing around EUR 19 million [<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="al0015"><p>Alt-text: Box 1</p></notes></boxed-text></p><p id="p0080">Infection occurs through oral ingestion of the oocyst stage of the parasite from contaminated faeces, food, drink, and pasture (for grazing animals), and following ingestion, the sporozoites are released from the oocysts and invade and undergo asexual development in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract of the host. This is followed by a sexual phase of development resulting in the production of potentially genetically diverse oocysts that are shed fully infective in the faeces. Oocysts may also &#x02018;hatch&#x02019; before they are shed from the host, causing re-infection and exponential increases in parasite burden, leading to chronic infection, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites have a remarkable capacity to reproduce in the host. The rapid multiplication of the parasite in the gut cells causes tissue damage and destruction of the intestinal epithelial cells with stunting of the villi, reducing the absorptive surface of the gut, leading to malnutrition, dehydration, and diarrhoea [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">During acute infection, and for a week or so following clinical recovery, the infected host will shed very large numbers of infectious oocysts in faeces [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Work with neonatal calves has shown that one calf can shed around 100 million infectious oocysts in faeces, which is a massive source of environmental contamination and poses an infection risk for other vulnerable hosts [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> oocysts are microscopic (most species are 4&#x02013;6 &#x003bc;m in diameter) and have a tough waxy wall composed of lipids and glycoproteins, which enables the parasite to survive a wide range of conditions, including temperatures from &#x02013;22&#x000b0;C to 60&#x000b0;C. This wall protects the parasite against many common disinfectants, which makes <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> hard to control on the farm, in drinking water, swimming pools, and in fresh produce [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0090">Not all <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. in livestock are of public health significance, but the species of most <bold>zoonotic</bold> importance for human infection is <italic>C. parvum</italic> [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which will be the focus for this review. Livestock, in particular young calves, are very vulnerable to cryptosporidiosis and a recent modelling study estimated the global load of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites in livestock manure to be in the region of 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>23</sup> oocysts per year, with cattle being the predominant source [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, improving our understanding of environmental transmission routes of zoonotic <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and oocyst survival is important in assessing and mitigating against disease risk and is essential for a One Health approach to tackle human and animal cryptosporidiosis. Currently, there are no effective vaccines to prevent cryptosporidiosis in humans or in livestock and there are few safe and effective therapeutic options available. Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that is well placed for a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to tackle it effectively and previous authors have advocated the benefits of adopting a One Health approach [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This review will discuss progress made in this area, with greater emphasis on the benefits and opportunities from tackling the disease in livestock, and look at recent advances in scientific technologies that may lead to much needed prevention and control strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Disease, Transmission, and Diagnostics</title><p id="p0095">Human infection is usually of the small bowel via the faecal&#x02013;oral route, although there is growing evidence for respiratory involvement in some populations [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including profuse watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea, typically start between 2 and 10 days after ingestion of oocysts and arise from malabsorption and inflammation [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some populations are especially vulnerable to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, and the parasite was included in the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Neglected Diseases Initiative in 2004 [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This was in recognition of the links to poverty, the disproportionate impact on young, malnourished children with subsequent growth and development impairment [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the severe impact on immunocompromised people. Long-term health consequences are also now recognised in people (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s0015"><title>Disease in Livestock</title><p id="p0100">Globally, cryptosporidiosis affects a large number of animal species, including the main livestock animals such as: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, horses, donkeys, water buffalo, camels, and poultry [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and zoonotic <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. have also been reported in wildlife species, including rabbits [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], deer [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], wild mammals [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and fish [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0105">Infection with <italic>C. parvum</italic> is one of the most important causes of diarrhoeal disease in neonatal (&#x0003c;6 weeks old) calves in many countries worldwide [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The parasite is the most frequently diagnosed cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea in the UK<xref rid="p0295" ref-type="p">i</xref> and <italic>C. parvum</italic> also causes significant disease in lambs and goats [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Sheep and goat production is an important agricultural industry in Europe, particularly in less favoured areas for agriculture, where they are an important source of meat and dairy products. It is estimated that 98% of the goat population is in developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia, where they are an important source of meat, milk, fibre, and fertilizer and help to improve the livelihoods of the world&#x02019;s poorest communities [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Children often play an important role in tending grazing livestock in many countries and, due to their close proximity to the animals, are very likely to come into contact with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites. Recent data from China has also shown the presence of <italic>C. parvum</italic> in yaks, which may pose a public health risk [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">The parasite causes disease in both dairy and beef herds and the prevalence of infection can be high in young calves, particularly in intensively reared management systems, with various clinical outcomes being reported, ranging from death of the calf to growth retardation and some animals with no obvious clinical signs [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The disease can also cause long-term production impacts in livestock (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). The minimal infectious dose for neonatal calves is very low, with 17 oocysts causing infection and a correlation of a dose-dependent relationship between oocyst intake and clinical signs [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">Clinical signs in acutely infected calves include yellow watery faeces, reluctance to feed, dehydration, and in severe cases can result in death [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The gut takes a few weeks to recover from infection and regain its ability to effectively absorb nutrients [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Oocyst shedding in the faeces of infected calves can be observed from day 4 postinfection, lasting for a further 10 days to 2 weeks and shedding can occur after diarrhoea has ceased. Therefore, asymptomatic animals may also pose a risk of infection to other animals and to people.

Of 199 documented outbreaks of human parasitic protozoal disease due to water contamination in the period 2004&#x02013;2010, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. accounted for the majority of outbreaks [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. How the oocysts reach water courses is not clear, as fate and transfer of oocysts from host faecal material through the environment to water courses is not well understood. Most scientists and water industry experts consider this mainly to be due to overland flow, particularly in periods of high rainfall or around intense rainfall events [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The effect of climate change (which is predicted to increase winter precipitation and summer extreme precipitation events) on pathogen loading to surface waters was recently explored, but predicted to have limited effect on the risk to public health, using models for catchment pathogen loads [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
