</p><p id="p0015">Earlier this spring, the powerful new coronavirus, called COVID-19, swept through our country like nothing we have seen since the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. The numbers of those infected with the COVID-19 virus soared on a steep trajectory over a relatively short period of time, and the health care community mobilized itself to care for those who needed testing and treatment. We quickly learned to adjust our traditional methods for providing care, including the utilization of drive-through services and expanding telehealth care.</p><p id="p0020">Chaos provides opportunities. The integral role nurse practitioners (NPs) play in health care has been highlighted throughout this disaster. The NP community met the COVID-19 pandemic head-on. Our NP colleagues manned command and call centers, installed telehealth carts at pharmacies and advanced Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines into practice. Nurses have always been on the front lines when it comes to caring for those who are sick, and that caring spirit and nursing innovation is what has afforded NPs the knowledge and skill in combating this pandemic.</p><p id="p0025">The sequelae of the COVID-19 virus for those impacted can include permanent loss of lung function, and I know my NP colleagues will stay abreast of the research coming out of this pandemic. Our patients may have challenges for years to come, and the NP community will be prepared to meet their future health care needs.</p><p id="p0030">I am proud of the roles NPs have taken on during this crisis. NPs have a long history of vocal leadership and stepping forward to influence health care and improve access to care. We will continue to face challenges in the weeks ahead. And as we heard from HHS Secretary Alex Azar during the recent AANP Health Policy Conference, &#x0201c;&#x02026; we are asking more than ever of our health care practitioners &#x02013; and I have great confidence that all of you will rise to the challenge.&#x0201d; As do I.</p><p id="p0035">Thank you for your dedication to providing evidence-based care to and advocating for your patients to help meet the health care needs of our citizens. Be safe, my colleagues!</p></body></article>
