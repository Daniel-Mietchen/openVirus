The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>airway management</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>infection prevention and control</kwd><kwd>personal protective equipment</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">

The virus has been classified in the UK as a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID), although the case fatality rate (estimated to range from &#x0003c;6%<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> to 0.25%<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>) is lower than that characteristic of most HCIDs. This article contains an overview of personal learning points in infection control from the first SARS epidemic, a review of relevant evidence, and suggestions on how to minimise the risk transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Personal lessons from SARS</title><p id="p0045">

</p><p id="p0060">The 251 cases of confirmed coronavirus SARS in healthcare workers who were infected after exposure to patients with SARS highlighted important lessons to learn regarding personal protective equipment (PPE). When standard PPE (in this case, an N95 mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) was used appropriately then the risk of transmission was low.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, healthcare workers were often exposed to a high viral load in the emergency department or ICU before standard PPE was donned for emergency intubation procedures. Subsequent interviews with staff involved in intubating infectious patients confirmed variable adherence to standard PPE recommendations.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0065">In 2003, Toronto quickly stopped all elective surgery and barred all visitors and relatives, and only essential on-call staff were allowed into the hospital, radically reducing the footfall of people in the building. Everyone who entered the building was instructed to wash their hands with alcohol gel, instructed to put on a face mask, asked to complete their contact details in a register, and patients and staff had their symptoms screened and temperature checked. Health authorities placed 8000 people in quarantine early in the epidemic. The rapid implementation of basic recommendations for screening and prompt isolation of all suspect patients and staff, together with quarantine of contacts, was ultimately effective in preventing significant healthcare worker and patient infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Differences in the approach for coronavirus disease 2019</title><p id="p0070">COVID-19 requires a different strategic approach to SARS, most notably because of the exceptionally large numbers of hospitalised patients and international pace of transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Shortly afterwards, on March 11, 2020, the WHO upgraded the situation to pandemic&#x02014;the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Between March 19 and March 29, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from 250 000 in 163 countries to more than 700 000 patients in 177 countries, meaning almost all countries are now hosting the disease. By way of contrast, between 2012 and 2019 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infected 2494 patients in 27 countries, although more than 80% of cases occurred during 2012&#x02013;4 in Saudi Arabia; the 2002&#x02013;3 SARS outbreak resulted in 8437 cases in 26 countries.</p><p id="p0075">The global epidemiological crisis of COVID-19 has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. One of the key differences from the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks has been a requirement to consider on a global scale the provision of infection control and healthcare worker protective equipment.</p><p id="p0080">The main transmission risks for all coronaviruses are exposure to droplets and contact transfer of virus. Droplets are heavy and usually disperse within a maximum 2 m radius after coughing and sneezing by an infected patient. A notable exception is when we carry out procedures with patients that generate artificial aerosols (small particle nuclei, which may penetrate standard surgical masks and contaminate a wider dispersal radius).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Aerosol generating procedures include, for example tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) provision, bronchial suctioning, bronchoscopy, and sputum induction. These procedures place clinicians in close proximity to the upper respiratory tract source of viral load, which has been linked to an increased risk of transmission of coronaviruses.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0085">The minimal infective dose is defined as the lowest number of viral particles that causes an infection in 50% of individuals. Data on the human infectious dose by aerosol and surface contact (fomite) transmission routes are still lacking for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. However, in mouse models for SARS-CoV, a relatively low dose of only a few hundred viral particles was required.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Early data from China found a strong association between COVID-19 disease severity, high viral load, and prolonged viral shedding;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> although these findings have not been consistently replicated, and the true pattern of contagion is likely to be more complex. Although small, retrospective studies of SARS implicate viral exposure dose as being proportional to the severity of clinical outcomes,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> there is still no direct equivalent evidence for disease outcome in COVID-19. Assessing transmissibility to healthcare workers, who are potentially repeatedly exposed to higher numbers of viral particles, may help determine future viral prophylaxis or early treatment strategies.</p><p id="p0090">Although the stability of aerosolised SARS-CoV-2 on common environmental materials appears to be similar to that of SARS-CoV under experimental conditions,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak are very different to those of SARS. One potential explanation may be earlier and higher accumulation of viral load in the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were higher in a small case series of 18 patients<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> than for patients with SARS-CoV.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> In the same study, the viral load in a single asymptomatic patient (tested because of close contact with known cases) was similar to that in symptomatic patients, which may support reports of transmission earlier in the course of infection.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> These patterns appear similar to patients with influenza<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and imply value in early case detection to prevent the transmission of infections. Despite these findings, it is important to appreciate that, based upon generalised principles of viral transmission, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are likely to disperse less viral load and ultimately be less contagious than symptomatic individuals, but at present we are unable to quantify by how much.</p><p id="p0095">Recognition of the relative contributions that short-range, large droplet, or airborne (&#x02018;aerosol-transmissible&#x02019;) infectious agents make to infection transmission also has significant implications for how healthcare workers need to manage infected patients. PPE is usually more costly for aerosolisable agents than for those only transmitted by large droplets or direct contact because of two key properties of aerosols: firstly, a propensity to follow air flow, therefore needing a much tighter seal around the PPE covering a healthcare worker&#x02019;s airway; and secondly, the small particle sizes of aerosolised agents, which require appropriate filtering capacity.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0100">The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in unprecedented global demand for PPE, with the rapid pandemic escalation leaving limited time for equipment reserve preparation. In the UK alone, the HNS supply chain delivered more than 170 million Filtering Face Piece 3 (FFP3) respirator masks in 2 weeks<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> in March 2020. Although PPE is only one part of safe and effective infection control, concern has escalated regarding how to mitigate against actual or impending shortages of critical equipment in areas of high demand. Much of the evidence of PPE efficacy has been derived from translation of studies using SARS or modelling systems as surrogates, although increasing pathogen-specific evidence on environmental contamination and airborne transmissibility<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> are factoring into the decision-making process.</p><p id="p0105">SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities in environmental inoculation to SARS-CoV: both coronaviruses are detectable at 72 h after contact with surface materials (albeit with an exponential decay in viral titres).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Viral particles in droplets can be detected for at least 3 h after being coughed into the air.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Fine aerosols remain airborne for several hours in still air and in disturbed air the particles settle onto surfaces faster. Although surface sampling from the rooms of patients with COVID-19 showed extensive environmental contamination, post-cleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient. Air sampling of patient rooms was also negative, although patients in the study had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms only and did not undergo any aerosol generating procedures.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0110">A series of regularly updated international recommendations on healthcare infection control throughout early 2020 have reflected three challenges: applying the learning from previous pandemic and inter-pandemic periods; a rapidly evolving understanding of the risk of infection transmission for COVID-19; and finally, a need to be proportionate regarding equipment utilisation during a pandemic. During this time the WHO,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and Public Health England (PHE)<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> all moved from a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; strategy, to one in which PPE use is risk stratified and the appropriate PPE is selected for the task required. Thus incremental contact, droplet and airborne precautions against COVID-19 have been established in the UK,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>
<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> meaning that all clinical areas considered to have frequent aerosol generating procedures, including ICU and operating theatres have similar PPE precautions. An exception to this standard is during neuraxial anaesthesia for elective Caesarean delivery, during which the risk of conversion to an aerosolising general anaesthetic is considered low and predictable in advance, hence droplet precautions are adequate for anaesthetists.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> A risk adaptive approach is recommended for other environments, where precautions should follow the risk of transmission during different clinical interactions. A common feature of all recommendations is that, irrespective of PPE required for each task, the equipment is used carefully and correctly, focusing particularly on safe removal.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>The COVID-19 patient</title><p id="p0115">The most detailed description of the clinical characteristic of COVID-19 patients derives from a cohort study of 1099 patients with laboratory confirmed infections across mainland China.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Important infection control characteristics includes a median (inter-quartile range [IQR]) incubation period of 4 (2&#x02013;7) days.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> SARS-CoV-2 virus can initially be detected 1&#x02013;2 days before symptom onset from upper respiratory tract samples.

A checklist or cognitive aid should be used for preparation and intubation. Communication in full PPE can be challenging. Preparing team members, assigning roles, and setting out the airway plan before donning and entering the intubation room, improves safety and team effectiveness. Intubating teams should be limited to one experienced intubator, one skilled assistant (such as an intensive care nurse or operating department practitioner), and one team leader who acts as a backup intubator and administers drugs.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> A runner should be placed outside the room to assist the intubating team. A strategy to target the most successful first attempt at intubation logically dictates that the most experienced anaesthetist is hands-on with the airway and that videolaryngoscopy is used to limit exposure risk.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>High-flow nasal oxygen and NIV</title><p id="p0170">HFNO delivers humidified, warmed oxygen via specialised nasal cannula at flow rates up of to 60 L min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.

A typical ICU solution relies upon isolating contagious patients in neutral or negative pressure side rooms, possibly with neutral pressure anti-rooms. This engineering solution permits flexibility in the clinical management of ventilation for infected patients, including aerosol generating procedures such as NIV and HFNO.<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> However, the rapid mismatch in ratio of intensive care beds to patients needing critical care has led to a rapid need to develop surge capacity<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> and to innovate with models of critical care provision in facilities that may not have the same engineering solutions for infection control (e.g. most operating theatres operate with a positive pressure air flow system).

</p><p id="p0200">Impact on oxygen supplies for widespread use of NIV is likely to be considerable. Some noninvasive ventilatory modalities are very oxygen hungry, using the high flow to provide inspiratory pressure. Once these devices are deployed over and above basal consumption plus an increase in ventilator usage, the maximum flow rate through the Vacuum Insulated Evaporators (VIE) oxygen stores can quickly be reached. This results in oxygen failure to the entire hospital starting at the sites most distal to the regulator, with the only remedy being to limit the number of devices pulling oxygen through the regulator or to use more efficient equipment.</p><p id="p0205">Airflow within hospital wards can dramatically affect the risk of nosocomial transmission of some coronavirus strains.
