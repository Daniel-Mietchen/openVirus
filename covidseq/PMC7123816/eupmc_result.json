    "Human serum albumin (HSA) is the predominant product of hepatic protein synthesis and one of the more abundant plasma proteins. HSA is a monomeric multidomain macromolecule, representing the main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure and the main modulator of fluid distribution between body compartments. HSA displays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA is the most important antioxidant capacity of human plasma, in addition to its ability to protect the body from the harmful effects of heavy metals such as iron and copper and reduce their ability to produce reactive oxygen radicals. HSA is the main depot for nitric oxide (NO) transport in the blood. HSA represents the main carrier for fatty acids, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, and provides the metabolic modification of some drugs and displays pseudo-enzymatic properties. HSA has been widely used successfully for more than 50 years in many settings of perioperative medicine including hypovolemia, shock, burns, surgical blood loss, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the use of HSA has shown a promising neuroprotective effect in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most recent evidence-based functions and uses of HSA in the perioperative period are reviewed in this chapter."
