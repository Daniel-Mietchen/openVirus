<italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause disease in a wide range of animals, being associated with fowl cholera in avian species, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine species, atrophic rhinitis in swine, and snuffles in lagomorphs (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 2006</xref>). As well, <italic>P. multocida</italic> is an opportunistic organism which lives as a commensal in the upper respiratory system of different animal species including mammals, birds and reptiles (<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Ho, 2013</xref>). The organism is also an important zoonotic pathogen and responsible for the majority of human wound infections following animal bites (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>). It has been suggested that <italic>P. multocida</italic> can even infect a human host through secretion droplets via scratching, licking and kissing (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="par0030">Several members of the family <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> including <italic>Pasteurella canis</italic> and <italic>Pasteurella stomatis</italic> have been found to be part of the normal flora of healthy pinnipeds kept in captivity (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). In marine mammals, pasteurellosis has been reported as an acute or peracute septicemia, sometimes with no obvious clinical signs other than sudden death (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>P. multocida</italic> has been associated with acute hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, hemorrhagic tracheitis, enteritis, bacteraemia and intestinal hemorrhage in cetaceans (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). In pinnipeds, pasteurellosis has been reported as causing disease in different species including both phocids and otariids (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, it has been suggested that all pinniped species are susceptible to septicemia caused by <italic>P. multocida</italic> (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="par0035">
<italic>P. multocida</italic> isolates are classified into five capsular serogroups (A, B, D, E and F) in the Carter scheme (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Carter, 1955</xref>; <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Rimler and Rhoades, 1987</xref>) and into sixteen somatic (Heddleston) serovars (1&#x02013;16) based on their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Brogden et al., 1978</xref>; <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Heddleston et al., 1972</xref>). Recently, an LPS multiplex PCR (LPS-mPCR) has been developed to assign <italic>P. multocida</italic> isolates to one of the 8 LPS genotypes (L1 to L8) based on their LPS outer core biosynthesis locus (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 2015</xref>). There has been no report on the Heddleston serovar of the <italic>P. multocida</italic> isolates associated with disease in marine mammals to the authors&#x02019; knowledge. However, Carter type A <italic>P. multocida</italic> has been reported previously in association with fatal septicaemia in a harbor seal in Canada (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Vedros and Giard, 1982</xref>).</p><p id="par0040">Here we report on the usage of whole genome sequencing to examine the strain relatedness of <italic>P. multocida</italic> isolates obtained from two sudden, sequential cases of death in captive fur seals at Sea World Australia.

There were five different enclosures within the pool with a flow through water system with some recirculation.</p><p id="par0050">Case 1 involved a male Subantarctic fur seal that had been found stranded on a beach near Napier, New Zealand in November 2006. The animal was deemed non-releasable and a decision was made to keep it in the collection at Marineland, Napier. In 2014, the animal was transported to Sea World Australia, Gold Coast, Queensland, weighing 87&#x02009;kg at the time of transportation. Prior to transport, several tests including biochemistry, complete blood count, PCR for the detection of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex and serology for phocine morbillivirus were performed (the latter two giving negative results). The seal&#x02019;s right eye was enucleated under general anaesthesia in 2015. The seal incurred minor bite wounds to the ventral abdomen inflicted by conspecifics and treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 2017. This seal also had mild recurring neurologic episodes with apparent seizures over the prior years.</p><p id="par0055">Case 2 involved a male New Zealand fur seal that was found at Brunswick Heads, New South Wales, Australia in August 2011. The seal was transported to Sea World Australia for treatment as it was underweight and dehydrated. It was deemed non-releasable after treatment that included the administration of dexamethasone and subcutaneous fluids to stabilize the animal&#x02019;s condition and prophylactic amoxicillin/clavulanic acid therapy for minor wound management. Two negative intradermal skin tests for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex were obtained during the quarantine period.

DNA was extracted using the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions from overnight cultures grown on 5% sheep blood agar. The DNA samples were then sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (150 bp paired ends) by the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics at the University of Queensland (St Lucia QLD 4072, Australia). Raw Illumina sequencing data was quality filtered to remove Illumina adaptor sequences, low quality reads and reads shorter than 75 bp using Nesoni v0.132 (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Victorian-Bioinformatics-Consortium, 2013</xref>). The qualities of the reads were assessed using FastQC v0.11.5 (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Quality-trimmed paired end reads were then assembled using SPAdes v3.10.1 (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>In-silico</italic> multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profiling was performed using MLST v2.8 (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Jolley and Maiden, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Seemann</xref>) and the <italic>P. multocida</italic> RIRDC-MLST scheme (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Subaaharan et al., 2010</xref>). A local database consisting of the gene sequences representing the 16 Heddleston serovar LPS outer core biosynthesis loci was prepared and Blastn v2.2.31+ was used to perform <italic>in-silico</italic> LPS typing. The relevant contig containing the outer core biosynthesis locus was extracted, Geneious 10.0.6 was used for annotation of the region and ClustalW v2.1 for alignments and comparision to the corresponding loci in <italic>P. multocida</italic> type strain PM70.

Animal care workers had previously reported anorexia, lethargy and signs of a potential seizure over the preceding 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;h. Once stimulated to move to the surface from the bottom of the pool, the seal was observed floating right side up and holding onto the side of the pool with its right fore and hind flippers. When submerged under water, the seal made minimal effort to return to the surface, and in doing so would return to hold on to the side of the pool. Cefovecin, diazepam, flunixin meglumine and subcutaneous fluids were administered poolside. Following a one hour period of observation, concern that the seal was beginning to aspirate water resulted in the decision to move the animal to the Veterinary Quarantine Centre (VQC) on-site at Sea World, Australia. Once dry-docked, amikacin, dexamethasone, thiamine, intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy was instituted. The seal remained depressed and prostrate with marked respiratory difficulty evidenced by open-mouth breathing and significant thoracic excursions, which worsened through the night. On December 6th, following a 14&#x02009;h therapeutic period, the patient remained moribund in a critical condition. Due to a poor prognosis, a decision was made to euthanize the seal with an intramuscular overdose of tiletamine-zolazepam (Zoletil&#x000ae;).</p></sec><sec id="sec0050"><label>3.2</label><title>Clinical findings (Case 2)</title><p id="par0100">On 8th of December 2017, a New Zealand fur seal was seen with diarrhoea and regurgitation following feeding.

Both the small and large intestine were congested and had a pink-purple-red-tan coalescing divot pattern recognizable at the antimesenteric surface (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C and D). The mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and vessels of the alimentary tracts were dilated. The spleen was contracted and blue-purple in color and petechial hemorrhages were found on the visceral surface. Bile imbibition was present along the serosal surface of the liver underlying the rib cage. No significant gross lesions were detected in the tongue, tonsils, salivary glands, thyroid glands, pharynx, larynx, stomach, testicles, epididymis and urinary bladder. Histopathological changes were limited to minimal inflammation in abdominal adipose tissue accompanied by numerous bacteria (mainly small Gram-negative bacilli), as well as congestion of many tissues.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><label>3.5</label><title>Microbiology</title><p id="par0130">

The <italic>in-silico</italic> MLST typing grouped all six isolates into MLST sequence Type 7. Use of the <italic>in-house</italic> LPS database of the eight previously described LPS outer core biosynthesis loci types suggested that all six isolates were carrying an identical LPS outer core biosynthesis locus, closely related to that of LPS Type 3. Detailed analysis showed that the LPS loci of the seal isolates was 6191 bp in length and had 184 nucleotide differences with that from PM70. The <italic>natC</italic> gene in the seal isolates appeared to carry a non-synonymous change at position 290 which results in introduction of a stop codon.

Fatal septicaemic pasteurellosis has been reported in cetaceans and pinnipeds, where the most common origin of generalized pasteurellosis in captive and wild pinnipeds is bite wounds inflicted by conspecifics (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). Pasteurellosis in marine mammals is often presented as an acute or peracute septicaemia resulting in fatality with or without clinical symptoms (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). The clinical signs, if present, can include nonspecific signs such as altered behavior, anorexia, lethargy and listless swimming a few hours preceding death (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). Typical necropsy findings include pneumonia, enteritis, myocarditis with epicardial/pericardial petechiation, hemorrhage, hepatitis, nephritis, splenitis, necrotic peritonitis, cervical inflammation and necrosis of adipose overlying the cervical esophagus (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). However, the per-acute nature of pasteurellosis might result in few gross lesions.</p><p id="par0160">In the seal in Case 1, in-house tests and necropsy findings such as lymphadenopathy and cardiac changes suggested a severe inflammatory response and an acute sepsis due to an invasive bacterial infection creating a pyogenic focus in the thorax via an oesophageal portal of entry. Severe secretory diarrhoea was consistent with the biochemical findings of panhypoproteinemia characterized by concurrent decreases in albumin and globulin, suggesting blood loss and/or protein-losing enteropathy.</p><p id="par0165">A severe effusive, exudative, hemorrhagic and septic peritonitis was observed upon necropsy in the fur seal in Case 2, with bacteria being present in extracellular and intracellular fluids. Given the apparently good health of this seal through its years of residence at Sea World, and the peracute onset of clinical signs resulting in sudden death, a severe bacteraemic sepsis as a sequelae to peritonitis was suspected. Isolation of <italic>P. multocida</italic> mostly as pure culture, from several internal sites and organs, clearly identified this Gram-negative organism as the cause of septicaemia and death in the two seals.</p><p id="par0170">
<italic>In-silico</italic> MLST typing revealed all isolates from both cases belonged to ST 7. Historically, ST 7 consists of six isolates, all obtained from Australian animals, five from chickens suffering fowl cholera and one isolate from a pig suffering from septicaemia due to <italic>P. multocida</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/" id="intr0015">https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/</ext-link>). To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no seal isolates have been examined by MLST or any other genotyping method.</p><p id="par0175">The clinical presentation of septic pasteurellosis is suspected to appear most probably after the levels of endotoxin reaches a certain concentration (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Wilkie et al., 2012</xref>). The key antigenic component of the endoxtoxin of <italic>P. multocida</italic> is the LPS, which also forms the basis of the Heddleston serotyping scheme (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Heddleston et al., 1972</xref>). Our <italic>in-silico</italic> typing showed that all the seal isolates carried LPS outer core biosynthesis loci type 3, which is the most prevalent LPS type carried by the <italic>P. multocida</italic> isolates associated with fowl cholera in Australia (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 2013</xref>). However, our data suggested that the LPS of the seal isolates have a unique <italic>gatG</italic> sequence which has not been previously reported. Consequently, the results obtained from MLST and LPS typing of the seal isolates are possibly suggesting that the birds transiting through the pools are responsible for introducing the outbreak isolate to the seals. Several species of seabirds frequent the pools at Sea World Australia, which supports this hypothesis. However, more studies including sampling the guano of the visiting birds would be needed to get more information about the source of the infection.</p><p id="par0180">
<italic>P. multocida</italic> is relatively resistant to environmental stresses being known to survive in turkey blood dried on glass for eight days and in soil held at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, pH7 and moisture content of 50% for up to 100 days (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Glisson et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, despite routine disinfection protocols, risk factors including exposure via wild seabird guano which is often deposited on the shade sails above the pools will remain. Guano can be a potential source of <italic>P. multocida</italic> as the organism has been previously isolated from the cloaca of apparently healthy web-footed birds in a Danish study of commercial poultry production systems (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Muhairwa et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to that, an association between prevalence of pasteurellosis in seals in an aquarium in the USA with waterfowl migration has been suggested earlier (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="par0185">Two out of twelve animals were affected in December 2017 and the peracute nature of disease, resulting mortality linked to the same bacterial species led to an initial belief that the two cases represented an outbreak of pasteurellosis. Our use of WGS and the comparison of the draft genome assembly of the six seal isolates to those obtained from the public database provided the needed resolution to confirm the isolates belonged to the same genetic lineage, thus confirming that an outbreak of pasteurellosis had indeed occurred. This is beyond what routine MLST would provide. As WGS is only now starting to be applied to outbreaks of pasteurellosis, there are limited similar studies. However, in a study on two on-going outbreaks in turkeys, each in a different US state, whole genome sequencing clustered isolates from each outbreak into distinct clusters (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">LeCount et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="par0190">In addition to that, the whole genomic data allowed insights into the level of diversity of <italic>P. multocida</italic> from within an animal in an outbreak as well as across animals in an outbreak. The minimum spanning tree demonstrated the case one and case two isolates of <italic>P. multocida</italic> share a very recent ancestor and the possibility of transmission through fomites from a common source. It also showed genetic diversity even within the same seal with the Case 1 thoracic fluid and lung isolates differing by 12 SNPs. This finding suggests that this seal has been originally infected with at least two different strains. As single colonies were initially picked from the primary plates for both tissues, it is not possible to determine if both of the genetic types seen in Case 1 were present in both sampled tissues. However, in Case 2, the two available isolates from the abdominal fluid (two separate fluid collections were cultured) yielded isolates that differed by 5 or 7 SNPs from the Case 1 thoracic fluid isolate. Hence, this analysis demonstrated that the Case 2 isolates are closely related with the two isolates obtained from Case 1, suggesting a common source.</p><p id="par0195">Given the peracute nature of pasteurellosis in these two cases, it is very unlikely to assume one strain infected case 1 and then underwent microevolution within seal one before transferring to seal two. Rather, our results suggest that the seals most probably obtained an infecting population from a common external source such as seabird guano or fomites. Mixed colonization by several bacterial lineages is relatively common among human bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>Psuedomonas aeruginosa</italic> in cystic fibrosis patients (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Sherrard et al., 2017</xref>). Mixed colonization by different genetic types within the one host has not previously reported in <italic>P. multocida</italic>.</p><p id="par0200">Future investigations into pasteurellosis outbreaks would help in providing more insight if multiple single colonies were selected from multiple tissues in multiple animals. Sampling the oropharyngeal of healthy seals is also needed to see whether seals can be asymptomatic carriers of such pathogenic <italic>P. multocida</italic> strains. As well, where relevant resources and capacities are available, future studies should use a metagenomic approach in which the full genetic diversity of <italic>P. multocida</italic> in tissues and relevant environmental samples could be determined.</p><p id="par0205">Studies in rabbits have demonstrated that direct contact with nasal secretions is an important route of transmission of pasteurellosis (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">DiGiacomo et al., 1987</xref>). Given the two seals were kept in different but adjacent pools since 17<sup>th</sup> of November 2017, it is unlikely that there were any direct contact with nasal secretion from Case 1 to Case 2. However, the fact that water moved freely between the pools would have made it possible for nasal secretions from the seal in Case 1 one to reach the adjacent pools. Excess rainfall in the region of Sea World Australia in November and December 2017 qualifies as another risk factor, allowing stagnant freshwater to accumulate and salinity in the pinniped pools to decrease, potentially facilitating overgrowth of bacterial organisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec0080"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0210">This study describes two different disease manifestations in two fur seals associated with <italic>P. multocida.</italic> Our use of whole genome sequencing has allowed a confirmation that the two cases were directly connected with all six available isolates being nearly identical at the core genome level.
