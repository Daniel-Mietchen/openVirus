# EUvsVirus Hackathon 2020-04-24:26

We are participlating in a weekend hack for #EUvsVirus - see https://euvsvirus.org
join the project and then our channel `t_contentmine_ffr2axj4x`.


## Goal - search the literature for scientific knowledge on any topic relevant to the pandemic

This pandemic requires solutions cfrom almost every subject: maths, physics, chemistry , bioscience, materials, engineering, statistics, psychology, sociology, politics, economics, law, history, literature,, philosophy). Most "Covid" engines only have a small fraction - we aim to search the whole literature including the Global South.

## How does it work?
Simple steps:
* select the soiurce you want to query
* download a few hundred articles in a minute or two.
* search and analyze them exhaustively on your own machine.
* display and publish the results

## What's new?
* A single point of contact for these repositories
* under your control
* extensible by creating your own search dictionaries

## What can I do?
***We'd like everyone to *test* the system.*** This helps us detect problems in platforms , in the sources, in the dictionaries and also give you an idea of what it can do. Then...
* **Propose a question** you'd like to answer. Create the query.
* **Search** (`getpapers`) one or more sources. Propose others.
* **download** a few hundred articles.
* **search** them with a few dictionaries. (`ami search`).
* **display** them and see whether there is a coherent message.

## How can I help?
Some of you will write software but it's not essential. Here's some ideas for tasks:
* find a valuable source (repository) and explore how to search and download.
* create a dictionary relevant to your interests
* translate a dictionary into your language (Use Wikidata!)
* search and analyse a particular question
* find ways of displaying results 
* documenting parts that you find unclear
* writing tutorials

## Is there a simple example?
### masks (n95)
This uses `getpapers` to search for "n955 AND mask" and analyze results:
see [search](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/blob/master/examples/n95/OVERVIEW.md)

## Is there a virus project to get started on.
### forensic science

We had a question (anonymised) from a forensic scientis:
<blockquote>
 ... to collect as many scientific articles as possible regarding the persistence of Covid-19 in different surfaces and materials that are commonly studied in a forensic setting, such as samples obtained form autopsies (skin, bones and body fluids), porous and non-porous surfaces and textiles.

We are trying to establish protocols in order to safely study these type of samples.
</blockquote>
Let's see if we can help...
### masks
My colleague Dan who is making face visors (1000/week in Cambridge Makespace) asks "do masks and visors work"?
