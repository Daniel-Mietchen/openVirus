# Goal - search the literature for scientific knowledge on any topic relevant to the pandemic

This pandemic requires solutions cfrom almost every subject: maths, physics, chemistry , bioscience, materials, engineering, statistics, psychology, sociology, politics, economics, law, history, literature,, philosophy). Most "Covid" engines only have a small fraction - we aim to search the whole literature including the Global South.
