    <h2 class="">Background</h2>
    <p id="p-4">The spreading of the novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the respiratory illness, COVID-19, starting from December 2019 has become a huge concern in the medical community around the world. In modern epidemiology, it is important to capture variations in genome sequence among isolates of such outbreaking pathogens for monitoring pathogen’s evolution or tracking epidemiological chains in local to even global scale. Relatively large genome of the corona virus (approx. 30 kb), however, makes it challenging to reconstruct whole genome of the virus from samples with various viral loads in cost-effective manner. Recently, a group of molecular biologists which is called ARTIC Network (
     <a href="https://artic.network/">https://artic.network/</a>) proposed 98 multiplexing PCR primer pairs (hereafter ARTIC primer set: 
     <a href="https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1">https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1</a>). The ARTIC primer set are designed based on a published reference SARS-CoV-2 genome MN908947.3 and are tilled almost whole region of the genomic region. Those 98 primer pairs are actually divided into two separate subsets (pool_1 and pool2) so that each PCR fragment does not overlap to each other in the same PCR.
    </p>
    <p id="p-5">We have already tested the ARTIC primer set and their protocol for several clinical samples, mostly RNA from pharyngeal swab, and observed a great performance of their primer set. Actually, the primer set works quite well for samples with relatively high viral load (Ct &lt;; 25 in clinical qPCR test). For such high viral load samples, all designated amplicons are amplified within acceptable level of coverage bias for subsequent NGS analysis. The approach of ARTIC Network is expected to save resources and scale to a number of samples with a given NGS sequencing capacity, which will be crucial for large epidemic situation being concerned in many countries. As sample’s viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entire coverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normally expected in multiplexed PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the two particular PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for the nsp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets. In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those two amplicons tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomic regions from samples with middle to low viral load (Ct &gt;; 27). This low coverage issue at the amplicons 18 and 76 are also seen in data published from other groups (e.g. 
     <a href="https://cadde.s3.climb.ac.uk/covid-19/BR1.sorted.bam">https://cadde.s3.climb.ac.uk/covid-19/BR1.sorted.bam</a>).
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="section" id="sec-2">
    <h2 class="">Results</h2>
    <p id="p-6">In ARTIC primes set, the PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, are amplified by the primer pairs nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_RIGHT and nCoV-2019_76_LEFT and nCoV-2019_RIGHT, respectively, which are included in the same multiplexed reaction “pool_2”. We noticed that two of those primers, nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT were perfectly complement to each other by their 10-nt sequence at the 3’-end (
     <a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig 1</a>). From this observation, we reasoned that the rapid decrease of the amplification efficiencies of those amplicons was due to a primer dimer formation between nCoV-2019_18_LEFT and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, that could compete to the amplification of desired targets. Indeed, we observed many NGS reads derived from the predicted dimer in raw FASTQ data (data not shown).

    <h2 class="">Discussion</h2>
    <p id="p-17">Since we published the first version of this manuscript which described about the modification of nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT primer, the ARTIC Network group has updated their primer set to ‘V2’ to cope with the dropout of the amplicon 18 and 76 (
     <a href="https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V2">https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V2</a>). Although the modification was done on the primer 2019_18_LEFT instead of 2019_76_RIGHT, their V2 primer set is likewise expected to improve the coverage of amplicon 18 and 76 as seen this study.
    </p>
    <p id="p-18">In this version of manuscript, we added result of further modification in four primers contained in pool_1 to prevent six dimer formations. This modification entangled interference among batch of primers which involved in as many as eight PCR targets. With this modified primer set, one could recover more genomic region particularly from samples with low viral loads (&gt;;30) with smaller sequencing effort.</p>
    <p id="p-19">The result of these experiments clearly indicates that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of those problems can be fixed easily by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study.</p>

    <h2 class="">Materials and Methods</h2>
    <p id="p-20">RNA extracted from clinical specimens (pharyngeal swabs) are reverse transcribed as described in protocol published by ARTIC Network (
     <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">Quick, 2020</a>) but scaled downed to 1/4. The Ct values in clinical qPCR test for those samples ranged from 25 to 30. The cDNA was diluted to 10-fold by H
     <sub>2</sub>O, and 1 μl of the diluted cDNA was used for 10 μl reaction Q5 Hot START DNA Polymerase (NEB) (2 μl of 5x buffer, 0.8 μl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.1 μl of polymerase and 0.29 μl of 50 μM primer mix volumed-up by milli-Q water). It should be noted that this amount of cDNA template per PCR reaction was 4-fold less than that in our usual protocol because we were intended to save those clinical samples. The thermal program was identical to the original ARTIC protocol, and the numbers of CPR cycles were 30 for experiment in 
     <a id="xref-fig-2-9" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig 2</a> and 35 for experiment in 
     <a id="xref-fig-4-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig 4</a>. The PCR products in pool_1 and pool_2 reactions for same clinical samples were combined and purified by 1x concentration of AmpureXP. The purified PCR product was subjected to illumina library prep using QIAseq FX library kit (Qiagen) in 1/4 scale and using 6 min fragmentation time. After the ligation of barcoded adaptor, libraries were heated to 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate ligase, and then, all libraries were pooled in a 1.5 ml tube without balancing DNA concentrations. The pooled library was first purified by AmpureXP at x0.8 concentration, and then again at x1.2 concentration. The purified library was sequenced for 151 cycles at both paired-ends in Illumina iSeq100 along with other samples which were not involved in this study.
