  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) remains widespread in the North American pig population. Despite improvements in virus characterization, it is unclear whether PRRSv infections are a product of viral circulation within a farm, within production systems (local) or across production systems (external). Here we examined the dissemination dynamics of PRRSv and the processes facilitating its spread within and among pig farms in three production systems. Overall, PRRSv genetic diversity declined since 2018, while phylodynamic results support frequent transmission across-production systems. We found that PRRSv dissemination occurred mostly through transmission between farms of different production companies, which were predominant for several months, especially from November until May when PRRSv tends to peak in the studied region. Within production systems, dissemination occurred mainly through regular pig flow, (from sow to nursery and then to finisher farms); nevertheless, an important flux of PRRSv dissemination from finisher to sow and nursery farms highlighted the importance of downstream farms as sources of the virus. High density of farms and farms near major roads were more likely to infect by PRRSv, whereas higher elevation and denser vegetation acted as dissemination barriers. Although it is difficult to disentangle the exact route of PRRSv transmission, results evidenced that dissemination among commercially unrelated pig production systems was intense, reinforcing the importance of farm proximity on PRRSv spread. Thus, consideration of farm location and their geographic characteristics may help to forecast dissemination. The understanding of PRRSv transmission routes has the potential to inform targeted strategies for its prevention and control. Further studies are needed to quantify the relative contribution of PRRSv transmission routes. ### Competing Interest Statement none"/>
