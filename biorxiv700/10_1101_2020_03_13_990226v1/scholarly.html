    <p id="p-3">An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally. Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering.

   <p id="p-4">The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan China, has continued to sweep through South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran. More than 90,000 people have been infected worldwide, with nearly 3000 deaths in about 40 countries
    <sup>
     <a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>,
     <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>
    </sup>. Since February, it was estimated that about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong province and elsewhere were testing positive after their release from the hospital and had to return to the hospital for observation
    <sup>
     <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>,
     <a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>
    </sup>. Doubts about whether patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection” after recovery from initial infection have aroused the worldwide concern. Therefore, in this study, we used the nonhuman primate models with SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by the same virus rechallenge to ascertain the possibility of reinfection.
   </p>
   <p id="p-5">Four adult Chinese rhesus macaques (No M1-M4, 3-5 kg, 3-5-year-old) were intratracheally challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 1×10
    <sup>6</sup> 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID
    <sub>50</sub>), and the body weight, body temperature, X-ray, sampling of sera, nasal/throat/anal swabs and all primary tissues were carried out on schedule (
    <a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Following the initial infection, three of the four monkeys showed the weight loss ranging from 200 g to 400 g (
    <a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2a</a>), but the changes of rectal temperature in all the animals were not observed (
    <a id="xref-fig-2-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2b</a>). Other clinical signs such as reduced appetite, increased respiration rate and hunched posture were transient after the initial challenge. We next determined their viral loads in respiratory and anal swabs along the timeline after the infection. As shown in 
    <a id="xref-fig-2-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2c</a> and 
    <a id="xref-fig-2-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">2d</a>, the viral loads in nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs reached the highest levels (average, approximately 6.5 log
    <sub>10</sub> RNA copies/mL) at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and then declined naturally. Similarly, viral loads from anal swabs reached the peak about 4.5 log
    <sub>10</sub> RNA copies/mL at 3 dpi and then declined to undetectable level at 14 dpi (
    <a id="xref-fig-2-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2e</a>). To identify the virus distribution and histopathological changes in SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys, M1 monkey was euthanized and necropsied at 7 dpi. As shown in 
    <a id="xref-fig-2-6" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2f</a> (left panel), viral replication was found in nose (10
    <sup>7</sup> to 10
    <sup>8</sup> copies/mL), pharynx (10
    <sup>5</sup> to 10
    <sup>6</sup> copies/mL), lung (10
    <sup>4</sup> to 10
    <sup>7</sup> copies/mL), gut (10
    <sup>4</sup> to 10
    <sup>6</sup> copies/mL), spinal cord (approximately 10
    <sup>4</sup> copies/mL), heart (approximately 10
    <sup>4</sup> copies/mL), skeletal muscle (approximately 10
    <sup>4</sup> copies/mL) and bladder (approximately 10
    <sup>4</sup> copies/mL). Furthermore, the lesions occurred mainly in the lung confirmed by the HE staining and anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 staining, with mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septa, accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the alveoli, degeneration of the alveolar epithelia, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (
    <a id="xref-fig-3-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Figure 3a</a>). In addition, the chest X-ray at 7 dpi showed that the upper lobe of the right lung had varying degrees of the localized infiltration and interstitial markings, showing the mild to bilateral ground-glass opacification (Represented by M4, 
    <a id="xref-fig-3-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Figure 3b</a>). For the longitudinal tracking of the characteristics each monkey, the specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 of M2, M3 and M4 monkey was significantly elevated at 14 dpi or 21 dpi and 28 dpi compared to that at 3 dpi and 7dpi (*

    <em>0.01</em>, 
    <a id="xref-fig-2-7" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2g</a>). In the three infected monkeys alive, body weight and rectal temperature remained relatively stable before rechallenge (
    <a id="xref-fig-2-8" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2a</a> and 
    <a id="xref-fig-2-9" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">2b</a>), viral loads of nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were not detectable along the timeline before 28 dpi (
    <a id="xref-fig-2-10" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2c</a> to 2e), and no common abnormalities were found on a chest X-ray test at 28 dpi prior to the rechallenge (Represented by M4, 
    <a id="xref-fig-3-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Figure 3b</a>). Altogether, these data suggested that the three animals were considered as recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, similarly meeting the clinical discharge evaluation criteria (absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities and 2 negative RT-PCR test results

   <p id="p-12">From our current longitudinal study of monkeys, the reinfection could not occur if the monkeys produced the neutralizing antibody at an early stage after the primary infection. Correspondingly, the convalescing patients won’t be contagious when they build up the enough specific antibody to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, no viral replication in all primary tissues was detectable in re-exposed monkeys, implying that the coronavirus might not be hidden for a long time. For the phenomenon on the discharged patients tested positively, it may be attributed to the “false negative” RT-PCR test results before their discharge or the patients without fully recovery albeit they met the discharge criteria. Therefore, further refinement of the diagnostic techniques, antibody monitoring and samples testing from the lower respiratory tract is essential for the cure of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design. Importantly, the unsuccessful rechallenge in NHP models suggested that the re-positivity from discharged patients could not be due to reinfection. It needs to consider more complicated issues to find out the causes.</p>

     <p id="p-15">The nasal/throat/anal swab samples and mainly tissue compartments collected from infected monkeys were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcription was performed as previously described
      <sup>
       <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>
      </sup>. qRT-PCR reactions were carried out on an ABI 9700 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Instrument), the cycling protocol and the primers as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s, and then 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min, 95°C for 45 s. Forward primer: 5’-TCGTTTCGGAAGAGACAGGT-3’, Reverse primer: 5’-GCGCAGTAAGGATGGCTAGT-3’.

     <h3>ELISA</h3>
     <p id="p-16">Sera were collected from each animal for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) along the detection timeline after the initial infection. 96-well plates were coated with 0.1μg Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Sino Biological, 40591-V08H) overnight at 4°C and blocked with 2% BSA/PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. 1:100 diluted samples were added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C, followed by the HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology, ZB-2305) incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was developed by TMB substrate and determined at 450 nm.</p>

     <h3>Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry</h3>
     <p id="p-17">Autopsies were performed according to the standard protocol in ABSL3 laboratory at 7 dpi for M1 and 5 dpr for M3. Lung samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution. Then, paraffin sections (3-4 μm in thickness) were prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;;E) prior to the observation by light microscopy. For immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to identify the antigen of SARS-CoV-2, paraffin dehydrated sections (3-4 µm in thickness) were treated with an antigen retrieval kit (Boster, AR0022) for 1 min at 37°C and quenched for endogenous peroxidases in 3% H
      <sub>2</sub>O
      <sub>2</sub> in methanol for 10 min. After blocking in 1% normal goat serum for 1 hour at roomtemperature, the slices were stained with 7D2 monoclonal antibody (laboratory preparation

     <h3>Neutralizing antibody assay</h3>
     <p id="p-18">Sera samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibody observed by cytopathic effect (CPE). Briefly, the sera from monkeys were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Then, serially two-fold diluted sera were incubated with 100 TCID
      <sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C, and added into Vero-E6 cells in a 96-well-plate. Cells were cultured for 1 week to observe for CPE and the serum dilution in which 50% of the cells were protected from infection was calculated. Each dilution of serum was tested in triplicates.
