Five rhesus macaques were inoculated with 1×106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via conjunctival (CJ), intratracheal (IT), and intragastric (IG) routes, respectively. Remarkably, the CJ inoculated-macaques developed mild interstitial pneumonia and viral load was detectable in the conjunctival swabs at 1 days post-inoculation (dpi). Only via IT inoculation, viral load was detected in the anal swab at 1-7 dpi and macaque showed weight loss. However, viral load was undetectable after IG inoculation. Comparatively, viral load was higher in the nasolacrimal system but lesions of lung were relatively mild and local via CJ inoculation compared with that via IT inoculation, demonstrating distinct characteristics of virus dispersion.

    <h2 class="">Introduction</h2>
    <p id="p-5">Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets when direct or close contact with the patients with SARS-CoV-2. The other potential transmission routes remain to be further researched. In some clinical cases, samples of tears and conjunctival secretions from both SARS-CoV

The macaques were observed daily for clinical signs (body weight temperature were tested as shown). On 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi, the conjunctival, nasal, throat and anal swabs were collected.

The distinct distributions of viruses by different inoculation routes were consistent with the anatomical structure, suggesting that the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 into the host associated with the infection route. Furthermore, viruses were detectable in different segments of the alimentary canal and some lymphatic tissues via both inoculation routes revealing that they may play important roles in the spread of the virus within the host

    <p id="p-12">Meanwhile, comparison with prior to infection (day 0), the chest radiographs from CJ-1 revealed obscure lung markings and opaque glass sign in the bilateral upper lobes and the right lower lobe of the lung on 7 dpi.

Notably, the results of IHC were highly in accordance with the data of viral load detection on 7 dpi both in the CJ-1 and IT-1. Specifically, viral antigens were scattered in several cells in the nasolacrimal system via conjunctival inoculation, while they were more prominent in the trachea via intratracheal inoculation (
     <a id="xref-fig-4-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, viral antigen was obviously observed in the lamina propria of alimentary tract suggesting that the virus may spread from the initial entry to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (
     <a id="xref-fig-5-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Supplementary Figure 1</a>), and they were relatively slight detected in the kidney, myocardium, and liver in IT-1 but undetectable in CJ-1. (
     <a id="xref-fig-6-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Supplementary Figure 2</a>). Briefly, animal inoculated via conjunctival route gave evidence of relatively mild and local interstitial pneumonia compared to the intratracheal inoculated-macaque which demonstrated moderate, diffuse lesions in the lung accompanied with more infiltration of inflammatory cells and accumulation of exudation in the alveolar cavities.

    <p id="p-15">These data demonstrated that macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the conjunctival route rather than the intragastric route. Compared to the intratracheal route, viral load was comparatively high in the nasolacrimal system and lesions in the lung were relatively mild and local via the conjunctival route. Similarly, both the two routes can affect the alimentary canal.</p>

    <h2 class="">Discussion</h2>
    <p id="p-16">We inoculated rhesus monkeys via a single route via conjunctiva, intra-stomach, or intra-trachea, to avoid multiple routes of co-inoculation for confirming the exact pathway of inoculation. These results suggest that conjunctiva is a potential portal for viral transmission. In our results, viral load was detectable in several nasolacrimal system associated-tissues, especially in the conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, nasal cavity and throat, which drew the outline of the anatomical bridge between ocular and respiratory tissues. Particularly, the lacrimal duct functions as a conduit to collect and transport tear fluid from the ocular surface to the nasal-inferior meatus, being convenient for the drainage of virus from ocular to respiratory tract tissues. Actually, the previous report had demonstrated that although virus-containing fluid can be taken up through the conjunctiva, sclera, or cornea, the majority of liquid including tear and secretions is drained into the nasopharyngeal space or swallowed; the lacrimal duct epithelia are also possible to contribute to the absorption of tear fluid. Our results were highly consistent with the anatomical features that viruses enter the host via the conjunctival route. On the other hand, previous research demonstrated that SARS-CoV was undetectable in cynomolgus monkeys after intragastric inoculation which consistent with our result. At present, still, no evidence could prove that SARS-CoV-2 can transmission via fecal-oral route

     </sup>, although viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was prolonged detectable in fecal samples from patients
     <sup>
      <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>
     </sup> and in anal swabs from the infected macaques.
    </p>
    <p id="p-17">Respiratory viruses have the capability to stimulate ocular complications in infected patients, which then leads to respiratory infection 
     <sup>
      <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>
     </sup>. The fact that exposed mucous membranes and unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV

     <h3>Cells and viruses</h3>
     <p id="p-19">The SARS-CoV-2 named SARS-CoV-2/WH-09/human/2020/CHN was isolated by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking Union Medical College. Vero cells were applied to the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 stocks. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) were applied to incubate this cell line at 37°C, 5% CO
      <sub>2</sub>, complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin, and maintained. Titers for SARS-CoV-2 were resolved by TCID

     <h3>RNA extraction and RT-PCR</h3>
     <p id="p-20">All the collected-organs were applied to extract Total RNA as the description in the previous report. Briefly, the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen, Hilden, Germany and the PrimerScript RT Reagent Kit from TaKaRa, Japan were used following manufacturer instructions. RT-PCR reactions were applied to the PowerUp SYBG Green Master Mix Kit from Applied Biosystems, USA, following cycling protocol: 50°C for 30 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 min, 94°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 45 s.

     <h3>Animal experiments</h3>
     <p id="p-21">Five male rhesus macaques (
      <em>Macaca Mulatta</em>) between the ages of 3 and 5 years were used in this research. All were negative for tuberculosis and simian immunodeficiency virus. They were inoculated with 1×10
      <sup>6</sup> 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID
      <sub>50</sub>) of SARS-CoV-2 via three routes. Two male rhesus macaques were inoculated with 10

      <sub>50</sub>/ml SARS-CoV-2 via ocular conjunctival route named CJ-1 and CJ-2, one was inoculated via intratracheal route named IT-1, two were inoculated via intragastric route in sequence named IG-1 and IG-2, respectively. Prior to sample collection, all animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg). On 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi, the conjunctival, nasal, throat and anal swabs were collected and incubated in 1 ml DMEM with 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 U/ml penicillin. The IPTT-300 temperature probes, which were injected interscapular into the macaques prior to the start of the experiment, were applied to do temperature monitor every day. CJ-1, IT-1, and IG-1 were euthanized and necropsied on 7 dpi. Tissues were collected as followed, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, optic nerve, cerebellum, cerebrum, different segments of the spinal cord, nostril, nasal turbinate, nasal mucosa, nasal septum, soft palate, cheek pouch, parotid gland, epiglottis, lingual tonsil, pharyngeal tonsil, different lobes of lung, trachea, different lymph nodes, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, different segments of the alimentary canal, kidney, bladder, testis, and brown adipose tissues samples for detecting the viral loads to analysis the virus distributions. All sera were collected on 0, 7, 14 and 21 dpi for serologic detection to exam whether there presence the IgG antibodies reactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
