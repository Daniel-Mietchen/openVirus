  <meta name="DC.Description" content="The CRISPR/Cas12a RNA-guided complexes have a tremendous potential for nucleic acid detection due to its ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA once bound to a target DNA. However, the current CRISPR/Cas12a systems are limited to detecting DNA in a picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3 prime- or 5 prime-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new self-catalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a-mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied this sensitive system to detect as low as 25 fM dsDNA from the PCA3 gene, an overexpressed biomarker in prostate cancer patients, in simulated urine over 6 hours.
