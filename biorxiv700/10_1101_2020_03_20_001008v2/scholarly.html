    <p id="p-6">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put exceptional strain on public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, and commercial laboratories as they attempt to keep up with demands for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The current diagnostic testing methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) are traditional RT-qPCR assays that require two steps: first, an RNA extraction from patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab material, followed by RT-qPCR amplification of the extracted RNA to detect viral RNA

      <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>
     </sup>. The major bottleneck to widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing lies at the RNA extraction step. The simplest manual kit (the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini) is no longer available, and reagents and supplies for the larger automated instruments are extremely limited with uncertain supply chains. While substitution of other RNA extraction kits 
     <sup>
      <a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>,
      <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>
     </sup> is possible, they too are in limited supply. The current bottleneck is not simply the availability of RNA extraction kits, but also the cost of the extraction assay, the labor and time required to perform it, and the fact that it is rate limiting compared to the downstream RT-qPCR analysis. To address this issue, we tested the unconventional approach of skipping the RNA extraction step altogether and directly loading patient swab material into the RT-qPCR mix. Herein, we report that this approach (which we refer to hereafter as âdirect RT-qPCRâ) correctly identified 92% of samples (n =155) previously shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by conventional RT-qPCR featuring an RNA extraction. Thus, our results suggest that this streamlined assay could greatly alleviate constraints to COVID-19 testing in many regions of the world.
    </p>
    <p id="p-7">We initially conducted a pilot experiment using NP swabs from two COVID-19 patients who had previously been verified for SARS-CoV-2 infection by the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory (VDHL) using the CDCâs recommended RT-qPCR test. Both patient samples, which were originally collected as NP swabs in 3 mL of M6 viral transport medium (termed diluent hereafter), were pooled (equi-volume). RNA was extracted from 140 ÂµL of the pooled sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and purified RNA representing 11.3 ÂµL of the original swab diluent was detected as positive via standard RT-qPCR using the CDC 2019-nCoV N3 primer/probe set, with a CT of 18.7. In parallel, we added 7 ÂµL of the pooled COVID-19 patient NP swab diluent directly to the RT-qPCR reaction, and found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in the absence of an RNA extraction step. Compared to the same pooled NP swab diluent extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (after adjusting for the quantity of swab diluent added in each case), adding the NP diluent directly into the RT-qPCR reaction resulted in an â¼ 4 CT drop in sensitivity (
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1a</a>
     </strong>). Preheating the NP diluent for five minutes at 70Â°C prior to RT-qPCR had no impact on viral RNA detection. These results provided proof-of-principle that successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from an NP swab sample by RT-qPCR could be done in the absence of an RNA extraction step.

As a control, the indicated quantities of the CDC 2019-nCoV Positive Control SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA was spiked into M6 transport media, purified using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and screened by RT-qPCR. NP swab samples from seven additional donors were screened by direct RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using (b) the 2019-nCoV_N1 primer/probe set, (c) the 2019-nCoV_N2 primer/probe set, or (d) for human RNase P RNA using the RP primer probe set.

    <p id="p-9">We next sought to validate the direct RT-qPCR approach on additional samples, determine the optimal volume of NP swab diluent for use in the direct RT-qPCR assay, and further address the potential impact of a prior heating step on assay sensitivity. NP samples from three COVID-19 patients who had previously been shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at high, intermediate, or low copy load by the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle were heated or not at 95Â°C for 10 minutes and then directly loaded into RT-qPCR reactions at 1, 3, or 5 ÂµL volumes, or subjected to RNA extraction via the Roche MagNA Pure 96 platform prior to loading the equivalent of â¼20 ÂµL of swab diluent into the RT-qPCR reaction. The main findings of this experiment, shown in 
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>
     </strong>, were that i) SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in all three viral copy level samples at either input volume by direct RT-qPCR, provided they were heated first, and ii) addition of less NP diluent led to more sensitive detection of target RNA. Thus, heating appears important for subsequent detection of low viral copy samples, presumably by denaturing inhibitors of the RT and/or PCR enzymes present in the NP diluent. The best sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection was achieved when 3 ÂµL of swab diluent was used for direct RT-qPCR

    <p id="p-10">The CDC RT-qPCR method includes an internal control primer/probe set for detection of human RNase P. To ensure that direct RT-qPCR was able to detect the presence of this gene in NP swab diluent, and to test whether our approach was generalizable to other primer/probe sets, we screened seven donors (n = 4 COVID-19 positive; n = 3 COVID-19 negative) using the 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and RNase P primer/probe sets. Both the 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2 primer/probe sets specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in each sample from COVID-19 patients, but not in samples from the negative donors (
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-fig-1-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1b,c</a>
     </strong>). In addition, RNase P RNA was successfully detected in each donor by direct RT-qPCR (
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-fig-1-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1d</a>
     </strong>). Collectively, these results confirmed i) the validity of our direct RT-qPCR approach with additional virus-specific primer/probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ii) the presence of intact cellular RNA, as detected with an internal primer-probe set targeting a host gene, in all samples tested.
    </p>
    <p id="p-11">To get an accurate view of how omission of the RNA extraction would perform in a real-world clinical setting, we tested in a blinded fashion a panel of 150 NP swabs from COVID-19 patients representing high (CT less than 20), intermediate (CT of 20 - 30), or low (CT of more than 30) viral RNA loads by direct RT-qPCR. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy levels in these samples were previously determined at UW by standard clinical RT-qPCR that included RNA extraction. To address the potential impact of a prior heating step on detection sensitivity, NP swab samples were heated or not for 10 min at 95Â°C prior to use in the downstream RNA extraction and/or direct RT-qPCR. For each NP swab sample, a 3 ÂµL volume of diluent was used for direct RT-qPCR. In parallel, a 30 ÂµL aliquot of each sample was used for RNA extraction and an equivalent of 3 ÂµL of the original swab diluent used for RT-qPCR, allowing for a one to one comparison with the direct RT-qPCR method. To control for inhibitors of the RT or PCR enzymes and/or RNase activity in the swab diluent, an aliquot of each swab diluent was spiked with 4 x 10
     <sup>4</sup> copies of EXO control RNA for subsequent detection with an EXO primer-probe set; no inhibition was noted under any of the tested conditions. 
     <strong>Supplementary Table 1</strong> shows the full results of this experiment while 
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" class="xref-table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>
     </strong> provides a summary. 
     <strong>
      <a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>
     </strong> shows the CT values from the original clinical RT-qPCR done on the equivalent of 20 ÂµL of NP swab diluent versus those obtained by direct or standard RT-qPCR when measuring 3 ÂµL (or equivalent) of swab diluent. There were several key observations from this experiment. First, preheating NP swab samples prior to direct RT-qPCR enhanced assay sensitivity (e.g. 138 of 150 samples were detected following a heat step, compared with only 126 of 150 positive in the absence of preheating). Second, extraction of RNA prior to RT-qPCR did not enhance detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples when an equivalent amount of diluent was screened by direct RT-qPCR (138 of 150 samples were detected by each approach). This suggests one of the primary advantages of kit-based RNA extraction comes from concentrating the sample material so more RNA can be loaded into the RT-qPCR reaction. Third, 11 of the 12 samples not detected by direct RT-qPCR were from donors that had extremely low loads of viral RNA as originally determined in the clinical test (CTs ranging from 33 to 38). Fourth, preheating samples reduced sensitivity when using the Roche MagnaPure 96 RNA extraction system, but had little effect on the direct RT-qPCR approach. Finally, the results from the EXO spiking experiment indicate that the NP swab diluent does not inhibit the direct RT-qPCR assay. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the direct RT-qPCR assay described here is capable of reliably detecting the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients.

    <p id="p-13">COVID-19 testing demands are currently overwhelming the worldâs clinical laboratories. A major chokepoint is the RNA extraction step, due to both the time and labor for this step and the critical shortage of extraction kits and required reagents. As a means to circumvent these limitations on clinical testing availability, we have shown that a direct RT-qPCR approach that omits an RNA extraction step can effectively identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from NP swabs. Further, direct RT-qPCR is able to detect host RNA from NP swabs, which enables us to rule out false negatives due to inadequate swabbing of patients resulting in a paucity of intact RNA in the specimen, or due to the presence of inhibitors. When applied to a large collection of clinical NP specimens representative of the range of COVID-19 patients in the state of Washington, the direct RT-qPCR assay correctly identified 92% of the donors screened. The only donors that our simplified approach missed were those with the very lowest load of viral RNA (and who were on the very cusp of detection even when RNA extraction was used). Of the 1,872 cases with a positive diagnosis at UW by our team at the time of this writing, only â¼25% would fall into this low copy range, which indicates that this assay will detect the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients. Indeed, after we posted our initial results on bioRxiv

      <a id="xref-ref-4-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>
     </sup>, two additional groups posted preliminary data on bioRxiv and medRxiv replicating these findings, using standard clinical diagnostic methods in Chile and Denmark 
     <sup>
      <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>,
      <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>
     </sup>. The simplified approach we present here may be especially well suited for general screening of the public and identification of âsilent carrierâ individuals. Where resources permit, we envision that a two-step testing algorithm in which a repeat test including RNA extraction could be applied for symptomatic patients, health care workers, and others with a high index of suspicion but an initial negative result. Such a two-step strategy would reduce the need for RNA extraction for a substantial portion of future COVID-19 tests. Importantly, many testing sites in the developing world may not even have the capacity to perform RNA extraction, but could easily run RT-qPCR reactions. This new approach would open up a viable avenue for testing in these regions.

      <p id="p-5">The original version of this manuscript reported that addition of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab diluent from COVID-19 positive donors directly into a RT-qPCR reaction (ie. skipping the RNA extraction step) was a streamlined approach that could identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swab samples. Our initial finding was based on a single patient NP sample (which is shown in Figure 1a of this revision). The remainder of the data in this revision is new. Specifically, we have now optimized conditions for this direct RT-PCR test (new Table 1), and replicated our result using 154 additional clinical samples (new Figures 1b,c,d and 2, new Table 2, and new Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, we have included COVID-19 negative samples, which enables control for the presence of RNA in the swab specimens to rule out missing a positive due to an absence of intact RNA in the specimen (Figure 1d). Importantly, new collaborators (The Jerome laboratory at UW Seattle) joined the UVM team to generate this new data and are included as coauthors. Note that this revision removes Figures 2 and 3 of the original version (dealing with the use of alternative RNA extraction kits).</p>
