  <meta name="DC.Description" content="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. ### Competing Interest Statement"/>
