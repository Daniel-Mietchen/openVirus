  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Genetic polymorphisms within the IFNL3/IFNL4 genomic region, which encodes type III interferons, have been strongly associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through up to 5 years of follow-up. Genetic polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 that functionally affect type III interferons were genotyped with TaqMan assays. For both genetic variants and each infection, we evaluated time to first episode and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of an infection episode during follow-up, controlling for relevant covariates. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-λ4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.003) and respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p=0.005) and malaria (OR=1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p=0.033). IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 were in moderate linkage disequilibrium in this population (r2=0.78), and all the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-λ4 and not IFN-λ3 as the primary cause of these associations. We conclude that the ability to produce IFN-λ4 may have broad health-related implications by negatively affecting the immune response and clinical outcomes of several common infections. ### Competing Interest Statement L.P.-O. is a co-inventor on IFN-λ4-related patents issued to NCI/NIH, and receives royalties for monoclonal antibodies for IFN-λ4 detection.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p id="p-2">Genetic polymorphisms within the IFNL3/IFNL4 genomic region, which encodes type III interferons, have been strongly associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through up to 5 years of follow-up. Genetic polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 that functionally affect type III interferons were genotyped with TaqMan assays. For both genetic variants and each infection, we evaluated time to first episode and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of an infection episode during follow-up, controlling for relevant covariates. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-λ4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.003) and respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p=0.005) and malaria (OR=1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p=0.033). IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 were in moderate linkage disequilibrium in this population (r2=0.78), and all the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-λ4 and not IFN-λ3 as the primary cause of these associations. We conclude that the ability to produce IFN-λ4 may have broad health-related implications by negatively affecting the immune response and clinical outcomes of several common infections.</p>

      <p id="p-4">In the revised version we additionally adjusted the analysis for the paternal tribe that helps to control for possible population stratification. The associations with gastrointestinal infection became more significant, the associations with malaria were slightly attenuated and the associations with respiratory infections were not affected by this adjustment. These results suggest that IFNL4 might be important for the negative regulation of immune response to multiple infections.</p>
