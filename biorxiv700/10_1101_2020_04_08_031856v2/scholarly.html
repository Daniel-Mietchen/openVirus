  <meta name="DC.Description" content="The role of the RNAi/Dicer/Ago system to degrade RNA viruses has been elusive, which prompt authors to think that interferon (IFN) synthesis is essential, relegating the dsRNAs as accessory function. We investigate SARS-CoV-2 genome responsible of the new deadly COVID-19 pandemic for the theoretical possibilities to engage intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid pairing with human transcriptome. Segmental pieces of RNAs that originate from SARS-CoV-2 were computationally searched as a potential source of one strand, the complementary strand being from the host transcriptome. We therefore considered perfect complementarity of host RNA with any piece of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a collection of theoretical siRNAs potentially Dicer substrates. Few human genes seems targeted by SARS-CoV-2 RNA, among them mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30 and a subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 could explain premature death of infected cell by the collapse of mitochondria. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest."/>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p id="p-2">The role of the RNAi/Dicer/Ago system to degrade RNA viruses has been elusive, which prompt authors to think that interferon (IFN) synthesis is essential, relegating the dsRNAs as accessory function. We investigate SARS-CoV-2 genome responsible of the new deadly COVID-19 pandemic for the theoretical possibilities to engage intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid pairing with human transcriptome. Segmental pieces of RNAs that originate from SARS-CoV-2 were computationally searched as a potential source of one strand, the complementary strand being from the host transcriptome. We therefore considered perfect complementarity of host RNA with any piece of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a collection of theoretical siRNAs potentially Dicer substrates.
