# EThOS

These results are based on a sample of 7,655 [EThOS](https://ethos.bl.uk/) theses, all published in 2014. They were arranged into a CProject, with plain text versions of each file generated by [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/). I then ran:

```
ami-search -p ethos-sample --dictionary=virus_topics --dictionary=viral_systemic_diseases
```

...using the Dockerised versions of the tools I built [here](https://github.com/anjackson/contentminer/).

The process took 30mins, consumed a lot of RAM (15GB), and appears to slow down linearly as the number of documents processed increased.

It also threw an XML error and the analysis didn't complete, so I'm not sure I have all the outputs.

See [the log](./ethos-sample-ami-search.out) for details.

The results of the analysis are in the [ethos-sample](./ethos-sample), and the snippets are included for dictionary-based results.
