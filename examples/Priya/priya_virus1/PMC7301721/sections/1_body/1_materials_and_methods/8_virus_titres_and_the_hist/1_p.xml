<p>The amount of virus was evaluated using quantitative PCR. Organ tissue was prepared for haematoxylin eosin (HE) staining. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were also conducted. Paraffin sections of organs were de-waxed and then subjected to heat treatment in citrate buffer, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 0.3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in methanol. Sections were blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Cat#H1130, Solarbio, Tongzhou, Beijing, China) in PBS and incubated sequentially overnight at 4°C with 1:200 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-H7N9 antibodies(Cat#GTX125989, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA). Antibody binding was detected using EnVision System reagents (Cat#K5007, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). All slides were counterstained with haematoxylin.
