<p>The viral RNA of the H7N9 virus was extracted using Trizol (Cat#15596-026, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) method. The concentration, purity, and integrity of total viral RNA were detected using a NanoDrop 2000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The sequencing library was constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-zero Gold (Cat# RS-122-2301, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and the process was conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The library was constructed as follows: after digesting ribosomal RNA with Ribo-zero, the RNA was broken into fragments of about 350 nt using Fragment High Mix, and the sequencing library was constructed by synthesizing and purifying cDNA, terminal repair, adding poly-A tail, ligating sequencing connectors, and PCR amplification. After quality checking, the library was sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq Xten sequencer. The sequencing strategy generated 150 bp paired ends (PE150).</p>
