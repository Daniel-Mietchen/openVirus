<p>Clean reads were obtained through data quality control and filtering of raw sequencing data using the NGSQC toolkit [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clean Reads were compared to the reference genome (A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus) using BWA software [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on the results of the comparison between the samples and the reference genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) sites were detected using the Freebayes, and the snpEff software [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used for functional annotation of SNPs and INDELs. The screening criteria of SNPs and INDELs were that the number of covered reads was greater than five and the quality value was greater than 20.
