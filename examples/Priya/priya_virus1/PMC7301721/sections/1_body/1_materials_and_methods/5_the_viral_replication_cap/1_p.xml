<p>The TCID50 (Fifty percent tissue culture infective dose) assay was performed as described previously[
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The virus replication capability were valued using embryonated chicken eggs and A549 cells models. The two strains of viruses (both with the amount of 100 TCID50) were injected into 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and cultured in incubator at 37°C for 72 h. The replication capability of the two strains of viruses were measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre.
