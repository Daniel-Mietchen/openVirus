<p>After culture for 48 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS slightly. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After washed twice with PBS slightly, cells were penetrated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Cells were again washed, blocked for 30 min with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Cat#H1130, Solarbio, Tongzhou, Beijing, China) and incubated sequentially with 1:400 dilution of mouse anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein antibody (Cat#ab128193, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 1 h. After washing 5 times with PBS, the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat#ab150133, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 1:500 dilution was used as the secondary antibody. After washing 5 times with PBS, DAPI (Cat#C0060, Solarbio, Tongzhou, Beijing, China) was used as the nuclear counterstain. After washing 5 times with PBS, the cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope.</p>
