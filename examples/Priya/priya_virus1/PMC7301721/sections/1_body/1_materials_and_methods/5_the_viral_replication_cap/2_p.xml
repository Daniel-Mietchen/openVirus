<p>A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. When the cell density reached 70­–80%, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the bovine serum. The cells were then infected with the viruses (MOI=0.1). After the adsorption for 2 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS. DMEM supplemented with 1% foetal bovine albumin and 1 µg/ml L-l-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) was added to the culture A549 cells for 48 h when culturing the ZJU01 strain. DMEM supplemented with 1% foetal bovine albumin was added to the culture A549 cells for 48 h while culturing the GZ8H002 strain. The virus culture supernatant was measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre.
