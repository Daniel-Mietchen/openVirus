<p>The work was carried out in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Guangzhou Eighth People’s hospital (Ethical approval No. 20170178). Sputum and plasma specimens were collected daily after admission. The patient’s plasma remaining after routine testing was stored in a bio-sample banker. The normal plasma were collected from 10 volunteers (half male and half female). The median age of these volunteers was 26 (interquartile range 23–28 year) year old. These volunteers came to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine for regular physical examination. After the physical examination, these volunteers were confirmed healthy. The remaining plasma after routine testing was stored and used in our study.</p>
