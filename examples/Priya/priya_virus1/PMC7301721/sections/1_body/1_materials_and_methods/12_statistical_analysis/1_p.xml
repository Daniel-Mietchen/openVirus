<p>Statistical analyses of data for weight and survival rate were performed using Graphpad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analyses of the data for cytokines and chemokines were conducted using the Mann–Whitney test. Statistical analyses of the data for H7N9 gene expression in A549, embryonated chicken egg and mouse serum were conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Statistical analyse of the data for H7N9 gene expression in exosome-enclosed viral particle was conducted using paired t test. Statistical analyses of the data for H7N9 gene expression in the brain and lung leachates were conducted using a two-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni post-tests. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to compare the TICD50 titre of H7N9 virus isolated from the exosomes. The values are presented as means ± SD for the indicated sample sizes.
