<p>Mice were inoculated intranasally with 50 µl 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID50 A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) or the A/Zhejiang/ DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Cat#20012500BT, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) of the same volume was given to the mice in the control group. Mice were observed for illness, weight loss, and death post-infection. Then, the mice were sacrificed, and their serum was collected at 2, 4, and 6 days post-infection (dpi) . The lung and brain were removed. Part of the organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, while the other part was used to detect virus levels using quantitative PCR. An H7N9 nucleic acid quantitative detection kit (Cat#Z-RR-0309-02) and Influenza virus A Real time RT-PCR kit (Cat#RR-0051-01) were purchased from Zhijiang biological technology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China.
