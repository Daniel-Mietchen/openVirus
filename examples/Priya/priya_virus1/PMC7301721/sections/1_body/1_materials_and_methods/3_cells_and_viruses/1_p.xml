<p>The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) and A549 cell line (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). The cell lines were propagated in growth medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cat#11965092, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat#10100147, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus used in this study was isolated from a patient in Guangzhou, China, in 2017 (GenBank: MF455313- 455320). We isolated this virus from the patient’s plasma. The A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus was isolated from a patient in Zhejiang Province, China, in 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Virus stocks were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs at 37°C for 72 h. The allantoic fluid was harvested and tested using a haemagglutinin HA assay. Aliquots of the allantoic fluid containing the virus were stored at −80°C until further use.
