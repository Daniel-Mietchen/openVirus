<p>The culture of the two strains of viruses in A549 cell model was described in the previous part. After 48 h of culture, the culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 500 ×
 <italic> g</italic> to remove the cells. Then 40 ml virus culture supernatant was obtained. The supernatant was then subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 120000 ×
 <italic> g</italic> for 3 h in Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge. The pelleted exosomes were resuspended in 200 µl of PBS. The exosomes were then observed using a Tecnai Spirit 120 kv transmission electronic microscope.
