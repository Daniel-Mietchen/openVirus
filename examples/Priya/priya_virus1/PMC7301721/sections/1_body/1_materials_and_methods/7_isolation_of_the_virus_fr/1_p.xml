<p>The sera collected at 2, 4, and 6 dpi were used to isolate the virus. About 100 µl of serum was injected into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. The embryonated chicken eggs were cultured in an incubator at 37°C for 72 h. The allantoic fluid was harvested and tested using an HA assay. Then 100ul serum from the 6 dpi infected mice was used to detect virus levels using quantitative PCR. Meantime, we collected 1.2 ml of serum from the 6 dpi infected mice and diluted in 40 ml of PBS. The dilution was subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 120000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 h in a Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The pellet of virus was resuspended by 200 µl of PBS. The viruses were observed using a Tecnai Spirit 120 kv transmission electronic microscope to analyse their structure.
