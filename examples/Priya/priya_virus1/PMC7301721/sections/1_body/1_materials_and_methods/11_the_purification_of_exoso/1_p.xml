<p>To separate the virus from the exosomes, exosomes were purified using an Exosome-human CD63 Isolation kit (Cat#10606D, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The exosomes were bound to the magnetic beads marked by CD63. The viruses were separated by washing with solution buffer. Then, 40 µl of magnetic beads were washed with 200 µl of isolation buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA). The pre-enriched exosome solution was titrated with isolation buffer for the magnetic beads and mixed well. The beads were incubated overnight for 22 h at 4°C with mixing. The bead-bound exosomes were washed by adding 400 µl of isolation buffer and mixed gently by pipetting. The tube was placed on a magnet for 1 min and the supernatant was discarded. These steps were repeated three times. The purification of exosome was verified, with no H7N9 detected in supernatant (Cq &gt; 38 was considered negative). The last supernatant was collected and the bead-bound exosomes were resuspended by 300 µl of isolation buffer. The identification of H7N9 genes in the exosome was performed using an H7N9 nucleic acid quantitative detection kit. Then, 100 µl of bead-bound exosomes solution was injected to the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and cultured at 37°C for 72 h. The allantoic fluid was harvested and tested using an HA assay.</p>
