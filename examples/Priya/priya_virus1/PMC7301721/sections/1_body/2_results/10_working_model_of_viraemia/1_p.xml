<p>HPAI H7N9 virus infection starts in the respiratory tract. After infection, HPAI H7N9 virus replicates in the lung. Meanwhile, the patient suffered from persistent viraemia and a cytokine storm was observed his plasma. Live H7N9 virus was detected the patientâ€™s blood. These phenomena were confirmed using animal experiments. How is the virus transmitted from the lung to the blood? One possible explanation is that inflammation leads to the disruption of the lung-blood barrier. Another possibility is that the virus is released into the blood through via exosomes. When the H7N9 virus exists in the blood, the virus might cause extrapulmonary infection. We speculated that the virus could infect the brain, after observing this phenomenon in the mouse model (
