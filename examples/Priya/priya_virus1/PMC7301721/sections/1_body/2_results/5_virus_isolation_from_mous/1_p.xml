<p>We isolated the H7N9 virus from the mouse serum. In the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) infection mice, the live virus was detected persistently in the serum until death (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The serum collected at 2 dpi from the mice infected with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) contained live virus (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the following days of infection, live virus was not detected in serum. At 6 dpi, the H7 gene in the serum was detected using quantitative PCR. The H7 gene in the serum from mice infected with GZ8H002 strain was significantly higher than that from mice infected with ZJU01 strain (
