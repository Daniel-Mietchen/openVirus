<p>The histopathology of organ tissues was evaluated using HE staining. The extent and characteristics of the lesions varied among the groups. The mice infected with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) had multifocal interstitial inflammatory hyperaemia and exudative pathological changes in the lung, with larger lesions in the lung tissue and fusion of multiple patchy lesions. These histopathological changes were severe at 2 dpi. In the following days, the pathological changes of the lung tissue persisted, but gradually improved. At 6 dpi, the pathological change became moderate. This was consistent with the improvement in the mice’s general health (

At 2 dpi, the mice showed mild pulmonary injury. However, at 4 dpi, the pathological changes in the lungs were severe. The pulmonary pathological changes continued to worsen until death (
