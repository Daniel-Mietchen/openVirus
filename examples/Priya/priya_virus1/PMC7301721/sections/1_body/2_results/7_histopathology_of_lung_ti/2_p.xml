<p>High levels of the H7 virus gene were detected persistently in the lungs of the H7N9-infected mice (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). At 2 dpi the expression of the H7 gene was higher in the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9)-infected mice than in the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9)-infected mice. However, as infection continued, the expression of H7 gene in the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9)-infected mice increased rapidly. At 4 and 6 dpi, the expression of the H7 gene in the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) infection group was significantly higher than that in the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) infection group. The TCID50 was persistently detected in lung (

At 4 and 6 dpi, the TCID50 was higher in the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) infection group than in the A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) infection group. H7N9 virus was isolated persistently from the lung tissue collected at 2, 4, and 6 dpi in both infection groups (
