<p>We further compared the replication ability of these two virus. When cultured in embryonated chicken eggs, the replication ability of A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus was better than that of A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9). The quantity of RNA and the TCID50 titre of A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) was higher than those of A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) (

 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Thus, the viral replication capability of A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) strain was significantly higher than that of A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) (
