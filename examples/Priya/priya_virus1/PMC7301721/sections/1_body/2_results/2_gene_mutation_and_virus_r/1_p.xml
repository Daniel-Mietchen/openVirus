<p>The HPAI virus could be isolated from both the sputum and the plasma. Deep sequencing of the HPAI virus isolated from the sputum and the plasma were performed. The genome of ZJU01 strain was used as the reference genome. A circos diagram was constructed to present the mutations in the different genes (HA, NA, PA, PB1, PB2, NP, MP, NS). In the circos diagram, the innermost circle represents the virus isolated from the plasma. The other circles represent the virus isolated from the sputum collected at different times. The HPAI virus isolated from the sputum (three sputum samples from the same patient) and the plasma were highly similar. There were only rare mutations between them. However, the genes of the HPAI virus had many mutation in the eight viral genes compared with ZJU01 strain (
