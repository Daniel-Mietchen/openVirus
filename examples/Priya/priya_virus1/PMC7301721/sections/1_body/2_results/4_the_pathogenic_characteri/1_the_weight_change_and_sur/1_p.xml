<p>We observed illness, weight loss, and death in the mice after H7N9 challenge. Various amounts of weight change were noted in all three groups (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). The mice challenged with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) presented a relatively acute clinical process, and showed inactivity, ruffled fur, and poor appetite post-infection. The status of the mice gradually deteriorated over the following days. By day 6 post-infection, the remaining mice presented with severe signs of respiratory disease, including respiratory distress and further lack of appetite, and nearly 20% weight loss. All of the mice were dead by day 7 post-infection. The mice challenged with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) presented with mild illness and weight loss in the first 7 days. Thereafter, the mice gradually recovered, with an increase in body weight. The mice in normal control group were healthy during the entire observation period with no obvious weight loss or illness.
