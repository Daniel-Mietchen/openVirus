<p>We collected the serum of mice infected with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) in early (2 dpi) and late stages (6 dpi) of infection and detected the serum cytokine levels. In the early stage of infection, IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-13 levels were high in the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) infection groups (

The IL-13 level remained higher than that in the normal control. The mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) continued to suffer from the cytokinemia. The levels of IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-γ and KC were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (
