<p>To determine whether the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) strain had acquired any key molecular substitutions associated with increased virulence and transmissibility in mammals, or with antiviral drug resistance, we performed deep sequencing of the HPAI H7N9 virus. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus had acquired a four-amino-acid insertion in the HA cleavage site. The very important position L217Q in the HA protein leading to antigenicity change was missing in A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus has also acquired a significant mutation, R289 K, in the NA protein that leads to drug resistance [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24–27</xref>]. The K526R and M535L mutations conferring adaptations for mammalian infection have occurred in the PB2 protein of the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus. However, almost no D701N mutations were detected in this HPAI virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the PA protein, we found two major mutations, V100A and S409N, and in the NP protein we found V33I [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which cause the virus to be able to infect humans and well as avians. Moreover, the V100A mutation was found to be related to the fatality of H7N9 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
