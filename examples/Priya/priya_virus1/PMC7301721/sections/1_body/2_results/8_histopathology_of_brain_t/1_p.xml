<p>In both infection groups, HE staining of brains presented inflammatory cell infiltration (

 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). By contrast, the brains of the mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) presented increasingly severe pathological changes with extended infection time. In IHC staining of brains, large amounts of H7N9 viral antigens were detected in the brain at 6 d after infection (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E). The results suggested that the virus had infected the brain tissue.
