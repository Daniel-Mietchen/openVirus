<p>We also detected the expression of the H7 gene in brain leachate (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). The H7 gene was detected persistently in both infection groups. The H7 gene level in A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9)-infected mice were stable at 2, 4, and 6 dpi. However, in the A/Guangdong /GZ8H002/2017(H7N9)-infected mice, the amount of H7 gene detected at 6 dpi increased dramatically. The level of H7 gene was significantly higher than that in the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9)-infected mice (
