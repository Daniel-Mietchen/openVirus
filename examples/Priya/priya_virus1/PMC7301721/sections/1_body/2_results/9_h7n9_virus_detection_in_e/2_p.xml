<p>After purification, the H7N9 virus genes in the exosomes were detected using quantitative PCR. The exosome-enclosed viral particle is a very small part compared to the total viral particle. The H7 gene content of total viral particle and exosome-enclosed viral particle were presented in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D,E. The H7N9 amplicons were detected in samples of exosomes from both A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) or A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) infected cells (
