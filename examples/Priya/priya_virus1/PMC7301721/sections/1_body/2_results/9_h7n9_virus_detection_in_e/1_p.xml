<p>The exosomes were enriched using ultra-centrifugation. The morphology of the exosome was viewed using TEM. The typical shape of exosomes was observed in the different groups. The shape and size of the exosome varied from 50 to 200â€…nm. The culture supernatant from A549 cell model without virus infection was observed using transmission electronic microscope. The exosomes were showed by blue arrow (

 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). The culture supernatant from A549 cell model with GZ8H002 strain infection was observed using transmission electronic microscope. The exosome was showed by blue arrow. The viral particles were viewed and showed by red arrow (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). We found the exosome was closely related to virus. The virus seemed to be released from the exosome. This may be the direct evidence that exosomes contain viral particles.
