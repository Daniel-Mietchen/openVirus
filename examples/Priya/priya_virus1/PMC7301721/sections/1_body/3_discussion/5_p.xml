<p>However, we must say that we haven’t fully revealed the potential mechanism behind this feature of the 2017 H7N9 strain. But we observed the GZ8H002 strain might have acquired the possible key molecular substitutions associated with increased virulence and transmissibility in mammals. As we know, the presence of KRTA insertion in the cleavage sites enhanced the extrapulmonary infection ability and virulence of HPAI virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This effect has been also confirmed in H5N1 and H7N7 [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Influenza related encephalitis has also been found in H5N1 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The mutation of K526R is related to the increase of virus replication ability and the mutation of M535L may increase the virus polymerase activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44–46</xref>]. We found GZ8H002 strain has both K526R and M535L mutations. On the basis of the insertion of KRTA at HA cleavage site of highly pathogenic H7N9, cumulative effect may occur, which together leads to the enhancement of pathogenicity and neurotropism of highly pathogenic H7N9. But, more experiments are needed to confirm whether these mutations are essential for high virulence of highly pathogenic H7N9 virus.
