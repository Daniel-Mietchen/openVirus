<p>Exosomes are cellular secreted vesicles that are free to enter cells in a receptor-independent manner. Exosomes have been found to be closely associated with viral infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and can carry large amounts of viral nucleic acid or protein components. Studies have demonstrated that exosomes can carry HIV, hepatitis C virus, HAV, and Zika virus, causing the virus to spread [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12â€“14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study, we used the A549 cell model and found that A549 cells secreted exosomes under viral pressure. Gene fragments of HPAI H7N9 virus were detected in these exosomes. In addition, after inoculating chicken embryos with these exosomes, we isolated the H7N9 virus, further supporting the hypothesis that exosomes carry the entire genome of the H7N9 virus or live virus. These findings suggested that H7N9 extrapulmonary infection might develop via the exosome pathway. However, confirmatory trials are required to further clarify whether exosomes are indeed a route to extrapulmonary infection.
