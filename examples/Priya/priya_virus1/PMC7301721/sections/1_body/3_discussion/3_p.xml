<p>In our previous study, we observed that the levels of 34 of the 48 cytokines and chemokines tested were significantly elevated in plasma samples from patients infected with LPAI H7N9. We further found that the levels of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, and SCGF-β were highly positively correlated to disease severity. In addition, the profile of mediators MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-β, IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-γ is an independent outcome predictor [

Among them, the levels of ten cytokines and chemokines, including MIG, IL-1ra, IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, IFN-γ, MCP-3, IL-18, HGF, and MCP-1, were dramatically higher (&gt; 30-fold) in this patient compared with those in the healthy controls. The acute cytokinemia might lead to the patient’s death. The similar phenomenon was also observed in the mouse experiment. The mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) suffered a persistent cytokinemia, which might be the cause of death.
