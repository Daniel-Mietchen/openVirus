<p>Influenza virus infection of the respiratory tract is associated with a range of neurological complications. The incidence of severe pandemic H1N1 influenza-associated neurological complications was estimated to be 1.2 per 1,00,000 persons among children and Asian Pacific patients [

 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in patients’ cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, in a mouse experiment, H1N1 was found to infect many brain regions and induce neuropathological changes in neonatal mouse brains [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, avian H7N9 virus could effectively infect human brain cells. Meanwhile, the virus could be transcribed, replicate its viral genome, and generate infectious progeny virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, we detected relatively high levels of virus RNA in brain of mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. However, in the TCID50 test of the brain leachate, no H7N9 virus was found in the samples of mice infected with the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. By contrast, the TCID50 test was positive for A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) in the brain leachate at 6 dpi. The brain pathological changes supported this finding. We identified high levels of virus replication in the brain. Furthermore, we isolated live virus from the brain leachate. The replication of virus in the brain could cause profound central nervous system injury. Observation of neurological changes caused by H7N9 virus infection deserves further attention when managing these patients.
