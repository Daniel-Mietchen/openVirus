<p>In the previous studies of H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus infection, viraemia was commonly existed in the fatal cases, but was absent in nonfatal cases [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In previous study of H7N9, the virus RNA could only be detected in the lethal cases [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The amount of RNA detected in H7N9 patients is very small, and there is no previous report about patient with H7N9 infection to be confirmed to have viraemia. While in highly pathogenic H7N9 infection the viraemia was confirmed, which makes a great difference. At present, the mortality rate of H7N9 is about 40%, while as reported the mortality rate of highly pathogenic H7N9 is as high as 50% [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We speculated that there is a relationship between viraemia and high mortality. But more experiments still need to be carried out to confirm this suggestion.
