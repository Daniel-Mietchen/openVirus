<p>In the present study, HPAI H7N9 infection of a patient proved to be deadly. This patient presented with viraemia and died 3 days after admission. Whether there is live virus in the blood and whether it could lead to extrapulmonary infection have been two important questions. Previous studies detected viral RNA from LPAI H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1 infections [

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. H5N1 can be transmitted in ferrets by transfusion [

We successfully isolated the live virus from the patientâ€™s plasma. We confirmed that the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus persisted in the blood with mouse experiments.
