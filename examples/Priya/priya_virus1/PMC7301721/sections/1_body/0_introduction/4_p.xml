<p>Exosomes play an important role in viral infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that exosomes often carry viral RNA and proteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, studies have shown that the exosomes can carry intact HIV, HAV, HCV, and Zika viruses, causing their transmission and infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12â€“16</xref>]. Thus, exosomes have been confirmed as a route of virus transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The H7N9 virus might also spread through via exosomes. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the novel pathogenic characteristics of highly pathogenic H7N9.
