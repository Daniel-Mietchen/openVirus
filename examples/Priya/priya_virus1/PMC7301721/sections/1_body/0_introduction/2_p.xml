<p>In a previous study of H5N1 virus infection, viraemia was detected in 82% of the fatal cases, but absent in nonfatal cases. High viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. Individuals with detectable H5N1 RNA in their blood also had higher pharyngeal viral loads than those without evidence of H5N1 RNA, suggesting that the presence of viral RNA in blood reflects an overall high viral burden, which commonly leads to high mortality [

Viral RNA might represent non-infectious virus rather than infectious virus particles. No live viruses were isolated in the blood of these patients [
