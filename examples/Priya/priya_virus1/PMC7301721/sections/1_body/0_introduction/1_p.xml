<p>In February 2013, the avian influenza A H7N9 virus was identified as causing human infection, with high mortality and morbidity. To date, five waves of H7N9 infection have caused more than 1500 severe human infections and the mortality remains high, with more than 600 deaths [

The potential mechanism of this phenomenon may be that the later H7N9 viruses had a stronger ability to bind human receptors than the early isolates [

The H7N9 virus was spread in poultry, waterfowl, and migratory birds. Patients with H7N9 infection commonly had a history of exposure to sick and dying poultry. No evidence of human-to-human transmission was found. In the beginning of 2017, a novel highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAI) H7N9 was identified in human cases [

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in China, and 32 human cases were found to be caused by the HPAI H7N9 virus. Meanwhile, the HPAI H7N9 virus was continuously detected in poultry or environmental samples in 14 provinces. Approximately 60,000 poultry have died from HPAI H7N9 virus infections. The rapid growth of human cases and the geographical expansion of the HPAI H7N9 virus pose a great challenge to public health.
