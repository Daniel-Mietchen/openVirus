<p>Genetic changes to viruses might change their behaviour and pathogenic characteristics [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We treated a 63-year-old male patient with HPAI H7N9 infection. This patient had onset symptoms of high fever (42°C), sore throat, cough, palpitations and shortness of breath on day 9. The patient went to the Guangzhou Eighth People’s hospital and was admitted. This patient was severely infected and died 3 days after admission. We isolated H7N9 virus from the patient’s plasma. Isolation of virus was important to prove whether the virus disseminates beyond the respiratory tract. HPAI H7N9 caused severe viraemia, which might result in intense inflammatory responses, contributing to the high mortality. When live virus was isolated in the blood, virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract became possible.
