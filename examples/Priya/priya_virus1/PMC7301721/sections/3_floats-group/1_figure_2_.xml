  <p>Gene mutation and virus replication capability. A: A circos diagram showing the gene mutations. The genome of A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) was used as a reference genome. The circos diagram was constructed to show the mutations in the different genes (HA, NA, PA, PB1, PB2, NP, MA, and NS). In the circos diagram, the innermost circle represents the virus isolated from the plasma. The other circles represent the viruses isolated from the sputum collected at different times. The marked lines show the mutation sites. B-C: The virus replication capability in embryonated chicken eggs. Replication capability was measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre. D-E: The virus replication capability in embryonated A549 cells. Replication capability was measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre. F: Cell fluorescence map. The virus replication capability was indicated by fluorescence intensity.</p>
