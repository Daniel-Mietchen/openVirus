  <p>Isolation of exosomes and identification of viral genes. A: The culture supernatant from A549 cell model without virus infection was observed using transmission electronic microscope. The exosomes were showed by blue arrow. B: The culture supernatant from A549 cell model with ZJU01 strain infection was observed using transmission electronic microscope. The exosome was showed by blue arrow. The viral particles were viewed and showed by red arrow. C: The culture supernatant from A549 cell model with GZ8H002 strain infection was observed using transmission electronic microscope. The exosome was showed by blue arrow. The viral particles were viewed and showed by red arrow. D: The viral content in A549 cell model infected with ZJU01 strain. E: The viral content in A549 cell model infected with GZ8H002 strain. F: The H7 gene content in exosomes. G: The isolation of H7N9 virus from exosomes. H: The TCID50 titre of the H7N9 virus isolated from the exosomes.</p>
