  <p>The pathogenic characteristics of HPAI H7N9 in mice. 
   <bold>A:</bold> The weight change and survival curves of mice. The mice challenged with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) all died by 7 days post-infection. The mice challenged with A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) presented with mild illness and weight loss in the first 7 days. In the following period, these mice recovered with an increase in body weight. The mice in normal control group were normal during the entire observation period with no obvious weight loss or illness. B: The H7 gene content in mouse serum. At 6 dpi, the H7 gene in the serum form mice infected with GZ8H002 strain was significantly higher than that from mice infected with ZJU01 strain. C: The typical structure of the virus observed in the serum of mice. The virus was observed using a Tecnai Spirit 120 kv transmission electronic microscope(68,000 × magnification). The typical structure of the virus is indicated by a red arrow. D: The serum of mice observed using the transmission electronic microscope. E-G: The cytokine levels in H7N9-infected mice at 2 dpi. H-J: The cytokines level in H7N9-infected mice at 6 dpi. dpi: days post infection.
