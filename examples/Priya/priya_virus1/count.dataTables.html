        <span class="abst" title="The H7N9 virus mutated in 2017, resulting in new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 virus infection. H7N9 was found in a viraemic patient in Guangdong province, China. The present study aimed to clarify the pathogenic characteristics of HPAI H7N9. Virus was isolated from the plasma and sputum of the patient with HPAI H7N9. Liquid phase chip technology was used to detect the plasma cytokines from the infected patient and healthy controls. Mice were infected with strains A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) to observe the virus's pathogenic characteristics. Serum and brain tissue were collected at 2, 4, and 6 days after infection. The viruses in serum and brain tissue were detected and isolated. The two strains were infected into A549 cells, exosomes were extracted, and virus genes in the exosomes were assessed. Live virus was isolated from the patient's plasma. An acute cytokine storm was detected during the whole course of the disease. In animal experiments, A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) was more pathogenic than A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and resulted in the death of mice. Live virus was isolated from infected mouse serum. Virus infection was also detected in the brain of mice. Under viral stress, A549 cells secreted exosomes containing the entire viral genome. The viraemic patient was confirmed to have an HPAI H7N9 infection. A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) showed significantly enhanced toxicity. Patient deaths might result from cytokine storms and brain infections. Extrapulmonary tissue infection might occur via the exosome pathway. The determined pathogenic characteristics of HPAI H7N9 will contribute to its future treatment.">
