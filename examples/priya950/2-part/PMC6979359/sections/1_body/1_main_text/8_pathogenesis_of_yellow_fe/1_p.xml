<p id="Par51">Most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of YF in humans and NHP results from experimentally infected rhesus monkeys (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. The first successful infection of a rhesus monkey with YFV was demonstrated in 1928, by Stokes and colleagues (1928). The authors described the main pathological changes related to acidophilic necrosis of the liver parenchyma affecting predominantly the mid-zonal region of the lobule [

Similar findings were later reported in rhesus monkey three days post-inoculation with a high infectious dose (4565â€“400,000 times of the 50% lethal dose in a mice model). The progress of the disease was marked by an increase in necrotic liver cells, accompanied by an increase in animal temperature. Necropsies demonstrated infiltration of the portal tract and hepatic veins of the liver with inflammatory cells [
