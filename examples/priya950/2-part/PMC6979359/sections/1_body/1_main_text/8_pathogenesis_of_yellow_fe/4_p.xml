<p id="Par54">Recent YF outbreaks in Brazil opened an opportunity to study naturally infected NHP. Cunha and colleagues (2019) performed immunohistochemistry analyses and observed brown granular cytoplasmic hepatocytes in YFV-positive specimens of 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22), 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic> spp. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7), but not in five specimens of YFV-positive 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Two carcasses of female 
 <italic>Callicebus personatus</italic> displayed petechiae in the gastric mucosa, blood clots in the stomach, hemorrhagic and friable spleen, macroscopic changes with yellow areas in the hepatic parenchyma, plus edema in lungs and eyelid, and hyperemia of the eyelid. YFV RNA was detected in the lungs, liver, kidneys, bladder, stomach, and intestine, suggesting that the pathological picture was probably caused by YFV [

 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp and 22 non-identified specimens). They observed massive liver necrosis with Councilman bodies, splenic lymphoid depletion, follicular necrosis, acute renal tubular necrosis, and multisystemic hemorrhage [

One animal from this study presented atypical signs, such as massive steatosis with rare midzonal to random single-cell necrosis and multifocal micro abscesses in the liver, probably associated with an acute intestinal bacterial infection or septicemia. The same animal presented endothelial necrosis and hepatic regeneration signs, as suggested by oval cell hyperplasia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. During the last YF outbreak in Brazil, natural infection of Neotropical NHP resembled experimental infection, but new findings were reported. The comprehensive understanding of YF pathogenesis in Neotropical NHP could bear further studies using alternative animal models, bringing light in important aspects of YF pathogenesis and treatment.
