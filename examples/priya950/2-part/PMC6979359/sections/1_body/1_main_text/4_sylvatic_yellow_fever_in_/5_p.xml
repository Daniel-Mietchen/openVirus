<p id="Par31">In Brazil, most of human YF cases are described in males aged 14 to 35, who are more exposed to YFV by occupational or ecotourism activities in rural and sylvatic endemic regions. However, since the end of the 1990s, the numbers of YF cases among women and younger people have been increasing [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These numbers demonstrate an increase of 2.82 times the total of YF human cases and 1.57 times the sum of YF human deaths, compared to the previous 36 years (from 1980 to 2015) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Human cases were confirmed in 388 municipalities in the Southeast (96%), South, Midwest, and North regions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These data illustrate the magnitude of the recent YF epidemics in Brazil, reaching extensive YF-free areas.
