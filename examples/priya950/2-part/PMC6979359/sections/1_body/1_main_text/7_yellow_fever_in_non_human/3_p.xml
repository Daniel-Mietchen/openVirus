<p id="Par46">
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> is described as the most susceptible genus to YFV infection, developing clinical illness and fatal disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>], even when infected with low virus inoculum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, YFV antibodies have been detected in some specimens of 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic>, showing that some animals survive [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. In South America, it is common to hear howling monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp.) in the forests, a territorial habit, and their sudden silence is considered a signal for the circulation of YFV [

 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp., have been associated with YF outbreaks in Argentina [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>], Costa Rica [
