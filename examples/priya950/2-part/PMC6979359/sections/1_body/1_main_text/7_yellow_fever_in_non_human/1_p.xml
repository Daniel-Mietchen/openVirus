<p id="Par44">Old World NHP are sensitive to YFV and develop enough viremia to reinfect mosquitoes but rarely they show clinical signs or die. In Africa, the primary YFV amplifier hosts are 
 <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> spp. (with viremia lasting for three to four days) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] and 
 <italic>Colobus</italic> spp. (with viremia detected up to nine days) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Serological studies indicate that 
 <italic>Cercocebus</italic> spp. (mangabeys) and 
 <italic>Papio</italic> spp. (baboons) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>], and possibly 
 <italic>Galago senegalensis</italic> could be infected and contribute to YFV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Serological and clinical findings related to YFV infection are described in many Neotropical NHP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. All Neotropical NHP genera are considered susceptible to YFV infection with differing degrees of sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>].
