 <italic>.</italic> Females of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. are hematophagous and exhibit primatophilic daily activity. They have vertically stratified spatial distribution and are mostly found in the forest canopy (acrodendrophilic behavior) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Female mosquitoes prefer oviposition in phytotelmata, such as tree hollows, bamboo internodes, bromeliads and leaf axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Later on, the immature stages (eggs, larvae, and pupa) develop in those phytotelmata. 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> females seek and bite their hosts mostly in the afternoon or during the warmest hours of the day [
