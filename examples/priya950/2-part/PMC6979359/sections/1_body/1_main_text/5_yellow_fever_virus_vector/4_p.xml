<p id="Par35">Sylvatic YFV vectors are abundant in the treetops, with daytime activity peaking in the hottest hours of the day, corresponding to the resting period of the NHP in the canopy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], favoring the hematophagy in NHP. 
 <italic>H. leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. janthinomys</italic> are primatophilic species, but occasionally they can be found at ground level in areas surrounding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] or distant from the forests, including indoors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], since they can can travel for long distances, as 5.7 km and 11.5 km, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. leucocelaenus</italic> can adapt to human-modified environments, as periurban [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] and urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. YFV-infected specimens of 
 <italic>H. janthynomis</italic> have already been sampled in regions near or contiguous to urban neighborhoods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In that way, these mosquito species could play a significant role in viral maintenance in forest settings and in viral dissemination towards peridomestic and urban environments.
