<p id="Par43">As seen above, a great variety of arboreal NHP is found in different geographical areas where the presence of sylvatic vectors is registered. The urbanization and the expansion of agriculture practices have led to extreme habitat degradation, causing the fragmentation NHP populations in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Although NHP mostly exist in sylvatic environments, some Neotropical NHP adapt and survive in extremely degraded habitats [

 <italic>.</italic> Neotropical NHP are potential hosts for YFV due to their ecological and behavioral patterns and their susceptibility to the infection. A variety of factors could alter or lower the exposure rates of NHP to hematophagous insects. For example, the small body and group sizes of some monkeys lead to lower rates of malaria in Amazonian NHP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Some NHP species exhibiting less mobility, with territorial and quite habits in the tree canopy, as 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp., have higher chances of being bitten and infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. Social and diet behavior patterns could be modified in disturbed habitats, as already shown for the red howler monkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Those behavior changes could, in turn, alter the attractiveness in favor of hematophagous mosquitoes and, consequently, the transmission of viruses.
