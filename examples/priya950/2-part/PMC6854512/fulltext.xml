The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV mediates viral entry into host cells, and correct processing and modification of GP by host factors is a prerequisite for virus replication. Here, using an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy, 591 host proteins were identified as interactors of LASV GP. Gene ontology analysis was performed to functionally annotate these proteins, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highly enriched. Functional studies conducted by using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts showed that STT3A and STT3B, the two catalytically active isoforms of the OST complex, are essential for the propagation of the recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV glycoprotein precursor, mainly via affecting virus infectivity. Knockout of <italic>STT3B</italic>, but not <italic>STT3A</italic>, caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP, indicating a preferential requirement of LASV for the STT3B-OST isoform. Furthermore, double knockout of magnesium transporter 1 (<italic>MAGT1</italic>) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (<italic>TUSC3</italic>), two specific subunits of STT3B-OST, also caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and affected virus propagation. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 is essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, can effectively reduce virus infectivity without affecting cell viability. The STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation of GP is conserved among other arenaviruses, including both the Old World and New World groups.

Nosocomial epidemics of Lassa fever are associated with higher case fatality rates up to 36 to 65% (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A seasonal outbreak of Lassa fever occurred in Nigeria in 2018 and led to more than 100 deaths, reemphasizing the threat of LASV on public health (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). There is no U.S Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for LASV, and the only treatment option for Lassa fever is the nucleoside analog drug ribavirin, which is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Due to its high morbidity and mortality rates, LASV is classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) agent (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and a category A priority pathogen (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>LASV belongs to the <italic>Mammarenavirus</italic> genus (member of the <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> family) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), a genus of enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses that can be divided into two groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The OW family of arenaviruses includes LASV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a neglected human pathogen distributed worldwide (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), while the NW family of arenaviruses includes Jun&#x000ed;n virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV), the causative agents of Argentine hemorrhagic fever and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV forms spikes on the surface of the virion and is the sole antigen responsible for eliciting a virus-neutralizing antibody response (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The LASV GP is synthesized as a single glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and is subsequently cleaved into three segments by host signal peptidase (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and subtilisin-kexin-isozyme-1/site 1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), producing a stable signal peptide (SSP), a receptor binding subunit (GP1), and a class I membrane fusion subunit (GP2), which together form a trimer of GP heterotrimers on the virion surface through noncovalent interactions (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). GPs of NW arenaviruses, such as JUNV and MACV, bind to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to facilitate entry (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), while OW arenaviruses use alpha-dystroglycan (&#x003b1;-DG) or neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as their cell surface receptors (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Upon delivery to the late endosome, the GP of LASV undergoes an acidic pH-induced receptor switch to the intracellular receptor LAMP1, thereby facilitating membrane fusion to release the viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Arenavirus GPs also play an important role in the budding of virus progeny by interacting with Z protein, which provides the driving force of budding (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). By recruiting the matrix protein Z and the assembled nucleocapsid to virus budding sites, GP determines the apical release of nascent LASV from polarized epithelial cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Asparagine-linked (N-)glycosylation plays an important role in the folding, stabilization, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport of GPs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and all of these processes are essential for maintaining normal viral GP functions. For example, glycosylation of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) directs the proper folding and trafficking of nascent polypeptides (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and thus modulates the viral binding ability and regulates viral release (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Loss of glycans in HIV-1 gp120 significantly reduces virus binding to CD4 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). LASV GP possesses 11 potential sites for N-glycan modification, 7 of which are necessary for its proteolytic cleavage (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Despite the lack of cleavage in these latter glycosylation mutants, transport of a single glycosylation site-mutated GPC to the cell surface is not impaired, indicating that a single N-glycosylation site and proteolytic cleavage are not necessary for its intracellular trafficking (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). N-glycans in LASV GP also promote immune evasion in humans by shielding the virus from host neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This finding is in line with historical reports that passive serum therapy provided to cynomolgus monkeys or patients generated only limited protection efficacy (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Novel therapeutic strategies to control arenavirus-induced diseases require a thorough understanding of virus-host interactions. However, little is known about the comprehensive host interactome of LASV GP. In this study, an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy was used to identify host proteins interacting with LASV GP, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highlighted. The OST complex is responsible for the N-glycosylation process in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where it catalytically transfers a preassembled oligosaccharide to the amide group of an asparagine residue within the consensus N-X-T/S motif of a nascent polypeptide (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Multiple subunits of the mammalian OST complex have been reported, including defender against cell death 1 (DAD1), OST48, OST4, OSTC, ribophorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), TUSC3, MAGT1, STT3A, and STT3B (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The STT3 protein is the central enzyme of the OST complex, and two isoforms exist in mammalian cells: STT3A and STT3B (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B with overlapping functions. Either MAGT1 or TUSC3 is incorporated into STT3B complexes and endows STT3B with the capability to posttranslationally glycosylate cysteine-proximal acceptor sites via their oxidoreductase activity (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Functional studies showed that STT3A and STT3B are essential for the propagation of a recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV GPC. Although most glycoproteins in host cells are efficiently modified by STT3A in a cotranslational manner (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), our study indicated that LASV GP was preferentially modified by the STT3B-OST isoform. Our study provides new insights into the host interactome of LASV GP and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Identification of host proteins interacting with LASV GP.</title><p>To identify the host proteins interacting with LASV GP, we adopted a strategy to tag its C terminus with a Twin-Strep-tag, which is advantageous for the one-step purification of protein complexes from cell lysates (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). No significant changes of the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or cell surface transport were observed between the tagged and untagged LASV GPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Then, plasmids encoding the tagged LASV GP or vector plasmid as a control were transfected into HEK293T cells. At 48&#x02009;h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and LASV GP-associated host proteins were purified from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT and subjected to Western blot analysis using a GP1-specific serum or anti-Strep antibody. Cleaved GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates, together with a noncleaved form of GPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The retention of cleaved GP1 with purified GP2 suggests that viral GP remained in the prefusion conformation during the purification process since GP1 and GP2 interact with each other through unstable noncovalent interactions, and irreversible conformation changes during the membrane fusion process lead to their disassociation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Then, eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Three independent replicate experiments were performed, and a total of 1,104 host proteins were identified from at least one independent replicate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors of GP: (i) for proteins identified in only the GP group but not the control group, at least two peptides should be identified, or (ii) for proteins identified in both the GP and control groups, the GP versus control group peptide count ratios should be &#x0003e;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). With this standard, 591 proteins were considered as valid interactors of LASV GPs. &#x003b1;-DG, the host receptor of OW arenaviruses (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), was detected in the GP groups with high abundance but not in the control groups (Table S1).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Identification of host proteins interacting with LASV GP.

HEK293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGs plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or a pCAGGs plasmid expressing only the Twin-Strep-tag as a control. At 48&#x02009;h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed by using a mild nonionic detergent buffer at 4&#x000b0;C. LASV GP-associated host interactors were pulled down from cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT. Purified proteins were digested into peptides by trypsin and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to test whether the Twin-Strep-tag would affect the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and cell surface transport of LASV GP.

Twin-Strep-tagged LASV GP with its associated proteins was purified from cell lysates. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged with a Twin-Strep-tag was also set as the control bait. Endogenous STT3A and STT3B or exogenously expressed RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, and DDOST/OST48 were detected in the GP fraction but not in the GFP-purified fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). Most of the OST subunits (excluding DDOST) migrated into diffused bands and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates, probably because of stable associations with other subunits of the OST complex. We also compared our data set to a previous interactome of LCMV GP and found that 127 proteins were common (Table S1) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Interestingly, subunits of the OST complex were also identified in the interactome of LCMV GP, including STT3B, DDOST, RPN1, RPN2, and MAGT1. These results suggested a high confidence level of our interactome results and confirmed that LASV GP interacted specifically with the host OST complex.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 3</label><caption><p>Confirmation of the interactions between LASV GP and subunits of the OST complex by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses.

MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of the STT3B-OST complex. Despite their replaceable functions, MAGT1 mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in human tissues, whereas the expression of TUSC3 is relatively more restricted (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). MAGT1 was found to weakly interact with LASV GP in our MS data set, while TUSC3 was not identified (Table S1). This result could be explained by previous reports demonstrating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 easily dissociated from the canine OST during the purification process (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). To confirm that MAGT1 and TUSC3 were host interactors of LASV GP, a pCAGGs plasmid encoding 6&#x000d7;His-tagged MAGT1 or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected with LASV GP into HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses revealed that viral GP but not GFP was able to pull down exogenously expressed MAGT1 and TUSC3, indicating that these proteins were also host interactors of LASV GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">H</xref>).</p><p>We then sought to explore the roles of MAGT1 and TUSC3 in virus propagation.

They facilitate viral entry via binding to the virus receptor at the extracellular membrane or promoting membrane fusion in the endosome and participate in virus budding via interacting with the virus matrix protein Z to be incorporated into the envelope of nascent virions. Arenavirus GP is first translated into the ER lumen as a GPC precursor, which is mediated by SSP, and then undergoes a series of folding and modification processes along the secretory pathway to achieve a mature and functional conformation. Among these processes, N-glycosylation in the ER lumen is the most dominant modification of LASV GP. We systematically identified the host interactors of LASV GP using the AP-MS approach. This methodology enables us to gain detailed insights into the host machinery involved in stages of LASV GP synthesis, processing, and transport through the secretory pathway. Proteomic analysis identified multiple proteins of the OST complex as interactors of LASV GP. This was consistent with a previous interactome of LCMV GP (Table S1), although their roles were not examined (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The congruence between the interactomes of LASV and LCMV GPs highlights the reliability of these observations and prompted us to investigate the conserved roles of the OST complex in arenaviruses.</p><p>Although most viral membrane proteins are glycoproteins, the relationship between viruses and the OST complex has not been investigated in detail, except for flavivirus. A global host interactome analysis and a pooled CRISPR genetic screening revealed that the OST complex interacts with dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS3, and NS4B) (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) and is crucially involved in DENV RNA replication independent of its canonical roles in N-linked glycosylation (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The oxidoreductase activity of STT3B-OST was also reported to be necessary for its propagation (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Our further functional study indicated that the OST complex is a host factor on which the arenaviruses depend, suggesting that the OST complex might broadly participate in host-virus interactions.</p><p>We found that knockout of <italic>STT3B</italic> caused hypoglycosylation of viral GPC, while knockout of <italic>STT3A</italic> did not have such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting a preferential requirement for the STT3B isoform in the glycosylation of LASV GP. This result shows characteristics that differ from those of flavivirus, since DENV NS1 and NS4B were shown to be fully glycosylated in STT3A or STT3B knockout cells (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), and only simultaneous knockdown of STT3A and STT3B causes a major glycosylation defect of NS1 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Different dependencies of STT3A and STT3B for N-glycosylation were also found in VSV-G, influenza HA, and HIV-1 GP160 proteins, indicating the diverse mechanisms of modification utilized by different viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C</xref>). Nevertheless, both STT3A and STT3B were shown to be directly or indirectly required for the formation of infectious rLCMV/LASV GPC viruses but did not significantly influence the number of progeny viruses released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). Virions released from <italic>STT3A</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> and <italic>STT3B</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells showed reduced incorporation of GPs into virion particles and a partly reduced binding ability to normal permissive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, was able to strongly inhibit virus propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>) by affecting virus infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>) without resulting in significant cytotoxicity. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the host OST complex by NGI-1 may provide a useful treatment option to efficiently inhibit virus spread and reduce the fatality rate caused by Lassa fever in the future.</p><p>The relative importance of the STT3B isoform of OST in LASV infection may be related to the distinct enzymatic mechanisms of the two isoforms. In mammalian cells, the OST complex is a hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of a catalytically active subunit with several noncatalytic auxiliary subunits (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The additional components either play a structural role to support the structural stability and enzymatic activity of the OST complex or modulate the N-glycosylation efficiency for certain precursors (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). <italic>STT3A</italic> and <italic>STT3B</italic> arose from the same ancestral <italic>STT3</italic> gene during the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes and share a 59% amino acid sequence identity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Both STT3A and STT3B are widely expressed in human tissues, and the full glycosylation of polypeptides involves the cooperation of the two isoforms. The STT3A-OST isoform is primarily responsible for the cotranslational modification of sequons as nascent polypeptide chains enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) through direct interaction with the Sec61 translocon complex (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Most acceptor sites in host glycoproteins are modified by the cotranslational pathway, and depletion of STT3A by siRNA upregulates the level of the luminal ER chaperone BiP and induces the unfolded protein response in response to the hypoglycosylation of host proteins. Unlike STT3A-OST, the STT3B-OST isoform is less competent for the cotranslational modification and efficiently mediates posttranslational modification of glycosylation sites that are skipped by STT3A after nascent polypeptides enter the ER lumen (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Here, no significant changes in GP molecular weight were observed in <italic>STT3A</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, implying that the glycosylation acceptor sites for STT3A may also be targeted by STT3B, whereas in <italic>STT3B</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, the glycosylation acceptor site/sites for STT3B may not be fully rescued by STT3A; thus, the reduction in GP molecular weight was observed, and the GP maturation process and virion infectivity were impaired significantly. These results suggested the existence of glycosylation sites in viral GPC that are prone to being skipped by STT3A-OST and designated to be posttranslationally modified by STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B-OST that have overlapping functions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of either <italic>MAGTI</italic> or <italic>TUSC3</italic> did not reduce the glycosylation of LASV GP, whereas knockout of both led to the same hypoglycosylation pattern as that observed in <italic>STT3B</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, indicating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 exhibit compensatory functions for the glycosylation of LASV GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 was essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This finding provided novel details regarding the virus glycosylation process in the ER lumen.</p><p>STT3A and STT3B show relatively differential expression profiles in human tissues; STT3A expression was reported to be very low in the brain, lung, and kidney and high in the placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, whereas STT3B showed more uniform levels of expression (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Although STT3A and STT3B show tissue-specific expression, this phenomenon likely does not link the preferential requirement for the STT3B-OST isoform with the tissue tropism of virus infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, since STT3A was also here demonstrated to be a host prerequisite for virus propagation by indirectly influencing the infectivity of progeny viruses.</p><p>The OST complex utilizes dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (OS-PP-Dol) as donor substrates for the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues in the N-X-T/S consensus sites of newly synthesized proteins (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The fully assembled OS-PP-Dol is Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol, which is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the RER by glycosyltransferases that mediate the transfer of single glycosyl residues onto the dolichol phosphate step by step (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Assembly intermediates of OS-PP-Dol with different lengths (Glc<sub>0&#x02013;2</sub>Man<sub>0&#x02013;9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol) can also serve as the donor substrate for the OST complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). It was reported that STT3A and STT3B assembled into different OST complexes with a distinct discrimination ability to select Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol over its assembly intermediate Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol, which lacks the terminal glucose residue as the oligosaccharide donor substrate for N-glycosylation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The STT3B-OST complex is substantially more active and shows a reduced ability to discriminate different oligosaccharide structures; in contract, the STT3A-OST complex is extremely selective and preferentially glycosylates nascent proteins with the fully assembled Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is interesting to associate this distinct substrate-selective characteristic of STT3A and STT3B with the recently reported glycan heterogeneity of LASV GP. Analysis of the LASV glycome composition by hydrophilic interaction chromatography ultraperformance liquid chromatography revealed that the virus possesses an abundance of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans, which form punctuated clusters to shield the proteinous surface from the humoral immune response (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). It remains unknown whether the site-specific heterogeneity of virion surface glycans has any relevance to the preferential utilization of host OST isoforms by viruses during the glycosylation process. Further studies are needed to deeply elucidate the physiological significance of this host glycosylation strategy utilized by arenaviruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells.</title><p>HEK293T, HEK293, HeLa, A549, Huh7, and BHK-21 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Plasmids.</title><p>The cDNA sequences of GPs of LASV (Josiah strain, GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/HQ688672.1" assigning-authority="genbank">HQ688672.1</ext-link>), LCMV (Armstrong strain, GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY847350.1" assigning-authority="genbank">AY847350.1</ext-link>), MOPV (AN20410 strain, GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JX985097.1" assigning-authority="genbank">JX985097.1</ext-link>), LUJV (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ952384.1" assigning-authority="genbank">FJ952384.1</ext-link>), DNAV (isolate 0710-2678, GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU136038.1" assigning-authority="genbank">EU136038.1</ext-link>), JUNV (XJ13 strain, GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY358023.2" assigning-authority="genbank">AY358023.2</ext-link>), MACV (Carvallo strain, GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM198592.1" assigning-authority="genbank">KM198592.1</ext-link>), and VSV (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DQ408670.1" assigning-authority="genbank">DQ408670.1</ext-link>) were obtained from NCBI and chemically synthesized by Sangon Biotech (China).
