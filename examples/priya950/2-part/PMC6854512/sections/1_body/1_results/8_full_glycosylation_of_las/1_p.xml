<p>MAGT1 and TUSC3 are thioredoxin homologs, and a luminally oriented CXXC active-site motif is responsible for their oxidoreductase activity (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). A protein tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds is a negative regulatory factor for their posttranslational glycosylation (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay the folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs and thereby facilitate access to STT3B (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Mutation of the active site cysteines of MAGT1 or TUSC3 resulted in the hypoglycosylation of a subset of STT3B-dependent substrates (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). To test whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires the oxidoreductase activity of MAGT1 and TUSC3, plasmids encoding MAGT1/TUSC3 or MAGT1/TUSC3 with SXXC, CXXS, or SXXS mutations were transfected into

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, the expression of WT MAGT1 or WT TUSC3 was able to restore the glycosylation of LASV GPC (lanes 1, 5, and 6), whereas MAGT1 and TUSC3 with mutations of any cysteine in their CXXC site motifs failed to restore glycosylation and virus replication (lanes 2, 3, and 4). Our results revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3 play roles in the full glycosylation of LASV GP.
