<p>We also tested the effect of knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> on the glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza A virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C</xref>, influenza HA was only affected by knockout of 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>, whereas HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (GP160) was affected by knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>. No significant changes of molecular weight were observed in VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G).
