<p>To identify the host proteins interacting with LASV GP, we adopted a strategy to tag its C terminus with a Twin-Strep-tag, which is advantageous for the one-step purification of protein complexes from cell lysates (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). No significant changes of the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or cell surface transport were observed between the tagged and untagged LASV GPs (

At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and LASV GP-associated host proteins were purified from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT and subjected to Western blot analysis using a GP1-specific serum or anti-Strep antibody. Cleaved GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates, together with a noncleaved form of GPC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The retention of cleaved GP1 with purified GP2 suggests that viral GP remained in the prefusion conformation during the purification process since GP1 and GP2 interact with each other through unstable noncovalent interactions, and irreversible conformation changes during the membrane fusion process lead to their disassociation (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Then, eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Three independent replicate experiments were performed, and a total of 1,104 host proteins were identified from at least one independent replicate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors of GP: (i) for proteins identified in only the GP group but not the control group, at least two peptides should be identified, or (ii) for proteins identified in both the GP and control groups, the GP versus control group peptide count ratios should be &gt;3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). With this standard, 591 proteins were considered as valid interactors of LASV GPs. α-DG, the host receptor of OW arenaviruses (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), was detected in the GP groups with high abundance but not in the control groups (Table S1).
