<p>To further explore the biological significance of GP-associated interactors, statistical overrepresentation tests for GO molecular functions and biological processes were also performed. Redundant GO terms were first eliminated by REVIGO based on semantic similarity (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and further summarized manually. Functional subsets of proteins with ranked fold enrichment values and â€“log10(
 <italic>P</italic> values) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>. The top overrepresented functional subsets from GO molecular function and biological process analyses with high fold enrichment values (&gt;10) are highlighted in the scatterplot graph (central region) and listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Proteins responsible for host OST activity were highly overrepresented. STT3A and STT3B, the two isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the mammalian OST complex, together with their auxiliary subunits were identified as GP interactors here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition, proteins involved in the protein folding process and proteasome activity were also significantly enriched in the data set, hinting at possible roles of these proteins in arenavirus GP physiology. Interestingly, multiple proteins responsible for nuclear transport or Ran GTPase binding were also enriched in the data set, consistent with the results of a proteomic survey of JUNV virions (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), while their roles in virus replication remain unknown.
