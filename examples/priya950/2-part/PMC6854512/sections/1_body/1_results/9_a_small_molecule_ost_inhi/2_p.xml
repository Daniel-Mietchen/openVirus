<p>To further evaluate the effect of NGI-1 on virus propagation, supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>, NGI-1 treatment significantly reduced the viral titers, while the viral RNA copy numbers were only mildly reduced, indicating that NGI-1 mainly impaired virus infectivity but not the number of released progeny viruses. The effect of NGI-1 on LASV GP and virus propagation was also tested in several other human cell lines, including A549, HeLa, Huh7, and HEK293 cells, and both hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and reduced viral titer were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">D</xref>), which is consistent with the findings in HEK293T cells.
