<p>NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, was reported to directly target and block the function of the OST catalytic subunits STT3A and STT3B. Unlike tunicamycin, NGI-1 does not completely inhibit all the N-glycosylation sites, and this probably determines the reduced cellular toxicity of NGI-1, making it an excellent approach to modulate N-glycosylation in mammalian cells (
