<p>The results [resented above revealed that LASV GP was a preferred substrate of STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of the STT3B-OST complex. Despite their replaceable functions, MAGT1 mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in human tissues, whereas the expression of TUSC3 is relatively more restricted (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). MAGT1 was found to weakly interact with LASV GP in our MS data set, while TUSC3 was not identified (Table S1). This result could be explained by previous reports demonstrating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 easily dissociated from the canine OST during the purification process (

To confirm that MAGT1 and TUSC3 were host interactors of LASV GP, a pCAGGs plasmid encoding 6Ã—His-tagged MAGT1 or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected with LASV GP into HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses revealed that viral GP but not GFP was able to pull down exogenously expressed MAGT1 and TUSC3, indicating that these proteins were also host interactors of LASV GP (
