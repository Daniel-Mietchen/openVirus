<p>Since both STT3A and STT3B play roles in virus propagation, we sought to investigate the glycosylation profile of viral GP in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blotting. In 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, the viral GP displayed the same glycosylation pattern as that in WT cells, but the proteolytic cleavage process was hindered in the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi). Even so, the viral GP in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> did not significantly affect the glycosylation of LASV GP, which might be explained by the functionally compensatory effect executed by the STT3B isoform of OST in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells. However, we observed an obviously hypoglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells. To exclude the possibility that the reduced molecular weight of viral GPC was caused by other modifications, such as phosphorylation, viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F to remove the N-glycans. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, the migration of the unglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC was identical among these cells, suggesting that the differential migration of the glycosylated form of GPC in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells was due to the distinct glycosylation status of GPC. Taken together, these data showed that LASV GP was a preferential substrate of STT3B-OST and that the full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the STT3B-OST isoform. Although STT3A was not an essential prerequisite for the glycosylation of LASV GP, loss of STT3A delayed its proteolytic cleavage.
