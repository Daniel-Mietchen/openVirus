<p>To explore whether STT3A and STT3B affect viral replication, we rescued a recombinant arenavirus, rLCMV/LASV GPC, in which LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP, while the backbone of LCMV was not altered. This recombinant virus can be manipulated in BSL-2 conditions and reportedly exhibits high fitness with intact characteristics of LASV GP (

 <sup>–</sup> cells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC and harvested at the indicated time points. The intracellular viral level was determined based on the amount of viral S genomic RNA(+), as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and the viral titer in the supernatant was determined by an immunological plaque assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, the intracellular level of the viral S genome was only slightly reduced in
