<p>Since the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of OST subunits in HEK293 cells is reported to be relatively ineffective (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), we generated 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> knockout cells (
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells) by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to explore the roles of STT3A and STT3B in arenavirus propagation. Plasmids encoding single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the exons of the 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> genes were transfected into HEK293T cells to direct genome editing. Knockouts of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> were confirmed by sequencing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites) and Western blot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). To further confirm the loss of STT3A and STT3B catalytic activity, the N-glycosylation of two plasmids expressing progranulin (pGRN) or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which were reported to be specific N-glycosylation substrates of STT3A or STT3B, respectively, was examined (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, N-glycosylation of pGRN was inhibited in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells but not in wild-type (WT) cells or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, whereas knockout of 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> inhibited the N-glycosylation of only SHBG.
