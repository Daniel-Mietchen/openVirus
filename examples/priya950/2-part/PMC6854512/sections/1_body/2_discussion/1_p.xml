<p>Arenavirus GPs play critical roles in the viral life cycles. They facilitate viral entry via binding to the virus receptor at the extracellular membrane or promoting membrane fusion in the endosome and participate in virus budding via interacting with the virus matrix protein Z to be incorporated into the envelope of nascent virions. Arenavirus GP is first translated into the ER lumen as a GPC precursor, which is mediated by SSP, and then undergoes a series of folding and modification processes along the secretory pathway to achieve a mature and functional conformation. Among these processes, N-glycosylation in the ER lumen is the most dominant modification of LASV GP. We systematically identified the host interactors of LASV GP using the AP-MS approach. This methodology enables us to gain detailed insights into the host machinery involved in stages of LASV GP synthesis, processing, and transport through the secretory pathway. Proteomic analysis identified multiple proteins of the OST complex as interactors of LASV GP. This was consistent with a previous interactome of LCMV GP (Table S1), although their roles were not examined (
