<p>The relative importance of the STT3B isoform of OST in LASV infection may be related to the distinct enzymatic mechanisms of the two isoforms. In mammalian cells, the OST complex is a hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of a catalytically active subunit with several noncatalytic auxiliary subunits (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The additional components either play a structural role to support the structural stability and enzymatic activity of the OST complex or modulate the N-glycosylation efficiency for certain precursors (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> arose from the same ancestral 
 <italic>STT3</italic> gene during the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes and share a 59% amino acid sequence identity (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Both STT3A and STT3B are widely expressed in human tissues, and the full glycosylation of polypeptides involves the cooperation of the two isoforms. The STT3A-OST isoform is primarily responsible for the cotranslational modification of sequons as nascent polypeptide chains enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) through direct interaction with the Sec61 translocon complex (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Most acceptor sites in host glycoproteins are modified by the cotranslational pathway, and depletion of STT3A by siRNA upregulates the level of the luminal ER chaperone BiP and induces the unfolded protein response in response to the hypoglycosylation of host proteins. Unlike STT3A-OST, the STT3B-OST isoform is less competent for the cotranslational modification and efficiently mediates posttranslational modification of glycosylation sites that are skipped by STT3A after nascent polypeptides enter the ER lumen (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Here, no significant changes in GP molecular weight were observed in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, implying that the glycosylation acceptor sites for STT3A may also be targeted by STT3B, whereas in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, the glycosylation acceptor site/sites for STT3B may not be fully rescued by STT3A; thus, the reduction in GP molecular weight was observed, and the GP maturation process and virion infectivity were impaired significantly. These results suggested the existence of glycosylation sites in viral GPC that are prone to being skipped by STT3A-OST and designated to be posttranslationally modified by STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B-OST that have overlapping functions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of either 
 <italic>MAGTI</italic> or 
 <italic>TUSC3</italic> did not reduce the glycosylation of LASV GP, whereas knockout of both led to the same hypoglycosylation pattern as that observed in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, indicating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 exhibit compensatory functions for the glycosylation of LASV GP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 was essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This finding provided novel details regarding the virus glycosylation process in the ER lumen.
