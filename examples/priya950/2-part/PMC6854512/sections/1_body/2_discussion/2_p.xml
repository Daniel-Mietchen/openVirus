<p>Although most viral membrane proteins are glycoproteins, the relationship between viruses and the OST complex has not been investigated in detail, except for flavivirus. A global host interactome analysis and a pooled CRISPR genetic screening revealed that the OST complex interacts with dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS3, and NS4B) (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) and is crucially involved in DENV RNA replication independent of its canonical roles in N-linked glycosylation (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The oxidoreductase activity of STT3B-OST was also reported to be necessary for its propagation (
