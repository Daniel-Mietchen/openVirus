<p>STT3A and STT3B show relatively differential expression profiles in human tissues; STT3A expression was reported to be very low in the brain, lung, and kidney and high in the placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, whereas STT3B showed more uniform levels of expression (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Although STT3A and STT3B show tissue-specific expression, this phenomenon likely does not link the preferential requirement for the STT3B-OST isoform with the tissue tropism of virus infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, since STT3A was also here demonstrated to be a host prerequisite for virus propagation by indirectly influencing the infectivity of progeny viruses.
