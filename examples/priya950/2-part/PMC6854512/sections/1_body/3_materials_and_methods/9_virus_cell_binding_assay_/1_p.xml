<p>BHK-21 cells were preseeded in 12-well plates in advance and incubated overnight to reach 90 to 100% confluence. Prechilled cells were infected with RNA-normalized viruses derived from

 <sup>–</sup>, and WT cells and incubated at 4°C for 60 min. After incubation, the cells were washed extensively with prechilled PBS to remove unbound viral particles. The cellular total RNA was then extracted and purified using a total RNA kit (Omega). Cell-attached viral S genomes were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA.
