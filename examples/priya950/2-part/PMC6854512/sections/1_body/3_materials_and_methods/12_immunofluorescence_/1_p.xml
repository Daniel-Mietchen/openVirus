<p>Confocal microscopy was used to visualize the cell surface transport of tagged or untagged LASV GP in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were seeded in 15-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (801002; NEST Biotechnology) and transfected the next day with pCAGGs plasmids encoding Twin-Strep-tagged or untagged LASV GP using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). At 36 h posttransfection, living cells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of GP2-specific serum in PBS supplemented with 3% FBS at 4°C for 30 min. After three washes in PBS supplemented with 3% FBS, the cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Dylight 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (KPL, catalog no. 072-03-18-06) and washed three times with PBS. After live-cell staining, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and then subjected to imaging using a Nikon A1 MP multiphoton confocal microscope. Images were captured under a 60× lens objective.</p>
