The cDNA sequences of viral GPs and GFP were cloned into pCAGGs plasmids with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag (WSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSAWSHPQFEK). pLX304 plasmids encoding V5-tagged RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, DDOST, and pGRN were obtained from a purchased public genome-scale lentiviral expression library of human ORFs (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). pcDNA3.1(–) plasmids encoding 6×His-tagged MAGT1, Flag-tagged TUSC3, and Strep-tagged SHBG were constructed manually by PCR and an In-Fusion HD cloning kit (TaKaRa). Cysteine mutations of MAGT1 and TUSC3 were generated by PCR-directed site mutagenesis. sgRNA sequences specific to
