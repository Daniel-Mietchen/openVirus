<p>Cells were collected and lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates were denatured by adding loading buffer (containing β-mercaptoethanol) followed by heating for 10 min at 100°C. The proteins were then separated on SDS–10% PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by a Trans-Blot Turbo rapid transfer system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membranes were blocked in 5% defatted milk (dissolved in Tris-buffered saline [TBS]) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed extensively in wash buffer (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) three times (for 5 min each time) with agitation and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Proteintech, China) for 1 h at room temperature according to the species source of the primary antibody. The membranes were washed three times in wash buffer and imaged using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate solution (Millipore, Germany) to visualize the protein bands. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was utilized as a loading control by stripping the membranes with stripping buffer (Beyotime, China) and reprobing with an anti-GAPDH antibody according to the same procedures.</p>
