<p>Viral supernatants derived from different cells were first cleared by two rounds of centrifugation at 1,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> and 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min to remove cell debris. Cleared supernatants were then ultracentrifuged at 20,000 rpm in a SW32 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 2.5 h at 4°C and layered onto a 20% sucrose cushion. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were gently resuspended in PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis.
