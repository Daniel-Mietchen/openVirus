<p>The ID list of host interactors was submitted to PANTHER (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.pantherdb.org/</ext-link>). Statistical overrepresentation tests for cellular component, molecular function, and biological process annotations were performed by using a Fisher exact test with an FDR correction. Total genes in the 
 <italic>Home sapiens</italic> database were selected as a reference list. The threshold value of the FDR was set to 0.05. Redundant GO terms were then first eliminated by REVIGO (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://revigo.irb.hr/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://revigo.irb.hr/</ext-link>) based on semantic similarity (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and further summarized manually. The allowed similarity in REVIGO was set to “Medium (0.7).” A semantic similarity measure of “SimRel” was selected. A subset of the terms with ranked fold enrichment values and the number of mapped proteins was visualized in a scatterplot graph. The top representative functional subsets with highest fold enrichment values are highlighted in the central region and listed in tables. Proteins clustered into functional modules based on highly enriched GO terms were visualized by Cytoscape 3.6.0. Note that not all the interactors were exhibited, and one protein may have been classified into more than one subset.
