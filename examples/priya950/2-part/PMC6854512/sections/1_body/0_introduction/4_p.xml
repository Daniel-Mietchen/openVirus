<p>Asparagine-linked (N-)glycosylation plays an important role in the folding, stabilization, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport of GPs (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and all of these processes are essential for maintaining normal viral GP functions. For example, glycosylation of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) directs the proper folding and trafficking of nascent polypeptides (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and thus modulates the viral binding ability and regulates viral release (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Loss of glycans in HIV-1 gp120 significantly reduces virus binding to CD4 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). LASV GP possesses 11 potential sites for N-glycan modification, 7 of which are necessary for its proteolytic cleavage (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Despite the lack of cleavage in these latter glycosylation mutants, transport of a single glycosylation site-mutated GPC to the cell surface is not impaired, indicating that a single N-glycosylation site and proteolytic cleavage are not necessary for its intracellular trafficking (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). N-glycans in LASV GP also promote immune evasion in humans by shielding the virus from host neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This finding is in line with historical reports that passive serum therapy provided to cynomolgus monkeys or patients generated only limited protection efficacy (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).
