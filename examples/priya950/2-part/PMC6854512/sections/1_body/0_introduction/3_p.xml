<p>The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV forms spikes on the surface of the virion and is the sole antigen responsible for eliciting a virus-neutralizing antibody response (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The LASV GP is synthesized as a single glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and is subsequently cleaved into three segments by host signal peptidase (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and subtilisin-kexin-isozyme-1/site 1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), producing a stable signal peptide (SSP), a receptor binding subunit (GP1), and a class I membrane fusion subunit (GP2), which together form a trimer of GP heterotrimers on the virion surface through noncovalent interactions (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), while OW arenaviruses use alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) or neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as their cell surface receptors (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Upon delivery to the late endosome, the GP of LASV undergoes an acidic pH-induced receptor switch to the intracellular receptor LAMP1, thereby facilitating membrane fusion to release the viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Arenavirus GPs also play an important role in the budding of virus progeny by interacting with Z protein, which provides the driving force of budding (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). By recruiting the matrix protein Z and the assembled nucleocapsid to virus budding sites, GP determines the apical release of nascent LASV from polarized epithelial cells (
