  <p>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated isoform-specific knockouts of the OST complex impaired the propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. (A) Genotypes of the two selected 
   <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
   <italic>STT3B</italic> knockout cells, as determined by Sanger sequencing of genomic PCR fragments. WT cells were also sequenced as a reference. The PAM sequence and sgRNA sequence targeting gene exons are shown in yellow boxes. Putative cleavage sites of Cas9 are also indicated by arrows. Mutations of knockout cells are listed at the bottom. Only cells displaying frameshift mutations were chosen as candidate knockout cell lines. Although HEK293T cells have three copies of the 
   <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
   <italic>STT3B</italic> genes, the observed number of alleles for 
   <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
   <italic>STT3B</italic> could be less than three. (B) Confirmation of the knockout cell lines by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to STT3A and STT3B. Lysates of WT cells were also loaded as a reference. (C) The glycosylation patterns of V5-tagged pGRN and Strep-tagged SHBG in 
   <italic>STT3A</italic>
   <sup>–</sup>, 
   <italic>STT3B</italic>
   <sup>–</sup>, and WT cells were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the V5 and Strep tags, respectively. Different glycoforms are indicated by arrows. GAPDH was also detected as a control for each lane. (D) Growth kinetics of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus in 
   <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
   <italic>STT3B</italic> knockout cells and WT cells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at the indicated time points. Cellular virus levels were determined by the level of viral S (+) genome RNA normalized to the cellular GAPDH mRNA levels, which were measured by qRT-PCR. The supernatant virus levels were determined by the immunological plaque assay.
