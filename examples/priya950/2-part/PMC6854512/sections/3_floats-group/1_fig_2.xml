  <p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of LASV GP-interacting proteins highlighted the OST complex. (A) Cellular component distribution of LASV GP interactors as determined in PANTHER. A total of 591 proteins were clustered into 22 groups, demonstrating the extensive cellular distribution of LASV GP interactors. The raw 
   <italic>P</italic> values determined by the Fisher exact test are presented beside the column. (B) GO overrepresentation analysis based on molecular function and biological process annotations. Subsets of generated terms with ranked fold-enrichment values and â€“log
   <sub>10</sub>(
   <italic>P</italic> values) are visualized in the scatterplot graph. The bubble sizes are related to the number of mapped proteins. Redundant GO terms were first eliminated by REVIGO based on semantic similarity and further summarized manually. The top representative functional subsets with high fold enrichment values (&gt;10) are highlighted in the scatterplot graph (central region) and listed in 
   <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
   <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The test was performed using the Fisher exact test with an FDR multiple test correction of &lt;0.05. (C) Representative overview of the LASV GP interactome classified based on both biological processes and molecular functions, which were visualized by Cytoscape. Subunits of the OST complex are highlighted by a red square. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were validated by the coimmunoprecipitation assay shown below and are also presented here. Note that not all the interactors are presented here. In addition, note that one protein may be classified into more than one subset.
