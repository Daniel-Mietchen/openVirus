  <p>Knockout of 
   <italic>STT3B</italic> caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and reduced its expression level. (A) Expression and glycosylation profiles of LASV GP in 
   <italic>STT3A</italic>
   <sup>–</sup>, 
   <italic>STT3B</italic>
   <sup>–</sup> cells and WT cells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected by a specific antiserum, serving as an internal control to reflect the replication level of the virus. The cleavage rates of tagged and untagged GP2 are shown above as determined by densitometric quantification. (B) The reduced molecular weight of viral GP in 
   <italic>STT3B</italic>
   <sup>–</sup> cells was due to a deficiency in glycans. Viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F and Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected. (C) Quantitation of viral glycoprotein incorporated into viral particles. Viral particles (supernatant) derived from different cell lines at 48 hpi were collected by ultracentrifugation and screened for viral proteins (GP1, GP2, and NP) by Western blotting. (D) The levels of incorporated proteins were determined by the band intensities, and the ratios of viral GP2 versus viral NP were calculated as an indicator of the level of viral glycoproteins incorporated into a single viral particle. SDs are not shown because viral particles were derived from one individual preparation. In panels A to C, GAPDH was also detected as a loading control for each lane. (E) The cell binding ability of RNA-normalized viruses derived from different cell lines to normal BHK-21 cells was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to the GAPDH mRNA level. The data displayed here represent the means ± the SD of three independent experiments, and each independent experiment had two replicates.
