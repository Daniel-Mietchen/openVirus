  <p>Full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the CXXC active site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3. Plasmids encoding MAGT1 and TUSC3, or MAGT1 and TUSC3 with SXXC or CXXS or SXXS mutations, were transfected into

   <sup>–</sup>
   <italic>TUSC3</italic>
   <sup>–</sup> cells to restore the glycosylation of LASV GP. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01. Cells and supernatants were harvested at 36 hpi. The glycosylation patterns of viral GP were analyzed by Western blotting with serum specific to viral GP2. The expression of MAGT1 and TUSC3 was confirmed by specific antibodies. GAPDH was detected as a loading control for each lane. Restoration of virus glycosylation is indicated by red triangles. Supernatant viral titers derived from different cell lines were determined by the immunological plaque assay. The data presented here represent the means ± the SD of three independent experiments, and each independent experiment had two replicates.
