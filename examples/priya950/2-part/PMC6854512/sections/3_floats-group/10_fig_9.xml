   <sup>–</sup>, and WT (HEK293T) cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01. NGI-1 at the indicated concentrations was added to cells after virus entry. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added as a control. Cells and supernatants were harvested at 36 hpi. The glycosylation patterns of viral glycoprotein were determined by Western blotting with GP2-specific serum. GAPDH was also detected as a loading control for each lane. (B) Supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. Viral titers less than 10 PFU/ml were considered undetected and are marked with a red number sign (“#”). (C) A549, HeLa, Huh7, and HEK293 cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01. NGI-1 at the indicated concentrations were added to cells after virus entry. DMSO was added as a control. Cells and supernatants were harvested at 36 hpi. The glycosylation patterns of viral glycoprotein were determined by Western blotting with GP2-specific serum. GAPDH was also detected as a loading control for each lane. (D) Supernatant viral titers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. Viral titers of &lt;10 PFU/ml were considered undetected and are marked with a red number sign (“#”).
