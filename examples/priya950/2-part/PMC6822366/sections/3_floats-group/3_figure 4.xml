   <bold>ML tree of the H3N8 CIV concatenated full genome.</bold> From the dataset of the 44 full viral genome sequences, after splicing for segments M and NS, the segments were concatenated (HA, M1, NA, NP, NS1, PA, PB1, and PB2) for each virus, followed by the generation of a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree. The tree was constructed using the HKY + gamma nucleotide substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replications. Insert: Regression analysis of branch-length to year of virus isolation. Colour rectangles indicate different clades: clade I (yellow), clade II (pink), clade III (brown), clade IV (blue), clade V (green), clade VI (purple).
