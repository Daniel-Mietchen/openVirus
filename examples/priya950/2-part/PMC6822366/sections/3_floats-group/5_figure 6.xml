   <bold>Evolutionary rates of canine, equine, and human IAVs.</bold> Evolutionary rates of each segment of H3N8 CIV, H3N8 EIV, H3N2 CIV, and H3N2hIAV. The evolutionary rates of each segment were simulated using the BEAST (V1.8.4) program with a GTR plus gamma nucleotide substitution mode, relaxed molecular clock, and a prior coalescent Bayesian skyline tree with 10
   <sup>8</sup> generations.
