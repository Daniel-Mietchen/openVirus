   <bold>The Bayesian Skyline plot (BSP) of H3N8 CIV in each segment.</bold> BSPs were simulated using the BEAST (V1.8.4) program, based on all eight segments of 44 strains, with a GTR plus gamma nucleotide substitution mode and relaxed molecular clock. The prior tree set as the coalescent: Bayesian skyline with 10
   <sup>8</sup> generations. The blue vertical bar indicates the period of divergence of major H3N8 lineages in canine species.
