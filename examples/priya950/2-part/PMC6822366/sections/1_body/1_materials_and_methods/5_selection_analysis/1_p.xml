 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, D, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) were used as the input reference trees in DATAMONKEY [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which was used to estimate selection pressures. The SLAC (Single Likelihood Ancestry Counting), FEL (Fixed Impact Probability), MEME (Evolutionary Mixed Effects Model) and FUBAR (Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian Approximation) methods were used to identify codons under positive selection. The branch-site REL model was used to determine the selection pressure along the branches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We considered 
 <italic>p</italic> values of SLAC, FEL and MEME less than 0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability &gt; 0.9 as significant, and only sites supported by at least three methods were reported. To reduce the bias due to reassortment, a further refined dataset was produced by removing suspected sequences. The mean ratio of non-synonymous substitution per site (dN/dS) was then calculated using the SLAC method.
