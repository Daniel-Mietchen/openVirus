<p id="Par39">All of the maximum-likelihood (ML) trees were constructed by RAxML (version 8.2.4) using the general time reversible (GTR) model and a gamma distribution (G) to account for the rate heterogeneity among sites, and 1000 bootstrap replications were performed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The divergence time between EIV and CIV was estimated using the Bayesian MCMC method implemented in the BEAST (version 1.8.4) package. The GTR or Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model plus gamma distributed rate heterogeneity were used in the nucleotide substitution model. The lognormal relaxed molecular clock was used as the molecular clock model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and the Bayesian skyline coalescent model was set as the tree prior. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was run for 10
 <sup>8</sup> generations, with trees and posteriors sampled every 10
 <sup>4</sup> steps. Each gene dataset was independently run twice and combined using LogCombiner. After a burn-in of 10%, the final maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was summarized using TreeAnnotator [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and visualized using Figtree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In addition, the Bayesian inference (BI) tree of each gene segment was built using MrBayes with the HKY + G model, 10
 <sup>7</sup> generations and a sampling frequency of 10
 <sup>3</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. After removing the reassortment segment, the time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and evolutionary rates were estimated using the Bayesian MCMC method.
