<p id="Par40">Consensus sequences of different H3N8 CIV clades were aligned, and corresponding mutations (deviations from the consensus) were identified. The mutation position in each clade was confirmed using MESQUITE (a modular, extendible software for evolutionary biology). The number of amino acid changes in each enzootic cluster was counted. The U content of the HA and NA gene segments from multiple influenza A viruses was calculated using BioEdit [
