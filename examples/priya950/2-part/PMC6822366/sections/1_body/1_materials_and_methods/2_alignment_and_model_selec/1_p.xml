<p id="Par38">Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were generated using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], followed by manual editing using MEGA (version 7.0) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution for each sequence dataset was selected using jModelTest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score. TempEst (version 1.5.1) was used to analyse the temporal signal in the refined dataset sequences.
