<p id="Par36">We conducted an exhaustive search for H3N8 CIV complete genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database to generate a working dataset (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A total of 119 HA, 206 M1, 89 NA, 73 NP, 203 NS, 54 PA, 56 PB1, 51 PB2 gene sequences were complied. Likewise, for H3N8 EIV, a total of 349 HA, 212 M1, 331 NA, 170 NP, 233 NS, 153 PA, 158 PB1, and 157 PB2 gene sequences were complied. Eight datasets were created by combining each of the eight gene segments from H3N8 EIV and CIV for subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the eight complete datasets was performed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, followed by a second phylogenetic analysis using a refined subset of gene sequences comprising all H3N8 CIVs and their closely related EIV lineages using RAxML [
