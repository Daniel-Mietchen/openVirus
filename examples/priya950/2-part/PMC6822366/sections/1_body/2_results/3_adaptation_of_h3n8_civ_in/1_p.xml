<p id="Par49">To investigate the molecular changes that occurred in H3N8 CIV after interspecies transmission to the new host species, changes in the amino acid residues for the eight viral proteins, including HA, M1, NA, NP, NS, PA, PB1 and PB2, were analysed. Variations in the amino acid sequences are tabulated in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Regarding the HA gene of CIV and EIV (the positioning or numbering of amino acid residues in the HA gene is based on the starting codon for H3 HA), as previously described by Wen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], there was a W222L substitution at the receptor-binding site in all CIV HA genes. However, for the antigenic sites A to D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], there was a N54K substitution at antigenic site C in the CIV HA gene. Several non-synonymous substitutions in the HA gene were noted: V41I for clade V; G479D for clades II, III, and IV; and G479N for clade V. However, it reverted back to 479G for clade VI. Whether this N495G was a true reversion or a result of reassortment remains to be determined. Additional variations for other viral proteins are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The phenotypic significance of these variations, however, remains to be determined.
