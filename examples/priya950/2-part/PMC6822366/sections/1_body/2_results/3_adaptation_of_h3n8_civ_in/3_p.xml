<p id="Par51">Finally, the mean ratio dN/dS was calculated using SLAC, as shown in FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Interestingly, the mean dN/dS values for all gene segments of H3N8 CIV were higher than the corresponding gene segments of H3N8 EIV, indicating that CIV accumulated more non-synonymous substitutions after interspecies transmission to canines. The mean dN/dS values of the major coding regions of CIV ranged from 0.14 to 0.40, except for NS1, for which the dN/dS ratio was 0.6. In particular, there was a significant difference in the M1 gene, as the dN/dS ratio of CIV was almost double that of EIV.
