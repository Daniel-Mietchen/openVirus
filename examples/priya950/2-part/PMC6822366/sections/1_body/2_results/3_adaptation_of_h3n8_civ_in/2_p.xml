<p id="Par50">In addition, we also analysed the Uracil (U) content of each segment in both H3N8 CIV and H3N8 EIV to assess the degree of adaptation to the corresponding host species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. For H3N8 EIV, the time frame spans from 1963 to present, whereas for H3N8 CIV, it spans from 2002 onwards. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, there was an increasing trend in the U content over time (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) for all gene segments in both viruses, with the exception of the HA segment of H3N8 CIV, in which the U content gradually decreased over time. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, the HA gene of this emerging H3N8 CIV, in contrast to other gene segments, appeared to be “adaptation stagnant”. For NA, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2, the increasing rate of the U content for H3N8 CIV was similar to that of H3N8 EIV. Furthermore, for M1 and NS1, the rate of increase in CIV was significantly greater than that in EIV, suggesting that these two genes were under selective pressure to adapt in the new canine host.
