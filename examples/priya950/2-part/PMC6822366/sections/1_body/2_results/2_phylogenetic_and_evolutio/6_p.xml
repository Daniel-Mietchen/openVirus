<p id="Par48">To reconstruct the population dynamics for the emergence of H3N8 CIV, a skyline plot was constructed. As shown in FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the effective population size of H3N8 CIV increased sharply between 2005 and 2006 for almost all the gene segments, with the exception of NS1. In addition, this sharp increase coincided with the time of divergence of H3N8 CIV into multiple clades (I to V).
