<p id="Par47">We also calculated the evolutionary rates for different H3N8 CIV gene segments. Overall, after removing the reassortant sequences of each segment, the eight gene segments evolved at similar rates over the 13 years since the first report in dogs. The evolutionary rate of HA was 1.83 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% HPD 1.3–2.37 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year) and that of NA was 2.09 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% HPD 1.54–2.68 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year). For the other gene segments, the evolutionary rates ranged from 0.85 to 2.58 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitution evolutionary rates/site/year (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In general, the evolutionary rate for each gene segment was higher in H3N8 CIV than in H3N8 EIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, these rates were at the low end of the 95% HPD when compared to that of H3N2 hIAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].
