<p id="Par43">From the dataset of the 44 full viral genome sequences, after splicing for segments M and NS, the segments were concatenated (HA, M1, NA, NP, NS1, PA, PB1, and PB2) for each virus, followed by generation of a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). According to the topology of this concatenated ML tree, H3N8 CIV could be divided into six major clades. Furthermore, a regression analysis using the root-to-tip distance of the ML tree of the full-length genome (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> insert) showed that the R
 <sup>2</sup> was 0.61, indicating a somewhat linear relationship between nucleotide divergence and time, hence satisfying the criterion for Bayesian analysis. The MCC trees for each of the eight gene segments were subsequently generated, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. As shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Clade I consists of early viruses isolated from Florida in 2004. Clade II consists of isolates exclusively from Florida and Pennsylvania from 2006 to 2007. Clade III consists of isolates from Colorado and California from 2006 to 2008. Clade IV consists of isolates from Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2010. Clade V consists of strains circulating in Eastern States between 2010 and 2016. Clade VI consists of viruses from New York in 2006.
