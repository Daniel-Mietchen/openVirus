<p id="Par44">A Bayesian MCMC method was then utilized to estimate the evolutionary rate for each gene segment (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Despite the small sample size, the MCC trees of each gene segment exhibited similar topology and maintain five stable clades for M1, NP, PA, PB1, and PB2. However, an additional clade VI exists for HA, NA, and NS. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, intrasubtypic reassortment was detected among these six clades. For example, for A/canine/Florida/61156-5/2006 and A/Florida/89911-2/2006, while the M1 gene segment clusters within clade III, their other gene segments cluster within clade II; for A/Colorado/8880/2006, the PA gene segment clusters in clade II, while its other segments cluster within clade III; and for A/Colorado/30604/2006, the PB1 gene segment clusters in clade III, whereas the other gene segments cluster in clade VI. The topology of each BI tree of the eight gene segments was similar to that of the MCC tree (data not shown).
