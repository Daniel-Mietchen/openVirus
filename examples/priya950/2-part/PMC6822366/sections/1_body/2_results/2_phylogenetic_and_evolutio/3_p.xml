<p id="Par45">To achieve accurate dating of each gene segment, reassortant sequences were first removed from the dataset. The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the time of divergence were computed as described in the Materials and methods. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the tMRCA of HA, NA, PA and PB2 was 2002 (95% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 2000–2003), of M1 was 2002 (95% HPD 1998–2003), of PB1 was 2002 (95% HPD 1999–2003), of NP was 2003 (95% HPD 2000–2003) and of NS was 2003 (95% HPD 1997–2005). In general, these tMRCAs were in agreement with the time scale for the documented emergence of H3N8 CIV, within the timeframe of approximately 2002. However, for the time of divergence, NS1 appears to have diverged earlier than the rest—in 2001—with an estimated interval from 1999 to 2002. In addition, the range of tMRCA for NS1 was broader than the rest, from 1997 to 2005. To validate this estimated time of divergence for NS1, a sample of published NS (nucleotide) sequences for Florida-1 EIV and CIV were used in a regression analysis. A plot of the divergence of nucleotides over time (dN/t) showed that they intercepted around 2001–2002 (Additional file

The NS sequence of A/equine/Ohio/1/2003, a Florida-1 clade EIV, was used as a reference. A/canine/Florida/242/2003 was used as the emerging CIV, and isolates from the other six clades (I to VI) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. There were variations among the six identified CIV clades (I to VI). Some were unique for specific clades, e.g., L50I was unique for clade II. Some were “fixed” for later clades, e.g., V156I and L185F for clades IV to VI. Some had more than one variation, e.g., P212H for clade II and P212S for clade V. Some of these unique amino acid residues were within identified functional domains, e.g., a nuclear transport signal (137–146): 140G and 140R for clade I and clade II to VI, respectively [
