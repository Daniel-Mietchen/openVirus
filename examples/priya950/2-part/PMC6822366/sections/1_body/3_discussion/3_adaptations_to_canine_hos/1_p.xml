<p id="Par54">According to the tMRCA for each gene segment with regard to the time of virus emergence, the “adaptation” had occurred while in the equine host. This “pre-emergence adaptation” could be a characteristic of EIV in the Florida-1 clade, which might not occur in other sublineages. Phenotypic heterogeneity is common in equine influenza virus. For example, there is heterogeneity in virulence among different strains of EIV in the early American lineage (unpublished results). As discussed above, although the emerging strain was a reassortant strain and the reassortment event likely occurred in the equine host, back-and-forth interspecies transmission between the canine and equine host prior to the emergence of CIV cannot be ruled out.</p>
