<p id="Par57">Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that enzootic H3N8 CIV has evolved into five to six clades (I to VI). This rapid divergence is in contrast to the parental H3N8 EIV, which only diverged in approximately 1990 after a long-term monophyletic evolution since it was first identified in 1963. Whether it was due to a “founder effect” by geographic restriction or a function of selective pressure remains to be determined.</p>
