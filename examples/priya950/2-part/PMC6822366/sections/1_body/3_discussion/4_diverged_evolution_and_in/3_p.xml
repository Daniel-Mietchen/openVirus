<p id="Par59">The overall evolutionary rate of H3N8 CIV was lower than that of H3N2 hIAV, higher than that of H3N8 EIV, and similar to that of H3N2 CIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In addition, the evolutionary rate of each gene segment of H3N8 CIV was similar to each other. In addition, from the skyline plot, the effective population size of H3N8 CIV increased between 2005 and 2006, consistent with the genetic divergence during this period.
