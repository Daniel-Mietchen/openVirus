<p id="Par32">Of the two subtypes of equine influenza virus (EIV), only H3N8 EIV (formerly equine-2 influenza virus) remains circulating in horses, causing sporadic epizootics and disruptions of equine events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. H3N8 EIV was first identified in Florida in 1963 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since then, it has spread across multiple continents, including Eurasia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], South America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Of note, Australia became EIV-free again by aggressive quarantine measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. From its emergence in 1963 to approximately 1990, H3N8 EIV evolved as a monophyletic lineage; since then, it had diverged into American and Eurasian lineages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and subsequently, the American lineage further diverged into multiple clades, including Florida-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], of which H3N8 CIV was derived.
