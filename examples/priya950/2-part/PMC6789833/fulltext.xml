ZIKV infection is responsible for congenital Zika disease and other neurological defects. Antibody-mediated virus neutralization is an essential component of protective antiviral immunity against ZIKV. In the present study, we assessed whether our GFP reporter ZIKV derived from African viral strain MR766 could be useful for the development of a flow cytometry neutralization test (FNT), as an alternative to the conventional plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). To improve the efficacy of GFP-expressing MR766, we selected virus variant MR766<sup>GFP</sup> showing a high level of GFP signal in infected cells. A MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT was assayed with immune sera from adult mice that received ZIKBeHMR-2. The chimeric ZIKV clone ZIKBeHMR-2 comprises the structural protein region of epidemic strain BeH819015 into MR766 backbone. We reported that adult mice inoculated with ZIKBeHMR-2 developed high levels of neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies. Comparative analysis between MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT and conventional PRNT was performed using mouse anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera. Indistinguishable neutralization patterns were observed when compared with PRNT<sub>50</sub> and FNT<sub>50</sub>.

Introduction</title><p>Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus initially reported in Africa in 1947 [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, ZIKV became a public health concern with recent epidemics occurring in Yap islands (2007), French Polynesia (2013), and South America (2015) [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During these outbreaks, ZIKV infection was reported to cause severe complications in humans, such as developmental abnormalities in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, ZIKV is capable of long-term persistence in human body fluids and sexual transmission of disease has been documented [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection is mainly based on RT-PCR method during the acute phase of the disease [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Serological diagnosis of ZIKV infection is obtained at least one week after the onset of the clinical symptoms [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is frequently observed that members of flavivirus genus share strong antigenic cross-reactivity making inconclusive serological tests especially in regions where ZIKV and related flaviviruses, such as dengue viruses, co-circulate. To overcome this issue, the detection of antibodies that have neutralizing activity against ZIKV can be achieved to confirm recent infection [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is a widely accepted method to measure neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although PRNT is considered as a &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; assay for flavivirus neutralization, this specific but conventional format is a time-consuming method making difficult the screening of a large number of samples. Noteworthy, virus plaque-based analysis is limited to cultured cell lines, such as green monkey epithelial Vero cells, that permit plaque-forming assay. </p><p>New biological tests revisiting the conventional PRNT method are necessary for the rapid measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in large serum series. Consequently, several reporter gene-based methods for neutralizing assays have been recently developed for ZIKV [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given that reporter systems afford the ability to visualize viral expression inside the infected cells, we generated a GFP reporter ZIKV entitled ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We demonstrated that ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> is a performing tool for the monitoring of ZIKV replication in the host cell as well as the screening of antiviral compounds [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the present study, we adapted ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> for the measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies by flow cytometry analysis. The GFP reporter ZIKV-based flow cytometry neutralization test (FNT) was challenged with serum samples from mice inoculated with ZIKV. Results showed that our newly developed FNT generated ZIKV-neutralizing antibody titers that are equivalent to those obtained with conventional PRNT.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-07-00066"><title>2.

Generation of Viral Clone MR766<sup>GFP</sup> for Flow Cytometry Neutralization Test </title><p>To generate a more reliable GFP reporter ZIKV for flow cytometry neutralization test, recombinant ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> was repeatedly passaged on Vero cells using a limiting dilution cloning method [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A single virus clone, hereafter named MR766<sup>GFP</sup>, was selected for further studies. The progeny virus production of MR766<sup>GFP</sup> variant in Vero cells was at least 1.5 log higher than for parental ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expression of MR766<sup>GFP</sup> was examined in Vero cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f001">Figure 1</xref>).

Immune sera from mice inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 served as negative controls [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The serum samples were first subjected to testing by a conventional PRNT method in Vero cells using MR766<sup>GFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, negative control immune sera exhibited no reduction of virus plaque number at the lower dilution tested (1:50). In contrast, immune sera from mice inoculated with ZIKBeHMR-2 showed neutralizing activity against MR766<sup>GFP</sup>. The serum samples reduced the number of virus plaques in a dilution-dependent manner. In mice that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2, there was a PRNT<sub>50</sub> value of 130 (95% Confident Interval (CI): 93&#x02013;182). After inoculation of a booster dose, the ZIKV-neutralizing antibody titers increased up to 3051 (95% CI: 2251&#x02013;4136). Thus, a conventional PRNT confirmed the neutralizing activity of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera against ZIKV.</p><p>The mouse serum samples were next assessed by MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT. The neutralization tests were performed on Vero cells grown in 96-well plates, and GFP expression was examined 20 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f003">Figure 3</xref>). By flow-cytometry analysis, the percentage of GFP-positive Vero cells infected with MR766<sup>GFP</sup> reached 55%. There was no reduction in the percentages of GFP-positive cells using immune sera from mice inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 that served as a negative virus control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f003">Figure 3</xref>A).

This indicates a concordance between conventional PRNT and a FNT method based on a single infection round. Such results support the utilization of MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT for measuring ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens.</p><p>We next evaluated whether the MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT can be performed in human cells that do not support virus plaque assay such as human epithelial A549 cells. To evaluate the performance of our FNT on A549 cells, MR766<sup>GFP</sup> was incubated with serial dilutions of immune sera from mice inoculated with one or two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2. The virus-antibody mixtures were used to infect A549 cells seeded in 96-well plates. At 20 h post-infection, the GFP expression was observed in infected A549 cells by flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of GFP-positive A549 cells infected with MR766<sup>GFP</sup> reached 50%. There was a 100% infectivity with immune sera directed against heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f005">Figure 5</xref>A).

In mice (n = 15) that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2, there was a FNT<sub>50</sub> value of 161 (95% CI: 119&#x02013;216). After inoculation of a booster dose, the FNT<sub>50</sub> value of immune sera (n = 14) increased up to 2320 (95% CI: 1507&#x02013;3570). </p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f006">Figure 6</xref>, there was a linear relationship (R&#x000b2; = 0.94, <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.0001) between FNT<sub>50</sub> performed in Vero and A549 cells. Thus, human epithelial A549 cells are suitable for the measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens based on our newly developed MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-07-00066"><title>4.

To this aim, we took advantage of our previously developed GFP reporter ZIKV (recombinant ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub>), which had been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the monitoring of virus replication as well as the screening of antiviral compounds [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In routine, ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> infection is observed by flow cytometry analysis at 18&#x02013;24 h post-infection based on the GFP signal. In the present study, we identified MR766<sup>GFP</sup> as a variant of ZIKV<sub>GFP</sub> exhibiting a greater propensity to produce a GFP signal associated with a higher virus progeny production.</p><p>Here, MR766<sup>GFP</sup> was assayed with serum specimens from adult BALB/c mice inoculated with a chimeric viral clone ZIKBeHMR-2, which contains the structural protein region of epidemic Brazilian ZIKV strain BeH810915 into a MR766 backbone [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ZIKBeHMR-2 has a non-glycosylated E protein due to the introduction of a limited number of amino acid substitutions in the E glycan-loop of BeH819015 [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ability of ZIKBeHMR-2 to induce anti-ZIKV antibody production had been validated in adult BALB/c mice immunized by the intraperitoneal route [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The serum specimens obtained from mice inoculated with one or two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2 were evaluated for neutralizing antibodies by conventional PRNT. Immunized mice developed anti-ZIKV antibodies that neutralize MR766 with PRNT<sub>50</sub> values reaching up to 3500 [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consequently, anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera were suitable for a comparative analysis between our MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT and conventional PRNT, the latter being considered as a &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; assay for flavivirus neutralization. FNT was first performed on African green monkey Vero cells which are commonly used for neutralization tests. Vero cells were grown in 96-well-plates. The neutralizing activity of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera against ZIKV was estimated within two days. There was a linear correlation between FNT<sub>50</sub> and PRNT<sub>50</sub> values with R<sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination of 0.9. Thus, our newly developed GFP reporter ZIKV-based FNT allows a prompt and reliable detection of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens. A such method was next employed on human epithelial A549 cells, and there was a linear correlation between FNT<sub>50s</sub> values in A549 and Vero cells with an R<sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination of 0.94. We propose that MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT is a suitable method for the general measurement of antibody-mediated ZIKV neutralization. Now, it is of paramount importance to estimate our newly developed FNT format for the detection of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies using human serum specimens from Zika patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-07-00066"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that viral clone MR766<sup>GFP</sup> is a suitable GFP reporter ZIKV for the identification of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens by flow-cytometry analysis. The time-saver MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT format could provide a reliable platform for measuring antibodies that neutralize ZIKV in a large number of serum specimens without the requirement for plaque-forming formation. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether conventional PRNT method might be replaced by our newly developed MR766<sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT for epidemiological cohort studies as well as vaccine development on ZIKV.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-vaccines-07-00066"><title>6.
