  <p>Plaque-reduction neutralization test on anti-Zika virus immune sera. The neutralizing ability of mouse serum specimens against MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup> was determined by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) on Vero cells. Samples of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera were tested individually. Serum specimens were two-fold serial diluted starting at a 1:50 dilution. The results are shown normalized to the 100% infection achieved with MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup> without serum. In (
   <bold>A</bold>), the immune sera of BALB/c mice inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 served as a negative control (negative control). In (
   <bold>B</bold>), immune sera of BALB/c mice that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2 (5 log PFU) (1
   <sup>st</sup> dose). In (
   <bold>C</bold>), immune sera of BALB/c mice that received two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2 (5 log PFU) with an interval of 6 weeks (2
   <sup>nd</sup> dose).
