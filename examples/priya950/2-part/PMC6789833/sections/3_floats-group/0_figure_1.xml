  <p>Characterization of viral clone MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup> on Vero cells. In (
   <bold>A</bold>), the example of infectious virus foci developed after a focus-forming assay using anti-GFP antibody. To visualize infectious virus plaques, the cell monolayer was counterstained with crystal violet. In (
   <bold>B</bold>), cells were infected 24 h with MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup> at an m.o.i. of 1. The GFP-positive cells (GFP) stained with anti-E MAb 4G2 (4G2) were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. In (
   <bold>C</bold>), mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup>-infected cells (MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup>), as determined by flow cytometry analysis. Control: mock-infected Vero cells.
