<p>For the focus-forming assay, Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Virus samples were added to the cells for 2 h at 37 Â°C and then incubated with 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). After a 4-day incubation, cell monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (FA) in PBS, followed by permeabilization with 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were incubated with a mouse anti-GFP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at dilution 1:1000 followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at dilution 1:2000. Virus plaques were revealed with Vector NovaRED
 <sup>TM</sup> peroxidase substrate (Cliniscences Nanterre, France) and counterstained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Plates were scanned with an Epson scanner (Levallois-Perret, France).
