The first group of adult BALB/c mice (n = 5) was inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2, a second group (n = 15) received a single dose of 5 log PFU of ZIKBeHMR-2, and a third group (n = 14) received two doses of 5 log PFU of ZIKBeHMR-2 with a 6-week interval. All the serum specimens were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min.
