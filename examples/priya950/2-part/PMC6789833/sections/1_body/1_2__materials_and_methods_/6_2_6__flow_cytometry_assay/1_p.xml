<p>For flow cytometry assay, cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Virus samples were added to the cells for 18 h. Cells were gently harvested by trypsinization, fixed with 3.7% FA in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Samples were incubated with mouse anti-flavivirus E MAb 4G2 at dilution 1:1000 (R&amp;D Biotech, Besan√ßon, France) and then with Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at dilution 1:1000. Cells were analyzed with a Cytoflex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). </p>
