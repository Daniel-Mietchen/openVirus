<p>For flow cytometry-based neutralization test (FNT), 20,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates. Serum specimens were 2-fold serially diluted in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS with a starting dilution of 1:50, and incubated with an equal volume of a virus sample containing 20,000 PFU of MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> for 2 h at 37 Â°C. The virus-antibody mixture was added to the cell monolayers for 20 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% FA in PBS, and 10,000 cells of each assay were analyzed for GFP expression with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). The 100% infectivity was obtained with the number of ZIKV-infected cells positive for GFP expression in the absence of serum samples. The neutralizing antibody titer was determined as the serum dilution that resulted in a 50% reduction of GFP expression (FNT
 <sub>50</sub>) and was calculated by nonlinear, dose-response regression analysis.
