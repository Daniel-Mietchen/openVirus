<p>Variants of ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> were selected using a limiting dilution cloning method. Briefly, Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) were infected 5 days with ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of l0
 <sup>âˆ’4</sup>. Supernatants of GFP-positive cell monolayers were recovered, and the second round of virus cloning was performed on Vero cells, as described above. Viral clone MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> was selected and then passaged twice on Vero cells to produce a final virus stock for experiments. The infectious titer of the working MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> stock was 7.7 log PFU/mL on Vero cells.
