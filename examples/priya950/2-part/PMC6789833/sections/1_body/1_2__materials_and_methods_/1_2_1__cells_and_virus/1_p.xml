<p>Vero cells (clone E6) and A549
 <sup>Dual</sup> cells (Invivogen, Toulouse, France), referred to hereafter as “A549 cells”, were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C in MEM Eagle medium, supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM 
 <sub>L</sub>-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 0.5 µg/mL amphotericin B (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). The recombinant ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> derived from molecular clone ZIKV MR766
 <sup>MC</sup> is described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> and derived viral clone MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> stocks were amplified on Vero cells and titrated by plaque-forming assay on Vero cells, as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Virus titer was expressed as plaque-forming unit per mL (PFU/mL).
