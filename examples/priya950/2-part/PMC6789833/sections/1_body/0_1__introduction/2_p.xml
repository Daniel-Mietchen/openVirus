<p>Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection is mainly based on RT-PCR method during the acute phase of the disease [

 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Serological diagnosis of ZIKV infection is obtained at least one week after the onset of the clinical symptoms [

It is frequently observed that members of flavivirus genus share strong antigenic cross-reactivity making inconclusive serological tests especially in regions where ZIKV and related flaviviruses, such as dengue viruses, co-circulate. To overcome this issue, the detection of antibodies that have neutralizing activity against ZIKV can be achieved to confirm recent infection [

 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although PRNT is considered as a “gold standard” assay for flavivirus neutralization, this specific but conventional format is a time-consuming method making difficult the screening of a large number of samples. Noteworthy, virus plaque-based analysis is limited to cultured cell lines, such as green monkey epithelial Vero cells, that permit plaque-forming assay.
