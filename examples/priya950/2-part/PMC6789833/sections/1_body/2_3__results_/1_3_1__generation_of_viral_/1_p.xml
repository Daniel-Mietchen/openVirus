<p>To generate a more reliable GFP reporter ZIKV for flow cytometry neutralization test, recombinant ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> was repeatedly passaged on Vero cells using a limiting dilution cloning method [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A single virus clone, hereafter named MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>, was selected for further studies. The progeny virus production of MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> variant in Vero cells was at least 1.5 log higher than for parental ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expression of MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> was examined in Vero cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f001">Figure 1</xref>). We observed that most of the virus plaques produced in the focus-forming assay were positively stained by anti-GFP antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Flow-cytometry analysis confirmed that Vero cells positive for GFP expression were recognized by the anti-E mAb 4G2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, the MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> variant is a suitable GFP reporter ZIKV for the development of a FNT.
