<p>We next evaluated whether the MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT can be performed in human cells that do not support virus plaque assay such as human epithelial A549 cells. To evaluate the performance of our FNT on A549 cells, MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> was incubated with serial dilutions of immune sera from mice inoculated with one or two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2. The virus-antibody mixtures were used to infect A549 cells seeded in 96-well plates. At 20 h post-infection, the GFP expression was observed in infected A549 cells by flow cytometry analysis. The percentage of GFP-positive A549 cells infected with MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> reached 50%. There was a 100% infectivity with immune sera directed against heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). We observed that anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera reduced MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> infectivity for A549 cells in a serum dilution-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C). In mice (n = 15) that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2, there was a FNT
 <sub>50</sub> value of 161 (95% CI: 119–216). After inoculation of a booster dose, the FNT
 <sub>50</sub> value of immune sera (n = 14) increased up to 2320 (95% CI: 1507–3570).
