<p>The mouse serum samples were next assessed by MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT. The neutralization tests were performed on Vero cells grown in 96-well plates, and GFP expression was examined 20 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f003">Figure 3</xref>). By flow-cytometry analysis, the percentage of GFP-positive Vero cells infected with MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> reached 55%. There was no reduction in the percentages of GFP-positive cells using immune sera from mice inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 that served as a negative virus control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Whereas mouse anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera showed neutralizing activity against MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> in a dilution-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). In mice (n = 15) that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2, there was a FNT
 <sub>50</sub> value of 117 (95% CI: 81–169). After inoculation of a booster dose, the FNT
 <sub>50</sub> values of immune sera (n = 14) increased up to 2469 (95% CI: 1673–3645).
