<p>Data fitting between PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> and FNT
 <sub>50</sub> values on anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera revealed a linear relationship (RÂ² = 0.90, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.0001) between the two assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates a concordance between conventional PRNT and a FNT method based on a single infection round. Such results support the utilization of MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT for measuring ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens.
