<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f006">Figure 6</xref>, there was a linear relationship (RÂ² = 0.94, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.0001) between FNT
 <sub>50</sub> performed in Vero and A549 cells. Thus, human epithelial A549 cells are suitable for the measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens based on our newly developed MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT.
