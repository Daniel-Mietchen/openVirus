<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that viral clone MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> is a suitable GFP reporter ZIKV for the identification of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens by flow-cytometry analysis. The time-saver MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT format could provide a reliable platform for measuring antibodies that neutralize ZIKV in a large number of serum specimens without the requirement for plaque-forming formation. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether conventional PRNT method might be replaced by our newly developed MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT for epidemiological cohort studies as well as vaccine development on ZIKV.
