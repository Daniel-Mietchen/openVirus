<p>The development of new neutralizing assays that overcome the restrictions presented by the conventional PRNT methods become a priority for ZIKV. To this aim, we took advantage of our previously developed GFP reporter ZIKV (recombinant ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub>), which had been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the monitoring of virus replication as well as the screening of antiviral compounds [

 <sub>GFP</sub> infection is observed by flow cytometry analysis at 18â€“24 h post-infection based on the GFP signal. In the present study, we identified MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> as a variant of ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> exhibiting a greater propensity to produce a GFP signal associated with a higher virus progeny production.
