<p>Here, MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> was assayed with serum specimens from adult BALB/c mice inoculated with a chimeric viral clone ZIKBeHMR-2, which contains the structural protein region of epidemic Brazilian ZIKV strain BeH810915 into a MR766 backbone [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ZIKBeHMR-2 has a non-glycosylated E protein due to the introduction of a limited number of amino acid substitutions in the E glycan-loop of BeH819015 [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ability of ZIKBeHMR-2 to induce anti-ZIKV antibody production had been validated in adult BALB/c mice immunized by the intraperitoneal route [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The serum specimens obtained from mice inoculated with one or two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2 were evaluated for neutralizing antibodies by conventional PRNT. Immunized mice developed anti-ZIKV antibodies that neutralize MR766 with PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values reaching up to 3500 [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consequently, anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera were suitable for a comparative analysis between our MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT and conventional PRNT, the latter being considered as a “gold standard” assay for flavivirus neutralization. FNT was first performed on African green monkey Vero cells which are commonly used for neutralization tests. Vero cells were grown in 96-well-plates. The neutralizing activity of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera against ZIKV was estimated within two days. There was a linear correlation between FNT
 <sub>50</sub> and PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values with R
 <sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination of 0.9. Thus, our newly developed GFP reporter ZIKV-based FNT allows a prompt and reliable detection of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in serum specimens. A such method was next employed on human epithelial A549 cells, and there was a linear correlation between FNT
 <sub>50s</sub> values in A549 and Vero cells with an R
 <sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination of 0.94. We propose that MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>-based FNT is a suitable method for the general measurement of antibody-mediated ZIKV neutralization. Now, it is of paramount importance to estimate our newly developed FNT format for the detection of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies using human serum specimens from Zika patients.
