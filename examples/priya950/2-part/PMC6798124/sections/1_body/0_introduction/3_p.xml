<p>Therefore, there is a complex interplay between the innate immune responses elicited in the cell and how the virus counteracts this cellular response. Many aspects of the dynamics of the complex interactions that occur after IAV infection are not well understood. In order to better understand these dynamics, we characterized expression patterns of host and viral factors during IAV infection at the single-cell level. For these studies we used human respiratory cells infected with IAV at a low or high multiplicity of infection (MOI). First, time-lapse microscopy experiments showed MOI-dependent expression of NS1 per cell. Next, the single-cell transcriptome analysis also showed MOI-dependent expression of viral genes, with a negative correlation of the levels of the viral NS1 and PA genes with cellular gene expression, and distinct patterns of type I and III IFN and ISG expression in infected versus bystander cells. In addition, we found that type III IFN responses have a component of paracrine induction in epithelial cells. These findings were possible thanks to the use of single-cell transcriptome analysis, which, in contrast to bulk analysis, allowed for the characterization of gene expression profiles in infected versus bystander cells, as well as a stratification of the cellular gene expression according to the levels of the expression of viral genes. Finally, we determined the time scales of the functional antiviral responses during the first two rounds of IAV infection using a staggered IAV H1N1/H3N2 coinfection model in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.</p>
