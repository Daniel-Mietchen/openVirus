<p>The innate immune response is one of the first mechanisms of host defense against viral infections. In order to successfully establish infection in humans, viruses such as IAV have developed strategies to counteract this system. While extensive research on the genes involved in antiviral responses and on IAV antagonism has been performed, the global virus-host interaction and its consequences at the individual cell level are still not well understood. In this study, we performed a deep analysis of these interactions and their functional consequences in respiratory epithelial cells, which are main targets of IAV replication.</p>
