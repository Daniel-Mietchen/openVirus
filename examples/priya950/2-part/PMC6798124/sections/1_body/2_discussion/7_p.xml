<p>Our study also highlights the appropriateness of single-cell transcriptome analyses to better understand the processes governing virus-host interactions. In this study, this technology allowed for the identification of patterns of expression of IFN genes and ISGs in infected cultures, suggesting that the ability of a cell to secrete IFN and the degree of their antiviral capacity are associated with multiple factors, such as their infection state and the levels of the expression of viral genes. These issues cannot be addressed by the use of bulk analysis. Given the recent development of this type of technology, only a few studies have been reported to date applying them to IAV infection. Two recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on the heterogeneity of viral transcripts during IAV infection in epithelial cells and on the characterization of virus species triggering the immune response (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). In these studies, very low induction of the expression of innate immune genes was found, probably due to the use of a low MOI, which minimized the presence of coinfections as required by the type of questions addressed. An interesting 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study also addressed similar questions but focused mostly on the heterogeneity of infection and innate immune responses across multiple cell types (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).
