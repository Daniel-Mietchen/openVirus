<p>We also find that early innate immune responses developed after IAV infection at low MOIs are efficient at inhibiting subsequent infection of bystander cells. If the virus overcomes this first barrier and propagates in the tissue by multiple viruses infecting the same cells, the virus would more efficiently block the innate immune response in infected cells and hypothetically could replicate more efficiently as infection progresses. Therefore, this report provides insights into how the dynamics of the interplay of IAV immune antagonism and innate immune response can change as the number of viruses infecting single cells increases in the respiratory epithilium after the early stages of infection.</p>
