<p>Our single-cell sequencing data also showed that while the expression of most of the type I or III IFN is restricted to that small cell population, IFNL1 is more widespread, since it is expressed by most of the infected cells and also in the bystander cells, albeit to lower levels. The mechanism for IFNL1 induction in bystander cells is consistent with a paracrine response involving host factors secreted from virus-infected cells. Interestingly, Ank et al. (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) found that HepG2 cells (a human liver carcinoma cell line) showed upregulated expression of IFNL1 and IFNL2/3 upon treatment with either type I or type III IFN. However, in our study we did not detect induction of IFNL1 by those cytokines in A549 cells. These different results could be a consequence of the different cell types used in their study or of limits of detection. While human type I and type III IFNs are known to be induced by direct virus infection by similar transcription factors, their promoters are significantly different. There are 13 subtypes of human IFNA genes, and they are regulated by IRF3 and IRF7, which bind a cluster of transcription sites in the promoters with different affinities (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). However, the regulation of expression of IFNB1 is more tightly regulated by the coordinated binding of multiple complexes of transcription factors, specifically IRF3/IRF7, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and activator protein 1 (AP1), to the positive regulatory domains (PRD) of the enhanceosome (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). The type III IFN has been more recently described, given its later discovery (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Human IFNL2 and IFNL3 are almost identical and have highly similar promoters (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). IFNL4 is expressed in only a fraction of the human population, due to a widespread genetic polymorphism introducing a 5′-proximal frameshift (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). All IFNL promoters have binding sites for NF-κB and for IRF3/7, with some differences among them. In general, the literature suggests that IFNL promoters are more flexible than the type I IFN promoter (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which agrees with the broader distribution of type III IFN found in our study, and that NF-κB plays an important role in its activation. IFNL1 regulation is very divergent from IFNL2/3 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). IFNL1 has a distal cluster of NF-κB binding sites upstream of the promoter, and engagement of these sites by NF-κB transcription factors is enough to activate its expression (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Additionally, IFNL1 promoter can be activated by IRF and NF-κB factors independently through the separated elements, although engagement of both is necessary for the highest levels of expression (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Therefore, the paracrine induction of IFNL1 could be due to its promoter organization, which is unique among the rest of the type I or type III IFNs. Alternatively, additional binding sites for transcription factors yet unidentified could be present in the IFNL1 promoter, which could contribute to the unexpected paracrine induction of this gene. The broad expression of IFNL1 suggests a possible mechanism of amplification of the antiviral response in IFNLR1-IL10R2-expressing tissues, such as the respiratory epithelium, during IAV infections.
