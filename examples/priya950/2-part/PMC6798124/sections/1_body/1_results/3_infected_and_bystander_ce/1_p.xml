<p>Single-cell transcriptome analysis allows us the unique opportunity to tease out differences in the immune responses of infected cells, mainly elicited by sensing and autocrine signaling, and bystander cells, mainly elicited by paracrine signaling. We compared the distributions of gene expression in infected and bystander cells. The ratio of the expression of the top upregulated genes identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> between infected and bystander cells was calculated (log
 <sub>2</sub> fold change of the mean UMI count per cell in infected over bystander cells) and sorted according to the average of the results for the two MOIs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also selected and included in this panel 10 additional genes that were upregulated over mock-infected cultures and had the lowest ratio between infected and bystander cells (log
 <sub>2</sub> fold change of the mean UMI count per cell in infected over bystander cells). There was a consistent pattern of expression across all genes, where a lower ratio between infected and bystander cells was found at the high MOI than at the low MOI. In addition, a gradient in the ratio of the expression of those genes between infected and bystander cells was observed at both MOIs. Visualization of the expression of those genes (log
 <sub>2</sub> UMI mean) in infected and bystander cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) indicated that this pattern is probably due to a combination of different mechanisms of gene activation and different levels of susceptibility to virus antagonism. Genes depicted toward the left axes of the plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> showed expression in infected cells that was similar to or lower than in bystander cells, consistent with a paracrine mechanism of activation, as known for most of the ISGs. Frequently, the expression of these genes, such as the BST2 (tetherin), TRIM22, OAS2, IFI27, and IFITM2 genes, was lower in infected cells than in bystander cells, with this effect being more evident at the MOI of 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). As an example, detailed data for BTS2 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>. Genes positioned toward the right axis of these plots had greater expression levels in infected than in bystander cells. Most of these genes are known to be induced in an autocrine manner, such as the genes for type I and III IFNs and chemokines such as CCL5 (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), interleukin 6 (IL-6) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and CXCL10 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, we found several ISGs, such as IFIT2, RSAD2 (or viperin), OASL, and IFIH1 (or MDA5), that were expressed at higher levels in infected versus bystander cells, suggesting that in addition to being induced upon IFN signaling, they can also be strongly induced directly upon viral sensing in an autocrine manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of these four genes was already detected at 4 hpi at both MOIs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Detailed data for IFIT2 and IFNB1 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> as a representative example of increased expression in infected versus bystander cells. An autocrine component of activation of these ISGs might be of high importance for early innate immune responses to IAV.
