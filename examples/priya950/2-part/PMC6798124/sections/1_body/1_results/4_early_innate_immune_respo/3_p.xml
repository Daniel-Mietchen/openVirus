<p>Thus, using single-cell resolution transcriptome analysis, we identified a differential pattern of expression between type I and type III IFN systems during virus infection in epithelial cells. The pattern of IFNL1 expression identified in the single-cell expression analysis was consistent with a paracrine mechanism of activation in a large number of IFNL1-expressing bystander cells, in addition to the well-described autocrine induction upon virus sensing (
