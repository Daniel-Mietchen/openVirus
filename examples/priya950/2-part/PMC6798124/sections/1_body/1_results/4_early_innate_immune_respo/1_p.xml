<p>We also analyzed the distribution of type I and type III IFN gene expression in infected cultures at the single-cell level. As can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, we found that the expression of IFNB1 was restricted to a group of infected cells at both MOIs (corresponding to the blue group in the tSNE plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for IFNL2, IFNL3, and IFNL4. Interestingly, in the case of IFNL1, while high levels of expression in that specific group of cells were also found, there was a broader pattern of induction of expression among the rest of the cells in the culture, including both infected and bystander cells. At an MOI of 2, there was another small group of infected cells located at the left side of the green cluster (which in general expressed low levels of IFN and chemokines) in the tSNE plots that demonstrated high induction of IFNB1 and IFNL1 to -4. As described above, the preliminary cluster to which these cells belong was formed by the differential expression of genes associated with cell cycle, resulting in a different classification of those few cells than the ones in the blue group (which was characterized by infected cells with high expression of IFN and chemokines).
