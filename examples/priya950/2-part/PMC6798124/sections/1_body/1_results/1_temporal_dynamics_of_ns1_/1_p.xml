<p>The IAV NS1 protein is one of the viral antagonists of host innate immune responses. We first investigated the time scales of NS1 expression during IAV infection by time-lapse microscopy in the A549 human epithelial cell line using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NS1-expressing virus (PR8-GFP) (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). A549-H2B-mCherry was used to improve nucleus image segmentation accuracy in live imaging. We infected cells at MOIs of 10, 2, 0.6, and 0.2 and captured images from 3 to 12 h postinfection (hpi), which would mainly correspond to a single cycle of replication (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, with an MOI of 10, cells expressing NS1 were detected as early as 4 hpi. However, as the MOI was reduced, we observed a delay in the detection of expression of NS1, with detection at 5 hpi at an MOI of 2, 6 hpi at an MOI of 0.6, and 7 hpi at an MOI of 0.2. Quantification of the percentage of infected cells in the time-lapse experiment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. When we measured the median fluorescence intensity per cell in the infected cells (GFP+ cells), we found that a higher MOI was associated with higher levels of NS1 expression per cell at every time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This phenomenon can be explained by the differences in the number of cells infected with multiple infectious viruses, which will decrease with the MOI. According to the Poisson distribution [P(k) = e
 <sup>−MOI</sup>(moi
 <sup>k</sup>/k!), where k is number of virus particles that infects each cell and P(k) the fraction of cells that receive k particles], in a cell culture exposed to an MOI of 10 virtually all cells would theoretically receive two or more virions, and this number is reduced as the MOI diminishes to less than 2% with an MOI of 0.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, both earlier and higher NS1 expressions per cell were associated with increasing proportions of cells infected by more than one virus.
