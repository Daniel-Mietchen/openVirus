<p>Given the distinct patterns of gene expression of cellular and viral genes among the different groups, we tested whether there was an MOI-dependent expression pattern of all viral genes as we found for NS1 by time-lapse microscopy. Consistent with those findings, we found that at an MOI of 2, there was a higher level of expression of total viral RNAs per cell than at an MOI of 0.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). At 12 h, there was a clear gap in the detection of viral RNAs between bystander cells (0 viral UMI) and infected cells (over 648 and 349 at 2 and 0.2 MOI, respectively), which allowed for better differentiation between these two groups in the culture in subsequent analyses. Approximately 86% and 20% of infected cells were identified at MOIs of 2 and 0.2, respectively, at 12 hpi. Next, we analyzed the levels of the different IAV genes per infected cell. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, cells infected with a high MOI contained more viral UMIs/cell that those infected with a low MOI, supporting the hypothesis that multiple infections per cell result in increased level of viral proteins. Interestingly, and in accordance with previous reports (
