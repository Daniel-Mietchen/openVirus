<p>Based on the results from our time-lapse microscopy experiments, we hypothesized that the MOI dependence of NS1 expression could have important implications for its antagonism of the innate immune responses. Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA expression profiling (10× Genomics) in the same A549/PR8-GFP system using an MOI of 2, at which around 59% of the cells should be subjected to infections with more than one virus, and an MOI of 0.2, which should result in a low percentage of cells infected by more than one virus (∼2%). First, we identified the genes that showed the largest fold increase in mean expression (normalized unique molecular identifier [UMI] counts) across all cells in the infected versus the mock-infected cultures (
