<p>Subsequently, we investigated the implications of the MOI-dependent expression of viral genes in the innate immune response elicited in infected cultures. We analyzed the correlation between the viral and cellular transcripts that we found to be upregulated during IAV infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, we observed that at the high MOI, most of the viral genes had a negative correlation with cellular genes, with the exception of the NP and HA genes. At an MOI of 0.2, only the NS and PA genes showed a negative correlation with most of the cellular genes. In both cases, the viral genes that showed the strongest negative correlation with cellular genes were the NS and PA genes, supporting the conclusion that viral proteins encoded by these genes might have an important function as negative regulators of transcription of cellular genes. This effect is more evident with an elevated MOI, due to high levels of expression of viral genes per infected cell. Interestingly, the NS gene encodes the known innate immune antagonist NS1 protein, while the PA gene encodes the PA protein, which is part of the polymerase complex, and the PA-X protein and is also known to repress cellular gene expression (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In conclusion, we found that the expression of viral proteins per cell is MOI dependent—due to infection by multiple viruses per cell at the higher MOI—and is associated with reduced transcription of cellular innate immune genes.
