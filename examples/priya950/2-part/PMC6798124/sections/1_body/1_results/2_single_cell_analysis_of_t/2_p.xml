 <italic>t</italic>-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) visualization of the single-cell data, followed by a clustering analysis (see Materials and Methods), was used to examine the global expression profile of the single cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). At 12 hpi, for each MOI, we initially identified five clusters in the mock-infected cultures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and six clusters in the IAV-infected samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). However, by comparing the differentially expressed genes among the 5 clusters in mock-infected cultures and subsequent pathway analysis using a Reactome Pathway Database tool (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), we found that this phenomenon was mostly due to genes involved in cell cycle. Part of the clustering identified in the mock-infected cultures also mediated the clustering in the infected cultures (heat maps in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). For instance, at an MOI of 2, cluster 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) seemed to show a clear separation from clusters 0, 1, and 4 and had 111 genes that were differentially expressed than in those clusters. A pathway analysis of those genes (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) identified that the main pathways represented were associated with cell cycle processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Therefore, in order to extract the information relevant to this study, we collapsed some of these clusters according to the expression of viral genes and genes associated with the innate immune response. As a result, we defined three new clusters for each MOI as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>. For both MOIs, the red cluster is composed mostly of cells showing undetectable or low levels of viral mRNA expression. The green and blue clusters showed expression of viral genes; therefore, they are composed mostly of infected cells. Cells in the blue cluster (also for both MOIs) showed higher expression of type I and type III IFNs as well as chemokines such as CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>, bottom sections of the heat maps) than the green cluster and, as expected, than the red cluster (which is mostly composed of bystander cells). Interestingly, at an MOI of 2, cells belonging to the blue cluster clearly showed lower expression of viral genes, suggesting that they might experience a lower antagonist effect leading to a higher IFN production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Another interesting observation was that the red cluster showed overall higher expression of ISGs such as IFIT1, IFI27, and IFITM1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, top section of the left heat map) than the infected cells. A similar pattern was found at an MOI of 0.2. However, at this MOI we did not find clear differences in the expression of viral genes between the blue (cells producing high levels of IFN) and the green clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Cells infected for 4 h showed profiles very similar to those of mock-infected cells, with the exception of the presence of low numbers of infected cells and few innate immune genes as differentially expressed genes at an MOI of 2 (data not shown). Therefore, we focused most of our subsequent analysis on the 12-h time point.
