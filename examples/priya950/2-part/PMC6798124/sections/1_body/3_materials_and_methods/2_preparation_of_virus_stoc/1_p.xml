<p>IAV strains A/California/4/2009 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/2003 (H3N2), and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 expressing NS1 fused to green fluorescent protein (PR8-GFP) were propagated in specific-pathogen‐free embryonated hens’ eggs (Charles River Laboratories) (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Infectious titers of IAV stocks were determined by standard plaque assay on MDCK epithelial cells. For infections of A549 cells, infectivity was measured by influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) staining and automated imaging using a Celigo imaging cytometer (Nexcelom), and the titer was adjusted to obtain approximately the expected infectivity for each multiplicity of infection (MOI) according to the Poisson distribution.
