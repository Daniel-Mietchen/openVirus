<p>We evaluated the infectivity of H1N1 IAV in NHBE cells by immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% FBS in PBS. Next, cells were stained with an anti-HA (pan-HA group 1) monoclonal antibody KB2 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and a secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 (A488; Invitrogen), as well as a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 (A647; Invitrogen), and 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Images of complete Transwells (in triplicate) were collected using the automated Celigo imaging cytometer (Nexcelom). The percentage of infected cells was calculated by gating positive cells in A488 and A647 to minimize background noise, using the DAPI signal as a mask for nucleus segmentation.
