<p>Primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were purchased from Lonza. Progenitor cells were expanded and differentiated as previously described (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Briefly, cells were expanded in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM; Lonza) and then cultured in 12-mm Transwell filters (Corning) for 4 to 6 weeks in a 1:1 BGEM-DMEM mixture (differentiation medium) supplemented with retinoid acid (sigma) at a final concentration of 15 ng/ml.
