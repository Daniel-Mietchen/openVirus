<p>Improvement of cell nucleus segmentation for microscopy and image processing was achieved with the generation of A549 cells stably expressing an mCherry fluorescent protein-fused histone H2B (A549 H2B-mCherry cells). The H2B-mCherry expression plasmid was a gift from Robert Benezra (Addgene plasmid number 20972) (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cotransfected with H2B-mCherry plasmid in combination with 3rd-generation lentiviral packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-Rev, and pMD2.G (gifts from Didier Trono; Addgene plasmids 12251, 12253, and 12259). The resulting lentiviral particles were used to transduce A549 cells. Single-cell clonal selection was performed, and a selection of monoclonal candidates was tested against wild-type A549 cells to discard phenotypic abnormalities.
