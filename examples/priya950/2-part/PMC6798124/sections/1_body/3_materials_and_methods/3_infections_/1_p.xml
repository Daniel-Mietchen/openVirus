<p>Infections of A549 H2B-mCherry cells for real-time microscopy and single-cell transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed up to 12 h postinfection (hpi) to capture the first replication cycle of IAV. Cells were plated the day before the experiment in 24-well plates. Virus inoculum was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100 μl was added to the cells. After 1 h at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and Eagle’s MEM (EMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 5% NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% FBS was added to the cells. Cell culture plates were then placed in the 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber of the Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscope for subsequent imaging or collected at the desired time points for single-cell RNA transcriptome analysis.
