<p>The following steps were followed for data preprocessing and analysis. Paired-end reads from Illumina sequencing were aligned to a combination of the human hg19 and viral PR8 genomes using the Cell Ranger (10Ã— Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) pipeline. The resulting unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices were automatically filtered to remove background and noncellular barcodes. Six samples representing MOIs of 2, 0.2, and 0 (mock) at 4 h and 12 h were analyzed. The numbers of cells sequenced were 6,758, 7,377, and 4,505 for MOIs of 2, 0.2, and 0, respectively, at 4 hpi and 4,579, 4,698, and 8,562 for MOIs of 2, 0.2, and 0, respectively, at 12 hpi. Over 18,000 distinct genes were detected in each sample.</p>
