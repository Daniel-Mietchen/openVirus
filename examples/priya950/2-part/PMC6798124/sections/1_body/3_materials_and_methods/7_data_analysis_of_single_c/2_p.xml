<p>Sequencing analysis was performed using MATLAB and the single-cell sequencing analysis R package Seurat (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). We filtered cells by requiring a minimum of 200 genes with nonzero UMI counts and filtered genes by requiring a minimum of 3 cells with nonzero UMI counts. Cell UMI counts were then normalized for all samples to 10,000 total UMIs per cell, excluding viral genes, as they undergo a separate transcription procedure within infected cells. We performed principal-component analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality. A graph-based clustering approach was implemented over the first 10 PCA dimensions to separate our cell populations into distinct clusters. Manual curation of these clusters was then performed, with clusters combined to reflect the three relevant cell states we found to be present in our samples: uninfected or bystander cells, infected cells producing high levels of IFN, and infected cells producing low levels of IFN. Differentially expressed genes were determined for each cluster via a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, with top markers included in heat maps for the samples at 12 h after infection at MOIs of 2.0 and 0.2. To minimize the effect of rare barcode or sequencing alignment errors, we require a raw UMI count greater than 1 for a gene to be considered expressed. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between viral genes and cellular genes upregulated by viral infection. Viral and cellular genes were then sorted by their median correlation coefficients against the respective gene sets.
