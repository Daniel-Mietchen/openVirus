<p>A549 H2B-mCherry-infected or mock-infected cells were detached from the cell culture plates using trypsin-0.05% EDTA (Gibco), washed with cell culture media, and passed through a 40-μm cell strainer to prepare single-cell suspensions, and the final concentration was set at 1,000 cells/μl. We performed single-cell encapsulation with beads using the 10× Genomics Single Cell 3′ v2 kit and following manufacturer instructions (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). Briefly, a 10× microfluidic chip was loaded to target 5,000 cells. Single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs) were generated, and reverse transcription was performed in the emulsion prior to 12 cycles of cDNA amplification. Quality control and quantification of the amplified cDNA were assessed by Bioanalyzer. Libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each library was tagged with a different index for multiplexing during sequencing. Library quality controls were assessed by Bioanalyzer and quantified by Qubit and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems quantification kit for Illumina platforms). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the following read lengths: 26 bp for Read1 (cell barcode plus UMI), 8 bp for i7 index (sample index), and 98 bp for Read2 (insert).</p>
