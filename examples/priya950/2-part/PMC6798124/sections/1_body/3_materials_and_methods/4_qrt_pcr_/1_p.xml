<p>Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure gene expression levels as previously described (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>), with some modifications. Briefly, RNA isolation was performed using the Agencourt RNAdvance Cell v2 kit (Beckman Coulter). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with AffinityScript Multi-Temp RT (Agilent Technologies). PCR PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase and a SYBR green (Life Technologies)-containing buffer were used for the PCR, which was performed in a thermocycler (ABI7900HT; Applied Biosystems). The RPS11, TUBA1B, and ACTB housekeeping genes were used as internal controls. All samples were run in triplicate and normalized to the median threshold cycle (

  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>) value of the three corrected control genes in each sample, with the value converted to a nominal copy number per cell by assuming 2,500 copies of ACTB mRNA molecules per cell and an amplification efficiency of 93% for all reactions. In the NHBE cell experiment, results were then normalized to the 1-hpi time point of its respective time course and log
