  <p>tSNE visualization, unsupervised clustering analysis, and heat maps showing the most differentially expressed genes identified by single-cell RNA sequencing in mock-infected cultures (A) and infected cultures (C, E, F, and G) at 12 hpi. This clustering strategy resulted in 5 clusters in the mock-infected cultures (A), mostly due to differences in genes associated with cell cycle as shown by a Reactome pathway Database analysis (
   <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (B). The most represented pathways for each cluster (up to 4 per cluster) are depicted (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; cluster 0 analysis did not yield any significant pathway). Some of these genes also mediated clustering in infected cultures, resulting in 6 different clusters at MOIs of 2 and 0.2 (C and F). (D) The 10 most relevant pathways (sorted by 
   <italic>P</italic> value) identified by a Reactome pathway Database analysis of the 111 genes or entities that were differentially expressed between cluster 2 and clusters 0, 1, and 4 of the sample infected at an MOI of 2. (E and G) The three clusters generated after manual curation of the samples infected at MOIs of 2 and 0.2: infected cells producing high levels of IFN (blue), infected cells producing low levels of IFN (green), and mostly uninfected cells (red). The scale of the heat maps shows the gene expression of each gene in each cell relative to the mean expression of that gene across the sample (note that expression levels between different samples cannot be compared, as they are normalized across the cells in each sample).
