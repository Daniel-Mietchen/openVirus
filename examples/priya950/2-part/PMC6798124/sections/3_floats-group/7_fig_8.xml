  <p>Analysis of the functional antiviral response induced by IAV in differentiated NHBE cells using a H1N1/H3N2 coinfection assay. (A) Scheme of the experimental setup and time line. (B) Replication profile of H1N1 (Cal09) infection of NHBE cells. (C and D) Expression of type I and III IFN and ISGs in NHBE cells in cultures infected with the H1N1 IAV or mock infected. (E) Impact of the innate immune response induced by H1N1 IAV infection on the replication of the H3N2 virus. Averages of biological triplicates ± SEMs are shown. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple-comparison test were used. Adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are shown as follows: *, &lt;0.05; **, &lt;0.01; and ***, &lt;0.001. (F) Immunofluorescence assay of H1N1-infected NHBE cells, showing a time course analysis of the progression of viral infection.
