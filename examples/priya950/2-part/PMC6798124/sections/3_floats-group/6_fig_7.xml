  <p>Stimulation of A549 cells with TNF-α, IFN beta, IFNL1 (100 U/ml), or combinations of those cytokines or infected with PR8-GFP (MOI, 2) for 8 h. Induction of IFNL1 was not detected upon stimulation with those cytokines by qRT-PCR. Gene expression of the indicated genes (IFNs, with Mx1 and CCL5 to confirm the effectiveness of the treatments) was analyzed. Averages of biological triplicates ± SDs are shown.</p>
