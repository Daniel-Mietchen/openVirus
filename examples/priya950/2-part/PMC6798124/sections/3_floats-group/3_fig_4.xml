  <p>Distribution of the expression of viral genes (A and B) and their correlation with cellular genes (C). (A) Total viral UMI counts per cell. (B) Cells infected with a higher MOI (i.e., 2) show more elevated levels of viral genes than those infected with a lower MOI (0.2). The ratio of the median UMI count per cell for each MOI is shown at the top of each plot. (C) Heat map showing the correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient) between viral genes and a comprehensive panel of cellular genes. Viral and cellular genes were sorted by their median correlation coefficients against the respective gene sets.</p>
