  <p>(A) Ratio of the log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change mean expression in infected and bystander cells. Genes are sorted by the average value of the log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change of mean expression in infected and bystander cells for the two MOIs. (B) Comparison of the mean UMI count (log
   <sub>2</sub>) of cellular genes in infected and bystander cells for MOIs of 2 and 0.2. Data above the horizontal line indicate increased expression in infected versus uninfected cells. Data below the horizontal line indicate decreased expression in infected versus uninfected cells. (C) Violin plots of normalized UMI count for selected genes at 12 hpi in infected and bystander cell populations at high and low MOIs. Each dot represents a cell. The red line reflects the mean value of normalized UMI count across a cell population. The vertical gray line is a box-and-whisker plot representing the median (white circles), the 25th and 75th percentiles (ends of thicker gray lines), and high and low whiskers at 1.5 times the interquartile range (ends of the thin gray lines). In order to better highlight differences in the cell populations while still including zero values, for the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis, we applied a linear scale for values greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 and a log
   <sub>10</sub> scale for values greater than or equal to 1.
