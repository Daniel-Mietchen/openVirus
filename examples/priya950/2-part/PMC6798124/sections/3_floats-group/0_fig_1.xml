  <p>MOI-dependent temporal expression dynamics of the NS1 protein (PR8-GFP virus) in human respiratory epithelial cells (A549 H2B-mCherry) using time-lapse microscopy. Green indicates NS1 expression (GFP). The cell nuclei (H2B-mcherry) are depicted in red. (A) Time course from 3 to 12 hpi. One representative field is shown for each MOI. (B) Quantification of the number of GFP-positive cells for the four MOIs used (approximately 25,000 cells/well). For MOI of 0.2, 0.6, and 2, averages of two replicate wells ± SDs are shown. For infection at an MOI of 10 and mock infection, data from one single well are shown. (C) Heat map showing the median of fluorescence intensity of the infected cells (GFP+ cells). (D) Table showing the measured percentages of infected cells at 12 hpi, as well as the theoretical percentages of cells infected either with ≥1 virion (all infected cells) or &gt;1 virion (multiple infections).</p>
