The study of global cellular innate immune responses often masks multiple aspects of the mechanisms by which populations of cells work as organized and heterogeneous systems to defeat virus infection, and how the virus counteracts these systems. In this study, we experimentally dissected the dynamics of IAV and human epithelial respiratory cell interaction during early infection at the single-cell level. We found that the number of viruses infecting a cell (multiplicity of infection [MOI]) influences the magnitude of virus antagonism of the host innate antiviral response. Infections performed at high MOIs resulted in increased viral gene expression per cell and stronger antagonist effect than infections at low MOIs. In addition, single-cell patterns of expression of interferons (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) provided important insights into the contributions of the infected and bystander cells to the innate immune responses during infection. Specifically, the expression of multiple ISGs was lower in infected than in bystander cells. In contrast with other IFNs, IFN lambda 1 (IFNL1) showed a widespread pattern of expression, suggesting a different cell-to-cell propagation mechanism more reliant on paracrine signaling. Finally, we measured the dynamics of the antiviral response in primary human epithelial cells, which highlighted the importance of early innate immune responses at inhibiting virus spread.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen of high importance to public health.

Influenza A virus (IAV) targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract for replication. Therefore, it is critical to understand the innate immune mechanisms that protect these cells from infection by IAV. In airway epithelial cells, IAV double-stranded and triphosphorylated RNAs are pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) detected by receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIGI), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Upon PAMP detection, several autocrine signaling pathways are initiated, leading to expression of type I and III interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Engagement of type I and type III IFN to their receptors, IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1-IFNAR2) or IFN lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1-IL10R2), respectively, results in a paracrine response and subsequent activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which have antiviral activity and therefore will protect neighboring cells from viral infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Signaling events downstream of IFNAR1-IFNAR2 and IFNLR1-IL10R2 are highly similar, despite the sequence and structure of these receptors being extremely different (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These events include activation of Janus kinase (JAK) family kinases, phosphorylation and dimerization of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, association between STAT complexes and interferon responsive factor 9 (IRF9) to form interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), and translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA elements to induce ISG expression (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Nevertheless, one important difference which confers distinct functions to the two receptors is their cellular and tissue distributions. While type III IFN signaling is particularly important in the epithelial surfaces of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, liver, or the lining of the blood-brain barrier (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), type I IFN receptor expression in tissues is ubiquitous. In particular, expression of IFNLR1-IL10R2 by respiratory epithelial cells has been shown to be important for antiviral immunity against IAV <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cell culture (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Most of the viruses that infect humans have developed strategies to counteract the innate immune system by diverse mechanisms. One of the best-characterized examples is mediated by IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). It is known that NS1 inhibits the detection of viral RNA by interacting with RIGI (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and with the ubiquitin ligases TRIM25 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and RIPLET (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which leads to reduced IRF3 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation and decreased type I IFN production. NS1 also binds directly to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and sequesters it, preventing recognition and activation of the 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligo(A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and the type I IFN-induced protein kinase RNA activated (PKR) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). NS1 has also been shown to counteract immune cellular responses by interacting with the RNA posttranscriptional processing machinery (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and to promote translation of viral mRNA (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). NS1 is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation by binding to the p85&#x003b2; subunit (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Additionally, the C-terminal tail of H3N2 NS1 was found to act as a histone tail mimic and reduce host transcription (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Other viral components in addition to NS1 may also contribute to viral immune antagonism. For example, the hemagglutinin (HA)-encoding segment of pandemic IAV has been reported to suppress immunogenic cell death (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The PB1-F2 and PB2 viral proteins have been shown to prevent mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) activation and IFN induction (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and the PA-X protein has been reported to degrade cellular mRNA (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, there is a complex interplay between the innate immune responses elicited in the cell and how the virus counteracts this cellular response. Many aspects of the dynamics of the complex interactions that occur after IAV infection are not well understood. In order to better understand these dynamics, we characterized expression patterns of host and viral factors during IAV infection at the single-cell level. For these studies we used human respiratory cells infected with IAV at a low or high multiplicity of infection (MOI). First, time-lapse microscopy experiments showed MOI-dependent expression of NS1 per cell. Next, the single-cell transcriptome analysis also showed MOI-dependent expression of viral genes, with a negative correlation of the levels of the viral NS1 and PA genes with cellular gene expression, and distinct patterns of type I and III IFN and ISG expression in infected versus bystander cells. In addition, we found that type III IFN responses have a component of paracrine induction in epithelial cells. These findings were possible thanks to the use of single-cell transcriptome analysis, which, in contrast to bulk analysis, allowed for the characterization of gene expression profiles in infected versus bystander cells, as well as a stratification of the cellular gene expression according to the levels of the expression of viral genes. Finally, we determined the time scales of the functional antiviral responses during the first two rounds of IAV infection using a staggered IAV H1N1/H3N2 coinfection model in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Temporal dynamics of NS1 IAV expression in epithelial cells.</title><p>The IAV NS1 protein is one of the viral antagonists of host innate immune responses. We first investigated the time scales of NS1 expression during IAV infection by time-lapse microscopy in the A549 human epithelial cell line using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NS1-expressing virus (PR8-GFP) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). A549-H2B-mCherry was used to improve nucleus image segmentation accuracy in live imaging. We infected cells at MOIs of 10, 2, 0.6, and 0.2 and captured images from 3 to 12 h postinfection (hpi), which would mainly correspond to a single cycle of replication (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, with an MOI of 10, cells expressing NS1 were detected as early as 4 hpi. However, as the MOI was reduced, we observed a delay in the detection of expression of NS1, with detection at 5 hpi at an MOI of 2, 6 hpi at an MOI of 0.6, and 7 hpi at an MOI of 0.2. Quantification of the percentage of infected cells in the time-lapse experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. When we measured the median fluorescence intensity per cell in the infected cells (GFP+ cells), we found that a higher MOI was associated with higher levels of NS1 expression per cell at every time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This phenomenon can be explained by the differences in the number of cells infected with multiple infectious viruses, which will decrease with the MOI. According to the Poisson distribution [P(k) = e<sup>&#x02212;MOI</sup>(moi<sup>k</sup>/k!), where k&#x02009;is&#x02009;number of virus particles that infects each cell and P(k) the fraction of cells that receive k particles], in a cell culture exposed to an MOI of 10 virtually all cells would theoretically receive two or more virions, and this number is reduced as the MOI diminishes to less than 2% with an MOI of 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, both earlier and higher NS1 expressions per cell were associated with increasing proportions of cells infected by more than one virus.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>MOI-dependent temporal expression dynamics of the NS1 protein (PR8-GFP virus) in human respiratory epithelial cells (A549 H2B-mCherry) using time-lapse microscopy.

Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA expression profiling (10&#x000d7; Genomics) in the same A549/PR8-GFP system using an MOI of 2, at which around 59% of the cells should be subjected to infections with more than one virus, and an MOI of 0.2, which should result in a low percentage of cells infected by more than one virus (&#x0223c;2%). First, we identified the genes that showed the largest fold increase in mean expression (normalized unique molecular identifier [UMI] counts) across all cells in the infected versus the mock-infected cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

At 12 hpi, for each MOI, we initially identified five clusters in the mock-infected cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and six clusters in the IAV-infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). However, by comparing the differentially expressed genes among the 5 clusters in mock-infected cultures and subsequent pathway analysis using a Reactome Pathway Database tool (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), we found that this phenomenon was mostly due to genes involved in cell cycle. Part of the clustering identified in the mock-infected cultures also mediated the clustering in the infected cultures (heat maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). For instance, at an MOI of 2, cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) seemed to show a clear separation from clusters 0, 1, and 4 and had 111 genes that were differentially expressed than in those clusters. A pathway analysis of those genes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) identified that the main pathways represented were associated with cell cycle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Therefore, in order to extract the information relevant to this study, we collapsed some of these clusters according to the expression of viral genes and genes associated with the innate immune response. As a result, we defined three new clusters for each MOI as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>. For both MOIs, the red cluster is composed mostly of cells showing undetectable or low levels of viral mRNA expression. The green and blue clusters showed expression of viral genes; therefore, they are composed mostly of infected cells. Cells in the blue cluster (also for both MOIs) showed higher expression of type I and type III IFNs as well as chemokines such as CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>, bottom sections of the heat maps) than the green cluster and, as expected, than the red cluster (which is mostly composed of bystander cells). Interestingly, at an MOI of 2, cells belonging to the blue cluster clearly showed lower expression of viral genes, suggesting that they might experience a lower antagonist effect leading to a higher IFN production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Another interesting observation was that the red cluster showed overall higher expression of ISGs such as IFIT1, IFI27, and IFITM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, top section of the left heat map) than the infected cells. A similar pattern was found at an MOI of 0.2. However, at this MOI we did not find clear differences in the expression of viral genes between the blue (cells producing high levels of IFN) and the green clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Cells infected for 4 h showed profiles very similar to those of mock-infected cells, with the exception of the presence of low numbers of infected cells and few innate immune genes as differentially expressed genes at an MOI of 2 (data not shown).

At 12 h, there was a clear gap in the detection of viral RNAs between bystander cells (0 viral UMI) and infected cells (over 648 and 349 at 2 and 0.2 MOI, respectively), which allowed for better differentiation between these two groups in the culture in subsequent analyses. Approximately 86% and 20% of infected cells were identified at MOIs of 2 and 0.2, respectively, at 12 hpi. Next, we analyzed the levels of the different IAV genes per infected cell.

We analyzed the correlation between the viral and cellular transcripts that we found to be upregulated during IAV infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, we observed that at the high MOI, most of the viral genes had a negative correlation with cellular genes, with the exception of the NP and HA genes. At an MOI of 0.2, only the NS and PA genes showed a negative correlation with most of the cellular genes. In both cases, the viral genes that showed the strongest negative correlation with cellular genes were the NS and PA genes, supporting the conclusion that viral proteins encoded by these genes might have an important function as negative regulators of transcription of cellular genes. This effect is more evident with an elevated MOI, due to high levels of expression of viral genes per infected cell. Interestingly, the NS gene encodes the known innate immune antagonist NS1 protein, while the PA gene encodes the PA protein, which is part of the polymerase complex, and the PA-X protein and is also known to repress cellular gene expression (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).

The ratio of the expression of the top upregulated genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> between infected and bystander cells was calculated (log<sub>2</sub> fold change of the mean UMI count per cell in infected over bystander cells) and sorted according to the average of the results for the two MOIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also selected and included in this panel 10 additional genes that were upregulated over mock-infected cultures and had the lowest ratio between infected and bystander cells (log<sub>2</sub> fold change of the mean UMI count per cell in infected over bystander cells). There was a consistent pattern of expression across all genes, where a lower ratio between infected and bystander cells was found at the high MOI than at the low MOI. In addition, a gradient in the ratio of the expression of those genes between infected and bystander cells was observed at both MOIs. Visualization of the expression of those genes (log<sub>2</sub> UMI mean) in infected and bystander cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) indicated that this pattern is probably due to a combination of different mechanisms of gene activation and different levels of susceptibility to virus antagonism. Genes depicted toward the left axes of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> showed expression in infected cells that was similar to or lower than in bystander cells, consistent with a paracrine mechanism of activation, as known for most of the ISGs. Frequently, the expression of these genes, such as the BST2 (tetherin), TRIM22, OAS2, IFI27, and IFITM2 genes, was lower in infected cells than in bystander cells, with this effect being more evident at the MOI of 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). As an example, detailed data for BTS2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>. Genes positioned toward the right axis of these plots had greater expression levels in infected than in bystander cells. Most of these genes are known to be induced in an autocrine manner, such as the genes for type I and III IFNs and chemokines such as CCL5 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), interleukin 6 (IL-6) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and CXCL10 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, we found several ISGs, such as IFIT2, RSAD2 (or viperin), OASL, and IFIH1 (or MDA5), that were expressed at higher levels in infected versus bystander cells, suggesting that in addition to being induced upon IFN signaling, they can also be strongly induced directly upon viral sensing in an autocrine manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of these four genes was already detected at 4 hpi at both MOIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Detailed data for IFIT2 and IFNB1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> as a representative example of increased expression in infected versus bystander cells.

In order to address the magnitude and timing of the antiviral response induced in bystander cells during IAV infection at a low MOI using primary human respiratory epithelial cells, we established a model of staggered IAV H1N1/H3N2 coinfections in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells in an air-liquid interface (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Using two similar, but distinguishable, viruses to infect cell monolayers at different times allows the analysis of how the antiviral response induced after the first infection affects subsequent infection by the second virus. The design of the experimental protocol is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>. First, we infected NHBE cells with the H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009 at an MOI of 0.05, and then we characterized profiles of gene expression and virus replication throughout a 48-h time course. Using plaque assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), we established that the initial release of H1N1 infectious particles was detected at 12 hpi, peaked at 24 to 36 hpi, and declined after 48 hpi. We next analyzed the kinetics of expression of a comprehensive panel of innate immunity-associated genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Notably, we detected early upregulation of IFNB1, at around 4 hpi, as well as upregulation of IFNL1, IFNL2, and IFNL3, while changes in IFNA expression remained undetected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). Interestingly, ISGs, including IFIT2, CXCL10, RIGI, and Mx1, were also detected very early after infection (4 to 12 hpi [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>]).

Washes from the apical chamber were collected to assess viral replication at 1, 12, 24, and 48 h after H3N2 infection. The viral titers (PFU) measured after H3N2 infection correspond with H3N2 replication only, since the anti-H1 antibody restricts infections with H1N1 viruses. We used changes in those H3N2 titers as an indicator of the functional antiviral response induced by the previously added H1N1 virus. As both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were added at a low MOI, numbers of coinfections were negligible. Control experiments demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody 7B2 inhibited H1N1 replication as measured by plaque assay and immunostaining (data not shown). Thus, in this experiment we measured levels of H3N2 replication in bystander cells exposed to paracrine effects from H1N1-infected cells. Analysis of the impact of the innate immune response induced by the initial H1N1 IAV infection on the replication of the subsequently added H3N2 virus showed that adding the H3N2 virus at 2 or 4 hpi resulted in a replication profile very similar to that obtained with the H3N2 single infection. Interestingly, we found a significant decrease in the H3N2 replication titers (48 h post-H3N2 infection) when this virus was added as early as 8 and 12 h post-H1N1 IAV infection. As expected, we observed a greater reduction of the H3N2 IAV replication as the time of addition post-H1N1 IAV infection increased to 24 h or 48 h. To confirm that after infection with the H1N1 virus there was still a sufficiently large number of uninfected cells that could be potentially infected by the H3N2 virus, we performed immunofluorescence staining of NHBE cells infected by H1N1 under the same conditions. Visualization and quantification of complete wells indicated the presence of 1.23% &#x000b1; 1.32%, 3.2% &#x000b1; 1.37%, and 6.01% &#x000b1; 3.00% infected cells at 12, 24, and 48 hpi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>), indicating that most cells were available for infection upon exposure to the second virus. Therefore, these data indicate that early IFN responses elicited during initial viral infection are effective as early as 8 to 12 hpi and are critical for a functional antiviral response in bystander cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The innate immune response is one of the first mechanisms of host defense against viral infections. In order to successfully establish infection in humans, viruses such as IAV have developed strategies to counteract this system. While extensive research on the genes involved in antiviral responses and on IAV antagonism has been performed, the global virus-host interaction and its consequences at the individual cell level are still not well understood. In this study, we performed a deep analysis of these interactions and their functional consequences in respiratory epithelial cells, which are main targets of IAV replication.</p><p>Our analysis of the dynamics of NS1 expression showed an MOI-dependent expression of this important innate immune antagonist protein in infected cells. Similarly, we found that the levels of all IAV genes per infected cell were more elevated when cells were exposed to a high MOI than to a low MOI, most likely due to differences in the numbers of cells being initially infected with multiple virions. Under physiological conditions, the first round of infection of the respiratory epithelia by IAV would be mediated by a few virus particles, so probably infected host cells receive only one infectious virus. This is consistent with the very low number of viruses shown to be responsible for initation of infection in ferrets (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, as infection progresses, infection of neighboring cells is likely mediated by more than one virus originating from the infected cells, with lower numbers of viruses reaching cells farther away from the initially infected cells. Thus, we expect to find both single-virus- and multiple-virus-infected cells during human IAV infections. Interestingly, as found by a correlation analysis of the viral genes versus a panel of innate immune genes, NS shows a consistent negative correlation with the transcription of most of the innate immune genes. This negative correlation is clearly more enhanced in cells infected with multiple viruses (high MOI) than in those infected with single viruses (low MOI), suggesting that the number of virions that infect each individual cell has important consequences for the ability of the virus to counteract the innate immune response in that cell (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that viral IFN antagonism might be less effective during the initial stages of infection in the context of humans infected with a virus, when cells are impacted by single virus particles. During viral infection, the concentration of viral particles released grows exponentially, reaching levels up to 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>)/ml (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). At this level of replication in the respiratory tract tissue, it is highly probable that many cells get infected with multiple viruses, which would enhance the ability of IAV to suppress the innate immune response <italic>in vivo</italic> and at the same time favor the reassortment of IAV genes, an important evolutionary force for IAV.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 9</label><caption><p>Model of the interplay between IAV and innate immunity in epithelial cells during infection with individual virus particles (left) versus multiple virus particles per cell (right).

One of the best characterized is its ability to inhibit virus sensing by RIGI, either by sequestering dsRNA or by direct interaction with RIGI or TRIM25 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Related to this, we found IFNB1, all type III IFNs, and other cytokines and chemokines among the genes that correlated negatively with the levels of NS at the high MOI. However, we found that gene expression was affected at a general level, suggesting a global inhibition of the transcription of the innate immune genes. Also, when we compared the gene expression profiles in infected versus bystander cells, we found a group of genes, presumably induced in a paracrine manner, that were expressed at lower levels in infected than in bystander cells, probably due to virus transcriptional antagonism. While a combination of viral factors could be responsible for this global shutoff of host transcription, our data suggest that NS1 might be associated with this phenomenon. There is evidence in the literature that IAV infection results in reduced host transcription and mRNA processing by inhibiting the host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Related to this, a recent study found that several strains of IAV elicit global deregulation of Poll II transcription termination by impairing 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and termination, and this effect was dependent on NS1 expression (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). These studies could partially explain the global negative correlation that we found between viral genes and cellular genes. NS1 interactome studies have identified multiple additional interactions of NS1 with nuclear proteins (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), which could also have a global effect on cellular transcription. In addition, another study that used a combination of modeling and experimental research found that ISGs are specifically suppressed in IAV-infected dendritic cells through the inhibition of multiple transcription factors (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). The second viral gene that showed the strongest negative correlation with host genes in our analysis was PA. Interestingly, in addition to encoding one subunit of the IAV polymerase, it has a second open reading frame accessed by ribosomal frameshifting that results in the expression of the protein known as PA-X (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). PA-X inhibits transcription of cellular genes by selectively targeting host Pol II transcribed mRNAs (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the global negative correlation is a consequence of the expression of NS1 and PA-X in infected cells. Further investigation will determine if this effect is similar for other IAV strains or if it is strain specific, which will shed light into possible unknown mechanisms for virus-mediated host transcription inhibition.</p><p>The interaction between virus infection and the host response was further characterized in our study by comparing the gene expression profiles in infected and in bystander cells. Several genes, including the IFIT2, OASL and RSAD2 (also known as viperin) genes, with known antiviral activity (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), and IFIH1 or MDA5, which contributes to viral sensing (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), showed higher expression in infected versus bystander cells, suggesting that these ISGs, in addition to being inducible by type I or III IFN, have also an autocrine component of activation. Indeed, the induction of some ISGs was detected as early as 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), with such an early upregulation consistent with direct induction by viral infection. This is in contrast to the highly accepted concept that type I or type III IFN signaling is necessary for the induction of antiviral genes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), with a few exceptions such as ISG15 and CXCL10 (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The well-described mechanism of activation of transcription of ISGs upon type I/III IFN induction involves assembly and translocation to the nucleus of ISGF3, which binds to the DNA sequences in the promoters of ISGs known as interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Interestingly, Daly and Reich found two complexes in addition to ISGF3, interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) and the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, which could recognize ISRE sequences and activate transcription upon dsRNA stimulation in the absence of IFN (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). The abilities of these transcription factors to interact with ISRE differ among various ISGs, due to variations in their DNA sequences. A later study identified IFIT2, ISG15, IFIT3, IFIT1, and GBP1 as IRF3 target genes (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). With the exception of these highly informative studies, literature in this specific topic is scarce. Therefore, direct induction of ISGs in infected cells might be an important player in promoting effective early antiviral responses.</p><p>The analysis of the distribution of expression of type I and III IFNs also provided very interesting observations. First, consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), only a small population of infected cells produced high levels of IFN. NS1 protein could differentially inhibit the IFN response across the infected cells in the culture according to the NS1 intracellular levels, which could be determined by the number of virions infecting the cells. Related to this, at the MOI of 2 we found that the cluster of cells expressing IFN at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) presented lower levels of the NS gene than the rest of the infected cells. Another possibility is the presence of low levels of defective interfering (DI) particles in the virus stock, which are known to be strong inducers of IFN (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). While virus stocks were carefully prepared to avoid the presence of DI particles, some presence of them cannot be ruled out. However, if a large deletion is present in one segment of a virus, mRNA for the proteins that segment encodes would not be successfully transcribed in the cell infected by that virus. Related to this, we found that at MOIs of 2 and 0.2, 100% and 99.9% of the infected cells, respectively, presented all the different RNA transcripts from the virus, suggesting a low probability for the presence of DI particles in the virus stock. Interestingly, a recent study that used an elegant approach to perform combined cellular and viral single-cell RNA sequencing in IAV-infected A549 cells found that increased proportions of viral defects or mutations, and specifically defects or deletions in NS, were highly associated with increased expression of IFN among infected cells (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p><p>Our single-cell sequencing data also showed that while the expression of most of the type I or III IFN is restricted to that small cell population, IFNL1 is more widespread, since it is expressed by most of the infected cells and also in the bystander cells, albeit to lower levels. The mechanism for IFNL1 induction in bystander cells is consistent with a paracrine response involving host factors secreted from virus-infected cells. Interestingly, Ank et al. (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) found that HepG2 cells (a human liver carcinoma cell line) showed upregulated expression of IFNL1 and IFNL2/3 upon treatment with either type I or type III IFN. However, in our study we did not detect induction of IFNL1 by those cytokines in A549 cells. These different results could be a consequence of the different cell types used in their study or of limits of detection. While human type I and type III IFNs are known to be induced by direct virus infection by similar transcription factors, their promoters are significantly different. There are 13 subtypes of human IFNA genes, and they are regulated by IRF3 and IRF7, which bind a cluster of transcription sites in the promoters with different affinities (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). However, the regulation of expression of IFNB1 is more tightly regulated by the coordinated binding of multiple complexes of transcription factors, specifically IRF3/IRF7, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and activator protein 1 (AP1), to the positive regulatory domains (PRD) of the enhanceosome (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). The type III IFN has been more recently described, given its later discovery (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Human IFNL2 and IFNL3 are almost identical and have highly similar promoters (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). IFNL4 is expressed in only a fraction of the human population, due to a widespread genetic polymorphism introducing a 5&#x02032;-proximal frameshift (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). All IFNL promoters have binding sites for NF-&#x003ba;B and for IRF3/7, with some differences among them. In general, the literature suggests that IFNL promoters are more flexible than the type I IFN promoter (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which agrees with the broader distribution of type III IFN found in our study, and that NF-&#x003ba;B plays an important role in its activation. IFNL1 regulation is very divergent from IFNL2/3 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). IFNL1 has a distal cluster of NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites upstream of the promoter, and engagement of these sites by NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors is enough to activate its expression (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Additionally, IFNL1 promoter can be activated by IRF and NF-&#x003ba;B factors independently through the separated elements, although engagement of both is necessary for the highest levels of expression (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Therefore, the paracrine induction of IFNL1 could be due to its promoter organization, which is unique among the rest of the type I or type III IFNs. Alternatively, additional binding sites for transcription factors yet unidentified could be present in the IFNL1 promoter, which could contribute to the unexpected paracrine induction of this gene. The broad expression of IFNL1 suggests a possible mechanism of amplification of the antiviral response in IFNLR1-IL10R2-expressing tissues, such as the respiratory epithelium, during IAV infections.</p><p>Our study also highlights the appropriateness of single-cell transcriptome analyses to better understand the processes governing virus-host interactions. In this study, this technology allowed for the identification of patterns of expression of IFN genes and ISGs in infected cultures, suggesting that the ability of a cell to secrete IFN and the degree of their antiviral capacity are associated with multiple factors, such as their infection state and the levels of the expression of viral genes. These issues cannot be addressed by the use of bulk analysis. Given the recent development of this type of technology, only a few studies have been reported to date applying them to IAV infection. Two recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on the heterogeneity of viral transcripts during IAV infection in epithelial cells and on the characterization of virus species triggering the immune response (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). In these studies, very low induction of the expression of innate immune genes was found, probably due to the use of a low MOI, which minimized the presence of coinfections as required by the type of questions addressed. An interesting <italic>in vivo</italic> study also addressed similar questions but focused mostly on the heterogeneity of infection and innate immune responses across multiple cell types (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>We also find that early innate immune responses developed after IAV infection at low MOIs are efficient at inhibiting subsequent infection of bystander cells. If the virus overcomes this first barrier and propagates in the tissue by multiple viruses infecting the same cells, the virus would more efficiently block the innate immune response in infected cells and hypothetically could replicate more efficiently as infection progresses. Therefore, this report provides insights into how the dynamics of the interplay of IAV immune antagonism and innate immune response can change as the number of viruses infecting single cells increases in the respiratory epithilium after the early stages of infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cell culture.</title><p>Human adenocarcinoma A549 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) and minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; VWR), <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).</p><p>Improvement of cell nucleus segmentation for microscopy and image processing was achieved with the generation of A549 cells stably expressing an mCherry fluorescent protein-fused histone H2B (A549 H2B-mCherry cells).
