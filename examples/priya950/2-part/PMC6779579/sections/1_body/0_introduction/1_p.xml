<p>Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonosis worldwide. The incidence of human leptospirosis, as a nationally notifiable disease, has decreased in recent years in the Korea, although the outbreaks of the disease were a serious public health challenge in the 1980s. While sporadic leptospirosis cases have occurred annually in endemic areas, concern about potential epidemics remains because of the persistence of animal leptospiral carriers as natural reservoirs, people at risk, and favorable environmental and climate conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the literature on our existing knowledge and experience for recognition, identification, and infection control of human leptospirosis in the Korea would be able to take advantages for the future challenges.</p>
