<p>Differential diagnosis of leptospirosis from other febrile illnesses common during fall was difficult due to nonspecific clinical symptoms, and many people infected might be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Farmers were often financially unstable, and the disease occurred in the busiest season of harvesting, which may prevent them from seeking medical attention. Therefore, a prospective nationwide seroepidemiological investigation was performed to determine symptomatic and asymptomatic infections occurring among the patients who visited the hospitals. Six university hospitals in Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungbuk, Gyeongsang, and Jeonnam Provinces as well as Shinchon Hospital, Cheongju Hospital, Korean Armed Forces Capital Hospital, and Seoul National University Hospital, formed a collaborative network in 1985. Bacterial cultures and serological tests were taken from 1,313 patients with suspected leptospirosis, resulting in diagnoses of leptospirosis in 264 cases. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients were analyzed to confirm the timing and national distribution of infection, followed by surveys to determine the risk factors, including occupation, outdoor activities, and other environmental conditions.</p>
