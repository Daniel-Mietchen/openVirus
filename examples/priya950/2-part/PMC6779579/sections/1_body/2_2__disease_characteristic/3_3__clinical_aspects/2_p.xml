<p>In the Korea, the earlier description of the diseases before the causative agent was not identified focused on pulmonary manifestations titled as “hemorrhagic pneumonitis-like disease” or “epidemic pulmonary hemorrhagic fever”; patients often showed dyspnea, hemoptysis, or blood-tinged sputum, and severe cases died of asphyxiation due to massive hemoptysis from pulmonary hemorrhage and acute respiratory failure within 4 days. Although many patients recovered without sequelae, studies included more severe cases with pulmonary involvement reported a higher case fatality (average of 15.2%) [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; lung infiltration either bilateral or more prominent on the right; more prominent on the lateral lung fields; diffuse interstitial infiltrations or alveolar lesions. The chest X-ray findings worsened on day 3, as was the case for clinical symptoms; further worsened within several hours or 1–2 days; and peaked within 5–6 days. The pulmonary findings then improved rapidly like pulmonary edema, which was a clear difference from other types of pneumonia [

Since the late 1990s, leptospirosis has regained attention as an emerging infectious disease in several countries, and severe pulmonary form of leptospirosis (SPFL) in epidemic or sporadic cases has also been reported in Brazil, Nicaragua, Thailand, India, and Seychelles [

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. SPFL may appear in both anicteric and icteric leptospirosis. Even after 2000, sporadic cases of SPFL continued to occur in the endemic areas in the Korea [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the meantime, the pulmonary involvement was observed in many areas, caused by various serovars, therefore, it is not a serovar-specific [
