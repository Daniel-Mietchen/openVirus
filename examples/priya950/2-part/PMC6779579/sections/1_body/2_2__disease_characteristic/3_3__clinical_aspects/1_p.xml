<p>Leptospirosis shows various clinical manifestations, ranging from mild flu-like illness to fatal Weil's disease. Clinical severity depends on virulence of the serovar causing the infection, the size of bacterial inoculum into the body, the host susceptibility, and the organs involved. Even cases caused by an identical serovar may show different clinical manifestations by the region. Therefore, the term “serovar-specific syndrome” is no longer used. Clinical course of leptospirosis may show a biphasic pattern comprising the leptospiremic and immune phases. In the leptospiremic phase, leptospires are present in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and most other tissues, causing flu-like illness (high fever, headache, conjunctival edema, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting) for 4–7 days. When the disease enters the immune phase following 1–2 afebrile days, the patients show fever, accompanied by meningeal symptoms, uveitis, and myalgia. In general, 90% of patients develop mild anicteric infections and recover spontaneously, whereas 5%–10% progress to Weil's disease [
