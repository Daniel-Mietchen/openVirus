<p>Wild rats are known to be the most important reservoir for leptospirosis, and other domestic animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle, are also known as reservoirs. As anti-leptospiral antibodies existed in dogs, cattle, and pigs in Korea, it is likely that animals have acted as reservoirs of leptospires for a very long time [
