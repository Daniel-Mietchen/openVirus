<p>During the initial stage of serovar identification, the researchers in KNIH performed CAAT for 15 strains isolated in 1985 (11 from patients and 4 from rats) using 17 reference strains and their respective antisera obtained from the American CDC, Japanese NIH, and Ehime University. HM3 and HV8 strains were initially reported as serogroup 
 <italic>icterohaemorrhagica</italic> serovar Mwogolo, and HS7 as serogroup 
 <italic>canicola</italic> serovar Canicola, respectively. The remaining strains were found to be similar to Mwogolo or Birkini or could not be clearly identified [

In the meantime, MJ Kim reported that three strains isolated from patients in Yeoju (HY-1, HY-2, and HY-10) were clearly different from serovar Mwogolo or Birkini in analyses using shiromizu, RGA, and smithi monoclonal antibodies produced by Kobayashi in Japan [

Subsequently, Jang et al. compared the DNA restriction fragments of 21 Korean isolates belonging to the icterhemorrhagiae serogroup and reported that they showed a restriction fragment pattern identical to serovar Lai isolated from China, except a band of difference caused by a point mutation [

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Cho et al. also analyzed the serovars of 24 strains isolated from patients and 68 strains isolated from rats using CAAT and the monoclonal antibody assay. They reported that most strains were serovar Lai and 5 strains, including HM-3 and 18R, may be new serovars [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In conclusion, Oh et al. successfully proved that HM3 and 18R were new serovars, named as serovar Yeonchon and serovar Hongchon; these serovars were internationally registered as new serovars [
