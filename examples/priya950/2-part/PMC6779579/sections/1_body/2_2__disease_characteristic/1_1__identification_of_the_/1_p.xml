 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, belonging to the family 
 <italic>Leptospiraceae</italic>, is a thin (width: 0.1 μm, length: 6 - 20 μm) and coiled aerobic 
 <italic>Spirocheta</italic>. Leptospires can be observed under the dark-field microscope or phase-contrast microscope. Its end is hooked, and is extremely active motility when bent or rotating. Leptospires requires specialized media for culture and takes several weeks to months to grow. The genus 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> is characterized by antigenic and genetic heterogeneity and can be further classified genetically according to phylogeny and virulence or serologically. Serovar is defined as a leptospire whose homologous rabbit antiserum agglutinates it, but cannot be defined to a single isolate [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Serovar identification of isolated leptospires in a given region is necessary for development of diagnostic reagents and vaccines and is vital for research on changes in antigenicity or pathogenicity. When the cross-agglutination absorption test (CAAT) of two strains shows significant differences in antigen (residual titer &gt;10%), they belong to different serovars [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Standard strains represent each serovar, and more than 250 serovars were found in 26 serogroups. Since CAAT takes a great deal of time and effort, it is limited for timely identification and epidemiological investigation of strains causing epidemics, and the test may also fail to show subtle but important antigenic differences between strains. Since the early 1980s, relatively quick and accurate tests, such as antigen agglutination assay using monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and restriction enzyme DNA analysis, have been available to complement CAAT [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
