<p>Twenty-five years after the Korean War, in October 1975, there was an epidemic of “hemorrhagic pneumonitis-like disease” or “epidemic pulmonary hemorrhagic fever” of unknown etiology in the central part of the Korea, particularly in Yeoju and Icheon in the Gyeonggi Province. The ill people showed fever, cough, and hemoptysis, and some of them died with rapid progression of symptoms. As reported to public health authorities as well as across mass media, the epidemic became a social issue and gained academic attention. Subsequent cases occurred in Chungbuk Province, Paju in Gyeonggi Province, and army bases in Gangwon Province. Accordingly, the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases (KSID) held a symposium on this epidemic of pneumonitis-like disease of unknown etiology at the 14th annual conference on November 29, 1975, presenting the epidemiological investigation and patterns, clinical pictures and progression, X-ray findings, and autopsy and pathological findings of the disease. The Korean Medical Association (KMA) also held a panel discussion on the “epidemic of pneumonitis-like disease from the year's fall” on December 1, 1975 to understand the specifics of the epidemic [

Based on the epidemiological investigation conducted in 121 patients in Yeoju and Icheon in Gyeonggi Province, many cases occurred during the rice harvesting seasons, and the majority of them were young men (n = 108, 89.3%) working in agriculture (n = 114, 94.2%). Many patients performed rice reaping (n = 101, 83.5%) and threshing (n = 95, 78.5%), and some cases worked for more than 10 hours per day (n = 71, 58.7% and n = 64, 38.0%, respectively). The case fatality rate of 5.7% (n = 7) was lower compared to 17% reported to public health centers. Cases developed mild to severe symptoms. While most patients complained of fever and chills, headache, and malaise, more than half cases had cough, myalgia, and hemoptysis. The illness lasted for 3–10 days [

The autopsy findings of four patients aged 21 - 24 years who died of hemoptysis indicated systemic infection characterized by cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, adrenal, gastric, and cerebral hemorrhage and monocyte infiltrations, especially with hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia [

There was no person-to-person transmission within groups, alternatively considering for investigation of environmental hygiene in the involved areas. Therefore, multiple speculations were made regarding the cause of this disease, such as pesticide poisoning, pulmonary allergic condition, and idiopathic viral pneumonia; however, the etiology of the disease remained undetermined. Two studies reported later in February 1980 that the disease had occurred every year before as well as after the epidemic in 1975, on the basis of a retrospective review of patients admitted to Wonju Presbyterian Hospital [
