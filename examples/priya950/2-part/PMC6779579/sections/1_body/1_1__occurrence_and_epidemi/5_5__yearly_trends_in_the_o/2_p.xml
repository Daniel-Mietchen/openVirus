<p>Since serological diagnosis of leptospirosis was available at the KNIH in 1985, approximately 200 cases (only some cases were confirmed serologically) in 1984, 264 cases in 1985, and 50 cases in 1986 were estimated based on the results of the microscopic agglutination test. In 1987, 562 cases were reported mostly from Jeonnam and Jeonbuk Provinces affected in the large epidemic. The reported cases then decreased significantly after 1991 [

In a surveillance system constructed in the Yangpyeong Gun (county level) in Gyeonggi Province by Choi et al., the attack rate of leptospirosis from September to December, 1989 was 1.12 - 3.35 per 10,000 people in 1989, and increased to 3.63 - 9.85 per 10,000 people (projected to the population of the county) in 1990 following a flood. This study indicated that the incidence rates revealed approximately 50-fold higher than the number of cases reported nationally [
