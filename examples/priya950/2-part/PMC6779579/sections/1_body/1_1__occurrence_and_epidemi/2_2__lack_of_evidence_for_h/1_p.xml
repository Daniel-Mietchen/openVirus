<p>Historically, the presence of leptospirosis in Korea had long been a subject of debate before the liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation in 1945. Although a case with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> isolation from blood was reported in Japanese literature, which was not accepted by the medical society at that time, due to lack of serological test and animal experiment. In the period of Korean War (1951 â€“ 1952), there were the number of cases of Korean hemorrhagic fever and infectious hepatitis occurred. Korean and American medical scientists studied extensively on leptospirosis for those with fever, jaundice, and hemorrhagic manifestation, but failed to prove the presence of the disease. Several 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains were isolated from house rats in Busan (a temporary capital city during the Korean War) and wild rats (
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic>) in the Demilitarized Zone. Two leptospiral isolates were serologically very close to 
 <italic>L. icterohaemorrhagica</italic> [
