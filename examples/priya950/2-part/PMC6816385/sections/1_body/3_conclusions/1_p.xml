<p>The application of mPTP to the HCV and HBV data sets shows that automated viral species delimitation using phylogeny-aware methods yields clusters that largely agree with the current standard taxonomy. The additional clusters identified for HCV by mPTP is not surprising as they have been previously considered divergent sub-clusters within the genotypes 3 and 6. Analogously, for HBV, mPTP yielded almost identical results to the current nomenclature system with the exception of a single sub-genotype, C4, that was previously mentioned to be more genetically divergent within genotype C (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Paraskevis et al., 2013</xref>). In both cases, these new clusters indicate the potential need for taxonomic revision. However, given the wide use of the current nomenclature in the medical field, and the lack of other sources of information such as recombination, particularly for HBV, and, response to treatment, we wouldnâ€™t suggest taxonomic changes at present. Regarding distance methods, the example of HCV and HBV, shows that meaningful parameter values for distance-based methods may differ substantially among datasets, and, therefore, establishing global thresholds is impossible. On the contrary, mPTP can be seamlessly applied to taxa of substantially different life histories (e.g., variable population sizes, evolution rates), as it does not require any input parameters except a phylogeny. Overall, the ease-of-use of mPTP in conjunction with its computational efficiency on phylogenies with hundreds of samples render it a useful tool for viral biodiversity estimates, initial classification of understudied taxa, and accelerating the viral species identification process.
