<p>In the case of HBV, the mPTP clustering is almost identical to the current classification (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Norder et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Kramvis &amp; Kew, 2007</xref>) of the virus that comprises eight genotypes, except for subgenotype C4 which formed a new cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Figs. S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">S4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Appendix S1</xref>). This is in line with the greater genetic divergence of C4 compared to the other subgenotypes due to its ancient origin in native populations in Oceania (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Paraskevis et al., 2013</xref>). However, the split of C4 from its sister cluster (genotype C) is not supported by the MCMC sampling, potentially reflecting the lack of adequate sampling. On the other hand, the number of clusters identified by ABGD varied from 1 to 85 under different thresholds of minimum intraspecific divergence, while the delimitation for a threshold of 1.29% exactly matched the eight genotypes of the HBV classification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3</xref>). Both ABGD and mPTP identified seven of the genotypes (Aâ€“F) as distinct genetic clusters. The only difference was that mPTP split genotype C into two distinct clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>), i.e., subgenotype C4 was recovered as a distinct cluster from the remaining seven subgenotype.
