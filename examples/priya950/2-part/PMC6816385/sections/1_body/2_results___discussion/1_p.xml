<p>The biodiversity of viruses is tremendous and it is broadly accepted that our understanding of their ecology and evolution is constrained to a small fraction of species (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Paez-Espino et al., 2016</xref>). In just a kilo of marine sediment there can be a million of different viral genotypes (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Breitbart &amp; Rohwer, 2005</xref>), while on a global scale the number of viruses is 10 million-fold higher than the number of stars in the universe (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Suttle, 2013</xref>). The classification of such a diverse set of organisms constitutes a challenging task and is impossible to accomplish within reasonable time using phenotypic characters. Quantitative computational methods could provide a viable alternative, particularly for large scale clustering and fast identification of viral strains (

 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Modha et al., 2018</xref>). Using empirical data of the HBV and HCV viruses we show that by applying phylogeny-aware and distance-based tools to classify the strains of the two virus types, the corresponding genetic clustering closely recovers their currently accepted taxonomy.
