<p>The number of clusters inferred with ABGD ranged from 1 to 208 depending on the value of the maximum intraspecific divergence threshold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). The most reasonable result (i.e., the one closest to the current standard taxonomy) comprised 19 clusters and was obtained for a minimum of intraspecific genetic diversity of 5.99% (i.e., 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0599). Under this threshold, the delimitation is largely identical to the delimitation obtained with mPTP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), with three differences: (i) that genotype 3 was split into four clusters, instead of three, (ii) genotype six was divided into nine clusters instead of eight, and, (iii) genotype 7 is divided into two clusters. When the prior intraspecific divergence was increased to a higher minimum of 10%, all sequences were grouped in a single cluster. When the threshold was set to a lower value (3.6%) the number of clusters increased to 135 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the delimitation with the 5.99% threshold is largely congruent to current taxonomy and the clusters obtained with mPTP, thus indicating the usefulness of distance-based methods in virus taxonomy under well informed parameters.
