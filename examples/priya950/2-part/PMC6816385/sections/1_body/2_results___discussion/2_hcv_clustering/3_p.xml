<p>So far, the classification of HCV into genotypes and subtypes has been defined mostly by visual identification of clades in phylogenetic inference of HCV sequences (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the genotypes correspond to the seven major highly-supported phylogenetic HCV clusters while subtypes were defined as the secondary hierarchical clusters found within each genotype (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). This classification scheme has been widely adopted (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Combet et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Yusim et al., 2016</xref>) and has been shown to be robust (in terms of stability of the HCV phylogeny) and relevant for clinical practice, since response rates to immunomodulatory treatment for the chronic hepatitis C differs across genotypes. Nevertheless, new, unassigned lineages are often discovered from understudied areas (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Sulbaran et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2015</xref>) and it is challenging to assign them a taxonomic status, given that the genetic distance cut-off among intra and inter-specific relationships is arbitrary and variable for different parts of the HCV phylogeny (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et al., 2005</xref>). The greatly overlapping mPTP and ABGD clusters with the HCV genotypes shows that the classification, and, consequently, the identification, of the genotypes can be easily automated utilizing objective, transparent, and unifying approaches. Embracing such alternatives can be crucial for viruses like HCV, taking into account that the correct identification of the HCV genotypes could be of clinical importance in providing the appropriate medical treatment (

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2009</xref>).
