<p>In this study, we explore whether a recently developed algorithm for molecular species delimitation on barcoding or marker gene phylogenies can be deployed for ICTV. In contrast to genetic distance-based methods the multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP, 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kapli et al., 2017</xref>) infers the number of genetic clusters given a phylogenetic input tree. Such trees can easily be inferred using both, Maximum Likelihood (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>), or Bayesian approaches (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>) on single-gene or multi-gene multiple sequence alignments. The fundamental assumption of the model is that variance in the data, as represented by the phylogeny, is greater among species than within a species (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The additional assumption of mPTP, that the genetic variation may differ substantially among species allows to accurately delimit species in large (meta-) barcoding datasets comprising multiple species of diverse life histories (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kapli et al., 2017</xref>). Experiments using empirical data for several animal phyla (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kapli et al., 2017</xref>) and recently also viruses (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Thézé et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Modha et al., 2018</xref>) show that the method consistently provides extremely fast and sensible species estimates on ‘classic’ phylogenetic marker and barcoding genes.
