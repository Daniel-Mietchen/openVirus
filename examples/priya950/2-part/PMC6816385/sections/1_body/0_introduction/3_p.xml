<p>To date, the official taxonomy of viruses (ICTV, i.e., International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) has mainly been based on established biological classification criteria as used for other life forms, such as plants or animals. An analogous hierarchical classification system containing orders, families, subfamilies, genera, and species is being applied (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds, 2015</xref>). The ICTV is typically based on phenotypic criteria, such as morphology, nucleic acid type (i.e., DNA or RNA), hosts, symptoms, mode of replication, geographical data, or presence of antigenic epitopes, to name a few. Generally, such criteria, despite being informative, can be subjective, require highly specialized knowledge, and are time consuming to apply. In contrast, sequence evolution takes into account the evolutionary history of life forms and, thus, may offer a more objective source of information for taxonomic classification. An important difference in viruses compared to other organisms is that they lack a common set of universal genes such as the 18S rRNA in eukaryotes or the 16S rRNA in prokaryotes. Therefore, we cannot infer a comprehensive virus tree of life (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et al., 2017</xref>), and, more importantly for species delimitation, we cannot rely upon barcoding markers that are universally suitable for all viruses. We can nonetheless gain valuable insights for their systematics by utilizing phylogenetic information at lower taxonomic ranks (e.g., families, genera, species), using appropriate genes for each dataset. In this context, methods using genetic-distance thresholds (

 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Lauber &amp; Gorbalenya, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) have been suggested as a complementary method to the traditional virus classification for accelerating new species identification.
