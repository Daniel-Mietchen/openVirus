<p>The HBV dataset comprises 110 sequences corresponding to eight genotypes (i.e., A-H) and 31 subgenotypes. The genotypes (A through D, F, and H) have been further divided into subgenotypes indexed by numbers for the corresponding genotype (e.g., A
 <sub>1</sub>, A
 <sub>2</sub>, B
 <sub>1</sub>, B
 <sub>2</sub>, B
 <sub>3</sub>, etc.;

No subgenotypes have been reported for genotypes E, G and H which shows that they are of lower levels of genetic divergence than the rest. The distribution of HBV genotypes differs greatly with respect to the geographical origin. Moreover, they differ in their natural history, response to treatment and disease progression (
