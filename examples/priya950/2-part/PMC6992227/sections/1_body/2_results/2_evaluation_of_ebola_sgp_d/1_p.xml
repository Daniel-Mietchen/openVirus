<p>We first established the Ebola sGP Detection Kit LOD by serial dilutions of recombinant sGP protein in human plasma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The minimal concentration of spiked sGP detected is 7.8 ng/ml (based on a cut off value of delta OD 18), corresponding to 60 pM of protein, representing a low LOD, in agreement with previously reported LOD of silver-enhanced immunochromatography [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As we only use 140 Î¼l of sample per test, our diagnostic kit detects 1.09 ng of spiked sGP (
