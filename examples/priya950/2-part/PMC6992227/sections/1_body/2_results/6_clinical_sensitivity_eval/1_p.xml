<p>Finally, we assessed Ebola sGP Detection Kit clinical sensitivity and specificity with plasma samples from infected individuals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Out of 21 patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR, 18 patients were positive with the Ebola sGP detection Kit test, giving a sensitivity of 85.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Out of the 3 patients not detected by Ebola sGP Detection Kit, all are close to the RT-qPCR detection limits with Ct values of 31, 32 and 33 cycles. Positive and negative predicting value were 100% and 97,5% respectively, but further work is required to definitively define the clinical performances of the Ebola sGP detection Kit.
