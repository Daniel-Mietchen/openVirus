<p>To sharpen analytical sensitivity, we then analyzed plasma samples from monkeys infected with different doses of ZEBOV Gabon (10
 <sup>1</sup>, 10
 <sup>2</sup> or 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU) and collected at different times post-infection. Results displayed on 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed that the Ebola sGP Detection Kit gave positive results when monkey plasmas contain around 2 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml corresponding to viral titers of 5 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> FFU/ml. Moreover, all tests showed positivity for plasmas from monkeys infected with all three doses of ZEBOV from day 5 to day 9, including very high viral load samples, up to 10
 <sup>9</sup> or 10
 <sup>10</sup> RNA copies/ml. Since in human blood, the highest viral load is lower than 10
 <sup>10</sup> RNA copies/ml, we assume the test may not be susceptible to Hook effect, but further experiments should validate this hypothesis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the genome copies detection for monkey 1 infected with 10
 <sup>1</sup> FFU at day 5 was positive for only one RT-qPCR replicate (noted with *). This was also the case for genome copy analysis at day 2 for monkey 1 infected with 10
 <sup>2</sup> FFU and monkey 1 infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU (with 3.49 X 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 1.26 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml respectively) with again only one positive RT-qPCR replicate. Thus, the limit of RT-qPCR detection is above 3.49 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml in settings used in our BSL4 laboratory. By comparison Ebola sGP Detection Kit test was positive whenever genome copies gave robust positive results (i.e. both RT-qPCR replicates were positive) as well as for one monkey infected with 10
 <sup>1</sup> FFU at day 5 post-infection (biological replicate 1, one positive RT-qPCR replicate at 2.21 X 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/ml). Therefore, the relative detection limit of Ebola sGP Detection Kit was 2.21 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml. This indicated an analytical detection sensitivity close to the order of magnitude obtained by RT-qPCR, at least in our settings. We also note a false positive result with the biological replicate 2 infected with 10
 <sup>1</sup> PFU at day 0. Over all the negative samples tested from human or monkey origin during this work (see below), this was the only false positive result.
