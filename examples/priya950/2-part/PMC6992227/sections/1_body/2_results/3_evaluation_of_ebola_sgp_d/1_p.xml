<p>We next evaluated the LOD of our detection kit with ZEBOV Makona particles from cell supernatant undiluted or serially diluted in human plasma or blood. Genome copy numbers were measured in parallel for each dilution in plasma. The Ebola sGP Detection Kit gave positive results (i.e. test line delta OD value above 18, bold characters) for supernatant dilutions in both human plasma and blood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These dilutions have genome copies concentrations ranging from 1.22 x 10
 <sup>10</sup> to 2.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml. Thus, in those conditions Ebola sGP Detection Kit has limits of detection equivalent to 5.69 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 7.99 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> genome copies/ml when dilutions are made with plasma and blood respectively.
