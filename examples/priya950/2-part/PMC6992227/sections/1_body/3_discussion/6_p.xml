<p>The sGP Detection Kit test has a sensitivity of 85.7% (18/21), and a specificity of 100% (119/119). This test could then be used as a triage test to reduce nosocomial transmission among patients as it would reduce time spent by negative patients in health care centers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This high specificity is unique to our test as only one out of 4 LFA tests achieves an equivalent specificity in a recent comparative study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, all the 8 non-EBOV febrile patients admitted at the Macenta ETC are negative with the sGP Detection Kit as well as all cured-EBOV patients (triangle, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The sensitivity of our test has to be further delineated as only 21 samples were evaluated. It is important to note that among those positive samples, 4 were diagnosed by RT-qPCR with a Ct value ranging from 31 to 33 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Out of these 4 samples with low viremia, 3 were tested negative with the sGP Detection Kit. This result is in agreement with results obtained with other RDTs using low viremia samples (high Ct, usually above 29 or 30) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Samples from these 4 patients with Ct above 31 are blood draws collected at the recovery phase, i.e. before leaving the Ebola Treatment Center of Macenta. One could therefore argue that anti-ZEBOV antibodies are engaged in immune complex, masking sGP/GP for detection. Anti-ZEBOV IgG titers have been evaluated on viral lysates for these survivors’ patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. All these 4 survivors’ patients are positive for IgG [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Those antibodies could be due to prior asymptomatic infection or they have been generated during this infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, an antigenic detection kit, whatever the targeted antigen, may never be reliable to follow patient viremia during treatment. However, our goal was to establish an antigenic detection kit to diagnose early infection by mainly targeting sGP (and GP to a lesser extent), which is present at high concentration in blood of infected patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In these settings, we anticipate that most of the time no anti-ZEBOV antibody responses would be detected. Recent works nevertheless highlighted the detection of anti-ZEBOV antibodies in healthy people, presumably reflecting asymptomatic infections or paucisymptomatic cases, with different seroprevalences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Since a long and persistent antibody response is observed in Ebola survivors, we could assume that survivors are protected against re-infection and therefore have minor chance to get infected and spread infection in outbreak settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of specific antibodies for ZEBOV proteins should not interfere when assessing Ebola disease status with antigenic RDTs in naive patients.
