<p>Here we showed that this Ebola sGP Detection Kit displays a LOD corresponding to 7.99 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> genome copies/ml with Vero cells supernatant diluted in blood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), 2.21 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml with plasma samples from a cohort of infected monkeys (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, measured by RT-qPCR). These LODs are in agreement with published results for other RDTs, and even better since none of the immunochromatography-based RDTs tested so far displayed a LOD below 10
 <sup>5</sup> genome copies/ml. Furthermore, the human matrix used to dilute plasma samples from infected monkey has no effect on the LOD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007965.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), suggesting that Ebola sGP Detection kit could be used with human blood sample, without loss of sensitivity. In this perspective, the Ebola sGP Detection Kit analytical characteristics should then be evaluated in the future with blood samples collected by finger-stick since only 40 to 70 Î¼l of sample are required. Moreover, following addition of diluted blood or serum in the extraction buffer to the sample pad, no further manipulation is required to get the final result. These criteria are critical to reduce risks of contamination in remote areas and in low income countries, where specialized laboratories are not available.
