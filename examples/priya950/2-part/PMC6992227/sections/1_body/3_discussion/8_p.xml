<p>Future investigations are needed in order to confirm the promising results described in this paper. For example, we need to evaluate the sGP Detection Kit sensitivity and specificity with a larger cohort using human finger-stick whole blood, during an outbreak, to assess the capability of this test to identify ZEBOV-infected patients earlier than VP40-based diagnostic tests. Because the sGP detection kit is specific to Zaire EBOV, we also need to evaluate the ability of the 3 ZEBOV- and SUDV-specific mAbs to recognize other EBOV species in LFA.</p>
