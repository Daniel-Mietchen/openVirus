<p>In contrast to other antigenic diagnostic tests targeting EBOV VP40, the Ebola sGP Detection Kit was specific of human EBOV Zaire strain as none of the other hemorrhagic fever viruses tested were positive nor SUDV. This lack of cross-reactivity with SUDV reflects a lower conservation of sGP protein compare to VP40 (

From the first outbreak in 1976 to 2018 excluding the 2013â€“2016 West Africa major outbreak, percentage of human cases infected with BDBV, SUDV and ZEBOV are 9%, 31% and 60% respectively. As SUDV is responsible for around 1/3 of total cases, we investigated whether some mAbs generated during this work against ZEBOV sGP could cross-react with SUDV sGP as the NH2-terminal part of this protein is conserved across ZEBOV and SUDV (
