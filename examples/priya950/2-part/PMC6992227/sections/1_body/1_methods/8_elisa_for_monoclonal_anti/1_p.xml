<p>Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates were coated with the immunogens, recombinant sGP or GP protein, blocked with PBS + 1% BSA and incubated with sera or cell culture supernatant. After a washing step, appropriate dilution of HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig was added to the wells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) following by a washing step. The reaction was revealed with TMB one component substrate (RD-Biotech). The reaction was stopped with 20% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and the optical density (OD) measured by a Multiscan EX ELISA reader (ThermoFischer) at 450 nm &amp; 620 nm. To evaluate the specificity of the generated mAbs, ELISA were also using GP and sGP from different EBOV viruses.
