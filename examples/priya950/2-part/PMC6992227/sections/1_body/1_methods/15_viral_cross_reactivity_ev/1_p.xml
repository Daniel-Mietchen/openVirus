<p>The specificity of EBOV sGP Detection Kit was performed against other viruses responsible of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks in Africa. For technical reasons, each infectious supernatant [SUDV (6.16 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml), MARV Musoke (9.17 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) and Popp (7.90 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) strains, LASV AV strain (5.80 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU/ml), and CCHF 10200 strain (3.70 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml)] was pre-diluted 10-fold with naive human plasma from the "Etablissement Français du Sang". Samples were then diluted 5-fold with the extraction buffer and 140 μL from the final dilution (1/50) was applied to the cartridge and then read by the FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG1 analyzer (FUJIFILM, Japan). Positive control solutions were obtained by diluting ZEBOV sGP recombinant protein in naive human plasma and then 1/5 in assay buffer to give final concentrations of 125 ng/ml and 31.3 ng/ml. Negative control consisted in a 5-fold dilution of a naive human plasma with assay buffer. The experiment was done in triplicate and the results were presented with a positive or negative detection of these VHF viruses.
