<p>The lateral flow assay optimization includes several steps. First, the spraying concentration of the capture antibody on the nitrocellulose membrane was determined to maximize capture efficiency of the antigen. Second, the gold nanoparticle conjugate was improved. F(abâ€™)2 digestion protocol and the concentration of gold nanoparticle at the conjugation step were finely tuned. The optimal conjugate concentration was set to maximize the sensitivity of the assay. Finally, the sample dilution buffer was supplemented with human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA) blocker to improve assay specificity.</p>
