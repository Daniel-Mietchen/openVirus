<p>To determine the LOD of test line, delta OD values of test conditions without antigen were analyzed. The passive adsorption of gold label detection antibody gave a background signal of 18 delta OD, thus constituting the cut-off of the test line. We also evaluated experimentally the cut-off of the sGP Detection kit with plasma samples from healthy donors from Europe (30) and Guinea (70). Mean of delta OD was 3.66 (standard deviation of 3.74) and 5.2 (standard deviation of 3.9) with samples from Europe or Guinea respectively. The cut-off value taken as mean + 3 SD is 13.56 and 16.9 when using samples from Europe or Guinea respectively, which is in agreement with the cut-off used of delta OD 18 applied in this study.</p>
