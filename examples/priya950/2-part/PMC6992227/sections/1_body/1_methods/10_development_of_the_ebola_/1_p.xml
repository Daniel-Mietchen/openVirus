<p>An anti-mouse immunoglobulin and EE8 Ab were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, USA) to generate the control and test lines, respectively. A reagent pad containing XC2 mAb conjugated with colloidal gold (British Biocell International, UK) was placed between the sample application point and test line. The test strip was then placed in a FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG cartridge (FUJIFILM, Japan). Results express as delta OD values were calculated by FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG1 analyzer (FUJIFILM, Japan) based on OD values before and after silver amplification reaction.</p>
