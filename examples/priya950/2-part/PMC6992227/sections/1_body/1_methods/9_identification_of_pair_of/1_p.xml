<p>An anti-mouse immunoglobulin Ab and mAbs EE8, XC2, WE7, DB4, VB5, FE5 or FD3 were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, USA) to generate control and test lines, respectively. A reagent pad containing WE7, DB4, VB5, EE8, FE5, FD3 or XC2 mAbs conjugated with colloidal gold (British Biocell International, UK) was placed between the sample application point and test line. Positivity was determined by visual inspection. Screening strategy to select mAbs specific for sGP, GP or both is depicted in
