<p>Repeatability was evaluated by analyzing the same sample 10 times with the EBOV sGP Detection Kit following by measurement of the delta OD by the FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG1 analyzer (FUJIFILM, Japan). Two dilutions of a culture supernatant from Makona Ebola infected cells (3.00 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) were used: 10-fold and 250-fold dilutions in naive human plasma. Means and standard deviations were then calculated.
