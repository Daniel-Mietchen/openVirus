<p>The clinical sensitivity of EBOV sGP Detection Kit was evaluated on 40 human plasmas collected during West Africa Ebola outbreak (Macenta—Guinea) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The positive samples were previously selected based on a RT-qPCR positive value (Ct value&lt;34 cycles). Plasma samples were diluted 5-fold with the assay buffer and 140 μL were analyzed by the FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG1 analyzer (FUJIFILM, Japan) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The negative control was a dilution (1/5) of a naive human plasma with assay buffer and positive controls were as described above. The results were expressed with delta OD values.
