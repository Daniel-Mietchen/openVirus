<p>ZEBOV Makona virus supernatant (3 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) was 5-fold serial diluted (from 1/5 to 1/15 625) into naive human plasma provided by “Etablissement Français du Sang” (Lyon, France). 140 μl of each dilution were loaded in the cartridge. In parallel, 140 μl of each dilution were extracted for EBOV NP gene detection as described above. The limit of detection as viral genome copy number was assigned to the first positive result above the cut-off value (delta OD 18) obtained with the FUJI DRI-CHEM IMMUNO AG1 analyzer.
