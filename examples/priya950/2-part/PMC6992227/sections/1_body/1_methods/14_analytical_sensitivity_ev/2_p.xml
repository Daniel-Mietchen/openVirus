<p>Analytical sensitivity evaluation was also performed with plasma from Ebola virus infected monkey. Plasma collected 7 days after infection from one monkey infected with 10
 <sup>2</sup> FFU was 5-fold serial diluted (from 1/5 to 1/15 625) in naive human plasma or whole blood. 70 μl of each dilution in whole blood were absorbed on a blood pick apparatus (which contains an absorbent sponge). The sponge is released in the extraction buffer and mixed vigorously 30–40 times. Plasma was extracted from the whole blood with the help of a Blood cell separation cylinder (which contains a separation membrane). This plasma extraction system is manufactured by FUJIFILM. 140 μl of this extracted plasma were loaded in the cartridge and read with the AG1 analyzer. Dilution in naive human plasma followed the same process and 140 μl of the mix plasma/buffer was loaded in the cartridge and analyzed. In parallel, RT-qPCR was performed only on the plasma dilutions to evaluate the genome copy number of each dilution. For each sample, genome copy numbers were compared to the AG1 analyzer values to determine the LOD.
