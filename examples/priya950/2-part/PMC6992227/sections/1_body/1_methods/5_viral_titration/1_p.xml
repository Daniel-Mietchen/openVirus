<p>EBOV virus titration from either viral supernatants or from infected plasmas was performed with Vero E6 cells plated in 12-wells microplates 24h prior to infection. Infectious supernatants or infected plasmas were tenfold serially diluted in DMEM cell culture medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FCS (Eurobio Abcys). Vero E6 cells were infected with the serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C / 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Semi solid medium containing 1.6% of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in DMEM with 2% FCS was then added (vol / vol). Plates were incubated during 7 days at 37°C / 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Infectious foci were detected by incubation with a GP EBOV specific monoclonal antibody produced in mice (generously provided by Laurent Bellanger and Fabrice Gallais, LI2D Laboratory, CEA, Marcoule, France), followed by incubations with an Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Aldrich) and a 1-step NBT/BCIP plus Suppressor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each sample, results are expressed in Focus Forming Units (FFU) per ml of blood. All experiments performed on infectious material were performed in the INSERM Jean Mérieux BSL4 Laboratory.
