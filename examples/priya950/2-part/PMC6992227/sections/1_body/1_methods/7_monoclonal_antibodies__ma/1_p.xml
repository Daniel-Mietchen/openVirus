<p>5 Balb/c mice (8–12 weeks of age) per immunogen were immunized by intraperitoneal or foot pad injections using either sGP or GP proteins (total of 20 mice: 5 mice x 2 injection sites x 2 antigens) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) (first injection) or incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) (boost injections) (5–10 μg of proteins every 2 weeks). Three days after the last injection, spleen cells (intraperitoneal injections) or popliteal lymph node cells (foot pad injections) were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells (Sp2/0-Ag14 (ATCC CRL-1581), using polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500) (Sigma). Hybridomas were grown in DMEM culture medium (Sigma) containing 20% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) (Eurobio, France), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and supplemented with hypoxantine (1×10
 <sup>−4</sup> M), aminopterin (4×10
 <sup>−7</sup> M) and thymidine (1.6×10
 <sup>−5</sup> M) (HAT) (Sigma). After ten to fourteen days of culture, secreting hybrids were identified by analysis of culture supernatants by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hybridomas from selected antibody were cloned by limiting dilution and processed according to conventional methods. Clones secreting antibody of desired reactivity were expanded in 25 and 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks (Nunc, Denmark), harvested and cryopreserved in 40% FCS, 10% Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) and 50% RPMI-1640 culture medium (Sigma).
