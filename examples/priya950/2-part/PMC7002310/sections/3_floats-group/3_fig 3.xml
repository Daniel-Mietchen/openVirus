  <p>Phylogenetic relationships of HA-H1 sequences from exhibition-sampled swine, broad swine, swine variant, and late summer 2018 human cases of swine variant IAVs. (A) Re-creation of the phylogenetic cladogram and genome constellation heat map displayed in 
   <italic>Mia</italic>’s R Shiny application using the swine influenza virus H1 HA global nomenclature system. This automatically generated figure showed us that our sampled viruses had HA sequences most similar to the Other-Human-1B.2 (OH-1B.2) A/Brisbane/59/2007 
   <italic>Mia</italic> reference sequence and that they all shared a similar genome constellation. (B) Maximum likelihood phylogeny of swine IAV HA-H1 sequences incorporating the swine variant viruses 
   <italic>Mia</italic> used as references, including the nearest candidate vaccine virus (Ohio/35/2017) to our outbreak of 1B.2.1 IAVs. (C) Detail of the maximum likelihood phylogeny of H1 1B.2.1 and OH-1B.2 sequences including our field-processed IAVs (BCxx, green), 65 additional field samples that were laboratory processed (blue), the nearest CVV (red), 
   <italic>Mia</italic> reference (light blue), and five human cases of swine variant (purple) IAVs. Bootstrap values are annotated on the internal nodes.
