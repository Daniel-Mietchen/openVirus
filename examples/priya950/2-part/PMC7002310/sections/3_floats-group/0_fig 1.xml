  <p>Genetic relationship of human and swine virus lineages. Green, orange, purple, and blue arrows follow the evolution of hemagglutinin, while black errors follow other segments. Human seasonal lineages are green, classical swine-H1N1pdm09 is orange, the classical swine lineage is purple, and the Eurasian swine lineage is blue. In 2009, influenza A/H1N1Pdm09 virus displaced the previous human seasonal A/H1N1 virus from humans which continues circulating in swine. This virus reassorted, picking up the N2 segment from the triple-reassortant viruses into the A/H1N2 Other-Human (OH)-1B.2 lineage that caused human infections in the summer of 2018. The history of this HA can be traced back to the avian virus that caused the 1918 pandemic, through extinction and reemergence, and through decades of human seasonal activity.
