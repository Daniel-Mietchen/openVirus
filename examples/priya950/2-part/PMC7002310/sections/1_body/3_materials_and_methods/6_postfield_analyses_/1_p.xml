<p>We transported field-derived RNA and amplicons on dry ice back to the CDC in Atlanta, GA, and processed them with the Influenza Genomics Team’s standard Illumina MiSeq influenza surveillance pipeline (San Diego, CA, USA). We processed and assembled reads with IRMA’s Flu-sensitive module (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and calculated the identity of MinION-derived consensus sequences based on alignment to the sample’s MiSeq-derived consensus, which is considered the gold standard. Out of 425 swine sampled through our standard surveillance efforts at the exhibition, 136 swine tested positive for IAV by RT-PCR. Complete genome sequencing via our standard Illumina pipeline was attempted on 79 of those and produced 65 full genomes.
