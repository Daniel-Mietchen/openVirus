<p>We performed phylogenetic analyses with the MiSeq-produced sequences and an annotated set of swine IAV sequences. The annotated data set was constructed by downloading all publicly available swine IAV data collected in North America from the Influenza Research Database (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) on 1 June 2018. Each gene was aligned with MAFFT v7.294b (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and the best-known maximum likelihood phylogeny for each alignment was inferred using IQ-TREE v1.6.2 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), with the model of molecular evolution automatically selected during the tree search. Each gene was classified to an evolutionary lineage and/or phylogenetic clade (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Subsequently, we selected 3 to 10 viruses from each named clade that captured the evolutionary relationships among clades and that represented the major HA, NA, and whole-genome constellations circulating in U.S. swine (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We then aligned the MiSeq and annotated sequences with MUSCLE v3.8.31 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and inferred maximum likelihood trees using IQ-TREE v1.6.8 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), implementing a generalized time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across sites while allowing for a proportion of invariable sites and 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap approximations (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) (iqtree –m GTR+G+I –bb 1000).
