<p>We used three miniPCR mini8 thermocyclers (Cambridge, MA, USA) under laptop control for elution buffer heating, fMRT-PCR, barcoding, and library preparation. Following barcoding, we quantified the products using a Qubit DNA broad-range/high-sensitivity (BR/HS) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantification data allowed us to normalize and pool the barcodes and served as our only quality control check during the molecular workflow. Once pooled, we prepared the amplicons for Nanopore sequencing using the SQK-LSK 108 library kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). This protocol required cooling to 20°C; however, the temperature in the barn was roughly 30°C, and the fan-cooled mini8 thermocyclers could not get below ambient temperature. To solve this issue, we placed the thermocycler on a bed of ice, which effectively lowered the ambient temperature and allowed the mini8 to cool to 20°C. We sequenced the pooled samples on a MinION Mk 1B Nanopore sequencer using the flow cell FAH58363 equipped with R9.5.1 chemistry.</p>
