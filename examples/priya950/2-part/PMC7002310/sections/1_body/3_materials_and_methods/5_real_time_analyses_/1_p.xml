<p>For real-time analyses, we used a high-performance Dell Precision 7720 laptop (Round Rock, TX, USA) with 64 Gb of ram, four-core Intel Xeon 3.00 GHz central processing unit (CPU) E3-1505M v6 (2 threads/core), and two 1-Tb solid state hard drives, partitioned separately into a Windows 10 OS and Ubuntu 16.04 OS. 
 <italic>Mia</italic>’s custom analytical application runs on the Ubuntu partition and initiates automatically via crontab upon MinION read file (fast5) origination during active sequencing. We base called and demultiplexed fast5 read files with Albacore v2.2.7 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and assembled subsequent fastq files into consensus sequences with IRMA v0.6.7 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We used a custom MinION configuration module for IRMA that changes the default “FLU” module parameters as follows: dropping the median read Q score filter from 30 to 7, raising the minimum read length from 125 to 150 bases, raising the frequency threshold for insertion and deletion refinement from 0.25 to 0.75 and 0.6 to 0.75, respectively, and lowering the Smith-Waterman mismatch penalty from 5 to 3 and the gap open penalty from 10 to 6. We checked consensus sequences against a local database containing clade-annotated IAV sequences using BLASTn v2.7.1+ (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and used top BLAST matches to interpret a sample’s IAV genome constellation. We aligned consensus sequences against reference sequences with MUSCLE v3.8.31 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We built phylogenetic trees with FastTree double precision version 2.1.8 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with a generalized time-reversible model, branch lengths optimized under a gamma distribution, and local support values produced from bootstrap sampling 10,000 times and visualized the trees in R v3.4.4 with GGtree (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We determined amino acid differences to each candidate vaccine virus sequence in our database with a custom Python script that translates DNA consensus sequences and MUSCLE aligns the mature HA1 protein sequences. Analytical and processing status results were fed into a SQLite v3.11.0 database (Hwaci, Inc., Charlotte, NC) and visualized in a Web browser with an interactive R Shiny (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) application.
