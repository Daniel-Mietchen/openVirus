 <italic>Mia</italic>-processed reads in 4,000-read batches for the first 5 iterations, followed by 20,000-read batches for another 5 iterations and then 40,000-read batches until reads are no longer produced by the sequencer. This stepwise batching provides the user an understanding of the runâ€™s quality within minutes of sequencing, allowing the user to decide if it is worth continuing the run while maximizing computational resources. Results seen within the first hour of a sequencing track across a 6- or even 48-h run, with the extended run time increasing coverage and resolving a scant number of consensus bases.
