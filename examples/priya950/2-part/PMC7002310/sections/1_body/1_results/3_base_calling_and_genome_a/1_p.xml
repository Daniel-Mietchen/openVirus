<p>Sequencing produced 99,988 reads that were base called and demultiplexed with Albacore v2.2.7. A total of 67,105 reads passed a basic quality control (QC) threshold Q value of ≥7, and 22,552 of these reads were assigned to one of 24 barcodes (Fig. S1 [

The distribution of read lengths followed an expected pattern, with peaks corresponding to IAV segment lengths (Fig. S1 at the URL mentioned above). We assembled demultiplexed reads with IRMA (
