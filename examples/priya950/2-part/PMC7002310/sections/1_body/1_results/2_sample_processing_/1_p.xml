<p>Our surveillance target was a large agricultural event featuring exhibition swine. The swine began arriving on Sunday (day 0) and received an initial veterinary screening upon entry. We began scouting swine on day 3 for influenza-like illness (ILI) and noted the locations in the exhibition barn of animals with clinical signs of respiratory disease. During the day, the barns were very crowded with swine, presenters and their families, farm hands, visitors, and event staff. To avoid interfering with the event’s proceedings, swabbing and sequencing were conducted during the event’s off-hours. On day 4, we swabbed ILI-identified swine and their pen neighbors (
 <italic>n</italic> = 94) for influenza A virus (IAV) with the Flu Detect swine kits. We detected seven IAV-positive samples but suspected that additional samples collected from pen neighbors might be positive by sequence analysis. At 11 p.m. on day 4, we erected the 
 <italic>Mia</italic> platform inside the exhibition barn and began the workflow on 24 samples collected from the rapid-test-positive swine and their immediate neighbors. Overnight, we extracted RNA, amplified the full genome, barcoded amplicons, and quantified the barcoded amplicons. Sample concentrations ranged from 12.7 to 41.9 ng/μl (Table S2 [

We normalized and pooled the barcoded samples to 1 μg total. The final library amounted to 279 ng. The library was ready for sequencing at 6 a.m., and at this time, people were arriving at the barn to begin exhibition activities. To avoid disrupting the event, once the sequencing was initiated, we transported the sequencer attached to the laptop powered by the laptop’s battery to a hotel room.
