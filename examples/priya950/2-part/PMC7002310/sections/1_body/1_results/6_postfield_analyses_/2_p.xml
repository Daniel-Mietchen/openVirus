<p>As our real-time 
 <italic>Mia</italic> database contained human cases of swine IAV, we performed additional postfield phylogenetic analyses using the outbreak data, the 
 <italic>Mia</italic> database, and additional swine IAV sequences that represent the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships of contemporary swine IAV (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Compared to 126 swine H1 sequences, our 
 <italic>Mia</italic>-identified swine H1N2 viruses were in a monophyletic clade with contemporary 1B.2.1 (H1-δ2) HA genes from the human seasonal lineage (

Across all segments, MiSeq-derived data mirror the tree topology created in real time in the field from MinION-derived sequences (
