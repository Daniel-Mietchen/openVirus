<p>To compare the viral diversity we found in our MinION-derived viral sequences to what fully existed at the exhibition, we performed our standard IAV surveillance procedure in which we sampled 425 additional swine regardless of ILI. From these samples, we detected 136 (32%) IAV-positive specimens by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) and successfully sequenced 65 full genomes on a MiSeq platform. We found that the diversity of viruses collected and sequenced by more traditional surveillance methods was also detected in similar proportions by our
