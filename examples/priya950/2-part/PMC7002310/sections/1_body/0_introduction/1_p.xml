<p>Mobile sequencing technology, specifically the MinION sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, UK), has successfully generated rapid genomic surveillance data on-site during outbreaks of Ebola (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), Zika (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and Lassa (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) viruses. These studies relied on the transfer of raw read data to centralized institutions harboring high-performance computational resources to perform extensive phylogenetic analyses. These analyses resulted in a deep understanding of the viral evolution during the outbreak, as well as an estimation of transmission chains. Their reliance on vast databases and computationally intensive algorithms limited their ability to influence real-time prevention strategies and potentially stop further transmission events. Furthermore, the lack of vaccines to these viruses meant that the real-time-derived sequence data could not be leveraged to identify a suitable vaccine. On the other hand, influenza viruses have multiple enzootic reservoirs, cause annual epidemics in humans, and rapidly evolve, which necessitates constant genomic surveillance and iterative vaccine development. Given this need, we have an opportunity to mitigate the risk of an influenza outbreak at its source in real time by analyzing the viral genomes present and, subsequently, developing the best-matched candidate vaccine virus (CVV).
