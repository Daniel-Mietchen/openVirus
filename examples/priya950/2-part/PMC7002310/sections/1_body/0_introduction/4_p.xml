<p>Collecting samples in the field, shipping them to centralized laboratories, sequencing their genomes, and analyzing them often takes several weeks or months. Thus, the current surveillance process is less able to contribute real-time data during the emergence of pandemic threats (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The increased risk at this unique interface warrants concerted proactive surveillance and simultaneously serves as a proving ground for new real-time in-field genomic approaches to help prevent zoonotic infections and potential outbreaks. Here, we describe the development and deployment of a rapid and portable IAV sequencing pipeline we call 
 <italic>Mia</italic> (Mobile Influenza Analysis [mi…ô, MEE-uh]) and the genomic results obtained from this surveillance.
