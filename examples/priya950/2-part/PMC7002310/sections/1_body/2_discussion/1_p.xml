<p>We successfully developed a mobile next-generation sequencing (NGS) suite called 
 <italic>Mia</italic> and deployed it to a high-priority swine-human interface that resulted in our identification of an influenza A virus outbreak. We created 
 <italic>Mia</italic> by selecting and optimizing laboratory equipment that fits into a cooler and two standard-sized suitcases (Fig. S43 [

Our automated analysis pipeline performs base calling, quality control, genome assembly, phylogenetic analysis, BLAST searches, and amino acid comparisons to current CVVs without an Internet connection. We are able to monitor all of these results in real time on the laptop performing the analyses. 
 <italic>Mia</italic> will be continuously improved and adapted for use in harsher field environments (see Text S1 at the URL mentioned above).
