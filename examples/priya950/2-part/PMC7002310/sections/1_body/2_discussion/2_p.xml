<p>In the field, the data generated indicated that while multiple lineages were cocirculating, the numerically dominant subtype, H1N2, was genetically different from the most similar WHO prepandemic CVV, including variation in known antigenic sites. Moreover, we determined that these viruses posed a risk of causing disease in a young population, as similar H1 viruses disappeared from seasonal circulation in humans in 2010 and were replaced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Therefore, the sequence data were used to initiate the synthesis of an optimal CVV approximately 18â€‰h after unpacking

This proactive strategy of identifying the predominant swine influenza viruses in exhibition pigs prior to the start of annual agricultural fairs in the United States proved to be very useful, as zoonotic infections caused by the predominant A(H1N2) virus found in exhibition pigs were detected in humans exposed at fairs in July and August 2018 (

Had this virus caused a severe outbreak or pandemic, our proactive surveillance efforts and vaccine derivation would have provided an approximate 8-week time advantage for vaccine manufacturing.
