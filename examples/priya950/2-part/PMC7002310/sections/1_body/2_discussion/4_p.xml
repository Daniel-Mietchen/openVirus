<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a perpetual threat to global health security, both as human-endemic seasonal viruses and the more insidious pandemic viruses. IAV pandemics result from zoonotic transmission of IAVs to humans followed by onward human-to-human spread in populations lacking sufficient immunity. The swine-human and avian-human interfaces are of keen interest for future in-field surveillance efforts due to the pandemic risk of avian and swine influenza viruses that circulate in these settings (

 <italic>Mia</italic> will be a useful tool to enhance the current centralized surveillance framework and can be deployed into resource-poor settings and operated by two technicians. This technology can serve to bolster IAV surveillance by monitoring important transmission interfaces for emerging viruses that have pandemic potential. Moreover, it might not always be possible to return samples from the field. In such cases, portable Nanopore sequencing and data transmission can take advantage of a distributed sequencing network while maintaining the advantages of a centralized database. This has the potential to greatly expand the reach of the current global influenza virus surveillance network.
