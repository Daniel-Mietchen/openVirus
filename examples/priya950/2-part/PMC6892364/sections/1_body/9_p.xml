<p id="Par11">Targeted sequencing with MinION is powerful and fast to detect pathogens in clinical samples. Bacterial composition from empyema patient’s pleural effusion could be understood within 2 hours after obtaining the DNA sample [

 <italic>16</italic>s 
 <italic>rRNA</italic> gene were sequenced to identify the bacteria. Due to the capability of long-read sequencing, the gene can be sequenced in entirety, increasing the resolution to detect the infecting bacteria species. Bioinformatics tools can be used to increase the accuracy of the amplicons and determine the bacteria composition up to species level [
