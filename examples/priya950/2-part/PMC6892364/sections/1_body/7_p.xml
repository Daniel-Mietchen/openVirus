<p id="Par9">The deviation from common sequencing principles allows the new sequencing platform to be miniaturized (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This opens new powerful aspects of sequencing that could never been achieved before. The portable sequencer, MinION, can be transported to countries or locations where performing sequencing is difficult or transferring samples to other countries or locations is forbidden. For example, MinION has been taken to a remote rainforest of Tanzania [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Ecuador [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the Canadian high Arctic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and even the International Space Station [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. MinION helped the surveillance and sequencing of Zika virus in the 2016 Brazil outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. During the project, it was found that most of the genome were fragmentary. Low titer was correlated to sequencing less than 50% coverage, so ‘tiling amplification’ was used to amplify the whole genome of Zika virus. This technique also was employed in the Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in Guinea to get a high nucleic acid concentration for sequencing [
