<p id="Par5">Traditionally, laboratory test for drug resistance is a long and laborious process. First, culturable microorganisms must be cultured on various growth mediums. The time needed for colonies to form also varies greatly. Then the colonies must be subjected to different type of antimicrobials until the susceptibility or resistance can be distinguished. In certain cases, drug resistance analysis is very critical to patientsâ€™ prognosis, therefore traditional process is impractical. Here is the niche for genetic analysis to expedite the drug resistance tests.</p>
