<p id="Par18">Advanced application of MinION in the field of infectious disease is the epigenetic sequencing. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in the gene expression that do not involve changes in genomic DNA sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In infection, the researches are mainly focused on the changes in host’s DNA methylome, histone marks, and microRNA profiles as a response to pathogen’s invasion. Relatively new, the number of infection-related epigenetic researches are still low compared with cancer epigenomics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. MinION has a high potential assisting epigenetic research. Due to its principle of directly sequencing nucleic acid molecules, any modifications in the nucleotides are also recorded in the raw signals. Therefore, untreated nucleic acid sequenced with MinION has enough information to distinguish 5-methylcytosine from cytosine if carefully analyzed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
