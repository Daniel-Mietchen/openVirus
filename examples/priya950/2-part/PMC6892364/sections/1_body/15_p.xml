<p id="Par17">Nanopore sequencing is not limited to DNA. RNA sequencing, either directly or after cDNA conversion, has been widely performed with MinION. Studies in RNA virus will gain substantial benefit because most of the high-profile human viral diseases that recently emerged are caused by RNA virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]; sequencing the virus in their natural state can open a lot of exciting findings. Already, direct sequencing of RNA virus and transcripts of DNA virus reveals the structural variants of coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], an mRNA that accumulates late in infection of herpes simplex virus-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and the discovery of novel RNA molecules and transcript isoforms of varicella zoster virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].
