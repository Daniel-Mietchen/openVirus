<p id="Par8">Next-generation sequencing incorporates many technologies, but mainly they include the incorporation of terminating nucleotides to a DNA polymerization process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These termination nucleotides can be paired with excitable compounds that is excited by laser beam; and depending on the compound, the excitation process will emit different wavelengths which can be identified as different nucleotide. A different kind of DNA sequencer uses nanopore protein to recognize the nucleotide in question. Here, the disturbance in the basal electrical current inside the protein caused by certain nucleotide strands will be recognized as specific patterns and converted into sequences of DNA by specific algorithm [
