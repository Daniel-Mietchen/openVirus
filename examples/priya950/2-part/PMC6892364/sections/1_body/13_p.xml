<p id="Par15">Metagenomic sequencing with MinION has been used in many clinical studies. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), EBOV, and hepatitis C virus can be detected from clinical samples after amplification of viral genomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In a similar experiment, a coinfection of DENV and CHIKV was found from one clinical specimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Pathogens causing lower tract infections can be identified by sequencing bronchial lavage with or without host depletion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This allowed the finding of bacteria composition and drug resistance phenotype in lower respiratory infection, which led to early antibacterial therapy within 6â€‰h [
