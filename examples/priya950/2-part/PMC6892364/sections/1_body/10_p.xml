<p id="Par12">Other techniques can be used to amplify the gene of interest instead of PCR (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for an outline of methods employed with MinION). Loop-amplified isothermal amplification (LAMP) is method to amplify a gene segment flanked by two to three pairs of primers in an isothermal condition [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Applying the LAMP technique as the amplification method, one group of researchers performed a genomic epidemiology study of dengue virus (DENV) in Indonesia and Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Up to 141 and 80 DENV-positive samples were amplified isothermally and sequenced with MinION. The successful detection rate was 79%. Serotype could also be determined despite the 74–80% identity. The LAMP–MiNION technique can be applied to other pathogens as well, such as malaria [
