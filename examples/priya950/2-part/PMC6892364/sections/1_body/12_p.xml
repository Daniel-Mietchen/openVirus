<p id="Par14">For metagenomic sequencing, there are several methods can be employed to overcome the difficulties. Host DNA depletion with saponin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], negative CpG selection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], or physical disruption of bacterial wall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] may be used to remove or reduce the background DNA and to increase sensitivity. Filtration, nuclease digestion, and random amplification allow reliable recovery of viral genomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Whole genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) can also be performed for low DNA concentration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This technique uses the high-fidelity phi29 polymerase combined with random hexamer primers to amplify DNA in isothermal reaction. Specific MDA protocols for amplifying Plasmodium DNA from whole blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and Mycobacteria DNA from sputum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] have been published.
