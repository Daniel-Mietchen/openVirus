<p id="Par7">Sequencing of PCR amplicons or whole pathogen genomic DNA can be applied to comprehensively screen for infecting agents and their drug resistance phenotype, if exists, at the same time. Sequencing technique has been around since 1975 by the works of Frederick Sanger, Allan Maxam, and Walter Gilbert [

Since then, the technology has been modified and refined with the automation of the original technique, the inception of next-generation sequencing, and the advent of long-read sequencing. With each iteration, the data throughput is increased, cost is reduced, and physical form of the sequencer is reduced. Sequencing ensures detection of DNA composition unique to an organism, the presence of antimicrobials-destroying genes, or mutation that can change the function or conformation of proteins related to drug resistance. Further application of sequencing using the next-generation platforms encompasses epigenetic profiling as well [
