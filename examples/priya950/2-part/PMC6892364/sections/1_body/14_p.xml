<p id="Par16">Other advantage of MinION is the ability to physically sequence long reads. Using ultra-long-read sequencing protocol, a read &gt;2 megabases is obtainable with special protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This is particularly important for de novo sequencing of clinical samples, which can have a very elaborate gene structures harboring drug resistant genes with high copy number. For example, plasmid-mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains can have large numbers beta-lactamase genes, leading to high-level resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The long-read sequencing could assist the investigation of antimicrobial gene location, copy number, and potential transposon-driven rearrangements of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] isolates that otherwise could not be capture by short reads by assembling the genome de novo. Furthermore, field sequencing using MinION of Lassa virus outbreak in Nigeria molded the management response by the government [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. By confirming the outbreak was caused by the same strains that transmitted from rodents to humans, the government focused the efforts on rodent control and safe food storage. Since Lassa virus is genetically highly diverse, long-read sequencing is the method of choice.
