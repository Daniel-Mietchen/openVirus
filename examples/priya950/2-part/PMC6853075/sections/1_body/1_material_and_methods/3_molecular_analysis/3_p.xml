<p>Viral RNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit, (QIAGEN, Inc., USA), with appropriate adaptations for the immature phases of the vectors. In this case, they were immersed in 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 25 µL of protease and macerated with the Tissue Ruptor (QIAGEN, Inc.) until the whole solution became homogeneous. Afterwards, in order to stop protease digestion, the samples were incubated at 56°C for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 3,400 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the steps determined by the manufacturer were followed. The RNA quantification was performed by the spectrophotometer NanoPhotometer
 <sup>®</sup> (Implen GmbH, Germany).The eluted RNAs were kept in a freezer at –80°C until further use (

For this, we used a superscript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen, USA) containing reagents capable of performing the reverse transcription reaction using oligonucleotides specific for the target region generating a specific cDNA for the amplification region in the Applied Biosystems
 <sup>®</sup> 7500 Real-Time Thermal Cycler (USA). In this methodology, specific probe and oligonucleotides are mixed in a solution containing all reagents necessary for amplification of the region of interest. The One-step RT-qPCR kit used was the TaqMan
 <sup>®</sup> Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix kit (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) with primers and probes specifically designed for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV (
