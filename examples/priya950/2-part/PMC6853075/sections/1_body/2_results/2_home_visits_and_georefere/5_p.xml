<p>A strong positive correlation was found between rainfall and HI, both for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (r=0.931) and for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (r=0.942); on the other hand, there was a moderate positive correlation between temperature and HI (r=0.457 and r=0.439 for each vector, respectively). These data show that, despite the important role of temperature in the development of the immature stages of the vectors, rainfall plays a more decisive role in this respect.
