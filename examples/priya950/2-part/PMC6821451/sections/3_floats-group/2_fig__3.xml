  <title>Recovery of TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination by aptamers specific to NS1</title>
  <p>
   <italic>In vitro</italic> ubiquitination was detected by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. In the presence of R-1 and R-2 aptamers, regular ubiquitination was occurred by suppressing the NS1 activity (lanes 4 and 5). Arrows indicate ubiquitinated bands.
