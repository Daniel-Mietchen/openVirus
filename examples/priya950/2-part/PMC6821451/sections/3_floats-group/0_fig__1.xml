  <title>Isolation of RNA aptamers specific to NS1 protein</title>
  <p>(A) Measurement of the affinities of the selected aptamers. The immobilized GST-tagged NS1 proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of the selected RNA aptamers (R-1 and R-2). After addition of primary and secondary antibodies sequentially, inhibition percentage was calculated. The graphs were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the values of the

Shaded nucleotides indicate the central 40 random sequences of the selected aptamers. (C) Comparison of the central 40 random sequences of the selected aptamers. Conserved sequences identified by ClustalW2 were indicated by asterisks and underlines.
