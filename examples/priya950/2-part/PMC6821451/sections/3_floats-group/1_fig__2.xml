  <title>Inhibition of NS1-TRIM25 interaction by the selected aptamers</title>
  <p>MBP-TRIM25 was immobilized on amylose beads and GST-NS1 was pre-mixed with the selected aptamers (R-1 and R-2). TRIM25 coated amylose beads were incubated with aptamer-NS1 complex, washed, and analyzed by western blotting to investigate the interaction of TRIM25 with NS1. Lane 1, without NS1 and aptamers in the presence of TRIM25; Lane 2, without aptamers in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1; Lane 3, included 2 μg of R-1 aptamer in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1; Lane 4, included 5 μg of R-1 aptamer in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1; Lane 5, included 2 μg of R-2 aptamer in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1; Lane 6, included 5 μg of R-2 aptamer in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1; Lane 7, included 2 μg of RNA library in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1 as a negative control; Lane 8, included 5 μg of RNA library in the presence of TRIM25 and NS1 as a negative control.</p>
