  <title>Suppression of viral replication by the selected aptamers</title>
  <p>Viral replication assay was performed with various amounts of aptamers (0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 ng). The transfected Raw264.7 cells were infected with PR8–GFP virus, and measured fluorescence signals that represented virus viability. The recombinant mouse IFN-β 1,000 units/ml was used as a positive control (lane INF-β). The fluorescence intensity versus (aptamers) fit to a hyperbolic decay equation, which provides 50% inhibitory concentration.</p>
