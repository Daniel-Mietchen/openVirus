<p>To isolate high-affinity RNA aptamers for NS1 protein, we performed SELEX procedure using a RNA library pool containing central 40 random core sequences. After 15 rounds of selection, 9 independent RNA aptamers were isolated and sequenced (data not shown). The binding affinity of each aptamer for NS1 protein was determined by ELISA with NS1 antibody and expressed as 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> values. The NS1 proteins were immobilized on glutathione-coated plates and various concentrations of the 9 selected RNA aptamers were added. And then NS1 antibody and anti-mouse-HRP were added. After addition of TMB, the reaction was stopped and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. After calculation of inhibition percentage, the curve was fit to a Michaelis–Menten equation (inhibition percentage = A[NS1] / (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> + [NS1], where A is the amplitude, [NS1] is the concentration of NS1, and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> is the dissociation constant), and the amplitude and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> value of each RNA aptamer were obtained (data not shown). Of the 9 aptamer candidates, two aptamers named R-1 (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> = 1.62 ± 0.30 nM) and R-2 (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic> = 1.92 ± 0.27 nM) were found to have the highest binding affinities for NS1 (

Based on the determination of binding affinity, the selected RNA aptamers were further analyzed bioinformatically. The secondary structures of the isolated RNA aptamers were predicted by Mfold program (

 <xref rid="f1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. The central 40 nucleotide random sequence region of the selected RNA aptamer was indicated by shaded line. Further bioinformatic analysis was performed by ClustalW2 (
 <xref rid="b5-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>) as shown in 
 <xref rid="f1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>. ClustalW2 was used to compare the nucleic acid sequence similarity of R-1 and R-2, and the result showed that they have 90% sequence identity.
