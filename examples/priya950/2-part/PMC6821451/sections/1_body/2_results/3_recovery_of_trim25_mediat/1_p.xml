<p>We hypothesized that TRIM25 can ubiquitinate the RIG-I regularly if NS1 is not working properly through inhibition by the selected aptamers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the selected aptamers inhibit the function of the NS1 and lead to regular TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination by carrying out the

 <xref rid="b9-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, if we included the selected aptamers in the reaction mixtures, RIG-I was able to interact with TRIM25 and ubiquitinated without being interfered by NS1 (lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that the selected aptamers suppress the NS1 activity and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination occurs regularly.
