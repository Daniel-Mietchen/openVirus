<p>We carried out pull down assay to determine whether the selected RNA aptamers can inhibit the direct interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and known to interact with more than 50 proteins (
 <xref rid="b20-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Marc, 2014</xref>). Of many protein partners of the NS1, TRIM25 is involved in RIG-I signaling pathway, and sequestration of TRIM25 by NS1 leads to block the activation of RIG-I CARD. Although interaction mode is not clear in the present study, the selected aptamers were able to successfully inhibit the interaction of NS1 with TRIM25. This implies that the aptamers is effective in protecting the TRIM25 from NS1, thereby promoting the induction of IFN. We further investigated the effect of the selected aptamers on the RIG-I ubiquitination, which is necessary for RIG-I CARD to bind to a downstream protein partner, MAVS, of mitochondria (

 <xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>), further investigations also showed that the selected aptamers can induce IFN (

 <xref rid="f5-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our results indicate that a blocking the NS1 function is one of the most promising strategies to inhibit the viral replication. In fact, in addition to nucleic acid aptamer, many attempts have been made to discover small molecule-based NS1 antagonists targeting the interaction of NS1-dsRNA or NS1-protein partners (
