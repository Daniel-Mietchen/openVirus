<p>To cope with invasion of incoming pathogens, host cells have a self-defense system, innate immune response, such as TLRs or RIG-I like receptors. One of the primary roles in innate immunity is induction of IFN, antiviral cytokine of the host cells. Most of viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent the host’s innate immune response by inhibition of IFN production. Influenza also has such an IFN blocking system, NS1, which is able to antagonize IFN induction by preventing IRF-3 and NF-κB from activation. Therefore, NS1 is regarded as a good target for development of therapeutic agents such as small organic compounds and nucleic acids (

Regarding the molecular mechanism how NS1 suppresses the IFN production, as of yet, precise mechanism remains unclear even though many attempts have been made. However, of the suggested mechanisms relevant to RIG-I pathway, it is most likely that NS1 interferes with RIG-I signaling pathway by inhibiting the RIG-I ubiquitination by E3 ligase TRIM25 (
