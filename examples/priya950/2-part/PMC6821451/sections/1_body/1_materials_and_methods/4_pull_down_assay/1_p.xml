<p>MBP-TRIM25 was prepared as described in 
 <xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials</xref>. MBP-TRIM25 (10 μg) was immobilized on 10 μl of amylose beads for 1 h at room temperature. GST-NS1 (10 μg) was mixed with the 2 or 5 μg of selected aptamer for 1 h at room temperature, and then TRIM25 coated amylose beads were incubated with aptamer-NS1 complex for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS, the proteins bound to the beads were heated to 95°C for 2 min and analyzed by western blotting. MBP-TRIM25 and GST-NS1 were detected with MBP antibody-HRP (1:1,000 in PBST) and GST antibody-HRP (1:1,000 in PBST), respectively. The bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system and ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, USA).
