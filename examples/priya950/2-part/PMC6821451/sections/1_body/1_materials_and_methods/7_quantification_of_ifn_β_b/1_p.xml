<p>HEK293T cells (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA6-AIV NS1 and the indicated amount of aptamers using lipofectamine
 <sup>TM</sup> 2000. After 6 h incubation, the media was substituted with DMEM containing 1% polyI:C. After 48 h, total RNA was isolated using easy-BLUE
 <sup>TM</sup> Total RNA Extraction kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of RNA was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm. Extracted RNA (1 μg) was used to synthesize cDNA using Maxim RT premix kit (iNtRON Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using synthesized cDNA and the SYBR green PCR Master Mix by a StepOnePlus
 <sup>TM</sup> (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR consists of a 10 min polymerase enzyme activation step at 95°C, and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min. The following primer pairs were used: INF-β forward primer (5′-AAACTCATGAGCAGTCTGCA-3′), INF-β reverse primer (5′-AGGAGATCTTCAGTTTCGGAGG-3′); human β-actin forward primer (5′-AGCGAGCATCCCCCAAAGTT-3′), human β-actin reverse primer (5′-AGGGCACGAAGGCTCATCATT-3′).
