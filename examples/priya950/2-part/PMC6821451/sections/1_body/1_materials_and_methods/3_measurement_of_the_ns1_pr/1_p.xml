<p>Glutathione coated plate (Pierce Biotechnology, USA) was incubated with 100 μl/well of GST-NS1 (100 nM in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS with Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h, and followed by incubation with various concentrations of aptamers (100 μl/well in PBS) for another 1 h at room temperature. Unbound GST-NS1 proteins were detected by incubating with 100 μl/well of NS1 antibody (1:1,000 in PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and 100 μl/well of goat-anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:1,000 in PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 μl/well of 3,3′,5,5′-tetrametylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Merck, Germany) was added to detect the bound HRP. The color developing reaction was stopped with 0.5 N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and the absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a TRIAD microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). The percentage of inhibition (Y axis) was calculated from the following equation: inhibition percentage = 100 – [(Abs/A
 <sub>0</sub>) × 100], where Abs is the absorbance in the presence of aptamer and A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance in the absence of aptamer.
