<p>To prevent the amplification of influenza, the host cells initiate innate immune response by recognizing conserved motif or pathogen-associated molecule patterns of incoming pathogen. This innate immunity is accomplished by pattern-recognition receptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) (

To evade hostâ€™s innate immune response, influenza has evolved a few strategies for viral replication. Influenza NS1 is known to be one of the most important proteins to counteract the antiviral IFN production of the host.
