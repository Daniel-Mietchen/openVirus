<p>In the present study, we isolated RNA aptamers specific to influenza NS1 protein. Because nucleic acid aptamers have comparable binding affinities with corresponding antibodies, they are regarded as potential candidates for the development of therapeutic agents or diagnostic probes (
 <xref rid="b4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Brody and Gold, 2000</xref>). The selected RNA aptamers bind to NS1 specifically and inhibit the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. This leads to recover TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and subsequent IFN induction. We also found that viral replication was suppressed in the presence of aptamers, which suggests that the selected RNA aptamers can be developed as a useful therapeutic agent in future.
