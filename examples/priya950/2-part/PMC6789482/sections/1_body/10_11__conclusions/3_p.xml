<p>Other promising vaccine formulations are at the preclinical evaluation stage. One example is a subunit recombinant PC vaccine that was produced in a secreted form from the hamster ovary cell line, which was stably transfected with a single polycistronic vector encoding the five PC genes; in mice, this was found to induce neutralizing antibody titers that were 100â€“1000-fold higher than those induced by natural infection in humans [

The multi-antigenic vaccine elicited potent humoral immune responses that neutralized different HCMV strains, exhibiting also an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and polyfunctional T cell responses [
