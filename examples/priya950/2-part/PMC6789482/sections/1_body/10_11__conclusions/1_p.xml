<p>The identification of HCMV glycoprotein complexes and the cellular receptors involved in virus entry is fundamental in understanding the mechanisms of HCMV infection and neutralization. This has prompted the development of novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of HCMV infection. In particular, the identification of the PC as a major determinant of HCMV cellular tropism and the most important target of human neutralizing antibodies supported the therapeutic use of the anti-PC antibody and the inclusion of the PC in vaccine formulations. Recently, a phase II clinical trial showed that the administration of a combination of two mAbs (one human to gH and one murine humanized to PC) reduced HCMV infection and disease in high-risk kidney transplant recipients [
