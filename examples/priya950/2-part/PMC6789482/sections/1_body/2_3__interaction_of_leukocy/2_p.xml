<p>The pathogenetic mechanism underlying the transfer of virus and viral products from infected endothelial cells to leukocytes seems to occur through the following sequential steps: attraction, adhesion, membrane fusion, and then transfer. Attraction to infected endothelial cells may be mediated by the granulocyte-attractant action of cellular chemokines, such as IL-8 and GroÎ±, which are produced by infected endothelial cells [

The next step is adhesion between leukocytes and infected endothelial cells, possibly mediated by the interaction between ICAM-1 on infected endothelial cells and its ligands, the leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 on PMNLs, and Mac-1 on monocytes. Both ligands belong to the CD11/18 integrin subfamily. When cell-to-cell contact/adhesion was immunologically prevented, no transfer occurred of virus or virus products from endothelial cells to either PMNLs or monocytes [

In 2004, a locus in the HCMV genome was identified (see below), which appeared to be essential for both infection of endothelial cells (endothelial cell-tropism) and leukocytes (leuko-tropism).
