<p>Apart from endothelial cells and leukocytes, epithelial cells are the cell type most commonly infected in vivo in patients with disseminated HCMV infection. Autopsy findings on AIDS patients who died of disseminated infection showed that epithelial cells are the ones that are predominantly infected in lungs, gastrointestinal tract, secretory glands, and kidneys [
