<p>The investigation of the genetic determinants of endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism started in 2002 with a joint project by Italian and German researchers. By cloning an endothelial cell-tropic HCMV isolate (VR1814) as a bacterial artificial chromosome, they generated a stable genetic material that was used in mutagenesis screens [

Initially, the researchers’ attention was steered towards the unique long b’ (ULb’) region of the HCMV genome as the prime candidate for identifying genetic determinants of endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism. First, it was found that, unlike for the murine CMV, HCMV UL45 (ribonucleotide reductase homolog) was not the genetic determinant of HCMV endothelial cell-tropism, since it was dispensable for the in vitro growth of HCMV in endothelial cells [

Secondly, the loss of endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism in AD169 and Towne strains was associated with (but was not due to) the loss of most of the ULb’ region (which moreover is true only for the Towne varS variant, but not in the varL variant [

 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thirdly, the low-passage clinical Toledo strain, which was unable to infect endothelial cells, displayed an ULb’ inversion with respect to recent clinical isolates. Finally, an endothelial cell-tropism-deficient plaque-purified variant carrying a UL132-130 deletion within the ULb’ region was selected from a recent endothelial cell-tropic clinical isolate following its propagation in fibroblasts [
