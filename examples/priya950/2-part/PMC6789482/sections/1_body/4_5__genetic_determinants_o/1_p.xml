<p>At the beginning of the 2000s, the conviction grew that some genetic mutation must have occurred in the HCMV genome during propagation of laboratory-adapted strains in fibroblast cultures. This assumption was strengthened by the observation that any new clinical isolate extensively propagated in vitro in fibroblasts led to the selection of virus variants that were neither able to transfer virus and viral products from infected cells to leukocytes, nor to grow in endothelial cells [

Based on the observation that this was a hallmark of all laboratory-adapted HCMV strains, as well as fibroblast-passaged clinical isolates, we proposed endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism as surrogate markers of pathogenicity for HCMV virulent strains, while their absence should be considered a marker of virus attenuation [
