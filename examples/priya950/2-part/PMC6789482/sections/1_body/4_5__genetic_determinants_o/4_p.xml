<p>During the course of a two-year study, it became evident that it was the UL128-131 locus (UL128L) that was essential for both HCMV endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments corroborated this conclusion. Firstly, the introduction of targeted mutations into the UL128L consistently caused loss of HCMV tropism, whereas any mutation introduced into any other gene of ULbâ€™ did not affect it. The second loss-of-function proof consisted of the detection of spontaneous mutations of natural viral variants within UL128L, which were detrimental to both endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism. In particular, eight independent HCMV clinical strains that had extensively propagated in fibroblast exhibited a series of spontaneous mutations, each affecting the coding sequence of one gene within the UL128L.
