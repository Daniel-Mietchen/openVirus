<p>In the course of this line of investigation, it was surprising to find that both properties were recovered in the Towne and AD169 laboratory-propagated viral strains, following adaptation to growth in endothelial cells. Interestingly, endothelial cell-tropism was restored much earlier than leuko-tropism [

The identity of the laboratory and endothelial cell-tropic variants of both AD169 and Towne strains suggested that even a minor variation of the viral genome (e.g., mutation reversion) was likely to be responsible for the loss/rescue of the tropism. Furthermore, the Toledo strain, at that time considered to be a prototype of wild-type HCMV strains, was shown to lack both endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism (just like laboratory-adapted HCMV strains), whereas the endothelial cell-tropic Toledo variant possessed a highly-divergent genome, suggesting that it arose from an unrelated strain [
