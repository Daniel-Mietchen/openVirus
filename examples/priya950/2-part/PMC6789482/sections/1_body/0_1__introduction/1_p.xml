<p>Following the advent and the rapid expansion of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections caused by both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, as well as the administration of immunosuppressive drugs required for organ and stem cell transplantation, the rate of disseminated HCMV infections reached a peak, thus giving rise to the study of their pathogenesis. Using a double-staining method, including one monoclonal antibody (mAb) staining the cell type and another staining the HCMV gene products, the cells most frequently identified as permissive to HCMV in vivo in different organs of patients with disseminated infection were found to be endothelial cells, epithelial cells, human fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. Of the hematogenous cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells from the myeloid lineage were found to be permissive to HCMV, whereas no cells from the lymphoid lineage were [
