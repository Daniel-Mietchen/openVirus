<p>Since its first isolation in the 1950s, HCMV has been routinely recovered from and propagated in fibroblast cells. However, while the gH/gL/pUL128L PC is required for infection of both epithelial cells and endothelial cells, it is dispensable for infection of fibroblasts. Infection of fibroblasts, in contrast, and probably infection of all cell types by cell-free HCMV, requires gH/gL to bind to another glycoprotein, gO, to form the gH/gL/gO trimer complex (TC), as reported [

 <xref rid="B52-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. While co-expression of gH, gL, and gO in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus did not produce detectable gH/gL/gO TC, gH/gL/gO complexes were produced in a mammalian cell system using triple plasmid transfection [

 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and occurs by pH-independent direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, unlike pH- and endocytosis-dependent HCMV entry into epithelial cells/endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B47-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the mechanism of entry into fibroblasts is still under discussion. Recent observations suggest that it may occur via a rapid micropinocytosis [
 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or even by direct fusion with the outer plasma membrane through the fusogenic activity of gB [
