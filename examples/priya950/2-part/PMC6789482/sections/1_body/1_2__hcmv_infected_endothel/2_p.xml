<p>Concomitant with the presence of CCECs, generally in even greater proportions, two subpopulations of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and monocytes, were found to carry infectious HCMV and virus products in the blood of patients with disseminated infection [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ability of both PMNLs and monocytes to carry infectious viruses and spread viral infections was shown by the consistent virus recovery from leukocytes drawn ex vivo from immunocompromised patients, following co-culture with susceptible endothelial cells or fibroblasts. This finding documented that virus uptake by leukocytes did not result in virus degradation. Conversely, it was shown that HCMV replication in both PMNLs and monocytes was blocked after immediate-early (IE) antigen synthesis [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on the results reported above, there is strong evidence that both CCECs and PMNLs contribute directly to disseminated infection.
