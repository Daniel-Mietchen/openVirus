<p>A third assay, developed at the beginning of the 1990s by several groups, was the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the quantification (QPCR) of HCMV DNA in blood leukocytes (leukoDNAemia) and plasma (plasmaDNAemia) or whole blood (DNAemia). For several years, it was possible to monitor HCMV infections closely in immunocompromised patients by simultaneously performing antigenemia, viremia, and DNAemia assays [

Finally, two additional assays were developed, both of which were related to the HCMV properties of endothelial cell- and leuko-tropism: the nucleic-acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technique for the detection of both IE and late mRNAs [
