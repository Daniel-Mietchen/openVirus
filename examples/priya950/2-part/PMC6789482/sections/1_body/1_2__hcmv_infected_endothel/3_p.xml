<p>Taken together, the data reported above allowed us to propose a model for the study of the interaction between infected endothelial cells and leukocytes [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. According to this model, following chemoattraction of PMNLs by infected endothelial cells through a virus-encoded Î±-chemokine (or host-encoded or a combination of both) and attachment to endothelial cells through the interaction between CD18 and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), discrete points of fusion between adjacent cellular membranes are established, allowing virus and viral products to be transferred to PMNLs [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Then, PMNLs carrying the infectious virus can detach from endothelial cells and be transported through the bloodstream to newly-uninfected endothelial cells of blood vessels, thus transmitting the infection to distant sites.
