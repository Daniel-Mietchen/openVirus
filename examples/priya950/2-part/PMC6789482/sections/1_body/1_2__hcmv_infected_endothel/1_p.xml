<p>In immunosuppressed patients, HCMV can cause either disseminated infection or end-organ disease. The extent of HCMV infection of endothelial cells in vivo was shown in findings on histological sections from nearly all organs of patients who died of AIDS and disseminated HCMV infection [

HCMV-infected endothelial cells were widespread throughout the body along the vessel walls; they often invaded the vessel lumen and detached, thus entering the blood stream as circulating cytomegalic endothelial cells (CCECs), which were often detected in the peripheral blood of immunocompromised patients with disseminated infection (
