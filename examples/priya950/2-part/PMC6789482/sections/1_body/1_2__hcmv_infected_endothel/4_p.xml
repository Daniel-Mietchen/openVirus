<p>These observations prompted the need for more rapid diagnostic assays than virus culture to monitor HCMV disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients. The first assay, developed at the end of the 1980s, was HCMV antigenemia, i.e., the assay that employs cytospin preparations to detect peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) that are positive for a viral protein. This protein was initially thought to be the immediate-early protein p72 [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This method provided a rapid diagnostic tool for the quantification of infectious virus in blood in less than 24 h and a rapid evaluation of the efficacy of antiviral treatment in patients with disseminated infection, except in cases where a drug-resistant strain was emerging.
