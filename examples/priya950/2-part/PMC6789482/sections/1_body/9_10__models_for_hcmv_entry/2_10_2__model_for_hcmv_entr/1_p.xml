<p>PC binding to Nrp2, and possibly to OR14I1, appears to promote endocytosis of virus particles into epithelial cells/endothelial cells. Then, following gB activation by the gH/gL component of the PC (or gH/gL/gO), the release of virus particles from the endosomal compartment into the cell may be triggered by acidification of the vesicle (

 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], endocytosis of virions may be induced in an Nrp2-independent manner following gH/gL/gO interaction with an as yet unknown cellular surface receptor, followed by interaction of the PC with Nrp2. In other words, it is likely that both TC and PC are required for infection of epithelial cells/endothelial cells, but the emerging hypothesis is that the gH/gL component of both TC and PC serves as the first activator of the fusogenic activity of gB through a conformational change in HCMV gL occurring upon receptor binding [

 <xref rid="B79-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. We also find it intriguing that HCMV would use two pathways (one pH-dependent and the other pH-independent) to infect different cell types. In addition, PC-containing virus strains can infect PDGFRÎ±-null fibroblasts because of the documented presence of an Nrp2 receptor on fibroblasts [
