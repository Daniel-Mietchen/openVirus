<p>The role of the olfactory receptor OR14I1 in HCMV infection of epithelial cells was recently established in a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen on epithelial cells expressing Cas9 and a single-guide RNA library [

The setup of the experimental study was based on the presumption that, by knocking out genes that are important for HCMV entry, cells will become resistant to infection and, hence, survive. To this end, epithelial cells were repeatedly exposed to HCMV for three months, and cellular clones resistant to viral infection underwent targeted sequencing, which identified OR14I1 (and to a lesser extent Nrp2) as the gene required for productive HCMV entry [

OR14I1 is a seven-domain transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor of the olfactory receptor family, which was found by Kowalik and colleagues to mediate HCMV attachment to epithelial cellsâ€™ surface and virus entry via endocytosis. In addition, they showed that OR14I1 downstream signaling mediated by the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A/AKT pathway was required for HCMV infection [
