<p>Although it had been known for several years that the TC is required for HCMV infection of fibroblasts, the cellular receptor for the TC was not identified until 2016, when Perez and colleagues demonstrated that the platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor (PDGFRα) is a cellular receptor for HCMV gH/gL/gO TC [

 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], it was discovered that the virus phosphorylated PDGFRα in fibroblasts, but not in epithelial cells, which lack PDGFRα. This was achieved by investigating the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) following exposure of epithelial cells (ARPE-19) or fibroblasts to HCMV. Using the recombinant TC and PC, immunoprecipitation studies coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that the gH/gL/gO TC directly interacted with PDGFRα, thus establishing the identity of a cellular receptor for TC.
