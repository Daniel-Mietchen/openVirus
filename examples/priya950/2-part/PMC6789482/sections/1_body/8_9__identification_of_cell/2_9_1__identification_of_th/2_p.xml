<p>To further investigate the role played by PDGFRα in HCMV entry, a genetic approach was adopted, as follows: (i) downregulation of PDGFRα by short hairpin RNA markedly inhibited infection of fibroblasts by the PC-mutated viral strain AD169, but did not affect fibroblast infection by the wild-type VR1814; (ii) accordingly, a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of PDGFRα markedly reduced infection by AD169, but not the VR1814 HCMV strain, in the haploid cell line HAP-1; (iii) finally, using a lentiviral-mediated overexpression approach, it was found that the overexpression of PDGFRα in epithelial cells made the cells susceptible to AD169 infection, simultaneously increasing infection by VR1814. Taken together, these results showed that wild-type VR1814 uses two alternative pathways for entry into cells; one is dependent on PDGFRα, and the other appears to involve the ErbB family members (exploited by the PC; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec9dot2-vaccines-07-00070">Section 9.2</xref> below), whereas the mutated AD169 virus relies only on PDGFRα.
