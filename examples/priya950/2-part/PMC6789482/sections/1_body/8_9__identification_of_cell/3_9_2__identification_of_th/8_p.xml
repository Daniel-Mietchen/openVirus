<p>In addition, using chemical cross-linking coupled to MS analysis on the same samples that were used for EM analysis, the interaction of Nrp2 and PC was investigated (

 <xref rid="B72-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This analysis detected several intra- and inter-molecular interactions within the Pentamer-Nrp2 complex. In particular, it showed that the four domains (a1-a2-b1-b2) of the extra-cellular region of Nrp2 interacted with distinct regions of the PC. Specifically, a1 mapped near the elbow formed by the V-shaped UL128L components of the PC, while the a2-b1-b2 domains occupied the larger densities emerging from the UL128L region of the PC. These data suggested that the a1 domain rearranges itself in relation to the remainder of Nrp2 upon PC binding. Moreover, the authors confirmed by SEC that the combination of all four extracellular domains of Nrp2 was required for PC binding, since neither Nrp2-a1a2 nor Nrp2-a1b1b2 alone were able to bind it.
