<p>The system was validated by testing the TC, which showed high binding affinity to PDGFRα, as expected [
 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Then, the PC was assayed using the new test system, which revealed that Nrp2 was the main interaction partner for PC in the single transmembrane panel. Other single transmembrane receptors were found to have different degrees of affinity with either the TC (i.e., TGFβRIII and neuroregulin2 (NRG2)), or the PC (THBD, LILRB3, CD46, and FCAR). The role of these putative co-receptors needs to be further investigated. The results of the screening were confirmed by biolayer interferometry, which showed high-affinity binding of the TC to PDGFRα, as well as to TGFβRIII, but not to NRG2. Similarly, the PC was shown to bind to Nrp2, THBD, and LILRB3 (weak interaction), but not to FCAR.
