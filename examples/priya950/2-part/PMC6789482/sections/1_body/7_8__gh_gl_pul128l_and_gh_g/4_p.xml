<p>Using the same purified soluble forms of TC and PC employed in defining their molecular architecture, the binding sites for the potently neutralizing human mAbs mentioned above [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] were defined on their surfaces [
 <xref rid="B64-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. By means of mass spectrometry paired with chemical crosslinking, three neutralizing epitopes were identified in gH (conserved in both TC and PC), along with five different neutralizing sites that were determined in the UL128L portion of PC [
 <xref rid="B64-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, EM and 3D reconstructions identified two distinct and opposite surfaces that were reactive with neutralizing mAbs in the pUL128L region of the PC.
