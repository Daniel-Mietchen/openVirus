<p>Structural and biochemical characterization of HCMV TC and PC by mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analysis showed that TC and PC form two mutually-exclusive cell entry complexes [
 <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It was found that complex assembly is promoted by the formation of disulfide bonds between the cysteine 144 of gL and either the cysteine 351 of gO (TC) or the cysteine 162 of pUL128 (PC), thus providing a molecular explanation for the modulation of cell tropism by these two glycoprotein complexes [

 <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The UL148 gene product was found to modulate HCMV tropism by regulating the composition of alternative gH/gL complexes. In particular, the UL148 gene product is required to sustain high levels of gH/gL/gO, whereas UL148-null virus has defects in gH/gL/gO maturation and shows enhanced infectivity of epithelial cells [
