<p>Direct confirmation of these findings was obtained in 2010, when the combination of memory B-cell immortalization and nAb determination in different target cells allowed researchers to identify two panels of human nAbs induced by natural infection [

These mAbs displayed similar neutralizing activity (within the nanomolar range of concentration) on both epithelial cells/endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The second panel included numerous mAbs that displayed neutralizing activity at picomolar concentrations, specifically on epithelial cells/endothelial cells, but which lacked neutralizing activity on fibroblasts. mAbs of this second group possessed two properties: (i) they reacted mostly with antigenic sites expressed by two or more genes within UL128L, and in particular the UL130+UL131 dimer; (ii) owing to the high degree of amino acid conservation among UL128L gene products of different virus strains (&gt;90%, [
