<p>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by female mosquitoes, mainly of the species 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and, to a lesser extent, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. There are 4 distinct serotypes—DENV-1 to DENV-4—of the virus, and all serotypes are presently circulating in endemic areas. DENV infects cells of the human immune system and other cell types, leading to symptoms that include high fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, rash, and mild bleeding. In severe cases, plasma leaks out of the circulatory system, which can be fatal. The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. One recent study estimated that approximately 390 million people are infected, of which 96 million manifest clinically each year [
