<p>Studies of mutations in the Fc region confirm that mAb half-lives can be extended, and the goal of a single injection to cover an entire season for those infections with seasonality is now a possibility.

For many infectious diseases, we are now seeing the buildup of a portfolio of potential antibodies. In cases in which little progress has been made, a systematic attempt is needed to identify the antibodies resulting from successful control of an infection in patients.</p>
