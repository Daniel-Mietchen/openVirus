<p>The ability of mAbs to protect against a lethal cryptococcal infection in mice was first demonstrated over three decades ago [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], with subsequent work demonstrating the efficacy of various mAbs that target the polysaccharide capsule, an essential virulence factor and the primary host–pathogen interface of 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Among these, mAb 18B7 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and was found to produce a modest reduction in circulating cryptococcal antigen. Further development has been hampered, however, by difficulties in securing funding for a disease for which financial returns are likely to be low—a common problem for neglected infectious diseases. Subsequent studies have examined mAbs that target cryptococcal melanin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], β-glucan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], or glucosylceramide ([
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]; see [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] for additional in vivo and in vitro examples). Host CD40 has also been targeted to stimulate the immune response [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In addition to highlighting the potential of mAbs as therapeutics, these studies have demonstrated the diversity of inhibitory actions that mAbs can perform on cryptococcal cells, which can include opsonization and increased phagocytosis, inhibition of fungal growth, capsular polysaccharide release and biofilm formation, antibody-mediated target cleavage, and augmentation of the host response [
