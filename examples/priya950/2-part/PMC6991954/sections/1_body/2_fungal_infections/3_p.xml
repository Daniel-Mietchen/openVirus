 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> predominantly causes opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS and is responsible for a large burden of AIDS-related disease and death in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Although the rate of infection has decreased in recent years through greatly improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), mortality in infected patients has not declined, demonstrating the failure of antifungal development to keep pace with improved antiviral treatment. Cryptococcosis first manifests as a pulmonary disease but spreads hematogenously to the cerebrospinal fluid and brain to cause meningitis and meningoencephalitis, adding the complexity of crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier to drug development.
