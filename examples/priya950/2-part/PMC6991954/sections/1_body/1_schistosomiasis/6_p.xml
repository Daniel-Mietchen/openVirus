<p>Clues about other possible ways forward, in terms of antigen selection, come from a variety of areas.First, 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> are helminths (or flatworms), and the initial immune response is a characteristically strong T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine reaction, which is not seen in viral or bacterial infections and is less pronounced in protozoan infections. The cytokines that are released include interleukin (IL)-5, which drives the production of eosinophils to attack the parasite, and IL-4 and IL-13, which drive the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Epidemiological studies in endemic areas suggest that an age-dependent immunity may develop against infection, or against reinfection after treatment [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. There is a good correlation between this protection and the development of IgE antibodies, resulting from Th2 responses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A hybridoma that produces a monoclonal IgE antibody to 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>japonicum</italic>, SJ18ε.1, was identified [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This mAb was protective in an in vitro, antigen-dependent, cellular cytotoxicity assay with rat macrophages or eosinophils and also in vivo during the early phase of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It recognizes a 97 kDa antigen, Sm-97 (Schistosoma mansoni-97), identified as paramyosin, a muscle protein unique to invertebrates [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The epitope of paramyosin recognized by SJ18ε.1 was determined to be the SJ18ε.1
 <sub>359−362</sub> sequence Ile–Arg–Arg–Ala [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Injection of mice with paramyosin provides protection against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>japonicum</italic> equivalent protein, Sj97 (S. japonicum-97), has also been proposed as a vaccine target [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], although no further development has been reported. Taken together, this suggests that an alternative approach to generating therapeutic mAbs would be to produce IgG mAbs targeting paramyosin and potentially other soluble, nonsurface antigens [
