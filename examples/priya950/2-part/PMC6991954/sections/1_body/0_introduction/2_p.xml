<p>The success of mAbs starts with the general applicability of the technology used to make them. Antibodies can be developed that have not only high affinity for their targets but also high selectivity, meaning they are less likely to have unwanted side effects and unexpected safety problems. mAbs are particularly good at targeting cell-surface proteins and circulating protein factors; this is in contrast to small molecules, in which cell surface protein–protein interactions have proved difficult to block. In addition, there has been great progress in the development of technology. Early generations of antibodies for human use were developed from mAbs developed in mice, antibodies that were then humanized. Recently, the technology used peptide and antibody display on phages, for which part of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Sir Gregory P. Winter [
