<p>A second reason for the popularity of antibodies in recent years is their success rate in clinical development. Once an antibody reaches testing in humans, it has a success rate of 17% to 25% for approval as a new medicine [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], compared with 5% to 10% for small molecules. This success rate is partly due to the exquisite selectivity of mAbs, enabling them to distinguish between closely related molecular targets. In the case of infectious disease, this selectivity can be absolute, since antibodies can be generated that are specific for the invading pathogen and do not cross-react with host tissues. This lack of cross-reactivity with human tissue can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry on both adult and embryonic tissues prior to the start of clinical trials. This is in stark contrast to small molecules, in which sometimes unexpected on- and off-target safety signals are frequently seen in the later stages of clinical development, resulting in expensive late-stage attrition. In addition, antibodies show a relatively narrow range of variation in pharmacokinetic exposure, facilitating early estimation of the human effective dose. This is unlike true xenobiotics, whose metabolism and elimination are usually driven by cytochromes, an enzyme class that is encoded by highly polymorphic genes in a process that is, furthermore, sensitive to drugâ€“drug interactions.
