  <title>Weights of mice following feeding on different diets.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (7 mice per group) were fed a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or a control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. 
   <bold>A.</bold> Weights were measured weekly or bi-weekly following the initiation of feeding. Weights are plotted as the percent change compared to initial weight at the onset of feeding. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Leptin was measured following 8–10 weeks of feeding using an ELISA. Statistical comparisons were made using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—**** p&lt;0.0001. For A, the error bars represent standard error. For B, the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Each graph represents data obtained from at least two independent experiments. The results from one representative experiment are presented.
