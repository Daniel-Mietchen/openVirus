  <title>Local viral replication is increased in obese mice.</title>
  <p>Groups of albino C57BL/6N mice (5 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese, B), 5% protein (LP, C) or control diet (Lean, D) for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) expressing nano-luciferase (nLuc) to track replication. At different time points post-infection, mice were anesthetized, injected intraperitoneally with 20 μg/mouse of the furimazine substrate and imaged using a Perkins Elmer IVIS Spectrum machine. Mice were imaged for 15 seconds within 5 minutes of substrate administration, and photon flux (photons/second) was quantified in the hind left footpad using Living Image software (A). The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. The data are presented as flux or photons/second (p/s) present within the left footpad. The flux is used to quantify the amount of light emitted from the footpad. Representative images of mice fed different diets, infected with MAYV-nLuc, and then imaged six days following infection (B-D). An uninfected control mouse is presented as the leftmost mouse in each image. Statistical analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—** p&lt;0.01.
