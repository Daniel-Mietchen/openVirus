  <title>Viral replication in obese mice results in decreased genetic diversity.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (7 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control diet (Lean) for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) and blood was collected two days later. RNA was isolated from the serum and next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared and then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500. The FASTQ files were trimmed for adapter and low-quality sequences using BBDuk. The trimmed reads were then analyzed using the ViVAN pipeline with a coverage cutoff of &gt;100x and a p-value filter of 0.05. From the output of ViVAN, we compared both total and non-synonymous Shannon entropy (A-B), Region variation (C-D), and Region heterogeneity (E-F) as markers of genetic diversity. The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
