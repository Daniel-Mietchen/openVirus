  <title>Removing the RNA extraction step increases the quantity of RNA detected from serum samples.</title>
  <p>Serum samples from mice infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) were used to assess the necessity for an RNA extraction step before one-step quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was performed using the NEB Luna Universal Probe kit with MAYV specific primers. For RNA extractions, the Zymo Viral DNA/RNA extraction kit was used. For testing without extraction, the samples were diluted 1:5 in PBS and then used directly for qRT-PCR. Viral RNA prepared from an infectious clone was serially diluted in ten-fold dilutions and used to generate a standard curve. The sample values were then fit to this standard curve and the volumes normalized to calculate the number of genome copies per mL of serum (genomes/mL). The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical comparison was performed using a two-tailed paired t-test.
