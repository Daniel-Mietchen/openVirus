  <title>Histological scores in mice with varying nutritional status.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice were fed either 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP) or control (Lean) diet for 8â€“10 weeks. Mice were then infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Nine days post-infection, the left hind footpad was collected and placed into formalin for fixation. The fixed tissues were then sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and then scored in a blinded manner by two independent anatomic pathologists following the scoring guide presented by Hawman et al. 2013. The middle bar represents the median.</p>
