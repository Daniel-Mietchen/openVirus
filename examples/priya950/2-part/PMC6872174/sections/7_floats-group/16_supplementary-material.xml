  <title>Obese mice have reduced chronic RNA levels.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (7 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) and footpads were collected 65 days post-infection. Viral RNA was quantified using qRT-PCR. The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05.
