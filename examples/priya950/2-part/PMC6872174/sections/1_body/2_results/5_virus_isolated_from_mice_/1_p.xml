<p>To examine the role of diet on the viral genetic diversity, we performed NGS on the viral RNA isolated from mice that were fed different diets and then infected with MAYV. We sequenced viral RNA from serum samples that were isolated 2 days post-infection. Since there were no significant differences in the concentration of genomes in these samples between the groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), we used the same volume for each sample as input for library preparation. Following Illumina sequencing, we used the ViVan pipeline [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to generate diversity statistics to assess differences between viral genetic diversity in the virus from each group. Average sequencing coverage across the genome was the same for each group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, p = 0.0082 and p = 0.0086, respectively). The difference between LP and lean mice approached statistical significance (p = 0.0587 and 0.0797 for total genome and non-synonymous Shannon entropy, respectively). We next compared region variation, a marker that is affected by selective pressures. Viral RNA from obese mice showed significantly lower region variation for both overall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, p = 0.0107) and non-synonymous (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, p = 0.0129) sites compared to lean controls. We observed a trend towards lower region variation for both total and non-synonymous regions when we compared the LP and lean groups (p = 0.1044 and p = .1068, respectively). We also assessed region heterogeneity, which is not impacted by the accumulation of specific variations and is, therefore, a measure of replication fidelity. No significant differences were observed between any group for region heterogeneity (
