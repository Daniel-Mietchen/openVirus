<p>To assess the infection rate of the mosquitoes fed on individual mice, we first analyzed the data by measuring infection and transmission rates from each mouse. Mosquitoes that fed on obese mice had reduced infection and transmission rates compared to lean controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>, p = 0.0451 and 0.0443, respectively). The infection and transmission rates observed in LP and control groups were not significantly different. The infection rates for obese mice varied from 6.3–55%, LP from 15–50%, and lean controls from 35–75%. The transmission rates for obese mice varied from 0–5%, LP from 0–20%, and lean controls from 5–15%. 60% and 20% of obese and LP mice had no mosquitoes found to be transmission positive following feeding, whereas all the lean controls resulted in transmission positive mosquitoes.
