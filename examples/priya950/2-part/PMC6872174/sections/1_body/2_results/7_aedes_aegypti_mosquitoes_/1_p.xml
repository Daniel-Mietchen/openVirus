<p>Since most arboviruses must efficiently infect mosquitoes to sustain transmission, we next assessed whether mosquitoes that fed on viremic mice fed different diets would have altered vector competence. We infected groups of C57BL/6 mice fed different diets with MAYV and, two days later, groups of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (n = 16â€“20) were allowed to feed on individual mice (n = 5), resulting in 96 blood-fed mosquitoes per group. The mosquitoes were held for 10 days before bodies, to assess infection, and saliva, to assess transmission potential, were collected. The amount of infectious virus present was the same in the serum of mice from each group on the day of the transmission (
