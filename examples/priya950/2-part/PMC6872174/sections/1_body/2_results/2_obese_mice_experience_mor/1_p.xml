<p>Our goal was to determine the effect of nutrition on disease burden upon infection with an arthritogenic alphavirus. To this end, we infected mice with MAYV following the 8â€“10 week feeding period and monitored the mice for signs of morbidity, specifically weight change or footpad swelling, over time. Obese mice experienced significantly greater weight loss following MAYV challenge compared to lean mice (
