<p>BHK-21 and Vero were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Aag2 and U4.4 mosquito cell lines were initially obtained from G.P. Piljman, Wageningen University, the Netherlands and maintained at 28°C with 5% CO2 in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% P/S. An Asian genotype of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was rescued from an infectious clone of a virus initially isolated in the Caribbean [

MAYV strain TRVL 4675 and RRV strain T48 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) and infectious clones were constructed under an SP6 promoter in the same plasmid backbone of the CHIKV clone described above. The MAYV infectious clone used in this study has been described previously [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] except that Xfect RNA transfection reagent (Takara) was used to introduce RNA into cells. Virus titers were calculated by plaque assay as previously described [
