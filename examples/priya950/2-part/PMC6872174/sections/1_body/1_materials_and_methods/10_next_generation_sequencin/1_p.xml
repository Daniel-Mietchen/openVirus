<p>RNA was extracted from serum and cell culture supernatant samples using the ZR-96 Viral DNA/RNA Kit from Zymo Research (Irvine, CA, USA). Samples were then DNase treated with TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher) and purified using RNAClean XP beads (Agencourt). Library preparation for NGS was performed using the Trio RNA-Seq kit (NuGEN), which creates, amplifies, and fragments cDNA and then depletes ribosomal RNA. We then sequenced the libraries on an Illumina NextSeq500 using single-end 150bp reads.</p>
