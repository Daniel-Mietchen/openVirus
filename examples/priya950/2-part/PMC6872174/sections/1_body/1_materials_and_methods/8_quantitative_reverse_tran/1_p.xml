<p>Genomic sense viral RNA was quantified using qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was performed on unextracted serum samples that were first heat inactivated at 50°C and then diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This method was shown to be more sensitive than when RNA extraction was included [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008089.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). qRT-PCR was performed with the NEB Luna One-Step RT-qPCR for Probes mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Primers and probes used in the study are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008089.s011">S2 Table</xref> and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Leuven, Belgium). qRT-PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions except for several modifications. Trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), and bovine serum albumin (NEB) were added at a final concentration of 0.15 M, 0.5 M, and 1 mg/mL, respectively. Cycling conditions were as follows on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 (Hercules, CA, USA); 55°C for 20 minutes for reverse transcription, 95°C for 5 minutes for initial denaturation and polymerase activation followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds (denaturation), and 60°C for 1 minute (annealing/extension). Readings to measure amplification were taken after the combined annealing/extension step. The number of genomes/mL was calculated based on a series of dilutions of RNA that was generated by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription from the full-length infectious clones mentioned previously to generate a standard curve. The Ct values of the samples were then fit to the standard curve to calculate the genomes/mL (GE/mL). The genome to PFU ratios (GE:PFU) was calculated by dividing the GE/mL by the PFU/mL.
