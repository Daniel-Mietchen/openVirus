<p>Tissues were harvested from mice and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The Virginia Tech Animal Laboratory Services (ViTALS) performed paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin, and two independent anatomic pathologists read the slides. For viral titers from organs, tissues were harvested aseptically into RPMI media with 10 mM HEPES and 1% FBS containing a sterile steel 5mm pellet to a final concentration of 10% weight by volume. The tissues were homogenized using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) for 2 minutes at 30 cycles per second. Plaque assays were performed on the cleared homogenate.</p>
