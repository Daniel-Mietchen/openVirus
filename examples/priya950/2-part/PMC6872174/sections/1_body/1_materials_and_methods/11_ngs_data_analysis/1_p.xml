<p>Generated sequencing files were first trimmed for low-quality bases and adapter sequences using BBDuk (BBMap—Bushnell B.—sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). To generate a consensus sequence for comparisons, we aligned the fastq files from the MAYV stocks that were used for infection to a MAYV TRVL 4675 reference sequence (Accession MK070492.1) using BBMap. We next called variants using LoFreq and filtered the resulting vcf file to contain only variants above 50% [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with a coverage cutoff of &gt;100x and a p-value filter of 0.05. The ViVAN outputs provide an array of genetic diversity indices, including Shannon entropy, region variation, and region heterogeneity. Analysis with Vivan was performed as previously described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, for each position throughout the viral genome, base identity and their quality scores were collected. Each variant was determined to be valid using a generalized likelihood-ratio test (used to determine the total number of minority variants) and its allele rate was modified according to its covering read qualities based on a maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, a confidence interval was calculated for each allele rate. In order to correct for multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate was set at 5%. Shannon entropy provides a measure of genetic diversity associated with the uncertainty of sampling a given genomic position; higher Shannon entropy indicates higher genetic diversity. The region variation is affected by selective pressures on the virus; a high variation rate suggests the accumulation of variant alleles which may be caused by positive selective pressures. Region heterogeneity, in contrast, measures replication fidelity; a virus with a more error-prone polymerase will have higher region heterogeneity. The equations for Shannon Entropy, region variation, and region heterogeneity are presented in our previous publications [
