<p>All statistics were performed in GraphPad version 8. Weight and footpad swelling comparisons were performed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Virus or RNA levels were compared using either a one-way or two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. When analyses included a component of time, a repeated measures analysis was included since we followed the same individuals over time. Transmission/infection rates for individual mice and antibody titers were determined to follow a non-normal distribution; thus, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons. Total transmission and infection rates were compared using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Survival was compared using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For comparisons between extracted and unextracted samples for qRT-PCR, data were compared using a two-tailed paired t-test. All experiments were repeated 2–3 times unless otherwise noted. The data are presented as the result of one representative experiment.</p>
