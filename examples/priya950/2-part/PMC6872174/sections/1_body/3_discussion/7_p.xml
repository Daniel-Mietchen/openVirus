<p>Arthritogenic alphaviruses are known to cause chronic inflammation, and CHIKV RNA and protein have been found in an infected human up to 18-months post initial infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, CHIKV has been found in the infected joints of mice up to 16 weeks post-infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to assess whether nutrition influences persistent alphavirus replication in the joints of mice. We found that obese mice had significantly lower levels of RNA for both MAYV and RRV 65 days post-infection compared to lean controls. However, it is unclear what role persistent viral replication plays in chronic alphavirus disease, as long-term disease in humans is strongly associated with the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines but not necessarily viral RNA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, obesity may be involved in persistent alphavirus replication, which may be involved in chronic disease.
