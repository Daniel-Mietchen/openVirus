<p>We next performed a mosquito transmission experiment by exposing mosquitoes to viremic mice previously fed different diets. For arboviruses, most transmission cycles require both the vertebrate and invertebrate host, which are highly divergent environments, a fact that restricts arbovirus evolution [

Mosquitoes that fed on obese mice displayed reduced infection and transmission rates compared to mosquitoes fed on lean control mice, despite no differences in viremia at the time of bloodmeal acquisition. These results point towards the decreased adaptability of virus isolated from obese mice, possibly due to the reduced genetic diversity observed in sequencing data. It is also possible that lipids or other factors in the blood that are altered in obesity or lipid changes in the virions themselves altered rates of transmission to mosquitoes in obese mice. Only mosquitoes that were fully bloodfed were selected for testing, and viremia levels were not different between the groups, so each mosquito likely received roughly the same amount of infectious virus. These data suggest that obese individuals may provide a certain level of refractoriness against subsequent viral transmission. Nutrition has been linked previously to virus fitness in mice fed either a selenium or vitamin E deficient diet and then infected with Coxsackie B3 virus; the virus was found to evolve quickly to a more virulent genotype [

Finally, 10 passages of Sendai virus in mice fed a control, high-fat, or low-selenium diet did not result in differences in genetic diversity (as measured by Shannon entropy) in the virus population. However, the virus populations displayed phenotypic differences upon infection of a new host, suggesting that nutritional status influenced the virus population and resulting transmission. It is possible that their sequencing approach was not sensitive enough to detect genetic differences within the population. Given the prevalence of obesity, undernutrition, and nutrient deficiencies, future studies should elucidate the influence of nutritional status on virus fitness and adaptation to novel environments.
