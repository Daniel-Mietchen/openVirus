<p>Arthritogenic alphaviruses are globally distributed and have been responsible for several recent large outbreaks. Notably, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) re-emerged in 2004 to cause a massive outbreak in the Indian Ocean region [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which subsequently spread to the Americas in 2013, resulting in millions of cases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ross River virus (RRV) causes thousands of cases a year in Australia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and has previously caused outbreaks in the Pacific Islands [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mayaro virus (MAYV), traditionally confined to sylvatic transmission in South America, was recently isolated in Haiti for the first time, serving as a warning that urban transmission can occur [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Arthritogenic alphaviruses produce a disease that is characterized by fever, myalgia, and polyarthralgia, which can last for months or even years [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent CHIKV epidemics have been associated with an increased number of deaths, suggesting that severe disease may be more common than is typically thought [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the rise in global travel, the spread of mosquito vectors, and climate change are likely involved in the expansion of these viruses, it is conceivable that changes in human health have also facilitated spread. Specifically, worldwide obesity has tripled since 1975, and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently estimates that 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Concurrently, roughly 10% of the adult population worldwide is considered underweight [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Over- and underweight, along with nutrient deficiencies, can be classified together as malnutrition and commonly occur in the same country or even within the same family [
