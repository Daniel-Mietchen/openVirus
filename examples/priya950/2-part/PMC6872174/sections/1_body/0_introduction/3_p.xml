<p>To our knowledge, no studies have directly assessed the role of nutrition in arbovirus infection using animal models. Given the worldwide prevalence of these forms of malnutrition and arbovirus disease, it is essential to understand how these comorbidities interact. We sought to determine what role both over- and undernutrition play in alphavirus disease, replication, transmission, and virus evolution in a mouse model. To accomplish this, we fed mice different diets; a high-fat overnutrition diet (HFD) with 45% fat; a low-protein undernutrition diet (5% protein); and a control diet with similar characteristics to the other diets except for macronutrient content. Following a sustained feeding period, we infected mice with either CHIKV, MAYV, or RRV and followed infection. We observed altered virus replication and transmission to mosquitoes in obese mice. Furthermore, we noted a reduction in genetic diversity in virus isolated from obese mice. Our findings illustrate the importance of nutrition on virus infection and suggest that nutritional status may be an underappreciated host factor in arbovirus disease, transmission, and evolution.</p>
