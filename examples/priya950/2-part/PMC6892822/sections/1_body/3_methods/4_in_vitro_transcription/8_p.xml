<p id="Par64">In vitro transcription was carried out using the MegaScript Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 100 ng of template DNA and subsequent DNA removal. The RNA was purified using phenol/chloroform and resuspended in buffer containing 10 M Tris, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To determine differences in RNA secondary structure, RNA was run on native 1% agarose TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA) gels, and then supplemented with ethidiumbromide. To denature secondary structures, the RNA was mixed 1:5 with 65% formamide, 22% formalin, 13% 10× MOPS (3-(
 <italic>N</italic>-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) buffer and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. Then, samples were run on a denaturing MOPS agarose gel containing 3% formalin and ethidium bromide.
