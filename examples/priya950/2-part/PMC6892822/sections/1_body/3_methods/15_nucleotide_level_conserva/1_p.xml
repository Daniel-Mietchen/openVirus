The following options were applied to retrieve avian-adapted consensus sequences: date range: 1999–2011, complete genome, minimum length M segment sequence 1027, and exclude duplicated and laboratory strains. The following options were used to retrieve the human consensus: date range: 1999–2011, complete genome, minimum length M segment sequence 1002, and exclude duplicated and laboratory strains.
