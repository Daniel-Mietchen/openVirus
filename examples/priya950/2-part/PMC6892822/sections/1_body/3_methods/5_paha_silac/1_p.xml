<p id="Par65">A549 cells were fully labeled in SILAC DMEM (PAA) supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, antibiotics, and with either heavy (R10K8, “SILAC-H”), medium (R6K4, “SILAC-M”), or light (R0K0, “SILAC-L”) arginine and lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Cells were cultured in SILAC-L/M/H medium for at least six passages. Ten-cm dishes of confluent light-labeled cells were mock-infected, while heavy- and medium-labeled cells were infected with either Pan or Mal strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3  PFU (pore-forming unit). Virus was allowed to attach to the cells for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before the infection medium was added (SILAC DMEM containing the respective SILAC AA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM glutamine, antibiotics). Prior to pulse labeling, cells were washed with pre-warmed PBS. Methionine-depleted infection medium additionally containing 100 µM 
 <sc>l</sc>-AHA (4-azido-
 <sc>l</sc>-homoalanine; Anaspec) was added for different 4-h intervals to the cells. Cells were washed in PBS, scraped from the dish, and frozen until further sample processing. Lysis and enrichment for newly synthesized proteins was done using Click-It Protein Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen), with modifications: for the lysis, 283 µl of urea lysis buffer was used per label, samples were incubated for 20 min on ice, sonicated and cell debris was removed before SILAC label were mixed. Ten percent of sample was directly subjected to Wessel–Flügge precipitation and served as the input, and 90% were used for enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. Two hundred microliters of alkyne agarose resin was mixed with 800 µl combined cell lysate and then catalyst solution was added. The enrichment reactions were rotated head over tails for 18 h at room temperature. Enriched proteins were reduced and alkylated as indicated in the manufacturer’s instructions. Beads were then washed sequentially (each 5×) in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) wash buffer (supplied with the kit), 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 80% acetonitrile in 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.0, and 5% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were then digested in 5% acetonitrile/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight using trypsin (Promega). Peptides were then acidified, desalted, and either directly measured on a nano LC-MS/MS setup (see below) or subjected to isoelectric focusing using an OFFGEL fractionator.
