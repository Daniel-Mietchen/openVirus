<p id="Par70">Raw files of the pAHA-SILAC were analyzed with MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.1 Default settings were kept, except that “requantify” option was turned on. Label-free quantification via iBAQ calculation was enabled. Lys4/Arg6 and Lys8/Arg10 were set as labels and oxidation of methionines, n-terminal acetylation, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues were defined as variable modifications. The in silico digests of the human Uniprot database (downloaded January 2018), the protein sequences of 12 Pan and Mal Influenza virus proteins and a database containing common contaminants were done with Trypsin/P. The false discovery rate was set to 1% at both the peptide and protein level and was assessed by parallel searching a database containing the reverted sequences from the Uniprot database. The resulting text files were filtered to exclude reverse database hits, potential contaminants and proteins only identified by site (i.e., protein identifications that are only explained by a modified peptide). Plotting and statistics were done using R and figures were compiled in Illustrator (Adobe). Raw files for pSILAC were analyzed as described above, except that MaxQuant software version 1.5.2.8 was used. For the pSILAC experiment comparing Mal infection in human and avian cells, spectra were searched against a database additionally containing the uniprot entries of gallus gallus. For the pSILAC experiment comparing Pan and Pan-AV, requantify option was set to off.</p>
