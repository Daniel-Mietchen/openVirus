<p id="Par43">Cloning was done using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Entry clones were generated from pDONR221 vector, expression clones from pDEST26-Flag/HA destination vector. Pan/Mal chimeric constructs were generated by replacing appropriate restriction fragments of wild-type pDEST26-Flag/HA-Pan and pDEST26-Flag/HA-Mal, respectively, with the corresponding synthetic chimeric DNA inserts purchased as gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies.</p>
