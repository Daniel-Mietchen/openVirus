<p id="Par38">Gene fragments containing the coding sequence (nucleotides 29–1007) of segment 7 of A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 (GenBank accession: CY077423), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (GenBank accession: HM006762.1), A/swine/Netherlands/25/1980 (GenBank accession: Z26862.1), A/BrevigMission/1/1918 (GenBank accession: AY130766, “p1918”), a mutated A/BrevigMission/1/1918 (with the following point mutations: C718T, A725C, A754G, G760A, G766A, A772G, “p1918 w/ Mal 707–779”), and a mutated version of A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 (with the following point mutations: G712A, A714G, G740A, C745T, G754A, A760G, “A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 w/ Pan 707–779”) fused to attB1 and attB2 sites were ordered as synthetic double-stranded DNA fragments from Integrated DNA Technologies. The coding sequences of Pan and Mal M segments (nucleotides 29–1007) were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) and fused to attB1 and attB2 sites by PCR using the following primers:</p>
