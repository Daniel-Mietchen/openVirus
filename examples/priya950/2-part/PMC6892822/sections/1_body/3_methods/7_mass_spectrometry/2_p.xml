<p id="Par69">Peptides from pSILAC samples were separated by 4 h gradients and ionized with ESI source and analyzed on Q-Exactive HF-X instrument (Thermo Fisher) in data-dependent mode. The full scans were performed with a resolution of 60,000, a target value of 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ions and a maximum injection time of 10 ms. The MS/MS scans were performed with a 15,000 resolution, a 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> target value and a 22 ms maximum injection time.
