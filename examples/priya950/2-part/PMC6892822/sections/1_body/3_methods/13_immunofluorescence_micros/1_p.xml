<p id="Par79">A549 cells were grown on glass coverslips and infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 1 FFU (fluorescence-forming unit)/cell. At the indicated time points post infection, cells were fixed for 15 min in 2.5% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with specific antibody against NP antigen (clone AA5H, Bio-Rad/Serotec, 1:1000, #MCA400) in 3% BSA for 1 h. After washing, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:1000) in 3% BSA. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) by adding to the secondary antibody solution. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol and images were acquired by an Eclipse A1 laser-scanning microscope using the NIS-Elements software package (Nikon). At least 140 cells were counted per condition to quantify the subcellular distribution of NP using the ImageJ software.</p>
