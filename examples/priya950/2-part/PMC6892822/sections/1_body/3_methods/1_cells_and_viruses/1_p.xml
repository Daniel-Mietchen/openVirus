<p id="Par37">A549 (ATCC CCL-185) and HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and antibiotics. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type II cells (ATCC CRL-2936) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum. DF-1 (ATCC CRL-12203) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 4 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Stocks of the avian influenza virus A/Mallard/439/2004 (H3N2) (Mal) (GISAID accession numbers EPI859640-EPI859647) were grown in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 2 days at 37 °C. A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) (Pan) (NCBI accession numbers: DQ487333–DQ487340), Pan + Mal M reassortant and Pan-Av mutant virus were grown in MDCK type II cells. Virus stocks were titrated on MDCK type II cells by measuring plaque-forming units (PFUs) or fluorescence-forming units (FFUs). For the latter, cells were infected with different dilutions of virus stock for 5 h. Then, cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed, and permeabilized by incubation in 75% ethanol for at least 12 h at 4 °C and stained with specific antibody against NP antigen (clone AA5H, Bio-Rad/Serotec, 1:1000, #MCA400). An Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Invitrogen) was used as secondary reagent (1:1000). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the FACSDiva software package.
