<p id="Par78">Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (125 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h on a rotating wheel and centrifuged. Supernatant was supplemented with NuPage LDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen), 50 mM DTT, and heated for 10 min at 70 °C. Samples were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) before being blotted onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a wet blotting system (Invitrogen). Specific antibodies against the HA epitope (clone 3F10, Roche, 1:500, #11867423001), vezatin (clone B-1, Santa Cruz, 1:1000, #sc271347), M1 (clone GA2B, Bio-Rad, 1:1000, #MCA401) or M2 (polyclonal, RRID: AB_2549706, Thermo Fisher, 1:1000, #PA5-32233) and suitable horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were used.
