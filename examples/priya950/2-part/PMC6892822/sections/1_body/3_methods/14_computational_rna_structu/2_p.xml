 </sup>. We used RNA-Decoder to identify the RNA secondary structure that is best supported by the evolutionary signals contained in the two input alignments (the so-called maximum-likelihood structure). The predictions by RNA-Decoder also included the posterior base-pairing probabilities for each base pair of the predicted RNA structure. Predicted base pairs with a base-pairing probability smaller than 25% were omitted from the RNA structure visualization. Note that each multiple sequence alignment was analyzed by RNA-Decoder in one chunk, that is, without partitioning it artificially into sub-alignments.
