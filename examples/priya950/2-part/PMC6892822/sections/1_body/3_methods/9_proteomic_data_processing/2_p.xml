<p id="Par72">SILAC ratios of host proteins were processed by first transforming them into logâ€‰2 space. The median SILAC-H/L and SILAC-M/L ratios from the input samples were used to estimate the mixing ratio of the input and the H/L and M/L ratios after the enrichment were adjusted correspondingly. SILAC-H/M ratio that relate to the Pan/Mal (or Mal/Pan) infection treatment were normalized to 0. Then, the replicate measurements were averaged. Proteins that were quantified in only one replicate were excluded. Later the top 2% of proteins (highest log2 fold-change) of either Pan/Mock or Mal/Mock condition were selected and multi-set GO enrichment was performed using Metascape tool (
