<p id="Par71">Two MaxQuant output files were used: proteinGroups.txt and evidence.txt. iBAQ values from infected samples were extracted from proteinGroups.txt. iBAQ values were first normalized by scaling to the iBAQ protein median across all mock-infected samples. This assumes that there are no differences in overall protein synthesis for different mock-infected samples. The iBAQ values were averaged for the corresponding label-swap replicates and proteins were categorized as host or viral. For estimating the newly synthesized protein mass, intensity values of H and M SILAC channels were divided by the summed up intensities of the light channel (mock infected). Data were then averaged for label-swap replicates and summed up for viral and host proteins independently. Finally, data were normalized to the 0–4 h time period.</p>
