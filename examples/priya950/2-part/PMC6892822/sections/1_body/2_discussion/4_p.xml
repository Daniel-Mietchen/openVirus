<p id="Par34">Our unbiased proteomic analysis indicates that the differences between permissive and non-permissive infection depend on differences in viral rather than host protein synthesis. Hence, the orchestrated synthesis of the viral proteome appears to be critically important for permissive infection. This supports the emerging view that modulation of viral protein synthesis underpins host adaptation

 </sup>. Specifically, we find that the strain-specific differences in M1 protein synthesis critically depend on a conserved 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element, which controls M-segment mRNA splicing. M1 is particularly important for the nuclear export of the viral genome to the cytoplasm

 </sup>. Consistently, we observed that the genome of the bird-adapted strain was inefficiently exported (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We were not able to directly assess the role of M1 for nuclear export because the level of ectopically expressed M1 is much lower than the level reached during infection. Interestingly, we also observed differences in HA and NA expression between both strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), which may be relevant in this context.
