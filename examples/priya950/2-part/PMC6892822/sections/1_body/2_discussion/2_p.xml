<p id="Par32">The cell culture-based infection model and splicing reporter system employed here are advantageous because they enable experiments under well-controlled conditions. Having said this, it is important to keep in mind that these model systems do not represent the full complexity of IAV infections in vivo. Also, the Pan and Mal strain employed here do not represent the full diversity of human- and bird-adapted IAVs. However, our computational analyses show that differences in RNA secondary structure of the 3â€² splice site are widely conserved in human- and bird-adapted IAVs. Moreover, recent results from the Steel lab show that avian M segments restrict growth and transmission of mammalian-adapted IAV strains in a guinea pig model
