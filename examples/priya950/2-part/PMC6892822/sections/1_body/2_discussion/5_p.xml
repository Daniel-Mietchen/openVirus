<p id="Par35">We found that exchanging only eight nucleotides of the human-adapted M segment to the bird-adapted sequences markedly impaired viral replication. Hence, the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element described here plays an important role for host adaptation. However, it is critical to also emphasize that this is not the only relevant factor for IAV host range. For example, despite the overall similar host response, we and others have previously described host factors affecting human and avian virus infections

 </sup>. Moreover, differences in the binding specificity of viral HAs are known to play an important role for host adaptation

 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements but also on 
 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as NS1, RdRP, NS1-BP, or HNRNPK

 </sup>. Indeed, while M1 production was clearly impaired in our mutant strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), the wild-type bird-adapted strain produced even less (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Also, the increased production of avian M1 in chicken cells relative to human cells indicates that host factors play a role (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). It is therefore important to interpret our findings in the broader context of viral and host factors that jointly determine the success of IAV replication.
