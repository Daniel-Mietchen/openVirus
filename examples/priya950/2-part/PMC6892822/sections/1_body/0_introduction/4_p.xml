  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Also, interaction proteomics experiments identified many cellular binding partners of IAV proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. A number of studies also quantified changes in protein abundance
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. However, these steady-state measurements cannot reveal the dynamic changes in protein synthesis during different phases of infection. Early studies used radioactive pulse labeling to monitor protein synthesis in IAV-infected cells

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. However, radioactive pulse labeling cannot provide kinetic profiles for individual proteins. More recently, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) emerged as a powerful means to study the dynamic proteome

 </sup>. SILAC-based pulse labeling methods such as pulse SILAC (pSILAC) and dynamic SILAC can quantify protein synthesis and degradation on a proteome-wide scale

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, metabolic incorporation of bioorthogonal amino acids such as azidohomoalanine (AHA) provides a means to biochemically enrich for newly synthesized proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. In combination with SILAC, AHA labeling can be used to quantify proteome dynamics with high temporal resolution
