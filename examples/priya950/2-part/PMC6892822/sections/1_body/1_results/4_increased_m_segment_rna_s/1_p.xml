<p id="Par18">We next sought to investigate the mechanism for the impaired M1 production. To this end, we first quantified the levels of viral mRNAs from our RNA-seq data. In total, the avian virus produced ~2/3 of the mRNA of the human strain with the single largest difference observed for M1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The strain-specific differences in M1 mRNA levels were very similar to the observed differences in M1 protein production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Hence, the impaired M1 protein production during non-permissive infection can largely be explained by reduced M1 mRNA levels.
