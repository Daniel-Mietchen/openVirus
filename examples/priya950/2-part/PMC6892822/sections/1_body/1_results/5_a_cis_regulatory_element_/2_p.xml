<p id="Par23">To determine the sequence responsible for the strain-specific splicing, we made chimeric reporter constructs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). When swapping the entire intron sequence of the M2 splice variant (nucleotides 52–739, corresponding to ~70% of the coding sequence), we did not observe major changes in the relative amount of M1 to M2. In contrast, integrating the human 3′ splice site region (nucleotides 707–779, 73 nucleotides) into the avian construct strongly impaired splicing down to the levels of the human wild-type construct. Conversely, when we integrated the avian 3′ splice site region into the human construct, we observed a strong increase in splicing, similar to the avian wild-type construct (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). To address splicing in the context of the viral RdRP, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with expression vectors for PB1, PB2, PA, and NP (of WSN strain) and Pan and Mal M wild-type and chimeric segments. In this system, the accumulation of M segment-derived mRNAs depends primarily on the activity of the RdRP. RNA-seq revealed consistent differences in abundance of the various isoforms with similar overall mRNA levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Thus, the splice site region alone is sufficient to switch the species-specific splicing phenotype in reporter systems using both viral and host RNA polymerases. Interestingly, this region has been reported to contain an RNA secondary structure
