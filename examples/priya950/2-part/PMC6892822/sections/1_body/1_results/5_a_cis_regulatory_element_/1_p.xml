<p id="Par22">The differences in M1 mRNA splicing can be due to (i) 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (i.e., specific signals encoded in the M segment), (ii) 
 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (i.e., other viral or host factors that interact with M1 mRNA), or (iii) a combination of both. To assess whether 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements are involved, we sought to investigate M segment RNA splicing outside the context of infection. We therefore designed a splicing reporter system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). To this end, we cloned the coding region of the M segment (nucleotides 29–1007) into a eukaryotic expression vector and fused it to an N-terminal Flag/HA tag. Importantly, this construct avoids the strong 5′ splice site of RNA 3

 </sup> and enabled us to assess the relative levels of M1 to M2 proteins. When we transfected human A549 cells with these reporter constructs, we found that M2 was produced to high levels with the construct containing the Mal M sequence, but was barely detectable when the Pan M sequence was transfected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Thus, our reporter system recapitulates splicing differences observed during infection. We conclude that 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the M segment cause excessive splicing of the avian variant.
