<p id="Par11">It is well established that IAV induces a global reduction in the production of host proteins. This host shutoff was attributed to a plethora of viral effector functions

 </sup>. To assess the host shutoff in our proteomic data, we investigated iBAQ values for viral and host proteins. As expected, viral proteins were potently induced, while the production of host proteins decreased over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The difference between host and viral protein synthesis reached several orders of magnitude and was highest during the 8–12 h pulse interval. Moreover, the total cellular protein output dropped to ~24% (Pan) or ~33% (Mal) at later stages of infection, of which ~20–40% was of viral origin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). At this level of detail, we observed no major differences between both strains. Thus, both strains initiate viral protein synthesis and induce the shutoff of host protein synthesis to an overall similar extent.
