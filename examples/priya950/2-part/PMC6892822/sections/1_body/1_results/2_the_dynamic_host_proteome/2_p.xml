<p id="Par12">Next, we investigated the profiles of individual host proteins across the course of infection. For this, we directly looked at SILAC ratios comparing infected and non-infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). As expected, synthesis of the vast majority of host proteins markedly decreased over time. However, some proteins were less affected by the host shutoff and displayed only a mildly decreased or even increased production. To assess this observation more systematically, we selected the proteins that were least affected by the shutoff at different pulse periods and performed gene ontology (GO) analysis. The heatmap of enriched GO terms provides a global overview of biological processes as the infection progresses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For example, many well-known interferon-induced antiviral defense proteins (e.g., MX1, several IFIT proteins, several oligoadenylate synthase proteins) were relatively strongly produced at late stages of infection. Also, many ribosomal proteins (GO term “peptide chain elongation”) largely escaped the host shutoff. Interestingly, we also observed significant enrichment of proteins involved in steroid metabolism and mitochondrial proteins (mito-ribosomal, respiratory chain proteins) at early and intermediate stages of infection, respectively. Cellular responses to infection with the Pan and Mal strain were overall similar. To assess potential differences between permissive and non-permissive infection, we compared protein log 2 fold changes between both viruses directly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Interestingly, type I interferon response proteins were first preferentially produced during non-permissive infection. At later stages, however, infection with the Pan virus elicited a stronger interferon response.
