<p id="Par17">We focused our attention on the M1 protein since it showed the largest difference between both strains. The protein is highly conserved between Pan and Mal (~96% amino acid identity) and the most abundant protein in virions

 </sup>. Moreover, M1 is known to mediate export of the viral genome across the nuclear membrane—an essential step during permissive infection

 </sup>. Thus, accumulation of M1 at late stages of infection is required for the appearance of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Interestingly, when investigating the subcellular distribution of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) by immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed efficient export during infection with the Pan strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In contrast, NP was inefficiently exported and accumulated in the nucleus upon Mal infection. These microscopy data is also corroborated by the increased interferon response induced by the Pan strain at later stages of infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which is stimulated by cytosolic viral RNA sensors
