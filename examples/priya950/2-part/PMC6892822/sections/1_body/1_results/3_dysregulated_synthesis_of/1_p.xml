<p id="Par15">Since the observed differences in host protein synthesis were surprisingly subtle, we focused our attention to the dynamics of viral protein synthesis. Production of most viral proteins peaked in the 8–12 h period (see Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. We then used SILAC ratios of shared peptides (i.e., peptides with sequence identity between both strains) to precisely compare the kinetics of viral protein synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). We found that the avian strain produced higher amounts of all viral proteins at the beginning, confirming that the Mal virus successfully enters cells and initiates its gene expression program. Later on, during mid to late phases, the human Pan virus produced most proteins more abundantly than the avian strain. Note that NS1 and M2 are excluded in this analysis because no identical peptides were identified.
