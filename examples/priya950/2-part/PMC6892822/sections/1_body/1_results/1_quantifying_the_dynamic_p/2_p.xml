<p id="Par9">We reasoned that comparing the kinetics of protein synthesis upon infection with both strains might reveal determinants of species specificity. To this end, we performed proteome-wide comparative pulse-labeling experiments by combining labeling with AHA and SILAC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>): cells incorporate AHA instead of methionine into newly synthesized proteins when the cell culture medium is supplemented with this bioorthogonal amino acid. AHA contains an azido group, which can be used to covalently couple AHA-containing proteins to alkyne beads via click chemistry. In this manner, newly synthesized proteins can be selectively enriched from the total cellular proteome. Combining AHA labeling with SILAC reveals the kinetics of protein synthesis with high temporal resolution

 </sup>. First, we fully labeled human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) using SILAC. Second, individual cell populations were infected with either Pan or Mal virus or left uninfected. Third, all cells were pulse labeled with AHA for 4 h during different time intervals post infection (0–4, 4–8, 8–12, and 12–16 h). The three cell populations for every time interval were then lysed, combined, and AHA-containing proteins were enriched from the mixed lysate using click chemistry (Fig.
