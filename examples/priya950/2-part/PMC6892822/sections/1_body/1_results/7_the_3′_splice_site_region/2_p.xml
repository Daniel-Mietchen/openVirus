 </sup>. M1 synthesis was selectively impaired during Pan-Av infection during both the 6–12 and 12–18 hours post infection (hpi) time intervals. At later stages, the Pan-Av strain also showed impaired production of other essential viral proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), suggesting that viral replication is also impaired. Next, we quantified M1 and M2 protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) and mRNA levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>). The Pan-Av strain displayed decreased M1 protein and mRNA levels, mimicking the behavior of the Mal strain (compare to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
