<p id="Par28">The experiments with reporter constructs described above are advantageous because they allow us to study the impact of M segment sequence features in isolation. Nevertheless, it is also important to assess the relevance of these findings during infection. We therefore mutated eight nucleotides in the splice site region of the Pan wild-type strain to the corresponding nucleotides in the Mal strain using reverse genetics (“Pan-Av” for a Pan strain with an avian splice site region, see Fig.
