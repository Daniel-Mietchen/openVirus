<p id="Par30">To assess the impact of M segment splicing on IAV replication in human cells, we assessed the growth characteristics of the different viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). As expected, the Pan strain reached ~1000-fold higher titers than the Mal strain. Exchanging the entire M segment of the Pan strain with the M segment of the Mal strain (Pan + Mal M) reduced titers about 10-fold. Importantly, a similar ~10-fold attenuation was also seen in the Pan-Av strain, which only differs from the Pan strain by eight nucleotides. We conclude that the 3′ splice site of the IAV M segment is indeed an important host range determinant.
