<p id="Par25">The RNA secondary structure that is best supported by the evolutionary signals in the two MSAs (the so-called maximum-likelihood structure) markedly differs between human and avian strains, particularly in the region around the 3′ splice site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>): the avian region encodes a hairpin-like structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>) overlapping the 3′ splice site, which is absent from the human-adapted sequences. This structure is similar to a hairpin reported by Moss et al.

 </sup> for four sequences, but differs in details (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Most importantly, the evolutionarily conserved structure reported here leaves the GC motif immediately downstream of the AG consensus at the 3′ splice site unpaired, making it potentially more accessible to splicing. In human-adapted sequences, this region is involved in a different conserved secondary structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) that is mutually exclusive with this hairpin. We conclude that the M segment of avian and human-adapted isolates contain evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures that markedly differ in exactly the region that is critical for strain-specific splicing. Importantly, the consensus sequences of avian and human isolates diverge by five nucleotides in the region of interest (pos: 745, 754, 760, 766, and 772), all of which are retained with the two strains that we investigated here (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). Thus, the Pan and Mal strains are by and large representative for human and avian strains in this region.
