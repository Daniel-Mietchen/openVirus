<p id="Par27">To investigate the global significance of these findings, we extended our analyses to other IAV isolates. The M segment of the seasonal Pan strain originates from the M segment of the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (p1918) virus, which is at the evolutionary root of human strains and caused the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic

 </sup>. Therefore, we cloned the M segment of p1918 into our reporter vector (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>). Again, we observed inefficient splicing of the p1918 M gene, consistent with our data for the Pan strain and previous reports

 </sup>. Moreover, integration the Mal 3′ splice site region into the p1918 gene increased splicing. Thus, inefficient splicing of the M gene in human-adapted IAVs occurs in a seasonal (Pan) and a pandemic (p1918) strain. The M segment of the Mal strain originates from the eastern avian lineage. A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 (H7N1), an early representative strain of this lineage, depicted even stronger M segment splicing than the Mal strain (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>, lane 3). Introducing the human-adapted mutations at the splice site region into this construct completely reversed the splicing phenotype (lane 4). Also, the “avian-like” M segment of A/swine/Netherlands/25/1980 (H1N1) showed a splicing phenotype similar to the Mal strain (lane 2). Finally, the human zoonotic strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) exhibited a splicing pattern similar to the Pan strain (lane 5). Collectively, these findings support the global significance of the strain-specific splicing patterns with respect to host range.
