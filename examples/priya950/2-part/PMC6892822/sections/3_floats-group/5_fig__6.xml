  <title>The 3′ splice site is a host range determinant.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> (Top) Eight nucleotide polymorphisms of Mal virus at the M segment 3′ splice site were integrated into wild-type Pan virus generating “Pan-Av” mutant. 
   <bold>a</bold> (Bottom) Design of pulsed SILAC experiment. A549 cells were infected with wild-type or mutant virus at an MOI of 4 (FFU/cell) and viral gene expression was assessed by pulse labeling during two time intervals. 
   <bold>b</bold> pSILAC-based quantification of viral protein production comparatively for Pan and Pan-Av virus. One replicate (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1) is depicted. 
   <bold>c</bold> Kinetics of M1/M2 protein levels as detected by immunoblotting. 
   <bold>d</bold> RNA-seq-based quantification of viral mRNA levels at 8 hpi (MOI = 1 FFU/cell) comparing Pan and Pan-AV infection. The average of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is depicted. 
   <bold>e</bold> Quantification of M segment-derived RNAs based on splice junction reads. The area of the pies scales with the total number of splice junction reads. The average of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is depicted. 
   <bold>f</bold> Multicycle replication curve of the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.05 FFU/cell on A549 cells. Means and standard deviations of biological triplicates (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) are shown along with significance estimates based on two-sided paired 
   <italic>t</italic> tests for the 16–48 h time points (n.s.: non-significant, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
