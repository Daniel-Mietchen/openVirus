  <title>Viral protein synthesis is dysregulated during non-permissive infection.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> SILAC protein synthesis profiles of human vs. avian-adapted IAV proteins based on shared peptides. No shared peptides were identified for NS1 and M2. The average of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is shown. 
   <bold>b</bold> MS1 spectra of individual precursor (M1—top, HA—middle, NP—lower) peptides in M and H SILAC channels. 
   <bold>c</bold> Cells were infected with the indicated viruses at MOI = 1 (FFU/cell) and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy for NP trafficking. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Scale bars: 10 µm. 
   <bold>d</bold> For quantification, NP staining pattern was categorized as predominantly cytosolic, nuclear or both. At least 140 cells were counted per condition.
