  <title>Differences in M segment RNA splicing.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Normalized read counts (RPKM, based on splice junction reads and exonic reads) for 10 viral mRNAs from poly-A-enriched and either Pan- or Mal-infected samples at 8 hpi. The sum of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is depicted. 
   <bold>b</bold> Direct comparison of fold changes for viral mRNAs/proteins from RNA level and protein synthesis data. 
   <bold>c</bold> Schematic depiction of the M gene architecture. The M pre-mRNA can be spliced into the indicated isoforms. 
   <bold>d</bold> Relative quantification of the different isoforms based exclusively on splice junction reads from RNA-seq data for both strains at 8 hpi. The area of the pies reflects the absolute number of splice junction reads. The average of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is depicted. 
   <bold>e</bold> SILAC-light-labeled DF-1 and A549 cells were pulse labeled with heavy or medium heavy SILAC amino acids (in label-swap duplicates) after infection with the Mal virus (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) and subjected to quantitative shotgun proteomics. 
   <bold>f</bold> pSILAC fold-changes are depicted for both pulse intervals comparing the production of viral proteins with the Mal strain in human vs. avian cells. The average of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates is depicted.
