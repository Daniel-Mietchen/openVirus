  <title>Hypothetical model for the role of M segment splicing for IAV host range.</title>
  <p>A 
   <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory secondary structure element (indicated hairpins) in avian but not human IAV M pre-mRNA facilitates splicing. This leads to the underproduction of M1 mRNA and protein in human cells infected with avian-adapted IAVs. The poor availability of the M1 protein may contribute to an impaired nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs).
