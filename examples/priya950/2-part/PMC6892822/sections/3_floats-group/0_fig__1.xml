  <title>A strategy to quantify protein de novo synthesis proteome-wide.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> SILAC-L/M/H-labeled A549 cells were infected with the human seasonal H3N2 IAV isolate Panama (Pan) or the avian H3N2 isolate Mallard (Mal) or left uninfected. The methionine analogous AHA was given to the methionine-depleted medium in different 4 h intervals. 
   <bold>b</bold> After lysis and enrichment for proteins that incorporated AHA, samples were subjected to shotgun proteomics. Absolute and relative protein synthesis profiles were quantified for host and viral proteins. 
   <bold>c</bold> iBAQ-based quantification of protein synthesis levels for host and viral proteins in cells infected with either Pan or Mal virus, as indicated. Median, 25th and 75th percentile of the respective populations are given. 
   <bold>d</bold> Quantification of the total newly synthesized protein mass for host and viral proteins with either Pan or Mal infection as indicated. Data were normalized to the 0–4 h time period. All data are based on the mean of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 biological replicates.
