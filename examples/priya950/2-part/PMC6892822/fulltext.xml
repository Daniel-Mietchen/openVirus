IAV infection causes seasonal epidemics and sporadically pandemic outbreaks in the human population with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. IAVs can infect both mammals (e.g., humans, pigs, horses) and birds (e.g., chicken, waterfowl). However, strains that are replicating in birds typically do not infect mammals and vice versa. Pandemics occur when influenza strains of avian origin with novel antigenicity acquire the ability to transmit among humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Understanding the molecular basis of host specificity is therefore of high medical relevance.</p><p id="Par4">The species barriers that hinder most avian IAVs from successfully infecting humans are effective at several steps in the viral life cycle. For example, the avian virus receptor hemagglutinin (HA) recognizes oligosaccharides containing terminal sialic acid (SA) that are linked to galactose by &#x003b1;2,3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the human upper respiratory airway epithelium, the dominant linkage is of &#x003b1;2,6 type, to which human-adapted HA binds. Despite these differences in receptor binding, many avian viruses are internalized by human cells and initiate expression of the viral genome. Such infections typically lead to an abortive, nonproductive outcome in mammalian cell lines. Our understanding of this intracellular restriction is still incomplete. One well-established factor is the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP): this enzyme catalyzes replication of the viral genome and transcription of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Polymerases from avian strains are considerably less active in mammalian cells than their counterparts from mammalian-adapted strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A wealth of experimental data described adaptive mutations that alter receptor specificity or fusion activity of HA (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>) and polymerase activity (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>). However, relatively little is known about the contribution of other IAV genes for permissive vs. non-permissive infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">A crucial aspect for permissive infection is the correct timing of viral gene expression: IAV proteins are produced at the specific phase of infection when they are needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. One example is the M gene, which encodes predominantly two polypeptides: the larger protein, M1, is produced from a collinear transcript. The smaller one, M2, is encoded by a differentially spliced transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. M1 is the matrix protein with multiple functions that encapsulates the viral genome, and also mediates nuclear export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. M2 is a proton-selective channel that is an integral part of the viral envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The ratio of spliced to unspliced products increases during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which reflects the changing demands required for optimal viral replication.</p><p id="Par6">Systems-level approaches have provided important insights into the molecular details of host&#x02013;virus interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For example, RNA interference (RNAi) screens identified host factors required for IAV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Also, interaction proteomics experiments identified many cellular binding partners of IAV proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A number of studies also quantified changes in protein abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, these steady-state measurements cannot reveal the dynamic changes in protein synthesis during different phases of infection. Early studies used radioactive pulse labeling to monitor protein synthesis in IAV-infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, radioactive pulse labeling cannot provide kinetic profiles for individual proteins. More recently, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) emerged as a powerful means to study the dynamic proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. SILAC-based pulse labeling methods such as pulse SILAC (pSILAC) and dynamic SILAC can quantify protein synthesis and degradation on a proteome-wide scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, metabolic incorporation of bioorthogonal amino acids such as azidohomoalanine (AHA) provides a means to biochemically enrich for newly synthesized proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In combination with SILAC, AHA labeling can be used to quantify proteome dynamics with high temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we use metabolic pulse labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry to compare proteome dynamics upon infection of human cells with a human-adapted and a bird-adapted IAV strain. We find that host proteins behave surprisingly similar, but observe striking differences in the production of viral proteins, especially for the matrix protein M1. Follow-up experiments with reporter constructs, in silico studies, and reverse genetics identify an evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element in the M segment as a host range determinant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantifying the dynamic proteome of IAV infection</title><p id="Par8">To assess species specificity of IAVs, we used a model system comparing a low-pathogenic avian H3N2 IAV (A/Mallard/439/2004&#x02014;Mal) to a seasonal human IAV isolate of the same subtype (A/Panama/2007/1999&#x02014;Pan). While the avian virus is not adapted to efficient growth in cultured human cells and causes a non-permissive infection, the seasonal human virus replicates efficiently. We demonstrated previously that the Pan virus produces &#x0003e;1000-fold more infectious viral progeny than the non-adapted virus, even though both strains efficiently enter human cells and initiate their gene expression program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">We reasoned that comparing the kinetics of protein synthesis upon infection with both strains might reveal determinants of species specificity. To this end, we performed proteome-wide comparative pulse-labeling experiments by combining labeling with AHA and SILAC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>): cells incorporate AHA instead of methionine into newly synthesized proteins when the cell culture medium is supplemented with this bioorthogonal amino acid. AHA contains an azido group, which can be used to covalently couple AHA-containing proteins to alkyne beads via click chemistry. In this manner, newly synthesized proteins can be selectively enriched from the total cellular proteome. Combining AHA labeling with SILAC reveals the kinetics of protein synthesis with high temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. First, we fully labeled human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) using SILAC. Second, individual cell populations were infected with either Pan or Mal virus or left uninfected. Third, all cells were pulse labeled with AHA for 4&#x02009;h during different time intervals post infection (0&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;12, and 12&#x02013;16&#x02009;h). The three cell populations for every time interval were then lysed, combined, and AHA-containing proteins were enriched from the mixed lysate using click chemistry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). After on-bead digestion, peptide samples were analyzed by high-resolution shotgun proteomics.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>A strategy to quantify protein de novo synthesis proteome-wide.</title><p><bold>a</bold> SILAC-L/M/H-labeled A549 cells were infected with the human seasonal H3N2 IAV isolate Panama (Pan) or the avian H3N2 isolate Mallard (Mal) or left uninfected.

Our data thus provides kinetic profiles for relative and absolute differences in de novo protein synthesis across the course of infection (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In total, we identified 7729 host and 10 viral proteins and quantified 6029 proteins in at least two biological replicates with overall good reproducibility (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The dynamic host proteome</title><p id="Par11">It is well established that IAV induces a global reduction in the production of host proteins. This host shutoff was attributed to a plethora of viral effector functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. To assess the host shutoff in our proteomic data, we investigated iBAQ values for viral and host proteins. As expected, viral proteins were potently induced, while the production of host proteins decreased over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The difference between host and viral protein synthesis reached several orders of magnitude and was highest during the 8&#x02013;12&#x02009;h pulse interval. Moreover, the total cellular protein output dropped to ~24% (Pan) or ~33% (Mal) at later stages of infection, of which ~20&#x02013;40% was of viral origin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). At this level of detail, we observed no major differences between both strains. Thus, both strains initiate viral protein synthesis and induce the shutoff of host protein synthesis to an overall similar extent.</p><p id="Par12">Next, we investigated the profiles of individual host proteins across the course of infection. For this, we directly looked at SILAC ratios comparing infected and non-infected cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). As expected, synthesis of the vast majority of host proteins markedly decreased over time. However, some proteins were less affected by the host shutoff and displayed only a mildly decreased or even increased production. To assess this observation more systematically, we selected the proteins that were least affected by the shutoff at different pulse periods and performed gene ontology (GO) analysis. The heatmap of enriched GO terms provides a global overview of biological processes as the infection progresses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For example, many well-known interferon-induced antiviral defense proteins (e.g., MX1, several IFIT proteins, several oligoadenylate synthase proteins) were relatively strongly produced at late stages of infection. Also, many ribosomal proteins (GO term &#x0201c;peptide chain elongation&#x0201d;) largely escaped the host shutoff. Interestingly, we also observed significant enrichment of proteins involved in steroid metabolism and mitochondrial proteins (mito-ribosomal, respiratory chain proteins) at early and intermediate stages of infection, respectively. Cellular responses to infection with the Pan and Mal strain were overall similar. To assess potential differences between permissive and non-permissive infection, we compared protein log&#x02009;2 fold changes between both viruses directly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Interestingly, type I interferon response proteins were first preferentially produced during non-permissive infection. At later stages, however, infection with the Pan virus elicited a stronger interferon response.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The dynamic host proteome of IAV-infected cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> SILAC profiles of host proteins infected with Pan (<bold>a</bold>) or Mal (<bold>b</bold>) compared to mock infection.

This included mechanisms at the transcriptional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, post-transcriptional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and translational<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> level. To study the relationship of mRNA and protein levels, we quantified mRNA levels at 8&#x02009;h post infection by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). mRNA level differences at this time point showed good correlation with corresponding differences in de novo protein synthesis, particularly during the subsequent 8&#x02013;12&#x02009;h period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e&#x02013;g</xref>). Thus, mRNA level changes play an important role for the shutoff of individual mRNAs, corroborating the view that the host shutoff is mainly due to reduced host mRNA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The correlation was higher for the Mal than for the Pan strain, suggesting that infection with the latter strain involves additional post-transcriptional processes.</p><p id="Par14">Traditionally, IAV is thought to prioritize the translation of viral over host mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, but more recent experimental and computational analyses challenge this view<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We investigated this question by calculating protein synthesis efficiencies (i.e., the amount of protein made per mRNA). To this end, we divided iBAQ values by corresponding RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million) values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Infection with both strains reduced host protein synthesis efficiencies compared to uninfected controls. Importantly, we did not observe preferential translation of viral transcripts. This suggests that mRNAs from human and avian influenza virus strains access the translational machinery with comparable efficiency, which argues against the idea that modulation of translation efficiency affects species specificity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dysregulated synthesis of viral proteins</title><p id="Par15">Since the observed differences in host protein synthesis were surprisingly subtle, we focused our attention to the dynamics of viral protein synthesis.

In contrast, neuraminidase (NA) and particularly matrix protein M1 were stronger produced by the human strain at later stages.

The M1 protein is produced from a collinear transcript that can be alternatively spliced into three additional isoforms, which all use a common 3&#x02032; splice site:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> the M2 mRNA, which encodes the ion channel M2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, RNA 3, which is not known to encode a peptide, and M4 mRNA, which is proposed to be translated to an isoform of the M2 ion channel in certain strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. We investigated the relative proportion of these isoforms in the RNA-seq data via splice junction reads. We detected all known isoforms plus a yet undescribed transcript of the avian M segment, which we call RNA 5. This transcript results from splicing at 5&#x02032; donor GG site (pos 520/521) and the common 3&#x02032; acceptor site and contains an open reading frame in-frame with M1 with a missing internal region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">While only a few percent (2&#x02013;3%) of the M1 mRNA was alternatively spliced during permissive infection, ~27% was spliced upon infection with the avian strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Thus, the reduced level of M1 mRNA during non-permissive infection is at least partially due to increased splicing of the M1 mRNA to alternative isoforms. In contrast, M2 mRNA levels were rather similar. We note that the comparable M2 mRNA level during non-permissive infection results from two opposing processes&#x02014;the increased splicing of the primary transcript to the M2 mRNA, and the global reduction in viral transcripts, which is probably due to the impaired polymerase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. We conclude that M segment RNA splicing is markedly different in permissive vs. non-permissive infection.</p><p id="Par21">In principle, the increased splicing of the M segment RNA by bird-adapted strains may reflect an evolutionary adaptation to different needs of the corresponding viral proteins in avian cells. In this case, avian-adapted strains would produce less M1 in both human and avian cells. Alternatively, the optimal balance of viral proteins could be constant and independent of the host species. In this case, avian-adapted strains would produce more M1 in avian than in human cells. To investigate this experimentally, we infected both human and chicken cells with the Mal virus and monitored the production of viral proteins using pSILAC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). We found that the Mal strain produced considerably more M1 in chicken cells than in human cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

When swapping the entire intron sequence of the M2 splice variant (nucleotides 52&#x02013;739, corresponding to ~70% of the coding sequence), we did not observe major changes in the relative amount of M1 to M2. In contrast, integrating the human 3&#x02032; splice site region (nucleotides 707&#x02013;779, 73 nucleotides) into the avian construct strongly impaired splicing down to the levels of the human wild-type construct.

To address splicing in the context of the viral RdRP, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with expression vectors for PB1, PB2, PA, and NP (of WSN strain) and Pan and Mal M wild-type and chimeric segments. In this system, the accumulation of M segment-derived mRNAs depends primarily on the activity of the RdRP. RNA-seq revealed consistent differences in abundance of the various isoforms with similar overall mRNA levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Specifically, we sought to identify functionally relevant RNA secondary structures that have been conserved during evolution of avian- and human-adapted IAVs. To this end, we analyzed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from hundreds of recent human H3N2 and avian isolates using the RNA structure prediction program RNA-Decoder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> (see Methods). This program is capable of dis-entangling overlapping evolutionary constraints due to encoded amino acids and RNA structure features and has been shown to successfully identify evolutionarily conserved RNA structures overlapping protein-coding regions, for example, in viral genomes such as hepatitis C and HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Importantly, RNA-Decoder captures evidence on conserved RNA structure based on the evolutionary signals encoded in the sequences of the input alignment. This is a key advantage over computational methods that identify RNA structures based on their thermodynamic stability in vitro, as these methods assume that the RNA has no interactions with other molecules (e.g., proteins and other RNAs) in vivo. Also, RNA-Decoder employs a probabilistic framework, which is capable of estimating the reliability of its predictions.</p><p id="Par25">The RNA secondary structure that is best supported by the evolutionary signals in the two MSAs (the so-called maximum-likelihood structure) markedly differs between human and avian strains, particularly in the region around the 3&#x02032; splice site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>): the avian region encodes a hairpin-like structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>) overlapping the 3&#x02032; splice site, which is absent from the human-adapted sequences. This structure is similar to a hairpin reported by Moss et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> for four sequences, but differs in details (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Most importantly, the evolutionarily conserved structure reported here leaves the GC motif immediately downstream of the AG consensus at the 3&#x02032; splice site unpaired, making it potentially more accessible to splicing. In human-adapted sequences, this region is involved in a different conserved secondary structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) that is mutually exclusive with this hairpin. We conclude that the M segment of avian and human-adapted isolates contain evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures that markedly differ in exactly the region that is critical for strain-specific splicing. Importantly, the consensus sequences of avian and human isolates diverge by five nucleotides in the region of interest (pos: 745, 754, 760, 766, and 772), all of which are retained with the two strains that we investigated here (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). Thus, the Pan and Mal strains are by and large representative for human and avian strains in this region.</p><p id="Par26">In addition to these computational analyses, we also wanted to assess RNA secondary structures experimentally. To this end, we in vitro transcribed the region of the M segment containing evolutionarily conserved secondary structure (nucleotides 707&#x02013;825) from both strains, purified the RNA, and analyzed it on native and denaturing agarose gels (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). We observed different migration behavior for Pan and Mal under native, but not denaturing conditions, consistent with different secondary structures (lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, when substituting eight nucleotides in the region 707&#x02013;779 (termed 3&#x02032; splice site region in our manuscript) from Mal into the Pan backbone (lane 3), we observed the same migration pattern as for the Mal wild-type RNA. Conversely, when substituting eight nucleotides from the Pan into Mal backbone (lane 4), we observed the same migration pattern as for the Pan wild-type RNA.</p><p id="Par27">To investigate the global significance of these findings, we extended our analyses to other IAV isolates. The M segment of the seasonal Pan strain originates from the M segment of the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (p1918) virus, which is at the evolutionary root of human strains and caused the 1918 &#x0201c;Spanish flu&#x0201d; pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, we cloned the M segment of p1918 into our reporter vector (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>). Again, we observed inefficient splicing of the p1918 M gene, consistent with our data for the Pan strain and previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Moreover, integration the Mal 3&#x02032; splice site region into the p1918 gene increased splicing. Thus, inefficient splicing of the M gene in human-adapted IAVs occurs in a seasonal (Pan) and a pandemic (p1918) strain. The M segment of the Mal strain originates from the eastern avian lineage. A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 (H7N1), an early representative strain of this lineage, depicted even stronger M segment splicing than the Mal strain (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>, lane 3). Introducing the human-adapted mutations at the splice site region into this construct completely reversed the splicing phenotype (lane 4). Also, the &#x0201c;avian-like&#x0201d; M segment of A/swine/Netherlands/25/1980 (H1N1) showed a splicing phenotype similar to the Mal strain (lane 2). Finally, the human zoonotic strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) exhibited a splicing pattern similar to the Pan strain (lane 5).

Having said this, it is important to keep in mind that these model systems do not represent the full complexity of IAV infections in vivo. Also, the Pan and Mal strain employed here do not represent the full diversity of human- and bird-adapted IAVs. However, our computational analyses show that differences in RNA secondary structure of the 3&#x02032; splice site are widely conserved in human- and bird-adapted IAVs. Moreover, recent results from the Steel lab show that avian M segments restrict growth and transmission of mammalian-adapted IAV strains in a guinea pig model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Together, these findings strongly suggest that our results are also relevant outside the specific experimental model system employed here.</p><p id="Par33">Our global assessment of protein de novo synthesis upon infection revealed a global reduction in overall protein output during infection with both strains, probably reflecting a global stress response. Also, we observed the well-known shutoff of host protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Specific classes such as interferon-related, ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins escaped the shutoff. We observed that the amount of protein synthesis upon infection primarily depends on mRNA levels. Thus, altered translation does not play a major role for the host shutoff, consistent with recent findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, we also found that viral transcripts were not more efficiently translated than host transcripts. This contrasts with early studies based on reporter systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, but corroborates recent ribosome profiling data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Our finding is also consistent with the fact that the codon usage of IAV genes is not optimized to reflect the codon usage of the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. It is also interesting that the translation efficiency of the bird- and human-adapted strains was similarly poor. Thus, adaptation towards high translational efficiency does not seem to be required for crossing the species barrier.</p><p id="Par34">Our unbiased proteomic analysis indicates that the differences between permissive and non-permissive infection depend on differences in viral rather than host protein synthesis. Hence, the orchestrated synthesis of the viral proteome appears to be critically important for permissive infection. This supports the emerging view that modulation of viral protein synthesis underpins host adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Specifically, we find that the strain-specific differences in M1 protein synthesis critically depend on a conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element, which controls M-segment mRNA splicing. M1 is particularly important for the nuclear export of the viral genome to the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Consistently, we observed that the genome of the bird-adapted strain was inefficiently exported (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We were not able to directly assess the role of M1 for nuclear export because the level of ectopically expressed M1 is much lower than the level reached during infection. Interestingly, we also observed differences in HA and NA expression between both strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), which may be relevant in this context.</p><p id="Par35">We found that exchanging only eight nucleotides of the human-adapted M segment to the bird-adapted sequences markedly impaired viral replication. Hence, the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element described here plays an important role for host adaptation. However, it is critical to also emphasize that this is not the only relevant factor for IAV host range. For example, despite the overall similar host response, we and others have previously described host factors affecting human and avian virus infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is also well-established that the RdRP of avian-adapted strains is less active in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, differences in the binding specificity of viral HAs are known to play an important role for host adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Lastly, M-segment splicing does not only depend on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements but also on <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as NS1, RdRP, NS1-BP, or HNRNPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Indeed, while M1 production was clearly impaired in our mutant strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), the wild-type bird-adapted strain produced even less (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Also, the increased production of avian M1 in chicken cells relative to human cells indicates that host factors play a role (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). It is therefore important to interpret our findings in the broader context of viral and host factors that jointly determine the success of IAV replication.</p><p id="Par36">We are living in a pandemic era of IAV infections that began at around 1918<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. At this time, a virus of ultimately avian origin acquired the ability to spread among humans and later on contributed its genetic material to other pandemic viruses until present. The M gene of this p1918 virus is in some regions similar to bird-adapted sequences, but shows important signatures of mammalian adaptation, especially at the 3&#x02032; splice site region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that mammalian adaptation at the 3&#x02032; splice site was linked to modulating M segment RNA splicing, which may have been relevant for the emergence of the 1918 pandemics in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p id="Par37">A549 (ATCC CCL-185) and HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) were grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2&#x02009;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and antibiotics.
