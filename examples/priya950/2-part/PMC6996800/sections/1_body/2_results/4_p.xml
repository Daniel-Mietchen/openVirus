<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228347.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we plot the ratio between the number of confirmed cases and the sum of confirmed and discarded cases, per semester. Given the well documented seasonal behaviour of the dengue epidemics during the last three decades, we adopt the used identification of the first and second semester of each year as the epidemic and inter-epidemic periods, respectively. The closer to 0.5 the dots are, the number of confirmed and discarded cases are close to each other.
