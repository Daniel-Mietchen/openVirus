<p>There is a significant association between confirmed cases of chinkugunya and confirmed and discarded cases of dengue. However, by assessing the correlation matrix given in 
 <xref rid="pone.0228347.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the values present a very low correlation (0.03 and 0.04, respectively). We also found that discarded cases of chikungunya have a significant association with the series of confirmed cases of dengue. This last showing a positive weak correlation (0.23).
