<p>We can see that the patterns of the proportion between confirmed and discarded cases differ among the diseases. For dengue, the proportion of discarded cases are most common during the second semester of the year, that is, in the inter-epidemic period. This pattern is also observed in years with the lowest incidence of dengue, namely 2012, 2014 and 2017.</p>
