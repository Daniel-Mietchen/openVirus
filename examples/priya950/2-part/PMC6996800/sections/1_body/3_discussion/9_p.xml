<p>According to Barbosa et al (2015), at least until 2010, the dengue surveillance system in Brazil was able to inform about the temporal and spatial trends of the occurrence of this disease, providing good evaluation indicators [

However, with the emergence of CHIKV and ZIKAV in the period 2014-2015, which have clinical manifestations similar to those of dengue, and in a scenario of limited availability of laboratory tests, there were major difficulties with this system. From this time on, the diagnosis of the viruses were mostly the clinical and epidemiological, limiting the correct registration of the cases in the SINAN. As it is of crucial importance for the surveillance to know, as close as possible, the real magnitude of occurrence of each of these arboviruses, it is considered that this study provided important issues that can contribute to improve the risk estimate and the spatial dissemination knowledge of the diseases. At this stage of understanding, we believe that our results raise a discussion of misregistration and suggest directions to overcome such a difficulty.
