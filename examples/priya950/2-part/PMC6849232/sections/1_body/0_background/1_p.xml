<p id="Par55">Like histone and DNA, RNA undergoes covalent modifications that fine-tunes its function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Post-transcriptional modification of RNA is very common in eukaryotes, with more than one hundred types of RNA modification reported so far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most of these modifications occur on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), which modulate RNA structures, functions, translation, as these RNAs are accessory molecules in eukaryotic processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Messenger RNA (mRNA), a primary information-bearing molecule, is also post-transcriptionally modified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As early as 1970s, researchers discovered that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is present on cellular mRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since then, m6A modification has been identified in many mRNA, with 25% of all cellular mRNAs containing multiple m6A residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been found that m6A modification mostly occur at RRACH motif (R = A or G, H = A, C, or U), and m6A sites are significantly clustered around transcription start sites, exonic regions flanking splicing sites, stop codons, 5’untranslated region (5’UTR) and 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].
