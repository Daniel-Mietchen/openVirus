<p id="Par56">m6A modification is dynamically and reversibly regulated by methyltransferases (writers) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and removed by demethylases (erasers) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; in addition, it functions by interacting with m6A binding proteins (readers), or by indirectly altering the structure of modified RNA to regulate RNA readerâ€“protein interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that m6A modification and its related enzymes play an important role in different phases of mRNA life [
