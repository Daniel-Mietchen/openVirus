<p id="Par62">Investigations into m6A modification on HIV have lagged behind other known viruses such as influenza virus, adenovirus, Rous sarcoma virus, and simian virus 40 for almost 40 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].Recently, Lichinchi et al. reported the presence of m6A modification on HIV-1 RNA, and characterized the molecular features, topology and function of the viral-host RNA m6A during CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T cell infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. They used HIV infected CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T cells as experimental subjects to analyze their RNA by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). Data showed that HIV-1 infection increased m6A modification level both in host and viral mRNAs compared with the un-infected cells. Knockdown of METTL3/14 suppressed virus replication, while knocking down of ALKBH5 produced opposite results. This indicates that m6A promotes replication of HIV. Subsequently, they discovered that m6A enrichment region was mainly located at the 5’UTR and 3’UTR of HIV genomic RNA, this finding was consistent with that of Tirumuru et al (their RNA samples were isolated from T-cells or primary CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T-cells infected with replication-competent HIV-1
 <sub>NL4–3</sub> and analyzed with high-throughput RNA sequencing (m6A-seq)) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, Kennedy et al. used photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A sequencing (PA-m6A-seq) technique to analyze the RNA samples isolated from infected human CD4
 <sup>+</sup>CEM-SS T-cells. They found the enrichment of m6A was merely located at the 3′UTR of HIV-genomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The discrepancies between these studies might stem from the different mapping techniques used or cell types used for RNA isolation.
