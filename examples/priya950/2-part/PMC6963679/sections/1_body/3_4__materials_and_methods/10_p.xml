<p>The ZIKV challenge was performed as described [
 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-08-00216" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, na√Øve and vaccinated BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) were infected at week four by the intravenous (i.v.) route with 10
 <sup>5</sup> viral particles (10
 <sup>2</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)) of the ZIKV-BR strain. Viral loads following ZIKV challenge were quantitated by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Sample size was determined to achieve 80% power to detect significant differences in protective efficacy. Vaccines were administered in a blind experiment. After the experimental outcome of the ZIKV challenge, samples were decoded.
