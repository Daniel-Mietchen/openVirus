<p>ELISPOT was carried out using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) isolated from the blood as previously described [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00216" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, MAIP ELISPOT plates (Millipore) were coated an Anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb, contained in the Mouse IFN-γ ELISpot BASIC (ALP) kit Ref 3321-2A), after 1 h blocking with complete DMEM media (10% FCS). Isolated PBMCs (using ACK buffer solution) were plated alongside 20-mer specific peptides overlapped by 10 a.a. (10 μg/mL) and 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> splenocytes per well. After 16 h incubation, cells were discarded and plates washed with PBS. Following this, 50 μL of biotinylated anti-mouse IFNγ mAb (1:1000 in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. After washing, plates were incubated with 50 μL of ALP (1:1000 in PBS) reagent for 1 h. After another washing step, developing solution (Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) was used. Once spots were visible, the reaction was stopped by washing plate off with water. Spots were acquired using an ELISPOT reader. Spot forming cells (SFC)/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs producing IFNγ were calculated.
