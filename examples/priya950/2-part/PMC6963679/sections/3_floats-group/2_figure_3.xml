  <p>Assessment of protective efficacy induced by MVA-ZIKV vaccines. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Naïve and vaccinated BABL/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were intravenously challenged with 100 PFU of ZIKV-BR strain, at four weeks post immunisation. After ZIKV challenge, viral loads were monitored for seven days. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Viral load kinetics in ZIKV-challenged groups were monitored to assess the protective efficacy. Graphs show days post-challenge on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis versus viral loads on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis. Continuous blue lines represent one mouse each, for each of the groups. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Relative viraemia at day 3 post-challenge, for each individual mouse and for each group was calculated based in the mean viremia from the naïve mice group. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values were determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
