   <bold>d</bold>) Expression of ZIKV immunogens by western blot of BHK21 cell extracts transduced with MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates, using an anti-ZIKV E antibody as the primary antibody. A change in size can be appreciated in the monomeric form of ZIKV E (around 45 kDa for full length E, in comparison with the TM deleted version of E), asterisk.
