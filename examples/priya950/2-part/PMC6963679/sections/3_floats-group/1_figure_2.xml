  <p>Immune responses elicited by MVA-ZIKV vaccines. BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) were intramuscularly immunised with a single dose of MVA encoding ZIKV antigens at 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU)/mouse. Serum samples were collected at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post immunisation. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Antibody responses elicited by MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates at 4 weeks and (
   <bold>b</bold>) 12 weeks post immunisation were quantified by ELISA in plates coated with a ZIKV E protein [
   <xref rid="B19-pathogens-08-00216" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Cellular immune responses to MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates. PBMCs IFNγ–producing cells after 4 weeks post immunisation were measured by (IFNγ) ex vivo ELISPOT, and 20-mer peptides spanning the ZIKV prME proteins at 10 μg/mL were used for stimulation. 
   <italic>p</italic>-values were determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
