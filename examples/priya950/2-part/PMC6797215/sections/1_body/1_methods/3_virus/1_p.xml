<p>Vector competence experiments were carried out with a low-passage YFV isolate (YFV-S79 strain) belonging to the West African lineage, which was originally obtained in 1979 from the serum of a patient returning to France from Senegal [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells. Virus stock was produced during the last passage, as previously described for DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Virus titration was performed by standard focus-forming assay (FFA), as previously described for DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with the exception of the primary antibody. A mouse anti-flavivirus group antigen monoclonal antibody MAB10216 (Merck Millipore) diluted 1:1,000 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Interchim) was used as primary antibody.
