<p>We measured the vector competence of 68 and 31 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> females and 132 and 76 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> females in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The data from both experiments were combined because initial analyses showed that none of the vector competence indices differed significantly between them. In each experiment, mosquitoes were exposed to three different YFV infectious doses to establish a dose-response curve. Vector competence was analyzed 14 days post blood meal, with the exception of infection rates that also included mosquitoes sampled at 10 days post blood meal.
