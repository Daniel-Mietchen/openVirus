  <p>Transmission potential is shown for the 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>malayensis</italic> population from Singapore under study and a control 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> population 14 days after oral exposure to 2.9 x 10
   <sup>6</sup> FFU/mL of YFV. Transmission rate is the proportion of females with a disseminated infection that had infectious YFV in their saliva 14 days post blood meal. Transmission efficiency is the proportion of all blood-fed females that had infectious YFV in their saliva 14 days post blood meal. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals of the proportions. The data shown are from two separate experiments.
