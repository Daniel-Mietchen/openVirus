<p>In this excellent study, the investigators have demonstrated that Ae. malayensis, an anthpophilic mosquito in Singapore, is a competent vector of YFV. Ae. malayensis occurs in some urban habitats that are not currently targeted in Ae. aegypti control programs, and they may contribute to “cryptic” arbovirus (DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV) transmission. But these findings do not increase the risk of YFV transmission in Singapore. </p>
