<p>Experimental studies have shown that Asian Ae. aegypti are similar to African and New World Ae. aegypti in their susceptibility and vector competence for YFV. Also humans and non-human primates of Asia origin are also susceptible. The most plausible explanation seems to be that most people living in Asia in the past and now have heterologous flavivirus antibodies due to natural or vaccine-induced infection with other flaviviruses like dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Animal studies indicate that hamsters infected previously with JE and other flaviviruses have lower levels of viremia and modest liver pathology, when subsequently infected with YFV. </p>
