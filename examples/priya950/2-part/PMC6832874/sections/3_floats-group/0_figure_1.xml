  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis based on the 750-nt sequence of the COOH terminus of the polymerase complex (RdRp) of GIV NoVs. The tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method and the Kimura two-parameter model. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Phylogenetic tree based on the full-length of the aa sequence of the VP1 protein of GIV and GVI NoVs, generated using the neighbor-joining method and Poisson correction. The rectangle delimits the VP1 sequences detected in cats.
