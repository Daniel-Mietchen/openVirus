<p>In the last few years, a number of viruses have been found in association with enteric disease in cats. Many of them have been discovered serendipitously, using advanced molecular techniques to screen feline stool samples. The epidemiology of these newly discovered viruses is still largely unexplored, but several pieces of evidence suggest their possible role as primary causative pathogens or synergistic agents in feline gastrointestinal disease. In order to obtain a complete picture, each novel enteric virus should be included in the panel of pathogens for routine testing of cases of feline enteritis. Furthermore, large structured epidemiological studies and experimental infections might help to clarify any possible association with enteric diseases.</p>
