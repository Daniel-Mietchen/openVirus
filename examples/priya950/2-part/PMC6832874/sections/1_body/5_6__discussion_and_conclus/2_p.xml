<p>Interestingly, some of the viruses considered in this review have also been identified in the canine fecal virome, suggesting the possibility of inter-species circulation between the two carnivore species. Cats and dogs may harbor NoVs of the same genogroups and genotypes, GIV.2 and GVI.2 [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Binding of GVI.2 and GVI NoVs in dog tissues has been demonstrated to be mediated by the presence of the H and A antigens of the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) family [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that dogs and cats share a similar pattern of HBGAs as the attachment factor for NoV infections [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Since a few aa mutations in the VP2 can modify the host range of FPV and CPV-2, it has been hypothesized that the novel carnivore protoparvovirus 2 has recently crossed the species barrier from a yet unidentified source, with a recent bottleneck event in the evolution of this virus in domestic carnivores [
