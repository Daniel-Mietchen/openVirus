<p>Except for the murine NoV [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], a reproducible system culture allowing the routine replication of in vitro NoVs is still not available. To date, there are two published systems (B cell line and stem cell-derived enteroids) [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] supporting replication of human NoVs, but the levels of replication are not sufficient for the generation of highly purified virus stocks or the development of culture-based quantification assays [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
