<p>The broadly reactive primers p289–p290 [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] targeting the highly conserved motifs (DYSKWDST and YGDD) of the RdRp region of caliciviruses and the norovirus-specific primers pair JV12Y/JV13I [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] amplifying the same region, have been both successfully employed to detect NoVs in carnivores [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, a specific RT-PCR strategy targeting the RdRp region has been developed based on the alignments of the cat and lion NoV sequences [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, given the high genetic heterogeneity of carnivores NoVs and the frequency of recombinant events, a more detailed characterization should rely on the determination of larger genomic sequence spanning the RdRp region and the complete ORF2 gene. The strategies mainly used to determine the sequence of ~3.4-kb fragment of the NoV genome (the 3′ end of ORF1, the full-length ORF2, ORF3, and the noncoding region through the poly-A tail) are based on the application of 3′ RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends) protocol previously described by Scotto–Lavino et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, also the specific primer sets targeting the complete ORF2 gene [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] of feline NoVs have been successfully used to acquire additional genetic information (
