<p>More recently, two novel feline NoVs have been identified in Japan [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], respectively. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 3′ partial sequence of ORF1 spanning 750 nt, at the COOH terminus of the polymerase complex, Japanese (M49-1/2012/JPN) and Italian (TE/77-13/ITA) strains showed the highest identity to the GIV.2 NoVs (strains lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA and cat/CU081210E/USA/2010) (91.0–93.0% nt and 97.0–98.0% aa) (

Interestingly, for both these novel feline NoVs, inconsistencies were observed between the RdRp- and capsid-based phylogeny, suggesting potential recombinant events. In the complete VP1 protein, the highest identities have been found to canine GVI NoVs. Based on Zheng’s criteria [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the Japanese strain M49-1/2012/JPN was tentatively classified as novel genotype (75.5–81.6% pairwise aa identity intergenotypes) within the genogroup VI (GVI.4) [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], while the Italian feline strain TE/77-13/ITA was classified as a genotype 2 (GVI.2) together with canine NoVs [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (93.0–94.0% pairwise aa identity intergenotypes) (
