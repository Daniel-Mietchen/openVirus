<p>The viral capsid is composed of 180 copies (90 dimers) of VP1, which consists of a shell (S) domain and two protruding (P1 and P2) domains [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The P2 domain extends above the viral surface and represents the most diverse region of the genome. The P2 domain is responsible for binding to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which function as receptors or co-receptors on host cells [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and it contains important determinants of antigenicity. Viral particles contain only a few copies of VP2, which are associated with the interior surface of the capsid formed by the S domain of VP1 [
