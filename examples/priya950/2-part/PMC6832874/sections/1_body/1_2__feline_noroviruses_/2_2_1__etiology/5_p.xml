<p>The first evidence on the possible susceptibility of a member of the family 
 <italic>Felidae</italic> to NoV infections was documented in 2006, in a four-week old lion (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) died of severe hemorrhagic enteritis at the zoo of Pistoia, Italy [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Upon sequence analysis of the complete VP1 capsid protein, the lion NoV appeared to be genetically more related to human GIV NoVs (69.3%–70.1% amino acid (aa) identity in the capsid protein). Following strictly the outlines of Zheng’s classification [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the novel NoV (strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA) was classified as a distinct genotype (IV.2) (cut-off ≥ 85% pairwise aa identity intergenotypes), within the genogroup GIV (cut-off ≥ 55% pairwise aa identity intergenogroups); human GIV NoVs were classified as genotype 1.
