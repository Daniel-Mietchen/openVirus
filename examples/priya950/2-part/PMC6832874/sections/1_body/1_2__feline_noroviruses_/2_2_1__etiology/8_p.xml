<p>Direct evidence on the circulation of NoVs in cats was obtained in 2012 in New York State [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], in which NoVs RNA was detected in the stools of six out of 14 (42.8%) 8â€“12-week-old cats with enteritis from a feline shelter. The full-length genomic sequence (7839 nt) of one feline NoV, CU081210E/ 2010/US, was determined. In the VP1, the novel virus displayed the highest aa identity to the GIV.2 NoV strain lion/Pistoia-387/06/IT (97.9%) and to the strain dog/Bari-170/07/IT (90.4%).
