<p>In addition to noroviruses, kobuviruses, and parvoviruses, other viruses such as astroviruses, rotaviruses, novel circular replication-associated protein-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and Lyon-IARC polyomaviruses (LIPyVs) [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], are suspected of having the ability to cause enteric disease in cats. Astroviruses (AstVs), family 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic>, are small, non-enveloped, spherical viruses of approximately 28–30 nm in diameter, with a positive single-stranded RNA genome of 6.8–7.3 kb in length organized in three ORFs (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and a poly A tail at the 3′ end [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. AstVs have been identified in human beings and in a variety of terrestrial and marine mammals, as well as in several avian species, and they are classified into two genera, 
 <italic>Mamastrovirus</italic> (AstVs of mammals) and 
 <italic>Avastrovirus</italic> (AstVs of avians) [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. AstVs are currently considered as one of the most common viruses associated with either mild or severe gastroenteritis in humans, mainly in young children and immunodeficient patients [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Feline astrovirus (FAstV) was first identified by EM from the stool of a domestic kitten with diarrhea in the USA [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subsequent EM-based investigations revealed the presence of FAstV either in the stools of diarrheic or healthy cats [

 <xref rid="B153-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. In the last few years, molecular tools have allowed characterizing in more detail the FAstVs infecting cats demonstrating the circulation of strains genetically closest to each other that have been classified within the species 
 <italic>Mamastrovirus 2</italic>, formerly known as feline astrovirus. Sequence analysis of the complete ORF2 gene revealed that the feline strains clustered within two distinct groups that have been recently proposed as different genotypes (group 1 and 2) [
 <xref rid="B154-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Furthermore, mamastroviruses more genetically closest in the RdRp region to AstVs previously found in foxes [
 <xref rid="B155-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>] have occasionally been identified in fecal samples collected from healthy cats [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>].
