<p>Rotaviruses (RVs) have been recognized as a major cause of human acute gastroenteritis since 1973 [
 <xref rid="B161-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. They primarily affect young children, accounting for almost 40% of hospital admissions for diarrhea and 200000 deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. RVs (genus 
 <italic>Rotavirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>) are characterized by a 70–75 nm non-enveloped multi-layered virion with 11-segmented double-stranded RNA encoding six structural proteins (VP1–VP4, VP6, and VP7) and other five or six NSPs (e.g., NSP1–NSP5/NSP6) [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. To date, nine rotavirus species (RVA to RVI) have been recognized [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>], and a tentative tenth species (RVJ) has been described [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Among these, RVA to RVC, RVE, RVH, and RVI are known to infect mammals, with RVA being the most prevalent [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The genetic variability of the VP4 and VP7-encoding genes determines the binary RVA genotype classification system [
 <xref rid="B165-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Currently, 27 G (VP7) and 37 P genotypes (VP4) of RVA have been described in mammals and avian species [

 <xref rid="B167-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. First evidence on the susceptibility of cats to feline rotavirus (FRV) infection was obtained serologically in 1978 by McNulty et al. [
 <xref rid="B168-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Subsequent experimental infections gave contrasting results, with some showing an association between rotavirus and reduced fecal quality as increased water content and not optimal conformation of feces [
 <xref rid="B169-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>], while others failed to give infection with evident clinical signs [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B170-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Early epidemiological studies on rotavirus infection in cats has been conducted by serological assay and EM analysis. The serological studies reported prevalence ranging from 3.5% [
 <xref rid="B171-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] to 100% [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>], while EM revealed rates from 5% [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to 6% [
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>] either in diarrheic or healthy animals. In a large molecular survey performed in the UK, FRVs RNA has been detected with an overall prevalence of 3.0% (57/1727); statistical associations with diarrhea or age have not been found [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the strains identified in cats showed the highest genetic correlation with RVs belonging to the A group [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. More recently, an I group rotavirus was detected in the feces of a diarrheic seventh-month old indoor cats [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that rotavirus I strain 
 <italic>Felis catus</italic> shared a monophyletic root, being most closely related to the two currently known rotavirus species I strain detected in the feces of two sheltered dogs in Hungary [
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Overall, FRVs are currently considered to play a minor role in clinical disease and are not routinely screened in diarrheic cases in small-animal veterinary practices [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. However, whether and to what extent FRVs may impact feline health, deserves further study.
