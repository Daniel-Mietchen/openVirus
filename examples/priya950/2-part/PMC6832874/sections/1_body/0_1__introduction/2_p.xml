<p>Within the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest for viral gastroenteritis that was sparked by the identification of novel viruses associated with diarrhea either alone or in mixed infections, occasionally resulting in more severe clinical signs. For many years, viral detection was restricted to a few specialized laboratories with EM equipment, and the etiology of a large portion of viral gastroenteric cases remained unknown. However, the introduction of diagnostic molecular tools mainly based on the use of broadly reactive primers, genus- or family-specific, targeting highly conserved genomic regions, increased the viral detection rate significantly, revealing that additional viruses, may be involved in the feline enteritis disease [

Furthermore, in recent years, using the advantages of metagenomic approaches for virus characterization and discovery, an unexpectedly high number of previously unknown viruses were detected in the feces of both healthy and diarrheic cats [
