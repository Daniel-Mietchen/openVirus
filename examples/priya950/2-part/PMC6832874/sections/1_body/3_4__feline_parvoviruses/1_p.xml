<p>Parvoviruses (family 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>) are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses of 22–25 nm with a positive-sense single-stranded (ss) DNA genome of 4.5–5.5 kb with complex hairpin structures at the 5′ and 3′ ends, and it encodes three or fpur proteins; non-structural (NS) 1, nucleoprotein (NP) 1, and viral protein (VP) 1 and VP2 [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> family is divided into two subfamilies, 
 <italic>Parvovirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Densovirinae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], infecting vertebrates and arthropods, respectively. In the 
 <italic>Parvovirinae</italic> subfamily is enclosed the genera 
 <italic>Bocaparvovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Protoparvovirus</italic>, whose members have been identified in a wide range of mammalian species, including domestic carnivores.
