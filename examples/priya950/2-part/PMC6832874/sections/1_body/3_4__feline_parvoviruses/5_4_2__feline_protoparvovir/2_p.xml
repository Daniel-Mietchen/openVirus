<p>FPV, isolated for the first time in 1965 [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], has been recognized as cause of disease in cats since the beginning of the twentieth century [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given the need to replicate in mitotically active tissue such as bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, and intestinal crypt cells, FPV is responsible of systemic infections characterized by severe panleukopenia and enteritis. Furthermore, the intrauterine or perinatal infection could result in cerebellar hypoplasia with ataxia and intention tremor of kittens [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. However, it has been demonstrated that several feline panleukopenia outbreaks in cats are not caused by classical FPV strains, but by variants of the CPV-2 [

 <xref rid="B133-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. CPV-2 was first identified in dogs in the late 1970s in Europe and North America, mainly associated with serious hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and myocarditis in puppies [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] and likely arisen from FPV after adaptation in an unknown wild-carnivore species [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Shortly after its identification, the original CPV-2 type, which cannot infect cats, was replaced by three variants, named CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c [

 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], that have regained the ability to replicate in vivo also in the feline host [
