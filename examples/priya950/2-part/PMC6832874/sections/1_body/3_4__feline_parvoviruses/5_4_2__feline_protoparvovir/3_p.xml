<p>In 2017, a novel protoparvovirus distantly related to FPV and CPV-2 was identified in cats, by assessing respiratory specimens collected from cats with or without signs of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and stool samples from diarrheic animals [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the nearly complete VP2 coding region of three feline strains (ITA/2012/TE109, ITA/2015/BA509, and ITA/2017/BA291) [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] revealed that the viruses displayed &gt; 99.9% nt sequence identity to a novel canine parvovirus, designated canine bufavirus (CBuV) [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], firstly detected in a litter of five-month-old puppies during an Italian outbreak of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). In the NS1 protein, CBuV displayed low aa (19.3%–51.4%) identity compared to members of the species 
 <italic>Carnivore protoparvovirus 1</italic>, while the closest relatives to CBuV were protoparvoviruses identified (47.2%–51.4% aa identity in NS1) in human and non-human primates, commonly termed as bufaviruses (BuVs) [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], which target a 207-bp region of the VP2 encoding gene of feline and canine BuVs, viruses genetically closest to carnivore protoparvoviruses 2, have been also identified in fecal samples collected from foxes and wolves in Italy [
