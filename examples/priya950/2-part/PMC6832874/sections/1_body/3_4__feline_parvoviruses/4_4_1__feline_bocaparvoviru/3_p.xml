<p>FBoV DNA was firstly identified by assessing fecal, nasal, urine, kidney, and blood samples collected from stray cats during a large molecular survey conducted in Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The near-complete genomic sequences (5179–5331 nt) were obtained for two strains (HK797F and HK875F) of enteric origin, whilst a third strain (HK797U) was detected in one urine sample. Upon sequence analysis, the three FBoV genomes displayed the highest identities (58.6–59.7% aa) to the minute virus of canines (MVC) [

 <xref rid="B113-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], the newly discovered feline parvoviruses have been classified within a novel species named 
 <italic>Carnivore bocaparvovirus 3</italic>. Subsequently, by metagenomics analysis of feces collected from a healthy cat in Portugal [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], an additional near-complete bocavirus genome was detected (strain POR1). The strain POR1 showed in the complete NS1 a low amino acids identity (58%) with the three FBoVs previously detected in stray cats in Honk Kong [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Accordingly, the FBoV2-POR1 has been classified as a distinctly designed species 
 <italic>Carnivore bocaparvovirus 4</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The third group of bocavirus, FBoV3, genetically diverse from FBoVs and FBoV2 strains, and then classified as an additional novel species, 
 <italic>Carnivore bocaparvovirus 5</italic>, has been detected in California [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] by next-generation sequencing (NGS), assessing fecal pools collected from 25 cats of a shelter. Since then, FBoV2 infections have been reported in Japan [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], both FBoV and FBoV2 strains were detected in Northeast China, and more recently a FBoV3 strain was identified in Canada [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetically diverse FBoVs widely circulate in cats in different geographical areas. However, it is not yet known whether this genetic diversity may affect the biological properties of the various FBoV species. Bocaparvoviruses infections have been identified as a possible cause of enteric, respiratory, reproductive/neonatal, and neurological disease. Human bocaparvoviruses have been detected in children with respiratory infections and gastroenteritis, but the pathogenic potential is still uncertain since they were also detected in healthy children and frequently in co-infection with other pathogens [

 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Animal bocaparvoviruses have been detected in both healthy and symptomatic animals, mostly young, with the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive disease [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. In dogs, it has been confirmed that the infection is linked to gastroenteritis [
 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Furthermore, the detection in extra-intestinal sites such as respiratory tract, liver, and blood, raises questions on the possibility that these viruses could cause systemic infections [
