<p>The first evidence on the susceptibility of cats to kobuvirus infections was obtained in the UK [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] by a serological screening based on of the prototype human AiV strain A846/88 [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] as an antigen. Out of the 97 sera tested, 69.9% (67/97) contained specific IgG antibodies, suggesting a high circulation of AiV-like viruses in the feline population investigated. More exact virologic information on the seropositivity found in cats was documented in the same year [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in South Korea by assessing a collection of stool samples from cats molecularly with diarrhea that revealed the presence of FeKoV RNA in six specimens with an overall prevalence of 15.4% (6/39). After this first direct identification, additional four molecular studies [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] confirmed the active circulation of these novel kobuviruses in cats either in Asiatic or European countries, with rates ranging from 13.5% to 28.8%.
