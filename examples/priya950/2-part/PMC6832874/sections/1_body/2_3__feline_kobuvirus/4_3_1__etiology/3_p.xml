<p>FeKoV genome is polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 8.2 kb in length, that contains 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of 646–717 nucleotides (nt), one single open reading frame (ORF) of 7308–7467 nt and 3′ UTR of 241–244 nt. The unique ORF encodes a single large polyprotein of 2436–2437 amino acids (aa) that undergoes protease processing to yield a leader protein (L), three structural capsid proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) and seven non-structural proteins (NSPs) (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D). The FeKoV genome, like that of other kobuviruses, could be divided into three functional regions: the P1 encoding the structural proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, P2 encoding the NSPs 2A-2C and P3 encoding the NSPs 3A–3D [

Putative cleavage sites of the polyprotein all contain primary Q/G amino acid residues, except for E/G and Q/A between VP0/VP3 and 3A/3B, respectively in the Italian TE/52/13/ITA strain, and Q/H, Q/A, Q/S between VP0/VP3, 3A/3B, and 3C/3D, respectively, in the Korean and Chinese strains (
