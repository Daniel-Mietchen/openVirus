<p>Although the majority of experimental animal studies suggested increased severity of disease with co‐infection of influenza and PTB, only half of the analytical studies on influenza and PTB in humans found the same. Descriptive studies, although they could not evaluate an association, reported an increased prevalence of co‐infection among cases with severe influenza or PTB disease. Data are limited from large epidemiological studies, studies with laboratory‐confirmed influenza and PTB, studies from high tuberculosis burden settings and studies that include data on HIV. In order to study the association between influenza and PTB and make inferences about causal associations, more epidemiological studies with systematic testing for influenza and tuberculosis are needed.</p>
