<p>Two descriptive studies reported on influenza in cases with tuberculosis housed at a sanatorium. Of these, one study described the effect of seasonal influenza on tuberculosis disease progression and complications.
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> This study, from the Netherlands in 1967, among children institutionalized with primary tuberculosis of the lungs and hilar lymphadenopathy reported a high frequency of developing secondary segmental pulmonary lesions, suggesting progression of PTB following serologically diagnosed influenza virus infection (defined as greater than fourfold rise in anti‐influenza virus antibody titres).
