<p>Three descriptive studies from HBC using data from the 2009 influenza pandemic reported the prevalence of PTB in individuals with influenza. Two of these studies reported a high frequency of tuberculosis (9% and 10%) in cases hospitalized with influenza and among influenza deaths relative to expected community prevalence. However, no inferences could be made on the significance of the association as there were no comparison groups or data were not evaluated statistically.
