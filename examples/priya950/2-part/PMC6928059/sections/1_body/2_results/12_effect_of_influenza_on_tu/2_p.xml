 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> showed that the course of experimental infection with tubercle bacillus in mice was worsened by simultaneous influenza infection (influenza A virus and tubercle bacilli challenge at week 0) and influenza infection superimposed on tuberculosis infection (influenza challenge 3 weeks after TB challenge). Co‐infection resulted in more extensive and rapid development of PTB lesions in mice than infection with tubercle bacillus only. Florido et al
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> reported that pulmonary bacille Calmette‐Guerin (BCG)‐specific CD8 T‐cell responses were impaired in co‐infected mice. Concurrent infection of mice with influenza virus and BCG (challenge on day 0) and sequential infection of mice with TB and influenza virus (TB infection on day 0 and influenza virus 7 weeks later) compared to infection with BCG only resulted in reduction in BCG‐specific CD4 and CD8 T‐cell responses, increased pulmonary disease and a delay in mycobacterium clearance from the lungs of infected mice. For sequential infection with influenza, the reduction in BCG‐specific CD8 T‐cell response was only evident in mice with untreated TB compared with mice that had cleared TB. Concurrent infection with influenza virus and tuberculosis reduced generation of protective T‐cell responses against intracellular mycobacteria but did not affect control of pulmonary influenza viral loads (no difference between co‐infected mice compared with the influenza only group).
