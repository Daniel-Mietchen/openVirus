 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> demonstrated that influenza A virus infection of mice 28 days before or during (on day 1 or day 14) 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection enhanced susceptibility to tuberculosis and impaired mycobacterium control and decreased host survival. Bernard et al
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> showed that in 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>‐infected mice, influenza virus challenge 1‐5 weeks after 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection, compared with 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>‐only infected mice, resulted in 50%‐75% shorter survival time and a higher case‐fatality rate. In addition, the effect of influenza virus on tuberculosis severity, measured by amount of tissue damage, increased with increasing time of tuberculosis infection prior to the influenza virus challenge. Five per cent of the mice infected with influenza alone died compared to 100% of the mice infected with influenza and tuberculosis. This was corroborated in a study by Bernard et al
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> in which 5% of the mice infected with influenza alone died compared to 100% of the mice infected with influenza and tuberculosis (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12670-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
