<p>Massanari (
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>) reported that tuberculin hypersensitivity in mice was temporarily suppressed following an intranasal influenza virus challenge; however, a normal response resumed after resolution of influenza virus infection. Tuberculin hypersensitivity, tested 4‐6 weeks after tuberculosis infection, was temporarily suppressed from day 3 to day 16 post an intranasal influenza virus challenge.
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> In contrast, Co et al
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> showed that influenza viruses had little effect on mycobacterial load and did not affect dissemination of tuberculosis in a mouse model. They showed that T cells responding to an acute influenza virus infection can modulate host responses to an ongoing BCG infection. Though not statistically significant, acute infection with influenza in mice with chronic
