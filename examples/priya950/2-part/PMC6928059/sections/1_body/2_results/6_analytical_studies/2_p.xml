<p>Three of the four analytical studies were from HBC, including one of high quality that reported no association with severe disease among patients with influenza‐PTB co‐infection compared to patients with influenza only.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> In this case‐population study from South Africa, tuberculosis was twice as prevalent among hospitalized influenza‐associated SARI cases compared with the general South African population (case‐population ratio [CPR] 1.85, 95%CI 1.68‐2.02).
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> A case‐control study from Kenya reported that 6% of hospitalized cases with influenza‐associated SARI had PTB compared with &lt;1% of neighbourhood‐matched controls (unadjusted OR 12.0, 95% CI 1.3‐107.37); however, the underlying PTB was not associated with influenza hospitalization on multivariable analysis.

There were no deaths among the 23 cases with influenza‐TB co‐infection, whereas 17 (2.8%) deaths occurred among cases in whom only influenza was identified,
