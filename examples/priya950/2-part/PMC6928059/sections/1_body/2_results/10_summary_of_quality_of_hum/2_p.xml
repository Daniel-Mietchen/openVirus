 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> Over a third of the studies about PTB and influenza virus co‐infection were descriptive case series that included univariate analysis, and the causal relationship could not be demonstrated. Some of the studies used clinical criteria for PTB cases; however, the specifics of the criteria used were not always fully described. Among the studies that included laboratory‐confirmed PTB, screening for tuberculosis was not done systematically.
