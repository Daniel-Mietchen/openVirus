<p>There were a number of limitations to this systematic review. Broad search terms were used to increase sensitivity to identify relevant articles, although this may have somewhat reduced search specificity. Over a third of the observational studies were descriptive, and due to the nature of these studies, an association could not be evaluated. The type of tuberculosis included differed among the studies, with some studies reporting newly diagnosed tuberculosis, some reporting on cases in a tuberculosis sanatorium for a number of months and some included cases who had completed tuberculosis treatment, thus making data less comparable. There were differences in the population tuberculosis incidences where studies were conducted which could affect the power to detect an association. However, the majority of studies were from tuberculosis high burden countries or were conducted during the period when tuberculosis burden was high. We included animal studies although these may not be generalizable to humans.</p>
