<p>Some of the studies reported on tuberculosis in patients from sanatorium.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> It is possible that the high prevalence of influenza reported in these studies is due to increased risk of influenza transmission resulting in high transmission rates in these closed settings. In addition, the influenza transmission may not reflect community‐acquired influenza and results from these studies cannot be generalizable to other settings. Due to a possibility of increased risk of high concentration of persons with co‐morbidities resulting in poor outcomes, closed settings should be prioritized for influenza vaccination.
