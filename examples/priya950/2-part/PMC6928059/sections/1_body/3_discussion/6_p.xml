<p>One of the studies suggested that compared to individuals infected only with tuberculosis, individuals with influenza‐PTB co‐infection had increased risk of death, and this association was not observed in patients with a more acute presentation. If cases with more chronic PTB are more at risk of severe influenza disease, this might explain the lack of association in some of the studies which only included LRTI patients with an acute presentation.
