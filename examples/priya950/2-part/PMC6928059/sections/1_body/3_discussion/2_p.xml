<p>Our systematic review suggests that analytical studies exploring the interaction between laboratory‐confirmed influenza virus infection and clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed PTB are severely limited. Experimental animal studies suggest an association, specifically that influenza‐tuberculosis co‐infection in mice results in more severe disease than influenza only or tuberculosis only disease. Observational studies among humans showed mixed results. Fifty per cent (4/8) of the analytical studies, one of which was of high quality, showed an association between co‐infection and severe influenza‐ or tuberculosis‐associated disease or increased prevalence of influenza co‐infection in individuals hospitalized for tuberculosis.

Three of the descriptive studies, although not assessed for statistical significance, reported either a high prevalence of co‐infection in cases with severe influenza disease
