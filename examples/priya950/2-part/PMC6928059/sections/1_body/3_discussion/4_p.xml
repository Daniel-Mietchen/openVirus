<p>Since the 1950s, authors have recommended influenza vaccination among patients with tuberculosis during influenza epidemics.
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza‐associated disease. Influenza vaccine has been shown to generate antibody response in patients with tuberculosis that is similar to those without tuberculosis, although these studies were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and did not include HIV‐infected individuals.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> However, both vaccines and antiviral treatment have cost implications and are not easily accessible in low‐ to middle‐income countries where the burden of tuberculosis and influenza are high.
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Identifying PTB patients as a risk group for severe influenza‐associated disease may assist policymakers in making decisions about prioritizing this group of patients for influenza vaccination and treatment with influenza antiviral treatment. More high‐quality epidemiological data from high tuberculosis burden settings are needed to address this question. In addition, more studies are needed to determine whether seasonal or pandemic vaccines or influenza antivirals should be prioritized for PTB patients and whether patients hospitalized with influenza‐associated illness should be investigated for PTB.
