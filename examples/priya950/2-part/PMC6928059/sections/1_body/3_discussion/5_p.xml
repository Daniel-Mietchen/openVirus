<p>Although some descriptive and analytical studies inferred worsening of PTB in co‐infected individuals,

In addition, there was no comparison of radiological findings in patients with and without co‐infection to assess whether changes in the lungs were a factor in the presentation or outcomes of influenza‐associated disease. The one study which showed an increase in pulmonary lesions did not present results on whether the radiological changes correlated with deterioration in clinical presentation.
