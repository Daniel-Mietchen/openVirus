<p>The mechanism by which influenza‐PTB co‐infection leads to severe influenza‐associated disease may be secondary to the underlying lung damage caused by PTB. It is possible that those who had severe outcomes from co‐infection already had the underlying lung damage from PTB leading to reduced lung capacity to deal with a viral infection such as influenza. Seki et al
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> suggested that the underlying chronic lung diseases such as tuberculosis may be an important factor in the increase in frequency of secondary bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza, which in turn can lead to increased frequency of complications.
