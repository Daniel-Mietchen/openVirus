<p>Data extracted from each study were entered into a Microsoft Excel worksheet, including: year published, study design, type of study (descriptive vs analytical), location of study, period of study, sample size, study setting (hospital/ICU/outpatient), type of influenza testing, tuberculosis testing method (microscopy, culture, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), results (influenza and tuberculosis), influenza strains, outcome and findings. In studies where only a number of cases or percentage was reported, we calculated the counterpart for the review. We summarized data under two groups, PTB in patients with influenza and influenza in patients with PTB; this was decided after examination of data. We did not stratify by age, gender or other characteristics.</p>
