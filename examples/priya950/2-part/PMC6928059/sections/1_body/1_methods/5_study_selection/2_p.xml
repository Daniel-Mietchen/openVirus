<p>Literature search results (titles and abstracts) were screened independently by two authors (SW and one of the co‐authors: CC, AN, JM, ALC or MM) to identify all citations that possibly met the inclusion criteria. Full manuscripts of selected citations were retrieved and assessed by one reviewer (SW) against the inclusion/exclusion criteria and checked independently by a second reviewer, one of the co‐authors (ALC, MM, JM, AN, CC, ST). Additional articles were identified from reviewing bibliographies of published articles. Discrepancies in included articles were resolved by consensus between the two reviewers with involvement of a third reviewer (CC) where necessary. Animal experimental studies, descriptive and analytic studies in humans were included. Studies that reported data on the association between laboratory‐confirmed influenza and clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed PTB including the following were included:
