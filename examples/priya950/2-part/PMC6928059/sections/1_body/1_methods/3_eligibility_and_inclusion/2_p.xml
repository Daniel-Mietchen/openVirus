<p>This review was restricted to published abstracts and articles from inception to December 2018 that reported data on the association (burden of disease, transmission and severity) between laboratory‐confirmed influenza and clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed PTB. Due to the scarcity of published data, descriptive studies, including studies without comparison groups, were included. Articles that included seasonal or pandemic influenza and animal experimental studies were also included. For human studies, inclusion was limited to studies in which influenza was laboratory‐confirmed and tuberculosis included PTB. Animal studies were included as they may provide useful insights into possible underlying mechanisms of interactions in humans. Studies that modelled ecological data on the association between influenza and tuberculosis, individual case reports, vaccine studies and influenza antiviral therapy in patients with tuberculosis were not included. Study selection is summarized in Figure
