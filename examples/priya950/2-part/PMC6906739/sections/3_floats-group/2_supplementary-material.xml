 <p>Functional enrichment of essential host genes associated with H5N1 infection. (A) Enriched Gene Ontology cellular component terms associated with 337 genes, as analyzed using Metacore. (B) Interactions among clusters of spliceosomes. The three kinds of colored circles (dark red, medium red, and light red) indicate that the cell viability increased more than 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. (C) Interactions among the clusters of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. The three kinds of colored circles (dark blue, medium blue, and light blue) indicate that the cell viability decreased more than 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. Download
