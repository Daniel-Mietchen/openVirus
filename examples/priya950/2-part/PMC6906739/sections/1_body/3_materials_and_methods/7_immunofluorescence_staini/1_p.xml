<p>Lung tissue was fixed with 4% formaldehyde for at least 24 h and was then embedded in paraffin. Next, antigen retrieval was performed. For immunofluorescence staining, sections were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and subsequently incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the indicated dilutions: anti-CD45 (rat; Abcam), 1:200; anti-CD11b (rabbit; Abclonal), 1:100; anti-ITGAX (CD11c) (rabbit; Abclonal), 1:100; anti-NCR1 (rabbit; Abclonal), 1:100; anti-CD3e (rabbit; Abclonal), 1:100; antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) (rabbit; CST), 1:500. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3, or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were used at a dilution of 1:200. Whole-section images were scanned with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Eclipse C1 fluorescence microscope and Nikon DS-U3 imaging system to identify leukocyte subsets.</p>
