<p>A genomewide small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting 19,424 human genes (with three siRNAs targeting each gene) and negative-control (NC) siRNAs was purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). A549 cells were plated into 96-well plates and transfected with siRNA (100 nM) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). At 24 h after transfection, A549 cells were infected with H5N1 influenza virus (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 3.0) or administered an equal volume of allantoic fluid (AF). At 48 h after infection, cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H (MTS) assay (catalog no. G3582, Promega, WI, USA). Cell viability values were normalized by calculating the ratio with respect to the viability of cells transfected with NC siRNA in the same plates as follows:
