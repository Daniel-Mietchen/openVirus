<p>Ifenprodil is a selective N-methyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and has been clinically used to treat neuronal injury and neurological disorders induced by overstimulation of the NMDA receptor (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Our RNAi screening data revealed that knockdown of the NMDA receptor gene (GRIN2B) could alter the viability of H5N1-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). We obtained RNA sequencing data from lung tissues of H5N1-infected mice treated with ifenprodil and analyzed biological processes and pathways influenced by ifenprodil compared to vehicle control mice. We found that ifenprodil influenced the immune response and neurophysiological processes in the mouse lung (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Dozens of genes in most of the top 10 pathways were reported to be related to lung diseases as well as to traditional neuropathic indications of ifenprodil (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table S4</xref> in the supplemental material). Although previous reports indicated that NMDA receptors are expressed in lung tissues, that NMDA receptor signaling is linked to inflammation, and that overstimulation of the NMDA receptor can trigger lung injury (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), our study revealed for the first time that ifenprodil is effective in avian influenza A H5N1 virus infection and lung injury.
