<p>By searching the DrugBank database, we identified 146 drug target genes (372 drug candidates) among 1,137 host genes that altered cell viability by more than 20% in the RNAi screen after H5N1 virus infection. We further evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 104 commercially available drugs (with 65 validated target genes) by examining their ameliorative effects in a cell viability assay in H5N1-infected A549 cells (
