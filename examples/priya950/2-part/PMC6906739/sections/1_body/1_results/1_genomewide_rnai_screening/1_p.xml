<p>A total of 19,424 human genes were screened by culturing with RNAi; 6,540 effective genes were selected for a second round of genomewide RNAi screening. The viability of H5N1-infected A549 cells was affected by a total of 2,957 genes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Among these host genes, 1,137 and 337 RNAi treatments altered cell viability with H5N1 infection by more than 20% and 30%, respectively, in both screenings (
