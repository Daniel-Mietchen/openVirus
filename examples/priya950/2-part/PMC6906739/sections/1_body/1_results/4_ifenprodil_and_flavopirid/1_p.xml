<p>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the lung tissue showed that ifenprodil and flavopiridol alleviated cytokine storm in H5N1-infected mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">B</xref>). We obtained blood samples from H5N1-infected mice and performed multiplex analyses to measure the levels of 23 cytokines/chemokines in plasma from mice administered ifenprodil or flavopiridol. Overall, ifenprodil treatment and flavopiridol treatment significantly decreased the measured levels of 8 and 12 cytokines/chemokines, respectively, in the plasma of H5N1-infected mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">H</xref>). Our results suggest that these drugs, especially ifenprodil and flavopiridol, can attenuate the excessive inflammation caused by H5N1 virus.
