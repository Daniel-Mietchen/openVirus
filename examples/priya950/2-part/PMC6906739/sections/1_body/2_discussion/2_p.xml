<p>The mechanisms by which ifenprodil and flavopiridol ameliorate lung injury and improve the survival of H5N1-infected mice may operate via an influence on the host immune response. Previous studies reported that limiting the infiltration of leukocytes such as NK cells and neutrophils could alleviate influenza A virus-induced ALI (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We found that both ifenprodil and flavopiridol significantly decreased the number of infiltrating cells in H5N1-infected mouse lung tissues. In addition, hypercytokinemia was reported in the blood samples of patients with lethal avian influenza A virus infection, and plasma cytokine and chemokine levels were linked to disease fatal outcomes (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In our study, both ifenprodil and flavopiridol alleviated cytokine storm, as they significantly decreased the RNA and protein levels of some cytokines and chemokines in lung tissues and blood samples from mice with H5N1 virus infection. In addition, we obtained H5N1-infected mouse lung tissues for RNA sequencing and conducted bioinformatic analysis, which showed that the genes influenced by ifenprodil or flavopiridol administration were highly clustered in GO functional terms and pathways related to the immune response. From these collective results, we speculated that the impact of ifenprodil and flavopiridol on the immune response contributes to the amelioration of H5N1-induced ALI and to improvement in mouse survival. However, the efficacy of ifenprodil and flavopiridol for the treatment of H5N1-induced ALI also needs clinical evaluation.
