<p>High‐income and low‐middle income countries with STI surveillance systems frequently rely on case reporting of STI cases or STI syndromes to estimate national incidence

 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. Case reporting drastically underestimates the burden of STIs due to the asymptomatic nature of infection, limited access to care for those with symptoms, and limited provider reporting 
 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. For these reasons, case reporting alone would not be a reliable measure of national STI burden. National, regional and global incidence and prevalence can be derived from longitudinal STI prevalence surveys using standard methods 
 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. STI prevalence surveys among general and high‐risk population groups of men and women can be conducted as part of population‐based health surveys such as those done for HIV, or in association with other health surveys or health services such as HIV screening and prevention (PrEP), maternal, reproductive, adolescent and child health services and military, work‐related or school‐based health screening. As STIs are not equally distributed among sexually active populations and a disproportionally higher burden of the STI/HIV epidemic occurs among certain key population sub‐groups, such as men who have sex with men and sex workers, specialized surveillance and culturally tailored programmes to address STIs among these populations are warranted. Routine STI prevalence assessments can identify key populations that can benefit from the implementation of effective STI interventions and further provide evidence of their impact. Global, regional and national estimates of STIs suffer from limited prevalence surveys among general populations, particularly among men
