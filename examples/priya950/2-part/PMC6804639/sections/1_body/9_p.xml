<p>As part of a transformation process taking place at WHO, set in motion by the Director General in 2018, the global STI surveillance and STI programme support activities will be moved from the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO RHR) to the Department of HIV and Hepatitis, to be duly renamed the WHO Department of HIV, Hepatitis and STIs. STI research will remain with (WHO RHR) ensuring that research continues to inform STI programming. The move of the STI programme will set an example at the global level of the opportunity to integrate these surveillance and country support activities recognizing similar modes of transmission, populations at risk and currently existing health care platforms. This transition is expected to herald a renewed global focus on the importance of STIs as indicators of HIV and hepatitis risk and as opportunities for prevention and control of all STIs while ensuring continued inclusion within the broader framework of sexual and reproductive health and rights
