<p>Robust national‐level strategic information systems that incorporate STI case reporting, prevalence surveys, assessment of the aetiology of STI syndromes, and monitoring for antimicrobial resistance to gonorrhoea are needed to guide programming and clinical service delivery

 <xref rid="fea-0001" ref-type="boxed-text">1</xref>). As reported in this issue by Wi et al., most countries lack the basic capacity to diagnose and treat STIs let alone implement surveillance 
 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Yet potential stakeholders must first recognize the prevalence and impact of these infections from reliable surveillance data. A vicious cycle of limited STI surveillance and narrow STI program response continues in most resource limited settings. Countries need strong strategic information systems that incorporate STIs to inform and help target prevention and treatment efforts, to rally political commitment, and build a strong national investment case. It is essential for countries to know their STI epidemics and to know the recommended responses in order that up to date, accurate information can guide national programming.
