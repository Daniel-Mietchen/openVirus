 <p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging viral pathogen discovered in 2009. The virus is present in countries of East Asia and is transmitted through the bite of an infected 
  <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> tick. SFTSV disease is associated with high morbidity and is often fatal. Despite the incidence of disease, no antiviral therapy or vaccine has been approved for use. Here, we report and assess 2 live attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates in our recently described ferret model of infection. We show that the viruses caused no clinical disease or mortality in healthy animals. Immunized animals mounted a robust humoral immune response to a single dose of virus, and this response protected the animals from a lethal challenge.
