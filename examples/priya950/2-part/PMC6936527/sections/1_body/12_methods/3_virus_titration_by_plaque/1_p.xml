<p>Virus titres were determined by focus-forming assays or by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were infected with serial dilutions of virus made in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% FCS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of a Glasgow’s Minimum Essential Medium overlay supplemented with 2% FCS and 0.6% Avicel (FMC Biopolymer). The cells were incubated for 6 d before fixation and staining with crystal violet to visualize SFTSV plaques, or using focus-forming assays for recombinant viruses as described previously (
