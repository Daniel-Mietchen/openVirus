<p>For the SFTSV ELISA, plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with purified nucleocapsid protein (0.2 μg/well) of CB1/2014 strain as previously described (
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Ferret sera was heat inactivated and treated with kaolin to reduce nonspecific binding. For the ELISA experiment, serum was collected from CB1/2014 infected ferrets and was used as a positive control in the data presented. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:10, followed by 2-fold dilution series in PBS from 1:10 to 1:2,560. After washing, the plates were incubated with 100 μL of diluted ferret serum with 2% skim milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were then incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)–anti-ferret IgG (KPL). For detection of antibodies, the plates were overlaid with 
 <italic>O</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) substrate and 1 M sulfuric acid was added. OD was measured with a spectrometer (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad) at 450 nm.
