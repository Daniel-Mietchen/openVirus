<p>Ferret sera were collected at 0, 8, 14, and 58 d after the last inoculation and neutralizing antibody was measured by FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> as previously described (
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Briefly, heat-inactivated, 1:10-diluted sera were used to neutralize virus. Twenty-five microliters of serially diluted serum were mixed with an equal volume of 200 focus-forming units of each SFTSV strain (rHB29, CB8/2016, and CB1/2014) for 1 h 37 °C. The mixture was adsorbed on to Vero E6 cells in 96-well plate at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were overlaid with maintenance medium, and the plates were incubated 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 d. The infected cells then were fixed with 10% formalin, and the foci formation was visualized with an in house-generated mouse anti-N antibody, followed by a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory). The antibody titers were expressed as reciprocals of the highest serum dilution showing a 50% plaque reduction or greater compared with control values.
