<p>Vero E6 cell line (commonly used cell line originally obtained from European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, previously described in ref. 
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). HuH7-Lunet-T7 cells (
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), which stably express T7 RNA polymerase, were obtained from R. Bartenschlager and were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 10% FCS. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> unless otherwise stated.
