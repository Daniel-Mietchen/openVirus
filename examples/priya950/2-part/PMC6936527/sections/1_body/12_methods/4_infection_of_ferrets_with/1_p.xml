<p>Groups of aged ferrets (&gt;4 y old; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) were infected via the i.m. route with rHB29 (4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFUs), rHB29NSsP102A (4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFUs), rHB2912aaNSs (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFUs), and CB8/2016 (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFUs). Blood was collected from anesthetized ferrets at intervals of 2 d until 12 d p.i. for virus titrations. In addition, 500-μL blood samples were immediately stored in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (MEDISTAR, Seoul, Korea) and analyzed for hematological parameters using a Celltac hematology analyzer (MEK-6550J/K; Nihon Kohden). To assess virus replication in SFTSV-infected ferrets, 3 ferrets from each group were scarified at 4 and 6 d p.i., and tissues (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine) were collected to assess viral RNA loads.
