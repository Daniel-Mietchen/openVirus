<p>Many rodent models for SFTSV have been developed in recent years, but no one model completely recapitulated the SFTS disease phenotype seen in human cases (

 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>); even experimentally infected Rhesus macaques (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and Cynomolgus macaques (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) do not develop a lethal disease. Recently, we described an immunocompetent age-dependent ferret model for SFTSV that recapitulated all SFTS disease pathologies, as evidenced by high viral loads in serum and tissues, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and a 93% mortality rate (
