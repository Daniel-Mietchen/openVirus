<p>Further research will need to be undertaken into the development of new reverse-genetics systems to fully understand the differences noted in the in vivo virulence observed between the Korean-derived isolates (CB1/2014 and CB8/2016) and the Chinese isolate (HB29) in our ferret model. The sequence of the recombinant rHB29 virus is based on a strain of SFTSV isolated from a patient described in Yu et al. (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, there are several differences between the viral isolates at the amino acid level in key proteins such as the virulence factor and innate immune antagonist NSs. The NSs protein of HB29 is only 96.6 and 98.0% similar to the NSs of CB1/2014 or CB8/2016, respectively. Our own experimental data has demonstrated a single point mutation (such as P
 <sub>102</sub>A) within NSs can dramatically reduce virulence of a virus (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). There is a total of 29 or 50 amino acid substitutions between HB29 and CB8/2016 or CB1/2014, respectively (

 </ext-link>). Therefore, it is possible that any of the amino acid changes between the different isolates could result in the attenuated phenotype observed in HB29-infected ferrets. Future work should aim to identify and pinpoint the amino acid changes that increase the pathogenicity of the Korean isolates.
