<p>Recently, genetic and phylogenetic analysis of SFTS viruses revealed that SFTSV could be grouped into at least 6 different genotypes referred to as genotypes A to F and that the prevalence of SFTSV genotypes are varied dependent on country (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Since the recombinant SFTS viruses described herein belonged to genotype D, the immunized ferrets were subsequently infected with a known lethal dose of a heterologous genotype B strain (CB1/2014) to evaluate cross-protective efficacy. These data clearly demonstrate that a single immunization of rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs is sufficient to confer heterologous-genotype protection in an aged ferret model when challenged with a lethal dose of the virulent strain of SFTSV, CB1/2014. Further, this protective effect was evidenced by a lack of clinical manifestations, an absence of thrombocytopenia and reduced virus replication and dissemination to the surrounding tissues of infected animals.
