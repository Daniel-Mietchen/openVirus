<p>In conclusion, we evaluated 2 recombinant HB29 derived live-attenuated SFTSV vaccine candidates and demonstrated their immunogenicity and protective efficacy using a lethal model for SFTSV in ferrets. rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs virus infection showed significantly reduced pathogenicity in the aged ferrets compared with the homologous genotype CB8/2016 strain (genotype D). Both viruses induced strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses against homologous and heterologous SFTSV strains. In particular, we found that following a single immunization with rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs ferrets were completely protected from lethal SFTSV challenge. No virus RNA was detectable in the serum or organs of preimmunized animals that had been challenged with CB1/2014 (

This suggests that a live attenuated vaccine platform might represent a suitable vaccine strategy against SFTSV due to its ability to induce a wider range of immune response types. It was recently reported that a live attenuated rVSV-based vaccine expressing the SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoproteins can elicit protection against SFTSV in immunocompromised IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (

Our live attenuated vaccines induced complete protection against lethal SFTSV challenge in an immunocompetent middle-sized animal model that exhibits clinical manifestations seen in SFTS patients (

Given the genetic diversity of SFTSV in nature, few prior studies have examined the cross-protective immunity against heterologous SFTSV genotype infections; thus, our present study provides valuable insights into the design of preventive vaccines against SFTSV.
