<p content-type="flushleft">SFTSV is an emerging pathogen of global significance (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Since its emergence in China in 2009 (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the virus has been isolated in Japan (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), Korea (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and Vietnam (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). As SFTSV is a relatively novel disease, therapeutic options are still limited to the administration of ribavirin, steroids, and/or plasma exchange in human patients (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Several companies and laboratories have been working to develop vaccines against SFTSV (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, there are many hurdles that must be overcome to successfully produce a useable vaccine, including the establishment of reliable vaccine efficacy testing methods. Firstly, the creation of proper animal infection models will be necessary to evaluate vaccine efficacy in vivo. To date, only a few animal models, such as type I IFN-deficient (
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), newborn (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), or mitomycin-treated mice (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), can recapitulate the fatal illness seen in human patients following SFTSV infection. However, it should be noted that type-I IFN-deficient and mitomycin-treated mouse models are both immunosuppressed systems. This means they cannot deliver the normal immune response against virus infection. Hence, a model for SFTSV infection with a normal immune status is essential to reliably test candidate vaccine efficacies. Secondly, a standard neutralization testing method will be needed to evaluate the cross-protective efficacy of novel vaccines. Recently, serum neutralizing antibody-based testing methods were reported (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>); however, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies with different SFTSV genotypes still needs to be evaluated to define a standard strain to be used in vaccine production.
