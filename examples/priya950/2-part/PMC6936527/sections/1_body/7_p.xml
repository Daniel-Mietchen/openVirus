<p>Since the discovery of the virus, there has been minimal work published on the development of antiviral therapies or vaccine candidates, and there is currently no commercially available vaccine to prevent SFTSV. Thus, it is of high priority to develop and evaluate potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent. Work has focused on a recombinant NSs protein vaccine (

 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) or a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidate expressing the SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoproteins (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). One therapeutic agent has also been developed through the characterization of an antibody isolated from an infected patient. Here, the authors demonstrated that this antibody conferred protection to a lethal SFTSV challenge (
