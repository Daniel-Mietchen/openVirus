<p>To evaluate the genetic stability of the NSs-deletant virus (rHB2912aaNSs), we conducted 6 serial passages of rHB2912aaNSs virus through groups of ferrets. In detail, 2 ferrets were infected with rHB2912aaNSs and the spleens of the animals were collected at 4 d p.i. for virus isolation in Vero-E6 cells. Once isolated, the passaged virus was administered to another pair of animals, until 6 passages had been recorded. The viral S RNA segment was amplified from each animalsâ€™ splenic tissue by RT-PCR, and the presence of the NSs truncation was confirmed by sanger sequencing. There were no nucleotide substitutions detected in the sequence of the S RNA segment isolated from passaged viruses compared to the original virus stock. Sequencing results also showed that no revertant virus was detected after 6 serial passages through sequentially infected animals.</p>
