<p>To demonstrate the association between clinical symptoms and virus replication in infected animals, we tested for the presence of viral RNA in the serum by qRT-PCR. All 4 viruses were detected in the sera of infected animals with rHB29 replicating to statistically higher levels than rHB2912aaNSs at days 4 and 6 p.i., whereas viral RNA from CB8/2016 was detected in the sera of infected animals from day 2 p.i. Peak RNA amounts of 1.62, 0.82, and 0.62 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies per 1 mL were observed at 4 d p.i. in rHB29-, rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A-, and rHB2912aaNSs-infected animals, respectively, before being cleared to undetectable levels by day 8 p.i. However, in animals infected with strain CB8/2016, viral RNA levels rose consistently over the course of the experiment peaking at 4.9 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies per 1 mL at 10 d p.i. Viral copy numbers of CB8/2016 recorded in the serum were consistently and statistically greater than those recorded in animals infected with the other SFTS viruses (

 <sub>102</sub>A, or rHB2912aaNSs viruses (
