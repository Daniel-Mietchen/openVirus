<p>One of the hematological pathologies’ characteristic of SFTS disease is a marked thrombocytopenia in infected patients and animals (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We examined platelet levels in the blood of animals infected with the 4 different viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). The expected normal range of platelets in laboratory ferrets is 171.1 to 1,280.6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). From 4 d p.i., several animals infected with rHB29 recorded platelet counts lower than the paired control sample taken on day 0 p.i. However, there was no statistical reduction in mean platelet counts observed at any time point analyzed (

 </xref>). None of the animals infected with either of the NSs-mutant viruses developed thrombocytopenia over the course of infection, and recorded mean platelet counts in these groups remained steady or even increased with time (

  <italic>B</italic> and 
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>). CB8/2016-infected animals developed a statistically significant thrombocytopenia by 6 d p.i., and this continued until 8 d p.i., where several animals had platelet counts below the expected normal range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref>). The average platelet count at 8 d p.i. for animals infected with CB8/2016 was only 153 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL, compared to that of 533, 851, or 758 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL in blood from rHB29-, rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A-, or rHB2912aaNSs-infected animals, respectively.
