<p>At 5 d p.c., 3 animals were killed per group to assess virus dissemination and tissue tropism in the challenged animals. In concordance with the initial infection data for CB8/2016 (

 <sub>102</sub>A-immunized and CB1/2014 challenged group, although this increase was not statistically significant (mean value of 0.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g). When the other tissues (e.g., lung, liver, kidney, and intestine) were examined, no statistically significant increases in viral RNA levels were detected (
