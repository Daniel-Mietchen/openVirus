<p>In CB8/2016-infected animals, viral RNA levels were high in all tissues assayed, with peak viral RNA levels detected in the spleen (4.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g) at 6 d p.i. A statistically significant increase in CB8/2016 virus copy number from 68 to 525 genome copies was also noted in the liver between 4 and 6 d p.i., respectively. CB8 replication was also detected in the intestines of infected ferrets (0.87 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g) at day 6 p.i., demonstrating a higher virulence and systemic spread of this virus compared to the other 3 viruses tested (
