<p>To further characterize the immunogenicity of each recombinant virus, we evaluated in vitro neutralization capabilities of the ferret sera by using a 50% focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT
 <sub>50</sub>) with the serum samples collected at the indicated time points post initial virus challenge (

  <italic>D</italic>–

 </xref>). Similar to the ELISA data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 
  <italic>A</italic>–
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>, the parental rHB29-infected ferrets showed the highest neutralization titers against both genotype D (HB29 and CB8/2016) and B (CB1/2014) viruses. Neutralization titres recorded from the rHB29-infected animal sera were detectable by day 8 p.i. and peaked at day 14 p.i. The peak FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained at day 14 p.i. were 5.5, 5.8, and 4.3 FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> (10log
 <sub>2</sub>) for the neutralization of rHB29, CB8/2016, or CB1/2014 viruses, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 
  <italic>D</italic>–
  <italic>F</italic>
 </xref>). Although the FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> value of sera from rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A- and rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets at 8 d p.i. was lower than the sera from that of the parental rHB29-infected group, they showed significantly increased FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values by 14 d p.i. from 2.5 to 3.3 FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> (10log
 <sub>2</sub>) against genotype D strains (rHB29 and CB8/2016). Further, both sera from rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A- and rHB2912aaNSs-infected animals showed neutralization titers of 2.5 FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> (10log
 <sub>2</sub>) against heterologous genotype B SFTSV strain, CB1/2014 on day 14 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4
  <italic>F</italic>
 </xref>). The FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values of each ferret sera remained stable until 58 d p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 
  <italic>D</italic>–
  <italic>F</italic>
 </xref>). These results suggest that preimmunization with rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs could induce robust production of cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous SFTSV strains.
