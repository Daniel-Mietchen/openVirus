<p>In this paper, we bring together previously developed recombinant viruses and the newly described ferret model of infection to assess the efficacy of these viruses as live attenuated vaccine candidates. We show that while infection with a genotype D Korean strain of SFTSV (CB8/2016) was lethal in our ferret model, infection of the animals with recombinant viruses, including a wild-type derived recombinant Chinese isolate (rHB29; genotype D) resulted in a mild self-resolving infection devoid of fever. Infected animals experienced no thrombocytopenia, had reduced viral RNA levels in both serum and tissues and all animals survived infection. These animals developed a robust anti-SFTSV humoral immune response against homologous and heterologous genotypes of SFTSV by 14 d post inoculation and this immune response was 100% protective against a cross-genotype lethal challenge with the CB1/2014 strain (genotype B). Further, rHB2912aaNSs showed no reversion to wild type during serial passage in vitro and in vivo. It is of note, that both CB8/2016 and HB29 are genotype D wild-type viruses isolated from infected patients. However, as demonstrated, HB29 is less virulent in our ferret model of infection. The further deletion or mutation of the NSs ORF as seen in rHB2912aaNSs or rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A respectively, further attenuates these viruses (
