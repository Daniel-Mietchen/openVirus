  <p>Distribution of viral RNA copies in blood and tissues of challenged ferrets. Six ferrets in each group were i.m. inoculated with 10
   <sup>7.6</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> of CB1/2014. At the time points indicated following lethal challenge, serum viral RNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR (
   <italic>A</italic>). At 5 d p.i., 3 ferrets in each group were killed, and tissues (lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestine) were assessed for viral RNA copy number by real-time PCR (
   <italic>B</italic>). The one-way ANOVA with Dunnett multiple comparison test was used to assess 
   <italic>P</italic> values compared with each day p.i. of rHB29. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 and **
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005 (
   <italic>A</italic>); *
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, **
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, and ***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 (
   <italic>B</italic>). # No samples were collected as animals had died/been killed.
