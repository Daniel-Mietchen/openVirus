  <p>Distribution and viral RNA copy number in tissues of SFTSV-infected ferrets. Tissues (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group) from ferrets infected with rHB29 (
   <italic>A</italic>), rHB29NSsP
   <sub>102</sub>A (
   <italic>B</italic>), rHB2912aaNSs (
   <italic>C</italic>), or CB8/2016 (
   <italic>D</italic>) were collected at days 4 (solid shapes) and 6 p.i. (open shapes), and viral RNA copy numbers were assessed with real-time PCR. Examined tissues included lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestine. The asterisks indicate significance compared to each day p.i. sample by the 2-tailed, unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic> test (*
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.0195). Each experiment was performed for 3 biological and 3 technical repeats.
