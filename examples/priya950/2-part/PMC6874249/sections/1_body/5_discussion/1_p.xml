<p>We conducted a longitudinal seroepidemiologic study of occupationally exposed poultry workers in China during December 2014â€“April 2016. We investigated antibody profiles of 7 AIV subtypes that have crossed the species barrier to infect humans, H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N8 subtypes, and H6N6 subtype, which is a potential risk to humans. We assessed seroconversion by analyzing paired serum samples from poultry workers and detecting AIV in poultry and the environment in live poultry markets.</p>
