<p>We used HI and MN cutoff values in accordance with previously published data (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1). We considered 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:20 as the cutoff value for HI and MN titers for positive tests for H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H6N6, H7N9, and H10N8 virus subtypes (

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>) and considered 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:40 as the cutoff value for HI titer and 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:80 as the cutoff value for MN titer for positive tests for H9N2, pH1N1, and H3N2 virus subtypes (

  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>). We set a stricter dilution cutoff value for the H9N2 virus subtype. An HI titer of 1:40 commonly is used and generally is an accepted value for influenza serologic assays used in detection of seasonal influenza and avian influenza H9 infection (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>). We considered participants to have seroconversion when they had a 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>4-fold rise in antibody titer measured by HI assay between collection of 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1 serum samples, plus an MN titer value of the later specimen being 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:20 or 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:80 for H9N2 subtype only.
