<p>Our analyses were based on seroepidemiologic studies for influenza published by Horby et al. (

 </xref>). We assigned each participant a unique identifier and used all data collected with the questionnaire to establish a database. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate independent risk factors associated with seroprevalence of antibodies in poultry workers. Risk factors evaluated were age; sex; occupational exposure factors, including processing, selling, transporting, and feeding poultry; and seropositivity to human influenza pH1N1 or H3N2 viruses. For logistic regression analysis, we estimated the maximum likelihood for the odds ratio (OR) and calculated 95% CIs by using the Wald Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> test. We used binomial distribution to calculate 95% CIs of rate. We used Spearman correlation analysis to estimate the association between seroprevalence and local epidemic intensity of AIVs in live poultry markets by region. We used 2-tailed p values for all calculations and considered values &lt;0.05 statistically significant. We performed statistical analyses by using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
