<p>The seroprevalence profile was geographically distinct (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, in Shandong Province, H9N2 virus antibody seroprevalence was 23%, which was higher than in other provinces, especially Sichuan Province, which had only a 4.2% seroprevalence for this subtype. Provinces in the Yangtze River Delta, which were the first to report H7N9 infections in patients during the 2013 outbreak, exhibited higher seroprevalence rates compared with the other provinces. Shanghai had a rate of 10.3% and Jiangsu Province had a rate of 6.9%. In Sichuan Province, where a nonâ€“laboratory-confirmed H7N9-infected patient was reported before 2017, no participant tested positive for the H7N9 subtype.
