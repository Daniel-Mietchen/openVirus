<p>Exploring the correlation between AIV circulation in poultry and seroprevalence in workers in live poultry markets revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.8 (p = 0.04) for H7N9 virus and 0.5 (p = 0.28) for H9N2 virus, indicating that prevalence of local AIVs was statistically correlated with H7N9 subtype seroprevalence. Our results also revealed that AIV prevalence in the different provinces was a key determinant of seroprevalence in the corresponding poultry workers. However, we did not observe a similar trend with other seroepidemic subtypes.</p>
