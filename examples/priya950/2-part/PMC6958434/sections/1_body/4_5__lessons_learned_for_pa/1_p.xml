<p>On 22â€“23 June 2010, the Wadsworth Center hosted a statewide conference for clinical and public health laboratories to review the New York State response to the 2009 influenza pandemic. Central in the coordination of efforts and communication was the NYSDOH Incident Management System, which had been activated for 286 days, with daily state-wide calls to all services and relevant agencies. These statewide conference calls facilitated the sharing of experiences with state, regional and local health departments, identified limitations and problems, discussed the best laboratory practices, and regulatory issues that arose during the pandemic. Additionally, weekly conference calls had been held with state PHLs, the CDC and the Association of the Public Health Laboratories (APHL). </p>
