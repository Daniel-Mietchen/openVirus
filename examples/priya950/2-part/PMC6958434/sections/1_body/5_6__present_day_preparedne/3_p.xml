Emergency preparedness and response efforts are critical in influencing the intensity and duration of the next influenza pandemic and its impact on public safety. In addition to the extensive use of rapid genomic surveillance tools for monitoring circulating viruses in the human population, it has become clear that a one health approach, with additional surveillance efforts in key animal species, is essential [
