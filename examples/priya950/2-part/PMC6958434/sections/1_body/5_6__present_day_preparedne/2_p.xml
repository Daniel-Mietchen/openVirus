<p>The national and international networks for influenza surveillance for early detection continue to evolve. The World Health Organization has established six collaborating centers for epidemiologic and virologic surveillance [

Additional National Influenza Reference Centers are in California and Wisconsin, and across the three centers which provide extensive analysis on approximately 3,000 positive influenza samples per season collected from all U.S. states and territories. For all specimens submitted to these reference centers, influenza viruses are sequenced directly with next generation sequencing, enabling the rapid identification of sequence drifts, shifts, new clades, resistance mutations and reassortments. This detailed analysis is essential for heightened rapid surveillance, vaccine selection and preparedness for seasonal influenza, as well as to detect the emergence of a novel influenza strain. Influenza viruses are also cultured and analyzed with classical assays.
