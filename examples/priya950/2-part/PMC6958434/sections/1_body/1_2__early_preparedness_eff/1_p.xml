<p>Essential to pandemic preparedness are components of influenza surveillance that detect the emergence and spread of influenza virus strains, as well as monitor morbidity and mortality. The efforts to surveil and control the spread of influenza were hampered until the discovery of the virus. First isolated in 1933 [
 <xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-04-00132" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the development of laboratory procedures for the culture and identification of influenza from clinical specimens also facilitated major research applications. Beginning in 1945, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), Division of Laboratories and Research, now known as the Wadsworth Center, initiated laboratory research and diagnosis of viral disease. The construction of a new laboratory building for virology in 1949 bolstered the expansion of services for infectious viral agents. The laboratory responded to influenza outbreaks by isolating the virus and analyzing its antigenic capabilities for vaccination [
