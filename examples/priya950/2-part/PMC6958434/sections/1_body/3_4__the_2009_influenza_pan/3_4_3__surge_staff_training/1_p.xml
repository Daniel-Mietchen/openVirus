<p>The surge staff, previously trained in real-time PCR methods in other diagnostic laboratories at the Wadsworth Center, were reassigned to support and complement the work of Virology staff. In earlier years, a group of cross-trained staff had been maintained with knowledge and familiarity in virology as part of preparedness planning. However, over time, a different model was found to be more efficient. Rather than a cross-training mode of preparedness, where time and resources are continually tapped to train and maintain technical competencies for years, the Wadsworth Center opted for a just-in-time training mode, whereby the surge staff were trained as needed, for a limited set of skills necessary for performance of a defined task. The optimization of just-in-time training aligned the existing skills of staff with a related objective. The individuals and small teams each contributed their component in a production line to complete the entire testing process from sample receipt to test report. Overall, the just-in-time training process decreased costs while increasing work productivity.</p>
