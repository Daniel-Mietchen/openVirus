<p>During the years of intense pandemic preparedness in the USA, the CDC developed a panel of human influenza real-time RT-PCR assays to detect influenza types A and B and distinguish subtypes A/H1N1 (seasonal) and A/H3N2. This panel was distributed to PHLs nationwide to ensure an all-state molecular detection capability. The A/H1N1pdm09 specific assay was added in 2009 to distinguish this virus from the previously circulating seasonal A/H1N1 influenza virus [

In NYS, as suspected case numbers rapidly surged in April 2009, state and local epidemiologists screened test requests, restricting testing to cases with true symptoms of influenza-like-illness, particularly to severe cases. This triage of cases was key to preventing the inappropriate application of the test. It also ensured that the laboratory workload did not become overwhelming. At the onset of the 2009 pandemic response at the Wadsworth Center, more space and automated equipment were allocated to accommodate the increased specimen load. The previous implementation of barcoding and electronic data transfer assisted in managing the testing surge (

The Wadsworth Center also provided validation materials to clinical laboratories that were implementing laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), reviewed subsequent validation data for those A/H1N1pdm09 specific LDTs, and prepared proficiency testing panels.
