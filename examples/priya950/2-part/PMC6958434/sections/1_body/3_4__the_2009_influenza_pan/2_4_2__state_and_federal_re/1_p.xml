<p>In 1918, epidemic influenza was made a reportable disease in New York State. On 1 December 2004, influenza was added to the NYSDOH reportable diseases list, requiring all NYS licensed clinical laboratories to report positive influenza test results to the NYSDOH via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System. The results were reported to the CDC for inclusion in national surveillance, initially by online submission, and later by automatic electronic standardized messaging. During the 2009 pandemic, additional advisories directed that all “swine-origin influenza virus” [subsequently novel influenza A (H1N1)] test results from licensed clinical laboratories, whether positive, negative or indeterminate, be reported to state epidemiologists. This additional notification requirement did not continue after the pandemic. </p>
