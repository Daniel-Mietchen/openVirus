<p>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to investigate viral infection of the lungs using the IAV strain and route of administration as described above. Lung tissue was collected in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and fixed for 48 h followed by embedding in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were de-paraffinized prior to antigen retrieval with 0.1% Pronase (Merck) in PBS for 10 min at 37°C. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in PBS for 10 min and after blocking with serum (15 min, 10% Normal Goat Serum, Jackson Immunoresearch) to minimize non-specific binding, sections were incubated with either mouse anti-influenza A nucleoprotein, clone HB-65 [ATCC; (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)] or Mouse IgG2A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Breda, The Netherlands) at 1:100 dilution for 60 min at room temperature. The incubation with DakoEnvision goat anti-mouse antibody (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) was according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, slides were developed with AEC+chromogenic substrate for 30 min, counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 30 s and mounted using aqueous mounting media.
