<p>Binding of SP-D to the viral HA and interference with binding of the virus to its receptor was assessed by HAI as previously published (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Two-fold dilutions of SP-D or peanut agglutinin (negative control, Sigma Aldrich, Schnellldorf, Germany), which was included as a negative control, were made using Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline containing PBS containing 1 mM of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, PBS-CM (Gibco, Grand Island, USA). To 100 μl of the diluted SP-D, 2 hemagglutination units (HAU) of the respective viruses diluted in PBS-CM were added. After 1 h, 25 μl of 1% turkey erythrocytes were added. The hemagglutination patterns were read after 3 h of incubation at room temperature. The highest SP-D concentration tested was 1,000 ng/ml, except for the assays that compared activity between oligomers and trimers (only strain A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1); highest concentration SP-D tested: 2,000 ng/ml). As a negative control, the experiment was also performed in PBS without CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to demonstrate the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the SP-D activity. Statistically significant differences were calculated by two-tailed paired Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
