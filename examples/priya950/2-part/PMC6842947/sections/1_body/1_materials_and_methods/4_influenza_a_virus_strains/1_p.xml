<p>Hemagglutination inhibition studies were performed with 31 IAVs. These were selected based on their subtype and species of origin and included avian, swine and human IAVs of three subtypes: H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. Details of these strains are listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells as described previously (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). After low speed centrifugation, the infectious virus titers of the culture supernatants of the infected MDCK cells were determined as described previously (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and virus stocks were stored at −80°C until use. The three recombinant H5N1 viruses, A/Indonesia/5/05, A/VietNam/1194/04 and A/HongKong/156/97 were prepared as 6+2 reassortant strains by reverse genetics as described previously (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The basic cleavage site in the HA protein was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis.
