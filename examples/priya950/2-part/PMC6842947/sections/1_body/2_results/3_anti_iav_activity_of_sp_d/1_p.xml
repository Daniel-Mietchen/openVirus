<p>The ability of SP-D to aggregate IAV particles was determined using the pandemic A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) strain. Virus incubated in the presence of 4.0 Î¼g/ml hSP-D resulted in aggregate formation as demonstrated by a gradual increase in light transmission (black squares, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In the presence of the same amount of iSP-D, aggregation was significantly increased (75% increase after 12 min as compared to hSP-D (white squares, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As a control, incubation of virus in buffer only did not result in any aggregation.
