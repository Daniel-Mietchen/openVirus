<p>All full-length SP-Ds were produced using transient transfection of HEK293E cells as described previously for recombinant full-length pSP-D and hSP-D (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The SP-D-containing cell medium was subjected to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent mannan affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography to separate different states of SP-D oligomerization (oligomers vs. trimers). Mannan affinity chromatography did not reveal differences in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent mannan-binding efficiency between the three recombinant SP-Ds. Transient expression of the newly developed iSP-D construct, however, resulted in significantly higher expression levels (average yield 15–20 mg/l) as compared to pSP-D and hSP-D (2.5–5 mg/l) with a similar ratio of oligomeric vs. trimeric SP-D (approximately 2:1, w/w). Analysis of the oligomeric fractions of all three SP-Ds by reducing SDS-PAGE showed a major monomeric band of ~ 50 kDa for pSP-D, while hSP-D and iSP-D migrated as slightly smaller monomers of ~ 45 kDa (

Under non-reducing conditions, all SP-Ds showed multiple bands of increasing molecular weights with a distinct major band at &gt;500 kDa, especially for pSP-D for which all bands ran at slightly higher molecular weight as compared to those from hSP-D and iSP-D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, right lanes). Western blot analysis of reduced and non-reduced hSP-D and iSP-D followed by immunostaining with rabbit anti-human SP-D showed identical patterns of immunoreactivity with band sizes corresponding to those obtained after Coomassie staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The oligomeric fractions of the three SP-D preparations were also subjected to structural analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Several different oligomeric forms could be distinguished for all three SP-Ds that include dodecamers (four-armed structures), higher-order oligomers (“fuzzy-ball”-like structures) and intermediate forms. Of note, the structures present in the iSP-D preparations showed a tendency to become slightly more contracted upon AFM analysis as compared to pSP-D and hSP-D.
