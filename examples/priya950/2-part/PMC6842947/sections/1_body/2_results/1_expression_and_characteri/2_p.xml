<p>The saccharide binding properties of the three SP-Ds were compared using a variety of mono- and disaccharides as competitors for SP-D binding to BSA-mannan coated plates (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for each competitor were determined as concentrations (mM) required to obtain 50% reduction in SP-D-binding to BSA-mannan. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were not strikingly different for all SP-Ds measured. The order of preferential glycan binding for pSP-D was almost identical to what was published previously for natural pSP-D (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Overall, no significant differences were observed in carbohydrate binding profiles between hSP-D and iSP-D and both were comparable to what was previously determined for hSP-D (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The only exception was the IC
 <sub>50</sub>-value for myo-inositol which was three times higher for iSP-D as compared to hSP-D, in strong contrast with pSP-D which showed highest affinity for this glycan.
