<p>Additional HAI experiments were performed using the comparatively SP-D-resistant strain A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1) to determine the importance of oligomerization for SP-Ds HAI properties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The assay was performed with higher SP-D starting concentrations (2,000 ng/ml) as compared to the HAI data shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Again, fully assembled pSP-D was most profound in inhibiting this IAV strain, slightly more effective compared to iSP-D while hSP-D was not able to inhibit A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1). Trimeric SP-Ds were less effective in HAI as compared to oligomeric SP-Ds. Although pSP-D trimers still retained most of their HAI activity (3-fold reduction in activity; 144 ± 52 ng/ml for trimeric vs. 48 ± 29 ng/ml for oligomeric pSP-D), the iSP-D trimers were much less effective (almost 13-fold reduction; 1,800 ± 210 ng/ml for trimeric vs. 140 ± 50 ng/ml for oligomeric iSP-D). In the case of hSP-D, trimers showed no HAI activity against A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1), similar to what was found for hSP-D oligomers.
