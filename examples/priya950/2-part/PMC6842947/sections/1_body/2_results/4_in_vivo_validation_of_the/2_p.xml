<p>Using the parameters described above, this infection model was used to determine the protective value of iSP-D 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The first experiment was executed by administering 25 Î¼g of iSP-D, immediately before inoculation with IAV, and included 3 control groups that received buffer only, virus only or iSP-D only (6 animals/group). All animals were monitored for changes in body weight and results showed an average weight loss of 12.5% over 3 days in the mice that were treated with buffer followed by inoculation with virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), just below the ethical end point which was set at a cumulative weight loss of &gt;15%. In contrast, the mice that were first treated with iSP-D, followed by inoculation with the same 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> dose of H1N1pdm09, did not show any weight loss. Administration of iSP-D only did not result in any changes in body weight as compared to treatment with buffer only. In line with protection from infection-induced weight loss, the iSP-D-treated mice were also partially protected from virus replication in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) since the average lung virus titer in iSP-D-treated mice was approximately 10 times lower compared to non-treated mice.
