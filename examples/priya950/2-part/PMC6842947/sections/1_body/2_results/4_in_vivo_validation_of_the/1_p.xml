<p>The virus inhibiting potential of iSP-D 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> was assessed by using a mouse model for influenza and to demonstrate the protective potential against a human-derived virus strain, a clinical isolate of pandemic H1N1 virus (E9-6714, named H1N1pdm09 in the following) was used for inoculation. The optimal dose and route of administration (either intranasal, intratracheal, or intratracheal using a microsprayer) for this pandemic strain was first determined in a pilot experiment (4 animals/group). Results indicated that a dose of 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> delivered by the use of pulmonary microsprayer inoculation resulted in rapid weight loss and broader distribution of the virus over the lungs as determined by immunohistochemical analysis of lungs 3 days after infection with IAV; representative images are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. Viral infection was observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A,B</xref>) as well as in in alveolar epithelial cells (
