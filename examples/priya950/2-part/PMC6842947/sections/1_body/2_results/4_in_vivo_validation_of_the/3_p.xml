<p>Next, we evaluated whether different batches of iSP-D were equally effective in protecting from influenza disease symptoms and virus growth in the lungs. In addition, we compared the activity of iSP-D with that of hSP-D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7C,D</xref>, respectively). In this experiment a lower dose of SP-D was administered (5.0 Î¼g/animal) to monitor differences in protective activity between iSP-D and hSP-D more adequately. Mice that were infected with IAV after treatment with buffer had a mean weight loss of 12.6% by day 3. In contrast, the mice treated with iSP-D batch-a had a maximal weight loss of 5.4% and 3 out of 6 animals did not lose weight at all (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Whereas, lung virus titers were significantly reduced upon treatment with iSP-D (batch-a or -b) as compared to the control group (buffer only), no statistically significant reduction was observed when hSP-D was administered prior to infection.
