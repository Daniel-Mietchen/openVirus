<p>The innate immune response is considered crucial for containment of viral spread at early stages of infection and many previous studies, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, have shown that SP-D is known to play an important role in protection against IAV infection (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Animal species-specific differences in anti-IAV activity of SP-D have been demonstrated and may result from variations in key amino acid residues located in the CRD near the lectin binding site which facilitates interactions with glycans exposed on the surface of IAV (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Porcine SP-D, in particular, has unique structural features that sets it apart from all other SP-D species. An N-linked sialoglycan in the CRD of pSP-D facilitates interactions with the sialic acid receptor of HA, the spike protein of IAV responsible for viral attachment to the host epithelium. Follow-up structural studies with deglycosylated NCRD fragments of pSP-D revealed that its CRD contains a unique tripeptide loop (326
 <sup>GSS</sup>), that most likely contributes to the distinct lectin-mediated activity of pSP-D (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Crystallography and docking studies with octamannose also revealed 5 other residues that are hypothetically involved in generating profound anti-IAV activity as displayed by pSP-D: Asn324 and Asn330 might increase flexibility of the 326
 <sup>GSS</sup> loop, while Glu251, Gln287, and Lys289 are unconserved residues that could make contact with distal parts of lectin-bound octamannose (unpublished observations). To investigate to what extent these porcine-specific residues contribute to the distinct lectin-mediated antiviral activity of pSP-D, we generated iSP-D, a hSP-D-based mutant that has 8 amino acid residues in its CRD modified according to the pSP-D sequence (
