<p>The importance of SP-D in protecting against IAV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been demonstrated by the use of SP-D knockout mice (SP-D -/-) that, upon infection by IAV, show increased lung virus titers and weight loss as compared to wildtype mice (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); pulmonary instillation or over-expression of SP-D can correct these effects (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Pandemic IAV strains, in particular, are associated with low expression of N-glycans in the head region of their HAs and consequently, these strains are fairly resistant for lectin-mediated binding and subsequent neutralization by SP-D (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> was tested with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, not only because pandemic IAVs are of special interest with regard to their implications for human health, but also because this virus is resistant to neutralization by endogenous wildtype SP-D. Weight loss of infected mice was rapid and consistent and is considered to be an important and sensitive indicator of diseases symptoms in mice. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on IAV-infected mice and sections were stained for the presence of viral antigens. Results indicated that H1N1pdm09 infection in mice induced bronchiolitis but also alveolitis, with virus-staining in epithelial cells lining the bronchioles and the alveoli (

Moreover, these observations also mimic closely pulmonary infections in humans caused by pandemic IAV (e.g. 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009) characterized by distinct, substantial pathological changes of the lower respiratory tract, associated with widespread infection of bronchiolar as well as alveolar epithelial cells (
