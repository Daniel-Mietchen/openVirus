  <p>Lung immunohistology of pandemic IAV infection mouse model. Pattern of pandemic IAV-infection in the lungs from mice used as a model for antiviral efficacy studies with iSP-D. Photomicrographs of hematoxylin-stained tissue sections and immunohistochemically stained sections for detection of influenza viral nucleoprotein from mice infected with a clinical isolate of pandemic A/California/E9/09 (H1N1) at a dosis of 1 Ã— 10
   <sup>3</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> in PBS. After intubation, the virus was administered by microspraying just above the tracheal bifurcation. Three days post-infection, lungs were collected, fixed, embedded in paraffin and further processed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Viral antigen is stained reddish brown against a hematoxylin-stained blue background and shown for different areas of the lower respiratory tract: 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> bronchiolar epithelial cells, 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> alveolar epithelial cells. Scale bars as indicated in each panel.
