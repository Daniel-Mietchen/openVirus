  <p>Aggregation of IAV particles by hSP-D and iSP-D. IAV particles [strain A/Aichi/68 (H3N2)] were suspended in buffer, mixed at 
   <italic>t</italic> = 0 with 4.0 μg/ml iSP-D or hSP-D (control: virus only). The continuously stirred mixture was monitored for light transmission during 12 min and results are expressed as % of light transmission at 
   <italic>t</italic> = 0. Measurements were performed five times and values are mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was carried out by the two-tailed paired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (iSP-D vs. hSP-D).
