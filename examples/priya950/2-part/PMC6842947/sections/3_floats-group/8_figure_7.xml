  <p>Validation of iSP-D as antiviral agent against pandemic IAV infection in mice. The protective potential of iSP-D against pandemic IAV infection 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> was assessed using the model as described in the materials and methods section and in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. Three different experiments were executed with 4 different conditions within each experiment; group size was 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per condition. Administration of iSP-D or hSP-D and viral challenge (A/California/E9/09 (H1N1) strain, 1 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) as described in the Materials and Methods. Three days after infection the average animal weights (% of weight at day 0) and average virus titers (log virus/g lung tissue) were determined for all experimental groups. Experiment I, 
   <bold>(A)</bold> (animal weight) and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> (virus titers): antiviral effect of iSP-D-delivery (25 μg/animal) immediately followed by viral challenge. Experiment II, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> (animal weight) and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> (virus titers): comparison of antiviral activity between 2 different batches of iSP-D and between iSP-D and hSP-D (5.0 μg/animal). Experiment III, 
   <bold>(E)</bold> (animal weight) and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> (virus titers): the antiviral effect of iSP-D (25 μg/animal) delivered 1 day after or 1 day before viral challenge. Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were made by Student's two-tailed paired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. *
