  <p>Transcriptional gene profiling of expression changes in acute ZIKV infection. Immunology panel gene expression profiling in the ZIKV RM cohort (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4) at day 0 (filled blue circles) or day 3 (open blue circles) and SIV/ZIKV RM cohort (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) at day 0 (filled red circles) or day 3 (open red circles). (A) Principal-component analysis comparing the four sample groups. The plot represents clustering of the data in a 2-dimensional (Dim.1 and Dim.2) matrix. Each dot represents one RM. (B) Heatmap of 163 differentially expressed genes (
   <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) in ZIKV and SIV/ZIKV RM cohorts (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5, respectively) at day 0 post-Zika infection. Blue indicates low relative gene expression, and yellow indicates high relative gene expression. Each row represents a normalized expression value for a single gene, and each row represents one animal from the corresponding cohort. (C) Pathway activation determined by z-scores. The top five pathways predicted to be activated (orange) or deactivated (blue) are displayed. PRRs, pseudoresponse regulators; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; HIV1, HIV type 1; ICOS, 
   <italic>i</italic>nducible T cell 
   <italic>cos</italic>timulator; ICOSL, 
   <italic>i</italic>nducible T cell 
   <italic>cos</italic>timulator 
   <italic>l</italic>igand. (D) Association between the CXCL10-normalized count at day 0 post-Zika infection and IP-10 levels (picograms per milliliter) in plasma at day 0. (E to G) Associations between ZIKV plasma viremia (log
   <sub>10</sub> number of GE per milliliter) at day 3 post-Zika infection and CXCL10 (E)-, IFIT3 (F)-, or IRF7 (G)-normalized counts at day 0 post-ZIKV infection. (H and I) Associations between normalized counts at day 0 post-ZIKV infection of IRF7 and CXCL10 (H) or IFIT3 (I). (D to I) Blue squares represent data from the ZIKV cohort, and red circles represent data from the SIV/ZIKV cohort. Correlations in panels D to I were determined using Spearman’s rank analysis.
