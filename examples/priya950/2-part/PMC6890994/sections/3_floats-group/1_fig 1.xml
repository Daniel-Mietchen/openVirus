  <p>Effect of SIV coinfection on ZIKV viremia and cellular infection in peripheral lymph nodes. (A) Study design depicting longitudinal time points for SIV infection, ZIKV infection, and PBMC and peripheral LN sampling. (B) Memory CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell counts for ZIKV (blue squares; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) and SIV/ZIKV animals (red circles; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 7). Each line represents an individual animal. (C) ZIKV mean viral titer in plasma (ZIKV, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 12; SIV/ZIKV, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 7). AUC was calculated from day 2 (d2) to day 7. (D and E) ZIKV RNA per 1,000 sorted cells in peripheral LN T cells (circles), B cells (squares), and macrophages (triangles) at 5 days post-ZIKV infection (D) and 27 days post-ZIKV infection (E) in SIV/ZIKV-coinfected animals (red) and ZIKV animals (blue). (F) Representative lymph node immunohistochemistry images at day 27 post-ZIKV infection of ZIKV vRNA (RNAscope; red), CD20 (B cell follicle; green), CD68 (white), and DAPI (blue). (G) Percentages of the ZIKV probe signal that are found within the B cell follicle region (filled symbols) and all other regions of the LNs (Other; open symbols) at day 5 and day 27 post-ZIKV infection. (H) Quantification of the LN area positive for ZIKV vRNA probe per total LN area quantified at day 5 and day 27 post-ZIKV infection. The dashed line represents the limit of detection (LOD). For this figure, all 
   <italic>P</italic> values between groups represent Mann-Whitney 
   <italic>t</italic> test results (red compared to blue), while 
   <italic>P</italic> values between cell types or days within the same group represent Wilcoxon matched-pair results.
