  <p>ZIKV, on its own, does not affect CD4 T cell polyfunctionality. (A and B) Pie charts depicting Th1 functionality and the ability of IFN-γ
   <sup>+</sup> IL-17
   <sup>–</sup> CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells to simultaneously produce CD40L, TNF-α, and IL-2 (A) and Th17 functionality and the ability of IL-17
   <sup>+</sup> IFN-γ
   <sup>–</sup> CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells to simultaneously produce CD40L, IL-22, IL-2, and TNF-α (B) in SIV/ZIKV (top pie charts)- and ZIKV (bottom pie charts)-infected RMs prior to and after infection with SIV and ZIKV. 
   <italic>P</italic> values are based on SPICE permutation tests and reflect differences between T cell polyfunctionality based on the expression of different combinations of cytokines (as illustrated by arcs surrounding each pie). 
   <italic>P</italic> values of &gt;0.05 are listed as not significant (NS).
