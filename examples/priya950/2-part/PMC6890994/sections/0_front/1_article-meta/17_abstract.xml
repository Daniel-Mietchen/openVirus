 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>Flaviviruses are controlled by adaptive immune responses but are exquisitely sensitive to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). How coinfections, particularly simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), that induce robust ISG signatures influence flavivirus clearance and pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we studied how Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is modulated in SIV-infected nonhuman primates. We measured ZIKV replication, cellular ZIKV RNA levels, and immune responses in non-SIV-infected and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), which we infected with ZIKV. Coinfected animals had a 1- to 2-day delay in peak ZIKV viremia, which was 30% of that in non-SIV-infected animals. However, ZIKV viremia was significantly prolonged in SIV-positive (SIV
  <sup>+</sup>) RMs. ISG levels at the time of ZIKV infection were predictive for lower ZIKV viremia in the SIV
  <sup>+</sup> RMs, while prolonged ZIKV viremia was associated with muted and delayed adaptive responses in SIV
  <sup>+</sup> RMs.
