<p>Both ZIKV and SIV have individually been isolated from wild nonhuman primates (NHPs) and, when experimentally introduced into captive NHPs, have been shown to mirror aspects of human disease progression (

We found that ZIKV viremia peaked later and was prolonged in SIV-coinfected RMs. These data provide insight into how preexisting lentiviral infection modulates ZIKV viremia in a relevant NHP model for both infections.
