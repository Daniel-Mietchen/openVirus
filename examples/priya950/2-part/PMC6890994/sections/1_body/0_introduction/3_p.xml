<p>Adaptive immune responses are also clearly important for the clearance of ZIKV and other flaviviruses (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which provide critical immunological defense functions. Most HIV/SIV-infected individuals who are not treated with combination antiretroviral therapy will lose sufficient numbers of these CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to render them susceptible to opportunistic infections (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). While this sensitivity to opportunistic infections generally occurs very late after the acquisition of infection, several studies have shown that HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) mount suboptimal adaptive immune responses to vaccination and viral infections (
