<p>To assess ZIKV RNA levels in the plasma of our study RMs, viral RNA was extracted using EZ1 virus minikit v2.0 (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Life Technologies). Absolute quantification of virus genome equivalents (GE; log
 <sub>10</sub> per milliliter) was determined by real-time PCR using a TaqMan probe (Integrated DNA Technologies) targeting the ZIKV E protein. ZIKV RNA levels were measured in all animals to at least day 11 post-ZIKV infection. All animals, except RHDFiV (SIV/ZIKV cohort) measured below the limit of detection (LOD) of 3.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> GE/ml at 11 days postinfection (dpi).
