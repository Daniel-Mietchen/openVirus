<p>Rhesus macaque LNs were biopsied 5 or 27 days post-ZIKV infection in both the ZIKV and SIV/ZIKV cohorts. LNs were then fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. LNs were then dehydrated by washing them in sequentially increasing concentrations of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and allowed to sit overnight at 4°C. LNs were sectioned at 5 μm (Histoserv). Sectioned slides were deparaffinized in a dry oven for 1 h at 60°C, followed by sequential washes in 100% xylene, ethanol of decreasing concentrations, and distilled water (dH
 <sub>2</sub>O). Antigen retrieval was performed by steaming slides immersed in a 0.5% citraconic acid solution (pH 7.4) at 95°C for 20 min, followed by two 10-min rinses in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O. Sections were treated with Protease Plus pretreatment solution (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) diluted 1:5 in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at 40°C, rinsed twice in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O, and then treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed twice in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O. Fluorescent 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was conducted using an RNAscope 2.5 HD Brown detection reagent kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. ZIKV RNA was detected using the V-ZIKA-pp RNAscope probe, and SIV RNA was detected using the SIV
 <sub>mac239</sub> RNAscope probe (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Following the final amplification step, tissue was stained with Trypticase soy agar (TSA) plus cyanine 3.5 amplification reagent (Perkin Elmer).
