<p>Primary-antibody staining was detected with Alexa Fluor 568 or 647 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Invitrogen). Some sections were stained with anti-ZIKV envelope (BioFront Technologies) for comparative analysis. Stained tissue was treated with 10â€‰mM CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>-50 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl (pH 5.0), TrueBlack lipofuscin quencher (Biotium), and TrueVIEW (Vector Laboratories) to quench autofluorescence. Slides were then mounted using Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences).
