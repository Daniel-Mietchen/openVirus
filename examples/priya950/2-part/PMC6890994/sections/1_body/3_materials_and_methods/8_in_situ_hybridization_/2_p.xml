<p>After RNA-fluorescent 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), sections were blocked overnight at 4°C in washing/blocking solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl [Quality Biological], 0.1%, vol/vol, Tween 20 [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.5%, vol/vol, cold water fish skin gelatin [Sigma-Aldrich]). Sections were stained with anti-CD68 (KP1; BioLegend) or anti-CD20 (L26; Invitrogen) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as a counterstain.
