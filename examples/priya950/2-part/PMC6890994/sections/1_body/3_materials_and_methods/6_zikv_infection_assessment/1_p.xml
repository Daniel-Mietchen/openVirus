<p>Lymph node cells from day 5 and day 27 post-ZIKV infection were sorted into T cell, B cell, and macrophage populations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>) for assessment of ZIKV viral RNA via qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted from sorted cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase I treatment per the manufacturer’s instructions. ZIKV positive-strand RNA was measured by qRT-PCR using the primers and probe described by Lanciotti et al., with a slightly modified probe to more closely correspond to the Nicaragua ZIKV sequence (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). The following primer and probe sequences were used: forward, 5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′; and probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM)-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAATCAGACACTCAA-MGBNFQ-3′. The qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate using Applied Biosystems TaqMan fast virus 1-step master mix and a QuantStudio 6 instrument (ThermoFisher). A standard curve was generated using

Friedrich, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The standard curve was used to extrapolate the number of copies of ZIKV RNA per 1,000 cells. Samples were considered positive if at least one of the triplicate wells had a threshold cycle (

  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>) value of less than 38. If not all of the wells of the triplicate sample were positive, then any positive

  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>s from that sample were averaged and divided by 3 to calculate the copy number.
