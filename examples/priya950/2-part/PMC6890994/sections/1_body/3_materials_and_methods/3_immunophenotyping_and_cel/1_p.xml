<p>Isolated PBMCs were used for multicolor flow analysis and cellular sorting using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with specific cross-reactivities to RM antigens. All PBMC samples at various time points from a specific animal were stained and run at one time. Cellular viability was assessed by Live/Dead Aqua (Invitrogen) fixable dead-cell staining, followed by staining with fluorescently conjugated MAbs against CCR5 phycoerythrin (PE) (clone 3A9), CD20 PE-Cy7 (L27), CD27 V450 (M-T271), CD3 Alx700 (SP34-2), HLA-DR allophycocyanin (APC)-H7 (L243), CD11b/MAC-1 BV605 (ICRF44), CD16 BV711 (3G8), and CD14 BV786 (M5E2) from BD Biosciences, CD28 ECD (28.2) and NKG2a APC (Z199) from Beckman Coulter, CD95 PE-Cy5 (DX2) and CD8a peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-Cyanine5.5 (RPA-T8) from eBioscience/Invitrogen, and CD4 BV650 from BioLegend to determine immunophenotype. Cells were then permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm; BD Biosciences), and their proliferation was assessed via
