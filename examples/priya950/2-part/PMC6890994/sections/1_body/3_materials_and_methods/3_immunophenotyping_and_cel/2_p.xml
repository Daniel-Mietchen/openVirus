<p>Cellular functionality was assessed after overnight stimulation at 37°C with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 2.5 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μM) in the presence of brefeldin A (1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) using the following MAbs (in addition to or intermixed with the above panel): IFN-γ V450 (B27) from BD Biosciences, NKG2a PE (Z199) from Beckman Coulter, TNF-α BV605 (MAb11) and IL-2 BV785 (MQ1-17H12) from BioLegend, and IL-22 APC (IL22JOP), IL-17 Alx488 (eBio64DEC17), and CD154 APC-eFluor780 (24-31) from eBioscience/Invitrogen. All samples were run on an LSRFortessa apparatus (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software version 9.9.5 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Any cell subset analysis that was based on fewer than 200 cells of the parent population was not included.</p>
