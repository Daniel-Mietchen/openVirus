<p>Reporter virus particles (RVPs) incorporating the structural proteins of ZIKV (strain H/PF/2013) (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>), dengue virus 2 (DENV2; strain 16681) (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), or West Nile virus (WNV) lineage I (strain NY99) (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>) were produced by complementation of a subgenomic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing replicon derived from a lineage II strain of WNV as previously described (

 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). To determine virus titer, 2-fold dilutions of RVPs were used to infect Raji cells that express the flavivirus attachment factor DC-SIGNR (Raji-DCSIGNR cells) (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) in duplicate technical replicates at 37°C. GFP-positive infected cells were detected by flow cytometry 2 days later. In subsequent neutralization assays, RVPs were sufficiently diluted to within the linear range of the virus infectivity dose-response curve to ensure antibody excess at informative points.
