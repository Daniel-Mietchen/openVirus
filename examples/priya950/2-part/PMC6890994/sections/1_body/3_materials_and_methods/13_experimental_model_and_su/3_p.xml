<p>Peripheral blood and lymph node biopsy specimens were collected pre- and post-ZIKV infection as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>. These sampling time points were chosen to focus extensively on early ZIKV infection prior to clearance from plasma circulation, as well as to include later time points in order to determine viral immune response dynamics and persistence. Study animals were prospectively screened and, with the exception of RHA0P003, free of the presence of antibodies for West Nile virus, dengue virus, and ZIKV prior to study infection. Neutralizing antibody titers from RHA0P003 were left out of the analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref> due to clear evidence of prior WNV infection detected in a prospective antibody-dependent enhancement WNV reporter virus particle assay. The NAb titers from this animal were high enough to drive significant differences at day 7 (a 17.8-fold higher average NAb titer in non-SIV-infected RMs), which was no longer significant when the RHA0P003 titers were left out.
