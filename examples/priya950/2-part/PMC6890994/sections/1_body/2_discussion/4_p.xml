A combination of Tfh loss and ISG-mediated hypoantigenemia may be cumulatively operative in decreasing ZIKV-specific NAbs. Although the degree to which lower levels of antibodies influence susceptibility to flaviviral coinfection is unclear, these data coupled with the prolonged ZIKV viremia demonstrate that SIV infection shapes the resultant anti-ZIKV response.
