<p>NHPs are often used as models to study viral vaccine efficacy and antiviral therapeutic safety and efficacy and to understand aspects of viral pathogenesis. Owing to &gt;90% genetic coding conservation between humans and nonhuman primates, viral infections in NHP models result from infections of the same cell types and induce nearly identical pathologies (

Here, we studied how preexisting SIV infection influences subsequent ZIKV infection. We find that the type I IFN responses elicited in SIV-infected RMs correlates with reduced ZIKV replication, that these coinfected animals mount inferior humoral responses to ZIKV, and that these animals have delayed ZIKV clearance. A recent study, using a small cohort of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)- and SIV-infected RMs also found that ZIKV viremia was uncharacteristically low during coinfection; however, the authors concluded that SHIV/SIV infections did not dramatically influence the course of ZIKV infection (
