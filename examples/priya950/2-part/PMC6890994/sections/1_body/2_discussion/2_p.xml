 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), and aberrant inflammation (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) are all described contributors. In HIV and SIV infection, antibody/virus complex trapping by follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks promotes the increased HIV/SIV exposure and subsequent infection of Tfh cells, and this is exacerbated by an inability of virus-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to enter the follicle (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Indeed, replication-competent HIV can be recovered from the FDC network for years after HIV-infected individuals are treated with antiretroviral therapy (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>) in SIV-coinfected animals suggests that replication-competent ZIKV may persist in lymphoid follicles and suggests that similar mechanisms may be operative for other flaviviruses. However, it is unclear which particular types of cells become ZIKV RNA
 <sup>+</sup> in lymphoid follicles or whether FDCs can become infected themselves. Additional work is required.
