<p>Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of the gene expression profiles revealed a robust type I IFN response to SIV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4B</xref>, ZIKV monoinfection). We compared levels of mRNA for IP-10/CXCL10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (from normalized counts from nanostring analysis) to protein levels in plasma (from ELISA) and found a strong, positive correlation (

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9167, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0013). We further observed an association between levels of IP-10 mRNA at day 0 and ZIKV viremia at day 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>), as we did with IP-10 protein levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This association was not limited to IP-10/CXCL10, as we also identified message levels of interferon-stimulated IFIT3 as a predictor of subsequent ZIKV peak viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F</xref>). To further understand the robustness of these findings, we also examined and found a relationship between ZIKV viremia and levels of IRF7, a central ISG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Indeed, IRF7 correlated positively with both CXCL10 and IFIT3 (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0061 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5I</xref>) (
 <italic> P</italic> = 0.0108). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the SIV-induced type I IFN response may lead to diminished ZIKV viremia during coinfection.
