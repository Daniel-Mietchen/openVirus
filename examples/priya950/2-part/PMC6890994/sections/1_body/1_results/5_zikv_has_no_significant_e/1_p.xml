<p>HIV and SIV infection are associated with decreased T cell functionality and loss of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, particularly Th17 cells from mucosal tissues, supporting the delayed and decreased immune responses observed in our ZIKV/SIV-coinfected animals (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This immunological perturbation is thought to be due, in part, to alterations to antigen-presenting cells, which result in an environment conducive to the maintenance and development of Th1 cells (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Given that ZIKV is also an RNA virus which induces Th1 cells (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), we sought to explore whether ZIKV coinfection further exacerbates immune dysfunction. Thus, we assessed whether SIV/ZIKV coinfection changed the functional profile of memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. We, therefore, measured the expression of CD40L, interleukin 22 (IL-22), IL-17, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) from mitogenically stimulated memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells by flow cytometry. We then determined the overall functional capacity of Th1 (IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> IL-17
 <sup>–</sup>) and Th17 (IL-17
 <sup>+</sup> IFN-γ
 <sup>–</sup>) CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells using a simplified presentation of incredibly complex evaluations (SPICE) analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). SIV infection decreased the polyfunctional capacity (defined here as the ability to simultaneously express CD40L, TNF-α, and IL-2) of Th1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Consistently with previous reports (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), SIV infection resulted in decreased polyfunctionality (simultaneous expression of CD40L, IL-22, IL-2, and TNF-α) of Th17 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). ZIKV infection did not influence the functional capacity of memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (either Th1 or Th17 cells) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).
