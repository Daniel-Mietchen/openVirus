<p>The humoral immune response plays a significant role in controlling flavivirus infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In non-SIV-infected animals, NAbs to ZIKV became detectable by day 7 post-ZIKV infection and then peaked at days 14 to 21, after which, titers plateaued until at least day 56 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (AUC, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0051). The SIV/ZIKV-coinfected RMs had a 5.3-fold-lower average EC
 <sub>50</sub> NAb titer at day 11 and a 2.9-fold-lower titer at day 14. Taken together, these data suggest that SIV-infected RMs have reduced innate and adaptive immune responses to ZIKV infection.
