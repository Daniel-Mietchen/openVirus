<p>Fluorescence 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for ZIKV RNA in lymph node sections verified that ZIKV RNA could be detected both within B cell follicles and in the paracortex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>, where ZIKV RNA is indicated with red arrows), with the majority of the ZIKV RNA at days 5 and day 27 post-ZIKV infection found within the B cell follicle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>). To understand how lymph node levels of ZIKV RNA compared between SIV
 <sup>+</sup> and non-SIV-infected animals, we performed quantitative image analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">H</xref>). Consistently with our plasma ZIKV RNA analysis, we observed modestly higher levels of ZIKV RNA within lymph nodes of non-SIV-infected animals at day 5 post-ZIKV infection than in SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.056) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>) but significantly higher levels of ZIKV RNA in lymph nodes of SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals at day 27 post-ZIKV infection (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). These data are consistent with delayed clearance of ZIKV in SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals and further demonstrate that the LN serves as a prolonged ZIKV reservoir in RMs.
