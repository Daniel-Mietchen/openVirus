<p>The observed delays in both ZIKV viremia and immunological responses in coinfected RMs suggested that SIV viremia might, itself, either directly or indirectly limit ZIKV replication. However, when we compared SIV plasma viral loads at day 0 of ZIKV infection with ZIKV plasma viral loads at day 3 post-ZIKV infection (peak ZIKV viremia in non-SIV-infected animals) we found no clear evidence that SIV viremia correlates with the extent of subsequent ZIKV replication (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), we next sought to examine whether there was an association of ISGs with levels of ZIKV viremia in our SIV/ZIKV animals. To measure systemic levels of IFN signaling, we assayed plasma levels of IP-10/CXCL10 in our animals longitudinally after SIV and ZIKV infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This IFN-induced protein has been shown to be high in acutely ZIKV-infected individuals and strongly associated with exanthema (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In non-SIV-infected animals, ZIKV infection led to increased plasma levels of IP-10 that were maintained until day 14 post-ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In SIV/ZIKV-coinfected animals, SIV itself (pre-ZIKV) induced and maintained high plasma levels of IP-10 (higher than those observed in the animals infected only with ZIKV) that did not further increase following coinfection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We, thus, questioned whether the IFN response elicited by SIV infection might predict lower levels of peak ZIKV viremia and compared the plasma levels of IP-10 prior to ZIKV infection with the levels of ZIKV viremia at day 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Higher levels of IP-10 prior to ZIKV infection, produced in response to SIV infection, were predictive of lower levels of ZIKV viremia. Moreover, the prolonged ZIKV viremia observed in SIV/ZIKV-coinfected RMs at day 7 post-ZIKV infection was associated with plasma levels of IP-10 prior to ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Thus, the IFN-stimulated response mounted against SIV correlated with a delayed peak and prolonged clearance of ZIKV viremia.
