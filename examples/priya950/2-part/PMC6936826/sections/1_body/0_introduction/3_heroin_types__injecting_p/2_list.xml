  <p>Heat. BTH is usually heated to ensure better dissolution in water. Although some PWID also heat PH, it is done more out of tradition than out of need [

  <p>Syringe rinsing. Because of its stickiness and viscosity, BTH requires multiple rinsing of the syringe to prevent the needle from clogging if it is to be reused [

  <p>Switching from venous to muscular injection sites. BTH appears to induce faster and more severe venous scarring than PH, causing PWID to migrate to subcutaneous or intramuscular injection routes [

  <p>Acidity. Different heroin preparations vary widely by acidity [
   <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. BTH is believed to be more acidic (pH ~ 2.8) than PH (pH ~ 4), with more acidic solutions showing reduced HIV survivability
