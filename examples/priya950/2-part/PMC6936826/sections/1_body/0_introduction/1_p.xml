<p>In addition to being a huge burden on society in terms of drug overdoses and deaths, intertwined opioid and heroin epidemics in the United States [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have the potential to increase HIV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID). Heroin use among American adults increased almost fivefold between 2002 and 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; most heroin is used by injection, and among PWID the proportion of persons living with a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2010 was 0.0215 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among PWID, most HIV transmission is attributed to the sharing of needles and syringes [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, there is an intriguing difference in HIV prevalence among PWID in the western (5%-6%) versus eastern United States (11%-12%) [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A study of 96 U.S. cities showed that in the late 1990s and early 2000s the difference was 2%-11% versus 3%-35% with the mean in the western U.S. areas three times lower than that of the eastern states (3.6 vs. 9.4) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A similar relationship was observed in HIV incidence [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In most of the western U.S. cities HIV incidence was less than 1 per 100 person-years, but the mean incidence in the eastern U.S. cities was over 3. Although a number of behavioral, environmental, historical, or structural factors may contribute to this disparity, we explore one plausible explanation based on the geographic distribution and use of specific heroin source-forms [
