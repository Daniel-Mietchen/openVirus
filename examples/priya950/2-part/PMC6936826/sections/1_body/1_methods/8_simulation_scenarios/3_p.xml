<p>Scenario A1. BTH + 20% HDS. This scenario mimics the western U.S. around the late 1980s through late 1990s. We assume that HDS syringes were used about 20% of the time even with the early introduction of needle and syringe programs. We assume 100% of double rinses and a starting HIV prevalence of 3%.</p>
