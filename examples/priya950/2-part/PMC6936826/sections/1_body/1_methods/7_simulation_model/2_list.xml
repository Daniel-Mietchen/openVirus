  <p>The model focuses on the injecting pathway of HIV transmission, and sexual transmission is considered only as a background force of infection, so each individual can become infected with some small per act probability (0.001) scaled down by overall HIV prevalence (probability that sexual partner is HIV positive) and assuming a frequency of sexual activity of once per week.</p>

  <p>In our model the agents were arranged in clustered networks (i.e., more intense syringe sharing with the members of the same networks [buddies] and only occasional sharing with the members of other networks [strangers]). These strangers represent the common pool of people who inject drugs and facilitate the spread of HIV from one network to another. In our model the structure of networks (i.e., who injects with whom) and within-network risk behavior (i.e., how often agents share the syringe) was drawn at random from uniform distributions. These networks were of different sizes: 20% very small (2 individuals), 70% medium (3–8 individuals), and 10% large (9–20 individuals) with the average network size of eight as was observed in a study of PWID in North Carolina. We considered for simplicity 64 networks that resulted in approximately 500 PWID.</p>

  <p>Each network could exhibit either high- or low-risk behavior norms. High versus low risk is defined as higher rates of syringe-sharing episodes with strangers (1 vs. 12 times a year) and within a network (e.g., 5 vs. 30 times a month). These parameters were estimated from the supplementary data collected in two studies of PWID [

  <p>The role of different types of syringes and sharing practices in HIV transmission has been discussed in a number of papers [

   <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Most of the current injecting in the United States occurs with LDS; however, for simulations related to the period 1992–2002 we assume that about 10%-20% of syringes used by PWID were HDS, with higher rates in the south and lower in the west [

  <p>We assume that only a fraction (e.g., 0.5) of the individuals in a network is present at a particular injecting episode. In simulation we only track injections that result in sharing syringes and do not consider injections alone.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>We consider a removal rate of 4%. Individuals may be removed because they die or stop injecting. To keep the population stable and have the same denominator for incidence and prevalence calculations, removed individuals are replaced with a similar but HIV-negative individual on the basis that most new PWID are unlikely to have been exposed to the virus.</p>

  <p>Following Jaquez et al. [
   <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and Fiebig et al. [
   <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] we assume that during the acute stage of HIV infection the probability of transmission increases between 5 and 30 times. For simplicity we use the value of a 10-fold increase.

  <p>Our model does not consider a number of factors that affect the dynamics of HIV spread, such as behavior change after becoming HIV positive, number of times syringes are reused, and variation in viral load resulting from the use of antiretroviral therapy. These factors affect the actual incidence and prevalence; however, for the purpose of examining the effects of heroin types, we assume that these factors vary in the same way between persons who use PH and BTH, and the additional parameterization will increase model complexity without critically impacting the results. A list of parameters is presented in
