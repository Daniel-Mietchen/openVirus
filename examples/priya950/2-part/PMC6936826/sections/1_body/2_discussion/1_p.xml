<p>We have presented an agent-based simulation model that explores the effects of BTH and PH on HIV prevalence and provides a plausible explanation for the differences in HIV prevalence between metropolitan areas in the eastern and western United States. We have also shown that if PH replaces BTH, the overall prevalence of HIV will slowly grow, primarily because there will be local HIV outbreaks. These outbreaks are driven by local high-risk networks. Although many experienced PWID over time have accepted certain safer injecting norms, newer, less experienced PWID (e.g., migrant groups or PWID who are transitioning to heroin use from prescription opioids) might be at the highest risk. The role of viral load, especially in the acute phase of HIV, becomes additional fuel in high-risk networks with a lack of harm reduction norms.</p>
