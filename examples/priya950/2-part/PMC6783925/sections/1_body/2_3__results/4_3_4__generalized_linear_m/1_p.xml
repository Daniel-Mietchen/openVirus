<p>Of the 11 demographic, ecological, and climactic factors included as predictors in the GLM, seven were supported as either promoters or protectors of A/H1N1pdm09 transmission between the 14 S/UT modelled (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most supported factor identified in the model was great-circle-distance between any two pair-wise locations (BF = 269.3). As indicated by the negative model coefficient (β| δ = −0.53), increasing distance between states was definitively protective of viral transmission. Population density and average temperature by origin were also both protective of viral transmission between S/UT, however with reduced support (BF = 8.93 and 4.69 respectively). In contrast, sample size by origin was the most supported factor (BF = 237.2) and strongly correlated with definitive promotion of viral transmission indicated by the positive model coefficient (β| δ = 1.46). Sample size by destination was also implicated as a strong promotor of viral transmission (BF = 10.3). Other apparent promotors of A/H1N1pdm09 transmission included aviation passenger flux both by origin and destination, and sample size by destination. Passenger flux by origin had the highest median effect size coefficient (β| δ = 1.86) of all factors however the wide uncertainty of the 95% BCI means it might also be protective (−0.46 to 2.95).
