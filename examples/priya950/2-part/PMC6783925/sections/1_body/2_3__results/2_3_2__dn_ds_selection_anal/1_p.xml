<p>Bayesian renaissance counting (BRC) identified 40 codon sites under positive selection given the uncertainty of the posterior phylogeny (95% BCI &gt; 1.0). Six of these sites were also detected by both FEL and SLAC procedures assuming a fixed tree (

 <sub>S</sub> ratio (13.42) followed by site 84 (8.14), 185 (4.50), and 256 (4.39). All validated sites detected in the complete Indian dataset, excluding 163, exhibited significantly higher d

 <sub>S</sub> ratios given the 95% BCI determined by BRC compared to both international samples. Among the six selected sites, four (163, 185, 186 and 222) are located within the antigenic sites of HA (Ca, Cb, Sa, Sb). The relative structural positions of these six selected sites are visualized in
