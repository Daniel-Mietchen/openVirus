<p>The frequency of residue changes (
 <italic>Datafile 1</italic>) at each detected site in India varied. Among the detected sites, S185T was the most frequently observed residue change (
 <italic>n</italic> = 473/613; 77.2%), followed by K163Q (
 <italic>n</italic> = 240/613; 39.2%), A256T (
 <italic>n</italic> = 231/613; 37.7%), and S84N (
 <italic>n</italic> = 160/613; 26.1%). Two residue changes, D222G and D222N, were observed in 3.1% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19/613) and 1.6% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10/613) of the Indian sample respectively. Four residue changes could be observed at site 84; in descending order of frequency: S84N (
 <italic>n</italic> = 160/613; 26.1%), S84G (
 <italic>n</italic> = 66/613; 10.8%), S84I (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6/613; 1.0%) and S84D (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2/613; 0.3%). Eight discrete changes were observed at selected site 186; in descending order of frequency: A186T (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/613; 0.82%), A186G (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2/613; 0.33%), and A186V (
