<p>Our findings have important implications in understanding the dynamics of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 transmission and evolution in India which could inform future public health prevention and control efforts in the country. We have identified increased selection pressure at multiple meaningful HA residue positions including site 222 and clade 6B characteristic residues relative to internationally circulating viruses that may explain the high CFR observed there, particularly the abnormally severe 2015 and 2017 seasons, and signifies a link to the unique public health burden of the virus in India. We believe this is the first study to observe increased selection at site 186 and believe this site could be a potential determinate of A/H1N1pdm09 severity. Future investigations however are warranted to confirm the antigenic potential of residue changes at this position and associated impact on morbidity and mortality. We have revealed national routes of A/H1N1pdm09 transmission in India identifying Maharashtra as the most supported state for spread throughout the country while quantifying climactic, ecological, and transport factors as drivers of within-country transmission. Together these results have important implications for future A/H1N1pdm09 surveillance and control within India but also for epidemic and pandemic risk prediction around the world. Strengthening influenza surveillance capacity in the country should remain a priority, first to improve estimates of severity, and second, to prepare for future epidemics and pandemics. Continuous monitoring of haemagglutinin changes remains vital for public health surveillance in India.</p>
