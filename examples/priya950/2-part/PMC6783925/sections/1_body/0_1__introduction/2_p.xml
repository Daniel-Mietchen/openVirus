<p>The first case of A/H1N1pdm09 in India was reported in May 2009 in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Following a second epidemic wave in early 2010, approximately 50,000 cases had been reported in India during the pandemic period with a reported CFR of 6.1% [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In subsequent seasons, the annual incidence of H1N1pdm09 in India was low, with approximately 5000 cases or less reported nationally each year. However, in 2015 and 2017, widespread epidemics occurred with an estimated 43,000 and 39,000 cases reported, as well as approximately 3000 and 2300 deaths respectively [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. States particularly affected included Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, accounting for 75.6% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2261/2991), and 72.1% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1634/2266) of all deaths nationally in 2015 and 2017. In some states, CFR of up 20% in 2015 and 30% in 2017 have been reported. Reasons for these frequent and severe epidemic waves of A/H1N1pdm09 in India with apparent high mortality remain unclear. Resource-constrained lower-middle income countries such as India where access to quality health care might be limited have been associated with excess influenza mortality [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], however ongoing reports of A/H1N1pdm09 associated mortality among otherwise healthy adults aged under 65 years in India remains particularly unusual [
