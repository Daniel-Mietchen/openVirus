<p>Lastly, only HA sequences were included in our analysis due to the limited availability of whole A/H1N1pdm09 genomes from India. Residue variations among other genes such as Polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) have been shown to affect viral replication in other influenza A viruses such as A/H5N1 which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. We cannot know if other more important residue changes may be driving the frequency and severity of A/H1N1pdm09 outbreaks in India, rather than selection within HA. Future studies however could investigate selection pressures and residue variations within PB2, among the other gene segments of influenza A.
