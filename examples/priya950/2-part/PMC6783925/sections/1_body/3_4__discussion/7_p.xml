<p>The identification of key climactic, demographic, and ecological factors associated with A/H1N1pdm09 transmission within India similarly indicates opportunities for targeted interventions during outbreaks that could also be generalisable among S/UT not included in our model. For example, increasing distance between S/UT was the most significant (BF = 269.3) factor identified as contributing to the model and was associated with the prevention of transmission (

This suggests that S/UT with lower average temperatures are more likely to transmit A/H1N1pdm09 to other S/UT in India. This appears consistent with previous biological evidence suggesting cooler temperatures are favourable for influenza transmission [

 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. High passenger flux by both origin and destination was another factor shown to be on average predictive of transmission between S/UT in India, but the evidence was inconclusive (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Taken together, public health decision makers might choose to prioritise efforts restricting human movement between neighbouring S/UT, and potentially restricting key domestic flights with high passenger flux.
