<p>Overall this study has some key limitations. First, sample representativeness is a limitation of any epidemiological study, including phylogeography. Only 14 S/UT were included in our model due to limited sample availability or unrepresentative sampling (five states with less than two sequences per 10 million population were removed). This includes less than half of the 36 S/UT in India. Ancestral state reconstruction methods like those used by discrete-trait phylogeography can only generate inferences from traits assigned to the extant taxa. For example, no sequences were available from Gujarat, which has been affected by particularly large outbreaks (approximately 7100 cases in 2015 and 7700 in 2017), meaning inferred transmission to and from Gujarat while perhaps expected, remains unresolved in our model. Limited sample availability may also have the effect of exaggerating the evidence of transmission between any two pair-wise locations in the model, for example, where Gujarat or another unsampled state may have acted as intermediate locations for transmission. Sample size by origin was also implicated as a predictor of transmission in the complete Indian dataset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 613), which suggests sampling bias may be affecting our primary results. For example, Maharashtra was the most highly supported location for transmission to other S/UT, but also had the most sequences available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 242/613; 39.5%). Discrete-trait Bayesian phylogeography is known to be susceptible to sampling bias and, in such cases, produces overestimates of origin support [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Figure S4, Table S7</xref>). Furthermore, Maharashtra also endured the largest recorded outbreaks (approximately 8500 cases in 2015 and 6100 cases in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) and had the highest average number of domestic passengers between 2009 and 2017 [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggesting our primary results may in fact reflect the truth. However, measures of transit between states in our GLM model only extended to domestic aviation. Other significant means of interstate travel in India such as rail (nationally 8.1 billion passengers in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]) was not considered in our model due to the lack of S/UT transit data. We hypothesize that rail-travel would have a significant effect on A/H1N1pdm09 transmission in India, particularly over short distances, however the absence of this data does not affect the interpretation of our results. Rather, any effect of rail-travel remains unresolved. Future studies could investigate the effect of rail-travel if state-based data were to become available.
