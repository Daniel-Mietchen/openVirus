<p>For the complete Indian sequence dataset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 613) we generated rate ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous (d
 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub>) mutations using Bayesian renaissance counting (BRC) implemented in BEAST v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] assuming three independent (1, 2, 3) codon partitions [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. At each site, positive selection was determined where the lower 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) was greater than one (d

 <sub>S</sub> &gt; 1). Potential sites under selection were validated using both two-rate fixed effects likelihood (FEL) and single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) tests in HyPhy assuming a p-value threshold of 0.1 which is convention [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For this, fixed MCC trees were generated with TreeAnnotator v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] from previous BEAST outputs. We also used BRC methods in BEAST v1.10 to compare d

 <sub>S</sub> ratios at significant sites in both global A/H1N1pdm09 datasets previously generated (S1 and S2). Due to the significant number of taxa in both global datasets (2 × 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4063), we first generated a posterior distribution of 10,000 trees each at 100 million MCMC generations before inferring d
 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios on a fixed posterior of 500 trees after removing 50% burn-in similar to Bedford et al. 2015 [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For all three datasets, relative H1 and H3 site numbering was determined using the influenza research database’s (FluDB) HA Subtype Numbering algorithm [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and residue frequencies at selected sites was determined using Geneious v10.1.2 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Selected sites within the HA structure (RCSB PDB ID: 4LXV [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) were visualized with YASARA View v19.7.20 [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
