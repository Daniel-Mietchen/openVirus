<p>A single state, Maharashtra, accounted for 39.5% (

To compare and control for potential sampling in the dataset, we generated five unique subsets, randomly sampling up to five sequences per location-year in location-years with greater than five sequences, while leaving those with less than five sequences per location-year untouched. This created a more equitable spatiotemporal distribution of sequences without removing under-represented location-years (

We calculated BF for each pairwise transition as the average between all five subsets using SpreaD3 v0.9.6 [
