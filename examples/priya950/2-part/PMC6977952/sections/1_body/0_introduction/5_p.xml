<p> Antibodies against various conserved antigens of the influenza virus (such as NP, M1, M2) are generally non-neutralizing in nature and cannot prevent the development of the viral infection. However, they are able to exert a protective function through various immune mechanisms. Thus, the study of the mechanisms of action of various antibodies, including non-neutralizing ones, as well as the development of methods for evaluating the level of such antibodies after immunization with new influenza vaccines, is relevant for the development of novel broad-spectrum influenza vaccines. </p>
