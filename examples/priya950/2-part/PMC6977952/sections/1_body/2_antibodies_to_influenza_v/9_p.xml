<p> The production of antibodies to neuraminidase is induced by an influenza infection. However, their level is usually lower than that of the antibodies to HA. It is crucial that most NA-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the serum of individuals who have suffered from an infection bind to a wide range of modern and historical influenza strains, inhibit NA activity, and protect laboratory mice in passive transfer experiments [

One of them is the creation of a pandemic vaccine based on a cocktail of several subtypes of NA (N1, N2, N6, N7, N8, N9, and etc.) associated with human and zoonotic influenza strains. It is also possible to include NA as an additional antigen in vaccines based on conserved influenza antigens: such as M2, NP, etc. [
