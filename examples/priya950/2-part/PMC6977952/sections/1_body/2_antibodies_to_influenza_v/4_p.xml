<p> HA stem-specific antibodies can interfere with the fusion of the virus with the endosomal membrane. Effective fusion requires the presence of 3â€“5 neighboring HAs with fusion peptides bound to the endosomal membrane

 </italic>. Neutralizing HA stem-specific are able to prevent the pH-induced exposure of the fusion peptide and prevent the formation of a network of HAs interacting with the endosomal membrane. In addition, some antibodies to the HA stem can inhibit cleavage of the immature HA0 precursor into the HA1 and HA2 subunits
