<p> Influenza virus neuraminidase is involved in various stages of the infectious process. It cleaves the viral particles from the sialic acid residues of the respiratory tract mucins, thus allowing for the virus entry into the cell. NA allows the release of new virions from the host cell, thus preventing them from remaining bound to the sialic acid residues on the cell surface. In addition, NA prevents the aggregation of virions, which is due to the interaction between the HA of a virion with the sialylated glycans of another one [
