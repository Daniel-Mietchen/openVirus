<p> Neutralizing HA stem-specific antibodies cannot be revealed using a hemagglutination assay. The principal methods for an evaluation of these antibodies are the reactions of neutralization [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], microneutralization [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and neutralization based on pseudotyped viral vectors [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The latter present chimeric viruses carrying influenza virus surface antigens that do not contain any genetic material and are not infectious. These pseudoviruses are usually derived from lentiviral vectors and the vesicular stomatitis virus. They allow avoidance of highly pathogenic influenza strains when performing a neutralization reaction (which is especially important when studying broad-spectrum antibodies). According to some reports, this method of evaluation is more sensitive and more suitable in the detection of neutralizing HA stem-specific antibodies than the conventional neutralization assay [
