<p> A key component of ELLA is enzymatically active NA, the inhibition of which is evaluated. NA can be used in the form of a purified protein or as part of a viral particle. When using a viral particle, it should be kept in mind that HA-binding antibodies can reduce NA activity due to the steric hindrance effect. Therefore, reassortant viruses of the H6NX and H7NX subtypes are commonly used in this assay. Although the use of reassortant viruses cannot completely exclude the effect of HA-specific antibodies on the NA activity, this assay is considered as the "gold" standard in the evaluation of the inhibitory anti-NA activity of antibodies [
