<p> Influenza virus HA and NA are highly variable proteins. However, the broad-spectrum vaccines that are currently under development may also include HA and/or NA and their epitopes. For instance, the HA stem is a rather conserved part of the molecule. Various strategies exist for redirection of the immune response to this particular antigen during vaccination [
