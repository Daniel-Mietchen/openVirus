<p> The HA stem is more conserved than the head domain. However, it is less immunogenic, possibly due to the fact that the bulky head region of the protein sterically hinders the access of antibodies to the HA stem. However, in addition to the non-neutralizing antibodies involved in the ADCC, ADCP, and CDC reactions, a certain amount of neutralizing HA stem-specific antibodies is detected in humans after an influenza infection or vaccination, with the infection being more effective in inducing the formation of this type of antibodies than vaccination. </p>
