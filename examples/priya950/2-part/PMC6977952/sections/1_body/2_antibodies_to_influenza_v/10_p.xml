<p> ELISA is one of the easiest ways to evaluate the immune response to NA. To reliably assess the level of NA-specific antibodies, recombinant, tetrameric, glycosylated, and enzymatically active NA should be used as antigen. However, ELISA does not provide any information on the functionality of the measured level of antibodies. NA enzymatic activity inhibition assays are based on the cleavage of small molecules by neuraminidase, which generates the signal to be measured. However, unlike terminal sialic acids, which are attached to the glycans of large proteins, these small molecules more easily access the active center of the NA protein [

The assay that allows one to obtain the most realistic estimates of the anti-NA activity of antibodies is ELLA (enzyme-linked lectin assay), which uses the highly sialylated glycoprotein fetuin as a substrate. The method is based on measuring the amount of galactose, the penultimate sugar residue in fetuin, which is bound to the substrate. NA cleaves terminal sialic acids, after which galactose can be measured using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated peanut lectin. ELLA has been optimized for routine serology; it is now used to evaluate the titers of neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies [
