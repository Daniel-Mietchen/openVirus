<p> To accurately determine the level of anti-influenza antibodies involved in ADCC, a reaction with the participation of the target antigen and effector cells (usually NK cells) is required. The antigen can be either a recombinant target protein, influenza-infected cells, or target cells expressing the desired antigens. If the antigen is a recombinant protein, it is treated with the test serum and then effector cells are added to the resulting antigenâ€“antibody complex. When conducting this reaction, one can assess ADCC by measuring the activation of the effector cells and their expression of surface and secreted marker proteins (as a rule, these are surface activation marker CD107a and interferon gamma)
