<p> The serum of healthy children and adults (but not infants) contains antibodies to various proteins of the H7N9 influenza A virus that are involved in the ADCC response, with the level of NP-specific antibodies being significantly higher than those to HA and NA. The level of antibodies to NP of the seasonal influenza A viruses that are involved in ADCC correlated with the level of antibodies to NP of the H7N9 influenza A virus. Therefore, production of these antibodies that cross-react with H7N9 is assumed to be triggered by vaccination and infection with seasonal influenza A viruses [

NP-specific antibodies that can interact with FcÎ³RIIIa and activate NK cells have been identified in healthy and influenza-infected volunteers. Healthy donor serum containing NP-specific antibodies were shown to induce NK cell activation against virus-infected cells expressing NP [
