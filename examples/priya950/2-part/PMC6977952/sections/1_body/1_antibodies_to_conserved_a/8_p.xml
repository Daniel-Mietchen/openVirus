<p> Using a panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies to the influenza virus HA protein (both neutralizing and non-neutralizing ones, both stem- and head-specific ones), DiLillo et al. [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that Fc-FcγR interactions are necessary for all broad-spectrum antibodies in order to ensure 
 <italic>in vivo </italic>protection. A similar result was obtained by comparing two NA-specific antibodies, one of which had a broad spectrum of action; the other was strain-specific. This suggests that the spectrum of action of not only certain HA-specific antibodies, but also antibodies to other influenza antigens exposed on the surface of an infected cell, depends on the Fc-FcγR interaction. Moreover, the dependence of some antibodies on the Fc-FcγR interaction can be circumvented by significantly (8–10-fold) increasing the amount of the antibody involved in the interaction with the influenza virus. It should be noted that, during viral infection, broad-spectrum antibodies are generated in much smaller quantities than strain-specific ones. Thus, the Fc-FcγR interaction apparently can increase the efficiency of the broad-spectrum antibodies, thereby compensating for their small quantity [
