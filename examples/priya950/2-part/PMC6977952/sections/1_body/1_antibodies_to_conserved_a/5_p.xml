<p> Influenza virus-infected cells carry viral proteins on their surface – mainly HA and NA – since new virions are formed by budding from the cell membrane. Anti-influenza IgG can bind viral proteins on the cell surface, thus opsonizing the infected cells. The Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa) exposed on the surface of many cells of the innate immune response, such as NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages, binds to the Fc region of IgG. The interaction between FcγRIIIa and IgG bound to the infected cell leads to phosphorylation of the tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and activation of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathway. As a result, NK cells begin to produce cytotoxic factors (perforins and granzymes), which lead to the death of the infected cell, and antiviral cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα) and chemokines
