<p> Phagocytosis is a crucial immunological process in which phagocytes engulf microbial and infected cells. The first step of ADCP includes opsonization of a microbial or infected cell by antibodies. After opsonization, phagocytes recognize the antibodies bound to foreign antigens, mainly via the Fcγ receptors CD32 (FcγRIIA) and CD64 (FcγRIA), as well as the Fcα receptor CD89 [

FcγR-/- mice have been shown to be highly sensitive to influenza even in the presence of influenza antibodies obtained from FcγR+/+ mice. Moreover, the absence of NK cells was not crucial for the defense response. It has also been shown that FcγR+/+ mouse macrophages actively engulf opsonized viral particles [

Dunand et al. showed that some non-neutralizing human broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies protect mice from an influenza infection through Fc-mediated recruitment of effector cells, with the protection being associated exclusively with ADCP but not with ADCC or activation of the complement system [
