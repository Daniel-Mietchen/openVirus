<p> In 2018, research was carried out to study the effectiveness of immunization of mice with a knockout of the C3 complement component with virus-like particles carrying the M2e proteins of human, porcine, and avian influenza A viruses, as well as virus-like particles carrying HA of the H5-subtype influenza A virus. It turned out that immunization with the M2e vaccine did not protect C3 knockout mice from the influenza A viruses, while even low levels of antibodies to the M2e protein were enough to protect wild-type animals from the influenza A virus infection upon passive transfer. On the contrary, C3 knockout mice immunized with a HA vaccine, which induces the production of strain-specific neutralizing antibodies, were protected from infection with a homologous influenza virus despite the low level of antibody response [
