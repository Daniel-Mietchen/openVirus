<p> Antibodies to conserved viral proteins, such as nucleoprotein (NP), also contribute to the ADCC response. For instance, the influenza infection and vaccination induce the production of antibodies to the NP, M1, and M2 proteins involved in ADCC [

 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has been shown that influenza virus NP is expressed on the surface of infected cells for some time and, therefore, can serve as a target for ADCC [

Carragher et al. demonstrated that vaccination of laboratory mice with soluble recombinant NP of the influenza A virus induces high titers of antibodies to NP and an extremely weak T cell response. At the same time, vaccination reduced the manifestation of disease symptoms and decreased the influenza virus titers in the lungs of the influenza-infected animals infected. Passive transfer of the sera of immunized mice to naive animals also provided protection against an influenza infection [

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the protective effects of the serum of mice immunized with influenza A recombinant NP upon passive transfer to animals with B cell deficiency and mice with a normal number of B cells manifest themselves through the mechanism that includes FcÎ³R [
