<p> In addition to alveolar macrophages, other effector cell populations can also participate in the ADCP-mediated response to the influenza virus. For instance, neutrophils, which are the largest in number amongst blood leukocytes, express high levels of FcγRIa/b/c, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIb on their surface after activation. In addition, neutrophils constitutively express FcαRI, which binds IgA and activates the cytotoxic and phagocytic responses [

Analysis of the Fc-FcγR interactions between various IgG specific to the HA stem and effector neutrophils showed that monoclonal human and mouse HA stem-specific antibodies can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are further delivered to the neutrophil`s phagolysosomes. However, such an effect could not be detected in the case of HA head-specific antibodies [
