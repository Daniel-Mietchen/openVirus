<p> The influenza vaccines currently being developed are aimed at generating an immune response not mainly to the conventional HA and NA influenza antigens, but to various conserved viral antigens. When creating a broad-spectrum vaccine, it is necessary to know what effectiveness criteria should be considered in preclinical and clinical trials. The traditional methods for assessing the humoral immune response to influenza vaccines by hemagglutination and neutralization reactions will no longer be relevant for most newly developed vaccines. The development of methods for evaluating non-neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies and studying their mechanisms of action are necessary if we seek to create effective broad-spectrum vaccines that can provide protection against both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza virus strains. </p>
