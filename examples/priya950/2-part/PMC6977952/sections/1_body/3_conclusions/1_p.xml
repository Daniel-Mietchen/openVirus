<p> In this review, the main mechanisms involving anti-influenza antibodies and the methods for the detection of these antibodies were considered. Antibodies can provide protection against influenza via Fc-independent or Fc-dependent mechanisms. Fc-independent antibodies directly neutralize the virus by preventing its entry into the cell, fusion, or budding from it. Antibodies to the head domain of hemagglutinin [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are usually strain-specific, are mainly involved in the direct neutralization of the influenza virus. As a rule, Fc-dependent antibodies are non-neutralizing but are able to activate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or the complement system [

 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Such antibodies can be targeted at the stem domain of the HA, NA, M2, or NP proteins of the influenza virus, and most of them are broad-spectrum antibodies [
