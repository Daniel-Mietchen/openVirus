<p>HIV-viral load was 4.10 ± 0.66 and 4.04 ± 0.67 in HIV patients with and without HCV infection (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.218), respectively. HIV-viral load was 4.14 ± 0.66 and 3.97 ± 0.66 in male and female HIV/HCV co-infected patients, respectively. The ALT, AST and HGB levels, the number of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells and the HIV-viral load were compared between HCV patients infected through IDUs and ST, but no statistical difference was identified (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Due to only one HCV patient in genotype 2a and 6u group, we neglected these two patients in the following analysis. Biochemical features of HCV patients with genotypes 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b, 6a and 6n were compared. The HGB level showed a significant difference among HCV subgroups with various genotypes (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027), but no other difference was found (
 <xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The HGB level was significantly higher in HCV patients with genotype 3a than patients with genotypes 3b (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033), 6a (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and 6n (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), respectively.
