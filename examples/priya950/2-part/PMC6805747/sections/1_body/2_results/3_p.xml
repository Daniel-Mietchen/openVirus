<p>After constructing the phylotree according to the reference sequences, HCV genotypes of all samples were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Six genotypes were identified in IDUs and eight genotypes were identified in ST HCV patients, after we compared the accuracy rate of each genotype. The genotype distribution showed a little difference between the two HCV subgroups, but no significance was identified, excluding genotype 3a (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019). The frequency of genotype 3a was 27.44% and 7.89% in HCV patients infected with IDUs and ST, respectively (
