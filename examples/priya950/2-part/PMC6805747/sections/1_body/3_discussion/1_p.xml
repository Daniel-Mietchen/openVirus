<p>Due to the lack of vaccine and HCV gene mutations, the protection and treatment of HCV infection need further study. Yunnan province is located in Southwest of China, neighbours the ‘Golden Triangle’. Thus, HIV-infected cohort is large in Yunnan. Drug injection and sexual behaviour are two main transmission routes of HIV infection, and HCV was one of the most frequent viruses co-infected with HIV [

 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The HCV infectious rate is much higher in the HIV-infected population than in the general population [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, most of the HCV genotype analysis focused on IDU patients. IDUs seemed the main transmission route of HCV infection, with infectious rate ranging from 22% to 95% [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, HCV-pooled prevalence was a little lower in Yunnan IDUs (76.6%) than in Guangxi (83.8%), Hubei (91.8%) and Hunan (78.7%) IDUs in Xia

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, we find that the HCV co-infected rate in HIV patients was 22.60% (202/894). It should be noted that the HCV co-infected rate was significantly higher in IDUs (45.68%) than in ST (7.10%) HIV patients, thus the low co-infected rate of HIV and HCV in this study was caused by ST. It was necessary to analyse the epidemic characteristic of HCV infection in HIV patients.
