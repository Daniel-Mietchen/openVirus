<p>A special phenomenon was expressed when we analysed the correlation between HIV-viral load and biochemical features of the HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Although all biochemical characteristics showed no correlation with HIV-viral load of total patients, the ALT, HGB levels and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells significantly correlated with HIV-viral load in male and female groups (
 <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The ALT level negatively correlated with HIV-viral load in female HIV/HCV co-infected patients, and the HGBÂ and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells were positively correlated with HIV-viral load in male and female patients, respectively. It seems that these correlations were not caused by age difference (
 <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Caffeine consumption could lead to higher CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells and lower HIV-viral load [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but no analysis between CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells and lower HIV-viral load was performed. It needed us to investigate more factors which play roles in the correlation between HIV-viral load and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells, such as host genetic polymorphisms, variety of drug or other pathogenic microorganism infections.
