<p>It was the first time to analyse the biochemical characteristics in HIV/HCV co-infected persons in Yunnan, China. Although the ALT and AST levels showed no difference between HCV patients by IDUs or ST with different genotypes, the HGB level was significantly higher in HCV patients with genotype 3a than in patients with genotypes 3b, 6a and 6n, respectively (

 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the serum iron level was a risk factor for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, and it was also positively correlated with the HGB level [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It seemed that the HGB level also correlated with HBV-related HCC. The function of HGB was containing and transporting oxygen in red blood cells. Thus, we assumed that the HGB level might correlate with HCV infection in different genotypes by the serum iron level, but it still needs to be verified.
