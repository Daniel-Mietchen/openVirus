<p>HCV genotypes showed a different distribution among various provinces in China. Genotype 3 (including 3a and 3b) occupied 61.39% (124/202) of total HCV-infected persons in this study, and this ratio is similar to the reported ratio (53.54%, 317/592) [

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genotype 3, especially genotype 3b, was the dominant HCV genotype in the HCV population in Yunnan, which was considered to be originating from Vietnam. Genotype 6a was the predominant HCV genotype in many regions in China, such as Hubei, Guangxi and Guangzhou [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Genotypes 3a and 1b were prevalent in Ningxia [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Jiangsu [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], respectively. It suggested that further analysis of the HCV genotypes in various provinces in China and investigating their epidemic features were necessary, which will benefit to control the HCV prevalence in the Chinese population.
