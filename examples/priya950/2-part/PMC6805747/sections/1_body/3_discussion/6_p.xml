<p>In summary, we studied the HCV genotype distribution and the epidemic characteristics of HIV/HCV co-infected persons in Yunnan, China. The results showed that genotype 3b was the predominant genotype in Yunnan. We firstly identified that the HGB level was significantly different among patients with different HCV genotypes, and HIV-viral load correlated with biochemical features of HIV/HCV co-infected persons.</p>
