<p>When the HCV genotypes in this study were compared to previously reported data in Yunnan [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], HCV genotype 1b showed a difference between the two cohorts. The ratio of genotype 1b was 16.33% and 15.37% in this study and the reported data, respectively. Although the infectious rate of genotype 1b seemed similar, statistical analysis showed a statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046). Because all reported HCV patients were IDUs with HIV, which suggested the difference might be related to different transmission routes. No significant difference was identified when comparing genotype 1b between the reported data and HCV with IDUs in this study. Although the ratio of genotype 1b was higher in patients with ST (26.32%, 10/38) than IDUs (15.08%, 114/756), no statistical difference existed. This result might be due to the small sample size of HIV/HCV patients with ST, thus enlarging the cohort for further analysis was necessary.
