<p>Although direct-acting antiviral therapy is widely used to control HCV prevalence, and about 95% HCV patients could be well cured, the numbers of patients co-infected with HIV and HCV were increased [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] due to shared transmission routes (injection and sexual transmission (ST)) between HCV and HIV infection. HCV infection is more frequent in the HIV-infected population (infectious rate 4.0%) than in other cohorts (infectious rate 2.4%) [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It seemed that the elimination of HCV became a serious burden in HIV patients. Patients with various HCV genotypes might express different clinical features and treatment effect, but the HCV genotyping study in HIV-infected persons is rare. Understanding the characteristics of HCV in HIV-infected individuals is necessary to decrease the numbers of the co-infected cohort.
