<p>Cases of measles in individuals who have previously received MCV, are generally milder than those in unvaccinated individuals. Nevertheless, such cases still require the same infection control efforts to detect contact history, and prevent further transmission as in unvaccinated cases [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. If we had not implemented preventive measures by isolating the nurse according to the CDC guidelines that were current at that time, there could have been additional exposed individuals, which would have made it difficult to contain spread in the hospital. Therefore, we suggest that HCWs who are anti-measles IgG-negative, should be considered non-immune, even if they have received 2 doses of the MCV. A work restriction may be one way to prevent further interruption of medical services, and further measles transmission.
