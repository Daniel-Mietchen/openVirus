<p>In some measles epidemics, even individuals who were considered immune to measles have become infected as a result of massive measles virus exposure [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This case illustrates that measles can be transmitted to IgG-negative individuals, even when they have limited exposure and have received 2 doses of MCV. As there have been no large-scale measles epidemics in Korea since the 2000-2001 epidemic, the chance of boosting immunity by natural infection has become much smaller than in previous generations. This probably explains why the nurse was susceptible to measles, despite having received 2 doses of MCV.
