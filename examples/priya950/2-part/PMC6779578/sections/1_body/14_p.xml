<p>In our hospital and the affiliated medical centers, it is not possible to test all HCWs for anti-measles IgG; therefore, only the HCWs who worked at the high-risk departments were tested. In addition, new employees should be tested for anti-measles IgG when they start working in the hospital. If the test is negative, the employee should be given an additional dose of MCV. When a new test was conducted on new employees and employees at high-risk departments, 92.6% were positive for anti-measles IgG. Especially in individuals aged in their 20s, anti-measles IgG was shown positive for only 87.4% of HCWs, which was below average.</p>
