<p>The HCW who was anti-measles IgG negative was a 25-year old resident nurse working in the ER. She had received 2 doses of MCV. She had only had brief contact with the index patient when measuring his blood pressure. We quarantined her, contrary to the KCDC recommendation, because we assumed that she was not immune to measles.</p>
