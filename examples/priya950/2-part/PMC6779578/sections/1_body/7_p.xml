<p>Fourteen days after the measles exposure, the nurse developed fever and a rash that began on the back of her neck. She had a cough but did not have any Koplik spots, coryza, or conjunctivitis. Although her respiratory symptoms could be classified as atypical measles, her skin rash resembled that of typical measles. We tested her anti-measles IgM and tested her for measles virus using PCR. Both test results were positive. We isolated her to prevent any further measles exposure of the HCWs and patients.</p>
