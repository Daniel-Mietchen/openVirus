   <bold>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).</bold> (
   <bold>A</bold>) An SNP is a variation on a single nucleotide which may occur at some specific point in the genome and that causes variations in DNA sequences between members of the same species. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Types of SNPs: DNA variation can be located in non-coding or coding regions. SNPs within a coding sequence can be synonymous if they do not produce an amino acid change (silent mutation), or non-synonymous if they affect the protein sequence. Non-synonymous changes can be divided into missense (producing an amino acid change in the protein) or nonsense (producing a truncated or longer protein).
