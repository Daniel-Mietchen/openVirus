<p>The cleavage of the IAV HA by host proteases is critical for viral infectivity. TMPRSS2 is a type II transmembrane serine protease family member, which was shown to activate HA proteins of multiple human IAVs in tissue culture cells. Furthermore, deletion of Tmprss2 in mice impairs the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses, including the pH1N1 2009 swine IAV [

The genetic predisposition to severe pH1N1 2009 influenza virus was evaluated in Chinese human subjects, finding that the GG genotype of rs2070788, leading to increased expression of TMPRSS2, was a risk variant to severe pH1N1 influenza [
