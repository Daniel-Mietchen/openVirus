<p>Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is expressed mainly on macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells. CCR5 mediates leukocyte chemotaxis in response to its ligands, including MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and RANTES. It can help direct multiple immune cell subsets, including regulatory T cells or Th17 cells to sites of infection, supporting the antiviral immune response. Evidence in humans support that homozygosity for the CCR5-Δ32 allele, a naturally occurring polymorphism of CCR5 encoding a 32-bp deletion, prevents its expression on the cell surface, and is linked with an elevated susceptibility to West Nile virus (WNV) [

In contrast, homozygous carriers of the Δ32 mutation are resistant to HIV-1 infection because this molecule, absent in the cell surface in subjects encoding the deletion, is a molecule normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells [
