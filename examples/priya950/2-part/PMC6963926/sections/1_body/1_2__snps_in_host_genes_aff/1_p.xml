<p>Risk factors, including underlying co-morbidities, age, and pregnancy, affect IAV susceptibility, but do not explain all the conditions under which serious IAV-associated disease can occur, making likely that SNPs in viral and host genes affect IAV susceptibility and the outcome of the disease. In fact, there are some examples of the presence of SNPs in host genes affecting influenza severity (
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00168-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which will be discussed in this review. SNPs affecting IAV disease have been found in genes recognizing viral components, in transcription factors important for IFN production and signaling, in ISGs with antiviral activities, and in genes involved in inflammation.
