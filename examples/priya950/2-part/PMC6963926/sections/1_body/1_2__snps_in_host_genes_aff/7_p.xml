<p>The antiviral protein IFITM3 is an ISG which abrogates the release of IAV content from late endosomes into the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, IFITM3 promotes the survival of mouse lung-resident CD8+ T cells following IAV challenge, which may help clear the infection [
 <xref rid="B117-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Furthermore, mice in which the expression of IFITM3 is abolished, showed severe disease after IAV infection, compared to parental mice [
 <xref rid="B118-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. One of the clearest associations of SNPs in genes affecting influenza severity is located in the ISG IFITM3. The human IFITM3 gene is encoded by two exons and is predicted to encode two splice variants that differ in the first amino-terminal 21 amino acids. Different studies have described the effect of IFITM3 SNPs in influenza disease severity. Northern European patients infected with IAV pH1N1 2009 virus requiring hospitalization showed over-representation of the SNP rs12252 in the IFITM3 gene, in which the majority T allele is replaced for a minority C allele [
 <xref rid="B118-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This leads to an alteration of the first splice acceptor site, originating an IFITM3 protein lacking the first 21 amino acids (NΔ21) due to the protein starting from an alternative start codon. According to these results suggesting that this SNP could affect influenza disease, the minority (CC) variant rendered homozygous cells more susceptible to IAV infection, and this susceptibility correlated with decreased levels of IFITM3 protein expression in comparison to the majority (TT) variant cells [
 <xref rid="B118-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Furthermore, cells expressing the NΔ21 protein showed an impaired ability to restrict viral replication when compared to wild-type IFITM3 cells [
 <xref rid="B118-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This data is consistent with previous results which show that the amino-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 are relevant for attenuating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication in vitro [
 <xref rid="B119-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Moreover, the CC genotype was found in 25% of Chinese patients showing mild disease after pH1N1 virus infection compared to 69% in patients developing a severe pH1N1 virus infection. In addition, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a six-fold increased risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes [
 <xref rid="B120-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], reinforcing the idea that IFITM3 is a factor affecting human IAV disease [
 <xref rid="B121-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. In another study, over-representation of the IFITM3 CC genotype was detected among fatal cases of Chinese patients infected with IAV pH1N1 and H7N9 viruses [
 <xref rid="B100-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], and in a more general study, including twelve studies published before February 2018 with more than 16,000 subjects, revealed increased risk of severe influenza in both the East Asian and White populations in the subjects encoding the IFITM3 CC genotype [
 <xref rid="B122-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].
