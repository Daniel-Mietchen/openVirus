<p>IRF-7 is a transcription factor that increases interferon (IFN) production in response to viruses [
 <xref rid="B110-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="B112-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. A patient suffering from an unusual life-threatening disease after pH1N1 infection encodes homozygous null mutations in the IRF-7 factor. Both IRF-7 alleles from this patient encode mutations c.1228T&gt;G/T (F410V) and c.1261C&gt;T/C (Q421X), which are mutations decreasing the ability of IRF-7 to induce the transcription of IFN genes after IAV infections [
 <xref rid="B113-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. These findings suggest that IRF-7-dependent production of type I and III IFNs is required for controlling IAV infections in humans. The rare allele A of two IRF-7 SNPs, rs12272434 and rs12290989, both located at exon/intron boundaries, were significantly associated with impaired levels of IFNÎ± production by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in response to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection [
 <xref rid="B114-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Therefore, these polymorphisms may affect the ability of human subjects to control HIV-1 infections, reinforcing the role of IRF-7 in controlling viral infections. However, the effect of these SNPs should be further studied.
