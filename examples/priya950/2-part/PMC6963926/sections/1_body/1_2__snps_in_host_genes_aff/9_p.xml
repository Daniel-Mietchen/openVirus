<p>Interleukins 1A and 1B (IL-1A and IL-1B, respectively) are inflammatory cytokines that play critical roles in recruiting immune and inflammatory cells and developing adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that both cytokines play central roles in innate immunity against viral infections [
 <xref rid="B125-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The frequencies of SNP (allele C) located 31 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site (rs1143627), on the IL-1B promoter were associated with increased risk of influenza disease in Chinese subjects [
 <xref rid="B126-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. This nucleotide change is localized in a TATA-box motif of IL-1B and modulates the transcription activity of IL-1B by binding to multiple transcription factors [
 <xref rid="B127-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The allele T of rs1143627 enhanced IL-1B protein expression, as indicated by several reports [
 <xref rid="B128-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. People carrying allele T showed a higher IL-1B expression, which could lead to increased IFNÎ³ production, which promotes virus clearance [
 <xref rid="B129-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In contrast, expression of IL-1B may be decreased in individuals who carry allele C, leading to a weaker immune response during viral infection. In addition, a T allele in IL-1A gene (SNP rs17561) increased the risk of IAV pH1N1 susceptibility, as observed in Chinese subjects [
 <xref rid="B126-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. The SNP rs17561 introduces a nonsynonymous mutation (A114S) in IL-1A protein, suggesting that this genetic variant may lead to a functional variation in host susceptibility to pH1N1. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism needs to be evaluated and the real risk of these alleles should be analyzed in larger populations.
