<p>In addition to IAV, there are other examples of SNPs in TLR3 or TLR3 signaling genes affecting viral infections. For instance, susceptibility to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is highly increased in human and mouse cells with defective TLR3 molecules [
 <xref rid="B101-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> SNPs, rs3775292, and rs6552950, leading to unknown functional consequences, were associated with an increased risk of CHIKV disease occurrence [
 <xref rid="B101-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Patients with impaired TLR3-mediated responses show an elevated susceptibility to Herpes Simplex-1 Virus (HSV-1)-mediated encephalitis by encoding TLR3-deficient alleles [
 <xref rid="B102-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,
 <xref rid="B103-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], or by encoding deficient TRAF3, TBK1 and TRIF molecules, leading to impaired TLR-3 signaling [
 <xref rid="B104-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In a Saudi Arabian population, the TLR3 rs78726532 SNP was strongly associated with Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections when compared to that in healthy control subjects [
 <xref rid="B107-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The TLR3 rs5743314 C allele was also associated with HCV-related liver disease progression (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) [
 <xref rid="B107-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. However, the functional effects of these SNPs seem to be unknown.
