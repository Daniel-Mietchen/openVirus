<p>TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, one of the IAV replication intermediate products, and in turn activates IFN production, leading to an antiviral response. A missense mutation (F303S) of the TLR3 gene was found in one out of three patients developing IAV-associated encephalopathy (IAE), a neurological consequence of severe viral infection [
 <xref rid="B98-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Assays in tissue culture cells showed that a TLR3 receptor encoding the missense F303S mutation was impaired in activating the transcription factor NF-κB, and in triggering downstream signaling via the IFNβ receptor, indicating that this genetic polymorphism could lead to increased IAV replication [

 <xref rid="B99-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This TLR3 SNP was found in all the children developing IAV-associated pneumonia (18 cases). However, the SNP was found in significantly less proportion in children with milder disease, suggesting a link between TLR3 and IAV pathogenicity. Furthermore, in a multicenter study involving 275 adult cases of avian H7N9 and pH1N1 IAV, in mainland China and Hong Kong, the TLR3 CC rs5743313 SNP was associated with fatal cases [
