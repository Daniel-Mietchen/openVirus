<p>In addition to C-type lectins, S-type lectins have been described, such as galectins, which recognize galactose-containing oligosaccharides present in the cellular plasma membranes and in viruses, such as IAV. Importantly, intranasal treatment of galectin-1 enhanced survival of mice infected with IAV by reducing viral load, apoptosis, and inflammation in the lung [
