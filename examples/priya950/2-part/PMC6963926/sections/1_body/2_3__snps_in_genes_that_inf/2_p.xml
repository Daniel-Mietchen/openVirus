<p>SNPs may modify the humoral immune response after IAV vaccination. Therefore, their impact on the immune responses induced after IAV vaccination are being analyzed [

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is localized in chromosome 6 of the human genome, it includes multiple genes and exhibits considerable diversity between populations. Moreover, in this genomic region, there is a higher presence of SNPs than in other sections of the genome. MHC class I and class II molecules have an essential role in the adaptive immune system in response to infections. Both classes of proteins bind peptide fragments derived from pathogens to be presented on the cell surface for recognition by appropriate T cells [

 <xref rid="B162-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. In those genes, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I and II are important because of their role in the immune system. Gelder et al. studied whether HLA class II polymorphisms modulate anti-IAV antibody responses to vaccination in a United Kingdom population [
 <xref rid="B154-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. For that, a cohort of HLA-typed donors at risk was investigated, and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titers were evaluated before and 28 days after the administration of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. A correlation between HLA class II alleles and IAV HAI titers in the influenza risk group was found. Moreover, a positive association between non-responsiveness to influenza vaccine and HLA-DRB1*07 and a negative association with HLA-DRB1*13 and HLA-DQB1*0603-9/14 [
 <xref rid="B154-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] was reported, suggesting that polymorphisms in HLA class II molecules affect antibody responses to IAV vaccination. These findings are important because they could potentially identify individuals who may not be protected by current vaccination approaches.
