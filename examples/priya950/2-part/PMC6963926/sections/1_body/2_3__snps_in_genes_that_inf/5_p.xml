<p>Other SNPs that are not related with immune responses have been also linked to vaccine effectiveness. Egli et al. revealed that the presence of the T/G or G/G genotype (rs8099917, minor-allele) in IL-28B (IFNÎ»3), a type III IFN, was linked with increased seroconversion in recipients of an inactivated influenza vaccine (

 <xref rid="B153-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Moreover, IAV-stimulated B- and T-cells from the minor-allele carriers exhibited increased HLA-DR and IL-4 expression, respectively. In addition, the expression of IL-28B, but not IL-28A or IL-29, mRNAs was significantly reduced in the rs8099917, minor-allele carriers. Authors also reported that the IL-28B rs8099917 polymorphism affected humoral responses to the IAV vaccine, and had a strong outcome on cellular immune responses by modulating the Th1/Th2 cytokine response [
