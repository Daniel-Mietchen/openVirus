<p>Currently, particular attention is being paid to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are loci within the genome of an organism in which two or more alleles can exist. SNPs affect a single nucleotide or base pair and they are one of the most frequent types of genetic variations in the genome [

 <xref rid="B83-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. SNPs need to be presented into the population with a frequency equal to or greater than 1% to be considered as polymorphisms. There are multiple types of SNPs, depending on their location that can be in different regions of the genes such as promoters, exons, introns or UTRs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00168-f002">Figure 2</xref>). SNPs in coding regions are classified as synonymous, when a nucleotide substitution does not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, although other effects, such as changes in mRNA structure or folding may account for variation in protein expression. On the other hand, non-synonymous SNPs are divided in missense or nonsense. In the first case, nucleotide substitution results in the change of one amino acid for another, affecting the protein sequence coded by a gene and therefore may lead to its dysfunction. In contrast, nonsense mutations are produced when instead of substituting one amino acid for another, the altered gene contains an early stop codon in the ORF or a stop codon is abrogated, producing an elongated protein. This type of mutations results in shortened or elongated proteins leading typically to nonfunctional proteins. The functional role of SNPs in coding areas of the genome can be easily analyzed by studying the gene products. However, most SNPs fall within non-coding genome regions, therefore, predicting their effects is challenging. For example, SNPs in the promoter regions could affect their activity and regulation producing changes in gene expression levels. SNPs in UTRs or intron regions have been related with an effect in protein translation or the production of splice variants of transcripts, leading to longer or shorter protein sequences, respectively.
