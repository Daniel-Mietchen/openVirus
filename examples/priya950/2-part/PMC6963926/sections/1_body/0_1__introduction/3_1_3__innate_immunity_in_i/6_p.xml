<p>Unregulated complement activation could play a central role in the acute lung injury (ALI) pathology induced by highly pathogenic viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and avian IAV H5N1, and H7N9 [
 <xref rid="B80-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In virus-induced acute lung diseases, high levels of chemotactic, and anaphylatoxic C5a can be generated as a result of excessive complement triggering and causing a “cytokine storm”. Accordingly, the blockade of C5a signaling has been involved in treating the ALI induced by highly pathogenic viruses [
