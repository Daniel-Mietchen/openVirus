<p>NLRP3 is expressed by myeloid cells such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="B71-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] or by human bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B72-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Upon stimulation, NLRP3 activates the inflammasome system, activating caspase-1 and leading to pro-inflammatory processes through the processing and activation of proIL-1B, proIL-18, and proIL-33 [
 <xref rid="B73-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. NLRP3 senses IAV dsRNA [
 <xref rid="B74-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and PB1-F2 protein [
 <xref rid="B75-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Furthermore, protein flux through the viral M2 ion channel activity in the trans-Golgi network activates NLRP3, leading to inflammasome activation [
 <xref rid="B76-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In addition to NLRP3 activation, IAV activates the inflammasomes through AIM2, increasing IAV-induced lung injury and mortality [
