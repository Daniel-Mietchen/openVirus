<p>Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins (IL)-1A IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α contribute to the proliferation and migration of different immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells, to the infected tissue. NK cells have the ability to kill virus-infected cells, are important for the activation of a protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response [
