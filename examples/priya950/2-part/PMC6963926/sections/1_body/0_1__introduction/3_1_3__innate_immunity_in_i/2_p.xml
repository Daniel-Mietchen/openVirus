<p>Secreted type I and III IFNs signal through different receptors in a paracrine or autocrine way to induce the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), several of which counteract viral replication [

 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Just as an example mentioned below, IFITM3 is an ISG playing antiviral roles against influenza virus infection and other viruses [
 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Type I and III IFNs signaling pathways lead to the post-translational phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2 transcription factors [
 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], being the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus protein tyrosine kinase 1 (JAK1) critical for the phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Moreover, STAT1 is phosphorylated by IKKÎµ during IFN signaling and this step is important for the IFN-inducible innate immune response [

 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Upon phosphorylation, STAT1 and STAT2 associate with IRF-9 forming the heterotrimeric ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex [
 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This heterotrimeric complex then translocates to the nucleus, and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) located in the promoters of ISGs, up-regulating their expression [
