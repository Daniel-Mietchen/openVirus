<p>Because of the ability of IAV to modify their genome using two main evolutionary mechanisms, antigenic drift and shift, viruses encoding novel antigenic proteins to which the population has limited or no preexisting immunity can be generated [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For that reason, seasonal vaccines have to be reformulated yearly to guarantee that the viral glycoproteins (HA and NA) in the vaccine match seasonal viruses circulating worldwide [

 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, IAV variability can lead to the generation of new virus strains with pandemic potential. For example, the first IAV pandemic of this century occurred in 2009 and it is estimated that in approximately one year, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) IAV infected more than 600,000 human beings, causing near 16,000 deaths in over 200 countries [
