  <p>Functional analysis of IL-17A in a PR8-infected mouse model. The IL-17A knock-out mice displayed decreased virulence after infection with PR8 influenza virus. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> IL-17A knock-out or WT mice were infected with PR8 influenza virus. Body weights were determined daily for 14 days and are depicted as the percentage of body weight at the time of inoculation. The data are the mean body weights of five mice. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean (

   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Three mice from the PR8-infected groups were euthanized on days 5 and 7 post-infection for lung virus titration and necropsy examination 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> The lung tissues of PR8-infected IL-17A knock-out and WT mice were collected, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. Representative images are shown at 20× magnification. Mean histological scoring of lung sections were also measured (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, 
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> The relative levels of IL17F, CCL5, CXCL11, IL-13, and IL-15 in IL-17A knock-out mouse lungs were determined by qRT-PCR at 5 days after PR8 infection. RNA levels were normalized to β-actin. The fold differences from the qRT-PCR were determined using the 2

   <sup>Ct</sup> method and are expressed as fold induction compared to WT mice with PR8 infection. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, 
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
