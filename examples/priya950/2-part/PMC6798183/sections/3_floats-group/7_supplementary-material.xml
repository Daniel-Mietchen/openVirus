  <p>Functional analysis of IL-17A in a CA04-infected mouse model. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> IL-17A knock-out or WT mice were infected with CA04 influenza virus. Body weights were determined daily for 14 days and are depicted as the percentage of body weight at the time of inoculation. The data are the mean body weights of five mice; the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (

   <bold>(B)</bold> Three mice from the CA04-infected groups were euthanized on days 5 and 7 post-infection for lung virus titration examination (
