  <p>Functional analysis of IL-17A in PR8-infected A549 cells. The stimulation of IL-17A in A549 cells facilitated replication of the PR8 strain. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A549 cells were cultured with or without IL-17A (20 or 50 ng/mL) for 24 h and then infected with H1N1 IAV at a MOI of 0.01. Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points to determine viral titers by TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and cellular RNA was extracted to analyze a select panel of immune-related genes by qRT-PCR. RNA levels were normalized to β-actin. Fold differences were determined using the 2
