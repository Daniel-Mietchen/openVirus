  <p>Viral titers and overview of the RNA-seq data of the DEGs. Differential replication efficiency and transcript profiles of responses to H1N1 IAV infection of A549 and 293T cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Growth characteristics of IAVs in A549 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and 293T 
   <bold>(B)</bold> cells. The cells were infected with PR8 or CA04 virus (MOI = 1), respectively. Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and viral titers were determined by plaque assays. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Numbers of reliably quantified DEGs (fold difference ≥2 or ≤0.5) in the A549 and 293T cells following infection with two different H1N1 IAV strains, as compared to uninfected controls. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Venn diagram showing the distribution of shared DEGs among PR8- and CA04-infected A549 
   <bold>(D)</bold> and 293T cells 
   <bold>(E)</bold>.
