<p>We also focused our attention on unique DEGs in CA04/PR8-infected cells. The top five pathways enriched in unique DEGs of CA04/PR8-infected A549 or 293T cells are displayed in

Among these most significant regulated pathways, two of them are strongly associated with lymphocyte cell activation: MSP-RON signaling and HMGB1 signaling, which were only enriched by CA04 infected A549 cells. These results suggested that the CA04 strain may be able to disrupt lymphocyte function, thereby delaying efficient antiviral defenses by the host.
