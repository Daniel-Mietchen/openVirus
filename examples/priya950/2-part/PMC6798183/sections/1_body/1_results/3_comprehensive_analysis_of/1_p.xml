<p>To investigate possible biological interactions of DEGs and determine important functional networks, DEG datasets were imported into the Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) tool. To identify functional groups and components of processes that are common and unique between the responses of A549 and 293T cells infected with the two different H1N1 viruses, the statistical enrichment of canonical pathways identified by IPA (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) was calculated. The 10 most common canonical pathways in infected A549 cells were interferon signaling and interferon signaling-associated pathways, indicating the rapid, and hyper-cytokine response in response to H1N1 IAV infection. In addition, the 10 most common pathways in infected 293T cells were involved in cytokine production regulation and various other pathways. Remarkably, the IL-17A and IL-17F pathways were highly enriched in IAV-infected 293T cells, indicating the potential function of IL-17 in the regulation of the IAV-induced inflammation responses of 293T cells (

Interestingly, the differential regulation of cytokine production in intestinal epithelial cells or macrophages by IL-17A and IL-17F were also enriched in the top five pathways in 293T cells infected with PR8 virus, further indicating the potential role of IL-17A/F in the regulation of virus propagation or the inflammatory responses of 293T cells.
