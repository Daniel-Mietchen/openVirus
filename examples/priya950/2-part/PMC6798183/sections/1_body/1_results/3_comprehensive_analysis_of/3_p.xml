<p>To examine the biological roles of the identified DEGs, functional analyses of both common and individual genes were performed using IPA software. Among the disease and disorder items, we focused on the inflammatory response, since many genes related to antiviral and inflammatory response signaling are included in this category (

Interestingly, a greater number of genes were included in the H1N1 virus infected A549 cells, indicating a greater inflammatory response during infection in A549 cells. Furthermore, IPA upstream regulator analysis revealed that many of the top upstream regulators are associated with the type I IFN response in A549 cells, while IL17A was enriched in 293 T cells, demonstrating a potential function of IL17A during virus replication (
