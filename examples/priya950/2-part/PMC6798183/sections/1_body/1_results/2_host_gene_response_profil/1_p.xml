<p>RNA isolates were prepared from both IAV- and mock-infected A549 and 293T cells at 8 hpi. A ≥2- or ≤0.5- fold difference in gene level and FDR-adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 between IAV-infected and mock infected extracts was considered as differential expression. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, a total of 487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 186 were down-regulated in A549 cells infected with CA04, while 456 DEGs were up-regulated and 346 were down-regulated in A549 cells infected with PR8. In addition, infection of 293T cells with strain PR8 resulted in fewer DEGs (147 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated). The Venn diagram shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> illustrates the overlap of A549 cell responses to CA04 and PR8 virus infection induced DEGs. 276 up-regulated and 111 down-regulated genes were DEGs in both virus infections. In contrast to A549 cells, the 293T cells infected with PR8 and CA04 virus demonstrated 134 common up-regulated genes but only two common down-regulated genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate differences between human cells in response to virus infection, with some shared alternations in expression profiles between the cell types.
