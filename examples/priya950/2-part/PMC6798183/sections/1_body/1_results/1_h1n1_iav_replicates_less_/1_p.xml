<p>To determine the efficiency of IAV replication in human cells, A549 and 293T cells were infected with CA04 and PR8 viruses (MOI = 0.1), respectively. Aliquots of cell supernatants were harvested at 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 h post-infection (hpi). The plaque assay was used to determine viral titers. Replication analysis in A549 cells revealed that propagation of PR8 and CA04 was similar in A549 cells over a 10-h period, reaching titers in the range of 5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL (
