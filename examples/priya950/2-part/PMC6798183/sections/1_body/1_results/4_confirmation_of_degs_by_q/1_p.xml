<p>To validate the differential expression profiles of genes obtained by RNA-seq analysis, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on selected DEGs. We found that the qRT-PCR results were consistent with those of the RNA-seq analysis. Although differences were observed between these two types of analyses due to intrinsic differences between the techniques, the qRT-PCR results displayed the same relative regulation of DE genes as the RNA-seq data (
