<p>To further validate our approach for identifying functionally relevant host genes, A549 cells were treated with IL-17A protein and then infected with PR8 influenza virus. With increasing amounts of IL-17A protein, the viral titers also significantly increased at 60 and 72 hpi (

IL-13, which is an anti-inflammatory factor during IAV infection. IL-17A stimulation resulted in marked down-regulation of IL-13 at all-time points post-infection when compared to untreated controls. In contrast, IL-15 expression was increased within higher concentrations IL-17A treatment (50 ng/mL) (
