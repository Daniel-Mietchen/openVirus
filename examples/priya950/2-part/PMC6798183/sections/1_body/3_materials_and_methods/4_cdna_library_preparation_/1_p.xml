<p>For cDNA library preparation, total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the RNAs were quantified using a NanoDrop ND1000 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), and their quality was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States). The RNA integrity number (RIN) of each sample was &gt; 8. The cDNA libraries were prepared according to the standard Illumina protocol. The RNA-seq was performed by the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. The three sets (repeat 3 times for each group) of different cell samples were used. RNA-seq raw data were cleaned by removing the adaptor sequence and low-quality reads (

After filtering reads containing sequencing adapters and reads of low quality, the remaining reads were aligned to the human genome using Tophat and normalized expression were calculated using the RPKM method. The distributions of reads for known genes were analyzed using the HTSeq. All Seq genes expressed in at least one of the samples with RPKM ≥ 0.1 were used for the analysis. RNA-seq raw data are included as
