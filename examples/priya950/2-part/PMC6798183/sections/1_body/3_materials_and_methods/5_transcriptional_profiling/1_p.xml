<p>Ingenuity pathway analysis software (Ingenuity System) was used for DEG analysis, and the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate DEGs. Genes with â‰¥ 2-fold changes were selected for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) functional classifications were determined using Blast2GO software, and the enriched gene functional categories were further classified by GO analysis with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Data were analyzed using IPA software. The most significant canonical pathways and functional processes of biological importance were identified using the list of DEGs identified by RNA-seq. Upstream regulator analysis was used to predict regulators and infer their activation state according to prior knowledge of expected effects and known target genes from the IPA database.
