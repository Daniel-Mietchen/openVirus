<p>For virus infection, 293T or A549 cells were incubated with H1N1 IAV (PR8 or CA04) at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in DMEM with or without FBS for the indicated times at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The infected cells were collected and used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by analysis of the rRNA band integrity.
