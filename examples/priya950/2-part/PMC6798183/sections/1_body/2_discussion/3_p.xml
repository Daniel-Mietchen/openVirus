<p>In CA04 virus-infected A549 cells, specifically enriched pathways were strongly associated with lymphocyte functions: HMGB1 signaling and MSP-RON signaling pathways. HMGB1 is an alarmin, which functions as endogenous molecular to activate the innate immune response (

Although similar virus replication was displayed in CA04/PR8 was displayed in infected A549 cells, completely different enriched pathways indicated the differential host response evasion strategies of H1N1 IAV.
