<p>Intense inflammatory responses are consistently reported as features of the high pathogenesis in humans (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Using common genes and total genes analysis, IPA data analysis (canonical pathways and functional analysis) revealed that the major host response pathways for A549 cells upon infection with PR8 or CA04 virus were PRR and interferon-related pathways. Similar results were also observed in a previous study, most up-regulated genes in PR8 infected A549 cell were also significantly enriched in the innate immunity, type I interferon response and PRR pathways (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). These results demonstrated that A549 cells infected with the H1N1 virus induced robust IFN responses and the activation of interferon-stimulated genes at early time points. In contrast to a prior report (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), other pathways involved in leukocyte extravasation signaling or paxillin signaling were also enriched in unique DGEs of A549 cells infected with PR8 virus, indicating that the potential functional genes were hiding behind the robust interferon response and antiviral response upon influenza virus infection. In addition, H1N1 IAV-infected 293T cells apparently failed to initiate the cellular inflammatory response and immune response. In addition, IL-17A- and Th17-associated pathways were highly enriched in 293T cells upon H1N1 IAV infection, indicating that 293T cells are not very prone to triggering host anti-influenza viral responses, although the cell is usually used for packaging virus (
