Identification of these sabotaged host factors could increase the number of potential antiviral drug targets. Here, IAV A/PR/8/34 (PR8)- and A/California/04/2009-infected A549 and 293T cells displayed differential virus replication. To determine the host cellular responses of A549 and 293T cells to IAV infection, RNA-seq was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Our data revealed that IAV-infected A549 cells activated stronger virus-sensing signals and highly expressed cytokines, which play significant roles in initiating the innate immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, IAV-infected 293T cells displayed weak immune signaling and cytokine production. Remarkably, IL-17A and associated genes were highly enriched in IAV-infected 293T cells. Furthermore, IL-17A can partially facilitate A549 cell infection by the PR8 strain and PR8-infected IL-17A knock-out mice consistently exhibited decreased weight loss and reduced lung immunopathology, as compared to controls. This work uncovered the differential responses of cells infected with two H1N1 IAV strains and the potential roles of IL-17A in modulating virus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transcriptome analysis</kwd><kwd>H1N1 influenza virus</kwd><kwd>human cells</kwd><kwd>IL-17A</kwd><kwd>differential replication</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a substantial threat to human health in the forms of seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reperant et al., 2014</xref>). IAV mainly targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, but can also infect macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Veckman et al., 2006</xref>). The innate immune system initiates host defenses against IAV infection, which is triggered by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize viruses or their genetic material (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kawai and Akira, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wilkins and Gale, 2010</xref>). This recognition results in appropriate antiviral responses, including the production of a variety of cytokines and the induction of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of the immune responses is correlated with increased morbidity and mortality due to IAV infection, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Teijaro et al., 2014</xref>). The overabundance of inflammatory cytokines is a major feature of 2009 H1N1 infection in both humans and experimental animals, and is widely thought to play a central role in the clinical outcome, and pathogenesis of IAV infection (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Tisoncik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hartshorn, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Teijaro et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, maintaining the immune system in an appropriately robust condition is thought to be important for the prevention of severe influenza symptoms (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Teijaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the balance between protective and pathological immune responses against IAV infection remain unclear.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis of host cellular responses to virus infection can be used to identify potential cellular factors directly or indirectly involved in viral infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, a recently developed transcriptome profiling approach, combined with bioinformatics has emerged as an important tool to extract detailed information concerning cellular signaling mechanisms (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). RNA-seq technology has the potential to reveal dynamic alterations in the pathogen genome itself and the systemic changes in host gene expression profiles during the process of infection by pathogens, which could help clarify the pathogenesis of viral infection and interactive mechanisms of pathogens. RNA-seq has been applied to study various viral infections and diseases, although previous studies have primarily focused on influenza virus infection of mouse models (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ertl and Klein, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, host transcript analyses have been conducted with the use of IAV-infected human lung tissues, which have confirmed significant enrichment of host defenses and the promotion of cell death, consistent with prior animal studies (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the abilities of mouse-adapted (A/PR/08/34) and non-adapted (A/CA/04/2009) H1N1 strains of IAV to induce differential defense responses in human cells were investigated. Although both PR8 and CA04 belong to H1N1 IAV, they have distinct origins (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Califano et al., 2018</xref>). These two strains were used to infect human 293T cells as a representative human cell line and A549 cells (human lung epithelial cell line) as a more physiologically relevant cell line (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Geiss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Temperton et al., 2007</xref>). RNA-seq was used to annotate host responses to infection of A549 and 293T cells by the PR8 and CA04 strains of H1N1 IAV. The results of this study provide a global view of virus type-specific and cell-specific mRNA profiles, illustrating the role, and mechanism of host/virus cellular responses during IAV infection. The differential infectivity of H1N1 IAV in A549 and 293T cells uncovered potential candidate genes that may contribute to the observed resilience of mammalian cells to pandemic IAV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>H1N1 IAV Replicates Less Efficiently in 293T Cells</title><p>To determine the efficiency of IAV replication in human cells, A549 and 293T cells were infected with CA04 and PR8 viruses (MOI = 0.1), respectively.

The 10 most common canonical pathways in infected A549 cells were interferon signaling and interferon signaling-associated pathways, indicating the rapid, and hyper-cytokine response in response to H1N1 IAV infection. In addition, the 10 most common pathways in infected 293T cells were involved in cytokine production regulation and various other pathways. Remarkably, the IL-17A and IL-17F pathways were highly enriched in IAV-infected 293T cells, indicating the potential function of IL-17 in the regulation of the IAV-induced inflammation responses of 293T cells (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

The receptor specificity of the hemagglutinin and internal genes of influenza viruses play roles in host range restriction (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the virus itself, host restriction proteins also play important roles in virus replication (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brass et al., 2009</xref>). Although numerous studies have documented the roles of various influenza virus proteins in immune evasion, factors that maintain the balance between protective and pathological host responses to infection are less well understood (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger and Morens, 2013</xref>). The application of genome-wide profiling techniques, such as microarray analysis, has resulted in the identification of novel host factors involved in H1N1 IAV infection of mice, ferrets, and macaques (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Boon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cilloniz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Go et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shinya et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to animal models, RNA-seq technology is also widely used to explore host cell responses to human IAV infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fabozzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2018</xref>). In this experiment, two different H1N1 IAV strains were used to independently infect A549 and 293T cells. RNA-seq was used to identify host DEGs during infection with two different H1N1 IAV strains. Numerous genes displayed significantly altered expression levels upon infection with different virus types. To better understand the host cell response to H1N1 IAV infection at 8 h, a total of 249 common DEGs were identified in A549 cells infected with the two different strains, but only 137 common DEGs were identified in CA04- and PR8-infected 293T cells, corresponding to the lower viral titers in 293T cells. Our previous work demonstrated that DEGs in H5N1-infected 293T and A549 cells were mainly linked to cellular function and metabolic processes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). These differential expression patterns motivated us to investigate the complicated relationship between H1N1 IAV and host cells.</p><p>Intense inflammatory responses are consistently reported as features of the high pathogenesis in humans (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Using common genes and total genes analysis, IPA data analysis (canonical pathways and functional analysis) revealed that the major host response pathways for A549 cells upon infection with PR8 or CA04 virus were PRR and interferon-related pathways. Similar results were also observed in a previous study, most up-regulated genes in PR8 infected A549 cell were also significantly enriched in the innate immunity, type I interferon response and PRR pathways (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). These results demonstrated that A549 cells infected with the H1N1 virus induced robust IFN responses and the activation of interferon-stimulated genes at early time points. In contrast to a prior report (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), other pathways involved in leukocyte extravasation signaling or paxillin signaling were also enriched in unique DGEs of A549 cells infected with PR8 virus, indicating that the potential functional genes were hiding behind the robust interferon response and antiviral response upon influenza virus infection. In addition, H1N1 IAV-infected 293T cells apparently failed to initiate the cellular inflammatory response and immune response. In addition, IL-17A- and Th17-associated pathways were highly enriched in 293T cells upon H1N1 IAV infection, indicating that 293T cells are not very prone to triggering host anti-influenza viral responses, although the cell is usually used for packaging virus (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In CA04 virus-infected A549 cells, specifically enriched pathways were strongly associated with lymphocyte functions: HMGB1 signaling and MSP-RON signaling pathways. HMGB1 is an alarmin, which functions as endogenous molecular to activate the innate immune response (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Klune et al., 2008</xref>). The MSP-RON pathway also plays an import role in the activation of macrophages and natural killer cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). A previous study reported H5N1 virus PB1-F2 inhibited host lymphocyte cell activation through inhibiting HMGB1 and MSP-RON pathways (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Leymarie et al., 2013</xref>). These pathways may also be utilized in CA04-virus infected A549 cells to subvert host defense responses. Although similar virus replication was displayed in CA04/PR8 was displayed in infected A549 cells, completely different enriched pathways indicated the differential host response evasion strategies of H1N1 IAV.</p><p>IL-17, which is produced during the adaptive and innate immune responses, functions as a pro-cytokine and plays a critical role during H5N1 IAV infection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cypowyj et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study also demonstrated a protective role of IL-17A by modulating early humoral immunity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, previous studies of IL-17RA-deficient mice reported that IL-17 may act as a double-edged sword by contributing to pulmonary immunopathology in pandemic H1N1 virus infection (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the H5N1-infected IL-17-deficient subjects display increased weight loss and reduced survival rates (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). However, the functions of IL-17A during IAV infection still need to be elucidated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, stimulation of A549 cells by IL-17A partially enhanced replication of PR8 virus. IL-17A can promote the release of IL-15, and most interestingly, can significantly suppress IL-13 expression. Previous reports indicate that IL-13 production leads to impaired antiviral immune responses, resulting in a more severe influenza virus infection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that IL-17A stimulation during H1N1 infection in A549 cells may limit the inflammatory response by regulating IL-13 expression. Consistent with previous research, we observed that IL-17A knock-out mice achieved higher survival rates and the lungs of PR8-infected IL-17A knock-out mice had lower viral titers than those of WT animals. Tissue-specific micro-environmental factors may respond to these differential reactions <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the influence of cellular components on lung pathology and the inflammatory response during influenza virus infection in IL-17A knock-out mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S4.SS1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The mouse experimental design and protocols used in this study were approved by &#x0201c;the regulation of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences of Research Ethics Committee&#x0201d; (Permit Number: PZIMCAS2013001).
