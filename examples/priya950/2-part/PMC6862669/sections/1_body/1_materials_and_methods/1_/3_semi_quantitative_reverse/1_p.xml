<p>Total RNA from the lungs was extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). A total of 400 ng/µl RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotide primers and the MuLV reverse transcriptase (Finnzyme; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viral transcripts were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as previously described (
 <xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The sequences of all additional primers used for PCR were as follows: Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, forward, 5′-GTCCTCAGATCTGGCTATTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCTTCAGTGGATTTTCTTGG-3′; IRF4, forward, 5′-TCACTTGTTCGTGGAGCATC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCTGGAGTCAGTGCTGATGG-3′; IRF7, forward, 5′-CCACGGAAAATAGGGAAGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CATAGGGTTCCTCGTAAACA-3′, Arginase 1 (Arg1), forward, 5′-GCAGTGGCTTTAACCTTGGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTGTGATGCCCCAGATGGTT-3′; CD38, forward, 5′-TGGCCTTGCTGGAATAGGTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCATCAAGGTGGGAGCATGG-3′; early growth response protein 2 (Egr2), forward, 5′-ACCTCCTTCCTACCCATCCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACAGGGAAACGGCTTTCGAT-3′; G-protein coupled receptor 18 (Gpr18), forward 5′-TGGCCATCGTACAGCCAAAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTCGGAGATCTTCAGGCAGG-3′. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) transcripts were detected by using primers as previously decribed (
