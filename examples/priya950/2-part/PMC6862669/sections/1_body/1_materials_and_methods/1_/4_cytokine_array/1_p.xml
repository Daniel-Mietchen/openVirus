<p>Lung tissue homogenates (100 Âµl) were lysed and the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chemokine expression in lung tissue lysates was assessed using the Proteome Profiler Mouse XL Cytokine array kit (R&amp;D Systems). Signal intensities on autoradiography films were quantified using Gene Tools software (Sygene). The expression levels of cytokines were normalized to the expression level of reference spots. The assay was performed in duplicate to ensure reproducibility of the results.</p>
