<p>In order to effectively diagnose and treat severe influenza virus infections, it is important to determine the infection status and the quality of the host immune response. Therefore, the identification of specific biomarkers that enable accurate diagnosis of the disease and have a prognostic value for predicting disease severity is required (
 <xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Identifying biomarkers of influenza A infection is challenging, as many viral and cellular factors influence virulence, host response and pathogenicity of the virus. Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, NS and polymerase PB1 and PB2 gene products serve a central role in determination of virulence (

The activity of innate and adaptive immune cells is coordinated by cytokines. However, an overactive or unbalanced immune response may result in the overproduction of cytokines that leads to severe inflammation, whereby an excessive number of neutrophils and mononuclear cells are recruited to the site of infection (
