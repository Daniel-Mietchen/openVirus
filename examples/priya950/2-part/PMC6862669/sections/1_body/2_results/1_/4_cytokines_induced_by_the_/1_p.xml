<p>The most apparent differences between the cytokine levels induced by LD0 and LD100 doses of the virus are shown in 
 <xref rid="f5-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. LD0 did not influence the expression of these cytokines, whereas LD100 increased their expression at 2 days p.i. These cytokines can be divided into the following three main groups of proteins: i) IFN-Î³; ii) IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15 and chemokines, CCL2, CCL3/4, CCL12, CCL17, CCL19; and iii) other immune response proteins, including leptin, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), pentraxin (PTX)2 and 3, WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP-1), MMP-2, MMP-3, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM-1).
