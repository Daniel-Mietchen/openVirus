<p>The mRNA levels of selected genes in the infected lungs were determined using a semi-quantitative PCR assay at days 0, 2 and 4 days p.i. As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="f3-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>, LD0 and LD100 doses of the virus induced similar expression alterations of RIG-I and Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) mRNAs. LD100 induced significantly higher levels of RIG-I mRNA at 4 days p.i. No signficant difference in IRF3 and NF-ĸB mRNA expression levels was observed. IRF7 mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice infected with lethal doses of the virus at 4 days p.i. (P&lt;0.05). In addition, LD100 induced significant increases in IRF4 mRNA levels at 2 and 4 days p.i. (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05). Both viral doses induced similar expression alterations of interferon (IFN) mRNA levels, except for IFN-β and IFN-ε. LD0 induced a significant increase in IFN-β mRNA levels at 4 days p.i. (P&lt;0.05). In addition, LD100 induced a significant increase in IFN-ε mRNA expression at 2 days (P&lt;0.05) and 4 days (P&lt;0.001) p.i.
