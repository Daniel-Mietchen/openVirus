<p>Different transcriptional mRNA profiling in murine macrophages were observed in the lungs infected with with LD0 and LD100. Classically activated macrophages (M1) can be distinquished from alternatively activated macrophages (M2) by their relative expression of CD38, Gpr18, Fpr2 and Arg1, Egr2, respectivelly. As demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="f6-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, no signficant difference in CD38, Gpr18, and Fpr2 mRNA expression levels was observed at 2 and 4 days p.i. Arg1 and Egr2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice infected with lethal doses of the virus at 4 days p.i. These data indicate that infection with LD100 influences macrophage polarization in the lungs.
