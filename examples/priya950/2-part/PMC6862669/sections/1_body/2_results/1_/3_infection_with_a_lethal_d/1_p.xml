<p>Different cytokine expression profiles were observed following infection with LD0 and LD100. The expression levels of 114 soluble mouse proteins in the lungs of mice infected with either dose of the virus were compared. Both LD0 and LD100 significantly increased the expression levels of lipocalin 2, IL-33, CCL6, CCL11 and CCL22. The expression of these cytokines was not positively correlated with the quantity of virus used for infection (data not shown).</p>
