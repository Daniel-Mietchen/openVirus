<p>LD0 and LD100 viral doses increased the expression of 16 cytokines at 2 and 4 days p.i. (
 <xref rid="f4-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). However, distinct differences in the protein expression patterns of cytokines induced by LD0 and LD100 were observed. Cytokines, IL-1Î±, CCL5, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL13, CXCL16, C-reactive protein (CRP) and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 were more abundant in the lungs of mice infected with LD100, particularly at 2 days p.i. A significant decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteopontin (OPN) was observed at 4 days p.i. An additional group of the cytokines, including CXCL5, fetuin A, myeloperoxidase (MPO), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) were highly induced by LD100 at 2 and 4 days p.i. The expression of these cytokines was significantly higher when compared to LD0 at the same time-points p.i.
