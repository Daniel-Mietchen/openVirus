<p>Cytokines serve an important role in modulating the host immune response, clearing the virus, and healing any injury caused by the virus. Numerous factors influence the pathogenicity of the virus; thus, it is difficult to identify objective markers that can be used as an effective diagnostic tool and predict disease severity. It is hypothesized that virus pathogenicity is directly associated with the replication potential of the virus (
