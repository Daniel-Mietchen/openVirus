<p>In the current study, infection with LD100 induced overexpression of specific C-C motif chemokine ligand chemokines, which may contribute to disease pathogenicity and even death of the mice. Overexpression of chemokines CCL2, CCL17 and CCL19 is associated with the activity of M2 macrophages, and serves an important role in protective immune responses (

CXCL2 and CCL3 chemokines mediate neutrophil infiltration during the early phase of infection and can serve an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease in the lungs (
