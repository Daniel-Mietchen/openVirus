<p>In the current study, increased expression of CRP, LDL-R, MMP-9, MPO, PAI-1, OPN and VEGF correlated with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and lung tissue damage. These proteins are normally expressed during tissue damage or injury and serve important roles in tissue repair and lung immunity. Increased expression of these cytokines has been associated with the pathogenicity of virus infection. MPO-derived oxidants are pathogenic and can promote inflammation and tissue damage (

A previous study in mouse models demonstrated that H1N1 infection increased the levels of CCL2, MMP-9 and trypsin in serum and/or the lungs and heart (
