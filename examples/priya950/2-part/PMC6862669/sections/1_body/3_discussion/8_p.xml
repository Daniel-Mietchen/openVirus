<p>The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the respiratory system, and an imbalance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of granulomatous diseases and pulmonary fibrosis (

By comparing the cytokine profiles obtained from the lungs of mice infected with nonlethal and lethal influenza doses, the authors of the present study hypothesize that lethal infection may induce a mixed Th1/Th2 response. A previous study demonstrated that Th2-dominated immune responses to influenza virus infection exacerbate lung tissue damage and delay viral clearance (

In addition, the results of the current study indicate that immune cells, such as macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and basophils may serve a greater role in the pathogenesis of influenza infection than previously thought. However, the mechanisms by which Th1 and Th2 cells influence the inflammatory response during influenza virus infection require further investigation in future studies.
