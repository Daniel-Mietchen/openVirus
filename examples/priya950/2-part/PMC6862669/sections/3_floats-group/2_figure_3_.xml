  <p>Induction of RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathways. BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with LD0 and LD100 doses of H1N1 virus. The lungs were harvested prior to infection and at 2 and 4 days p.i., and lung homogenates were used for assessment of mRNA levels. Representative (A) reverse transcription PCR blots and (B) relative expression levels of mRNAs were obtained. The expression values represent the mean of two separate experiments and are presented as the mean Â± standard deviation. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001 and ***P&lt;0.0001, as indicated. RIG, retinoic acid-inducible gene; LD0, 10
   <sup>1</sup> plaque-forming units; LD100, 10
   <sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units; H1N1, A/PR/8/34 virus; IFN, interferon; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; p.i., post-infection; MDA-5, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5.
