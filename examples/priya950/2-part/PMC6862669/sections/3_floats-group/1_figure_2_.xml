  <p>Macroscopic alterations and virus titer in the lungs. Mice were infected with LD0 and LD100 doses of H1N1 influenza virus. (A) Lungs were harvested prior to infection and at 2 and 4 days p.i. (B) Virus titer was determined in lung tissue homogenates. The values represent the mean of two independent experiments. ***P&lt;0.001 vs. LD0. LD0, 10
   <sup>1</sup> plaque-forming units; LD100, 10
   <sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units; H1N1, A/PR/8/34 virus; p.i., post-infection.
