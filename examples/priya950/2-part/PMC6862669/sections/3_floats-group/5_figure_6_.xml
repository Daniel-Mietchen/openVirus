  <p>Induction of M21 and M2 markers in the lungs of mice infected with LD0 and LD100 doses of H1N1. The lungs were harvested prior to infection and at 2 and 4 days p.i., and lung homogenates were used for assessment of mRNA levels. Expression values represent the mean of two separate experiments and are expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation. **P&lt;0.001, as indicated. Gpr18, G-protein coupled receptor 18; Fpr2, formyl peptide receptor 2; Arg1, arginase-1; Egr2, early growth response protein 2; LD0, 10
   <sup>1</sup> plaque-forming units; LD100, 10
   <sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units; H1N1, A/PR/8/34 virus; p.i., post-infection.
