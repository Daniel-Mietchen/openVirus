  <p>Survival rates of mice following infection with LD0 and LD100 doses of H1N1 virus. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with LD0 and LD100 of H1N1. (A) Percentage body weight loss relative to initial weights was recorded daily until 8 days p.i. (B) Survival rates were calculated as the number of surviving animals/total number of animals ×100. n=2×4 mice at each time-point. ***P&lt;0.001 vs. LD100. LD0, 10
   <sup>1</sup> plaque-forming units; LD100, 10
   <sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units; H1N1, A/PR/8/34 virus; p.i., post-infection.
