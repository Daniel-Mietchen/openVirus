<p>In the vaccinated group who had been previously immunized with two doses of H5N2 LAIV 1 year before the booster vaccination, 39 (98%) of 40 participants developed a four-fold or greater rise of antibody titres against the strain A/turkey/Turkey/05/133 in HAI assay and 38 (95%) of 40 in MN assay on day 7. All participants had a four-fold or greater increase in antibody titers (peak GMT) against A/turkey/Turkey/05/133 and A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 (similar to wild type H5 virus which was circulated in Thailand) in both HAI and MN on day 28 (
