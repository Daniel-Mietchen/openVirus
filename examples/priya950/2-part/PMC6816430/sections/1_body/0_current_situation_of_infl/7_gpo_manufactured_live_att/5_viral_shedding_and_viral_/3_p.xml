<p>This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study using the same dose as in phase I study. The study was conducted from January to June 2013. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immune response and safety of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) manufactured by GPO in healthy Thais. One hundred and fifty participants (100 vaccinees and 50 placebos) aged 18–49 years were enrolled. Due to limited space in the isolation ward of the clinical trial unit, Participants were separated in 4 batches; Batch 1: 36 participants (24 vaccinees and 12 placebos) Batch 2: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and 13 placebos) Batch 3: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and 13 placebos) Batch 4: 38 participants (26 vaccinees and 12 placebos). Each batch was admitted to the isolation ward for 5 days after each immunization mainly for safety assessment and to ensure that there was no risk to contaminate the external environment with the vaccine strain. Two doses of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) were given by intranasal route on days 1 and 28. Follow up for nasal swab culture was done on days 2, 3, 5 and participants were discharged if culture-negative. Anyone who was still positive for nasal shedding on day 3 was given oseltamivir. Blood withdrawal was done on days 1 and 28 before immunization and on days 49 and 60, to measure immune responses by HAI, microneutralization, and serum IgG and IgA ELISA. 45 participants were randomized for nasal wash specimen on days 1, 14, 28 and 49. The trial could be terminated by any of those followings: If subject experienced disability or severe adverse event or death which was definitely related to the study vaccine in the investigator’s opinion; Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) judges to terminate the trial. The detailed information about the vaccine and the study procedure was previously described.
