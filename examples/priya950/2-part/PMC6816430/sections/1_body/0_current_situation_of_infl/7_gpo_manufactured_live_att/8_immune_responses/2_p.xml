<p>H5N2 LAIV also induced local antibody responses and cellular immune responses in cytotoxic T cells, different T-helper cell populations, and virus-specific immune memory cells. A recent study conducted in the US by K. Subbarao showed that influenza A(H5N1) pLAIV recipients with poor primary immune responses were actually having a long-lasting immunity and could be boosted with inactivated influenza H5N1 vaccine at 52, 54 or 56 months after the immunization by pLAIV.
