<p>This was a double-blind randomized study in 24 participants aged 18â€“45 years in 2012, 16 and 8 participants received vaccines and placebo, respectively. The Primary objective was to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of candidate H5 LAIV (strain H5N2) manufactured by GPO in healthy Thais with the humoral immune response by using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test and microneutralization assay as a secondary objective. Viral shedding and the stability of the viral strain were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The vaccine used the cold-adapted temperature-sensitive (
 <italic>ca-ts</italic>) live attenuated H5 candidate strain. The A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) vaccine was administered with 0.25 ml to each nostril by nasal spray on day 1 and day 21. The safety and immunogenicity monitoring were done up to 60 days. Participants were kept isolation and were discharged when nasal swabs were negative to ensure that there was no risk to the environment.
