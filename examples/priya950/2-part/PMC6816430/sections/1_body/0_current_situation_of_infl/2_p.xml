<p>In 2006, with growing concern that avian influenza viruses could mutate to become transmissible between humans and cause a pandemic, the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP) was launched by WHO. At the time of launching GAP, egg-based vaccine production had the capacity to produce about 350 million doses of inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose per year, or with optimization (working three shifts/24 h) up to 500 million doses. Even if manufacturers were to optimize output and expand vaccine production-capacity in the following 2–3 years, it was predicated that by 2009 the estimated maximum production capacity would be 780 million doses of inactivated trivalent vaccine and 2,340 million doses of monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine.

 </sup> Therefore, one of the major approaches to increasing supplies of pandemic influenza vaccine was capacity building and infrastructure strengthening or new production facilities in developing and/or industrialized countries; several developing country vaccine manufacturers participated in the GAP technology transfer programme, including the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Thailand which signed an agreement with WHO in 2007.
