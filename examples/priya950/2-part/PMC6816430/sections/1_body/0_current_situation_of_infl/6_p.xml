<p>In 2009, the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) decided to focus on development of LAIV because of the potential advantages of LAIVs compared to IIVs: LAIVs manufacturing does not require down-stream processing and the harvested vaccines can be simply packaged; confer high yields (20â€“50 doses of monovalent vaccine per an egg) compared to the IIVs; delivered needle-free (intra-nasal spray application) which can be facilitated in resource-poor settings; and induce a broad-immune responses including mucosal, systemic and cross-reactive responses.

 </sup> In May 2009, there was a sub-license agreement with WHO to obtain Russian LAIV technology from the Institute of Experimental Medicine (IEM), Saint Petersburg, Russia. After receiving the influenza A H1N1 (2009) pre-master seed from Russia through the support of WHO, the first pLAIV vaccine concentrate was harvested, and the first pLAIV clinical lot was filled in late August 2009. Based on the WHO recommendations for production and quality control of LAIV, the GMP-certified pilot plant was built at Silapakorn University in Bangkok, Thailand.

 </sup> Some initial obstacles were encountered such as a lower yield of doses than expected, the need to import a huge number of specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs and longer time for the optimization processes.

 </sup> The H1N1 monovalent vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic, fulfilling the criteria for licensure for emergency use.
