In fact, as of May 2019, there have been 861 confirmed human infections including 455 deaths from avian influenza A(H5N1) reported from 17 countries.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref></sup> Moreover, since March 2013 when the avian influenza A(H7N9) infection was first detected in humans, a total of 1,567 laboratory-confirmed human infections including at least 615 deaths (mainly from China) have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>In 2006, with growing concern that avian influenza viruses could mutate to become transmissible between humans and cause a pandemic, the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP) was launched by WHO. At the time of launching GAP, egg-based vaccine production had the capacity to produce about 350 million doses of inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 15 &#x000b5;g of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose per year, or with optimization (working three shifts/24 h) up to 500 million doses. Even if manufacturers were to optimize output and expand vaccine production-capacity in the following 2&#x02013;3 years, it was predicated that by 2009 the estimated maximum production capacity would be 780 million doses of inactivated trivalent vaccine and 2,340 million doses of monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup> Therefore, one of the major approaches to increasing supplies of pandemic influenza vaccine was capacity building and infrastructure strengthening or new production facilities in developing and/or industrialized countries; several developing country vaccine manufacturers participated in the GAP technology transfer programme, including the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Thailand which signed an agreement with WHO in 2007.</p><p>At the time of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the first imported case of pandemic H1N1 in Thailand was in early May 2009. By the second week of June 2009, there were two influenza outbreak notifications in the central region of Thailand, and then only a few weeks later the influenza virus spread throughout the country.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref></sup> At that time, there was no commitment to supplying inactivated influenza vaccines to Thailand during potential pandemics and there was no domestic production of bulk influenza vaccines. In fact, prior to 2007, there was no experience in egg-based vaccine production. By 2010, Thailand was importing 2.1 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine: GPO-MBP, a joint venture between the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) and Sanofi Pasteur, supplied approximately 800,000 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine by formulating and filling imported bulk, and the remaining 1.3 million doses were imported as finished products.</p><p>In 2005, the Thai government issued the first national pandemic influenza preparedness plans in response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in 2004. The second national strategic plan was issued for the year 2008&#x02013;2010. The first national strategic plan for influenza pandemic preparedness (2005&#x02013;2007) focused on supporting research and development of vaccines and antivirals during outbreaks.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup> In the second national strategic plan (2008&#x02013;2010), it was emphasized that Thailand would set up a local industrial-scale manufacture plant for egg-based pandemic influenza vaccines and train personnel for industrial-scale vaccine research and development processes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref></sup></p><p>With the support from WHO and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the GPO has been able to develop live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for potential pandemic vaccines (H1N1 and H5N2 LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccine for seasonal use.</p><p>In 2009, the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) decided to focus on development of LAIV because of the potential advantages of LAIVs compared to IIVs: LAIVs manufacturing does not require down-stream processing and the harvested vaccines can be simply packaged; confer high yields (20&#x02013;50 doses of monovalent vaccine per an egg) compared to the IIVs; delivered needle-free (intra-nasal spray application) which can be facilitated in resource-poor settings; and induce a broad-immune responses including mucosal, systemic and cross-reactive responses.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref></sup> In May 2009, there was a sub-license agreement with WHO to obtain Russian LAIV technology from the Institute of Experimental Medicine (IEM), Saint Petersburg, Russia. After receiving the influenza A H1N1 (2009) pre-master seed from Russia through the support of WHO, the first pLAIV vaccine concentrate was harvested, and the first pLAIV clinical lot was filled in late August 2009. Based on the WHO recommendations for production and quality control of LAIV, the GMP-certified pilot plant was built at Silapakorn University in Bangkok, Thailand.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup> Some initial obstacles were encountered such as a lower yield of doses than expected, the need to import a huge number of specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs and longer time for the optimization processes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> The H1N1 monovalent vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic, fulfilling the criteria for licensure for emergency use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup></p><sec id="S0001-S2001"><title>GPO-manufactured live attenuated influenza H5 candidate vaccine</title><p>GPO had received master donor seed H5N2 candidate vaccine strain (A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133) from WHO.

Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity of Live Attenuated Influenza H5 Candidate Vaccine Strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) in Healthy Thai Volunteers</bold></p><p>This was a double-blind randomized study in 24 participants aged 18&#x02013;45 years in 2012, 16 and 8 participants received vaccines and placebo, respectively. The Primary objective was to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of candidate H5 LAIV (strain H5N2) manufactured by GPO in healthy Thais with the humoral immune response by using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test and microneutralization assay as a secondary objective. Viral shedding and the stability of the viral strain were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The vaccine used the cold-adapted temperature-sensitive (<italic>ca-ts</italic>) live attenuated H5 candidate strain. The A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) vaccine was administered with 0.25 ml to each nostril by nasal spray on day 1 and day 21. The safety and immunogenicity monitoring were done up to 60 days. Participants were kept isolation and were discharged when nasal swabs were negative to ensure that there was no risk to the environment.</p><p>The A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 H5N2 candidate vaccine was safety and immunogenic. There were a total of 51 adverse events by systemic organ classes, 35 adverse events were reported from the vaccine group (16 participants), and 16 events were from the placebo group (8 participants). The most frequent adverse events were respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal disorders both in the vaccine group (16 events) and the placebo group (6 events), followed by gastrointestinal disorders in the vaccine group (6 events) and the placebo group (4 events). Among the total of 47 local reactions (24 after 1<sup>st</sup> immunization and 23 after 2<sup>nd</sup> immunization), 31 were from the vaccine group and 16 were from the placebo group. After the 1<sup>st</sup> immunization, the most frequent local reaction in vaccine group was stiffness of the nose (6 events), while placebo group reported only 1 event of the stiffness of the nose after the 1<sup>st</sup> immunization. After the 2<sup>nd</sup> immunization on day 21, the most frequent local reactions in the vaccine group were stiffness of the nose (6 events) and scratchy throat (4 events).</p><sec id="S0001-S2001-S3001"><title>Viral shedding and viral strain stability results</title><p>At the 1<sup>st</sup> immunization, 14 vaccinees out of 16 showed positive PCR results, and 10 vaccinees persisted to day 3. After the 2nd immunization, 13 out of 15 vaccinees had positive PCR results on day 1, and 5 vaccinees persisted up to day 3 following the 2nd immunization. One vaccinee&#x02019;s nasal swab had positive PCR results up to day 5 after the 2nd immunization. The nasal swab culture in eggs showed fewer positive results: 5 out of 16 vaccinees&#x02019; nasal swab were culture-positive after the 1<sup>st</sup> immunization and no one had positive culture after day 1. Only one vaccinee&#x02019;s nasal swab was culture-positive on day 1 after the 2<sup>nd</sup> immunization.

Phase II Safety and Immunogenicity of Live Attenuated Influenza H5 candidate vaccine strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) in healthy Thai volunteers</bold></p><p>This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study using the same dose as in phase I study. The study was conducted from January to June 2013. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immune response and safety of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) manufactured by GPO in healthy Thais. One hundred and fifty participants (100 vaccinees and 50 placebos) aged 18&#x02013;49 years were enrolled. Due to limited space in the isolation ward of the clinical trial unit, Participants were separated in 4 batches; Batch 1: 36 participants (24 vaccinees and 12 placebos) Batch 2: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and 13 placebos) Batch 3: 38 participants (25 vaccinees and 13 placebos) Batch 4: 38 participants (26 vaccinees and 12 placebos). Each batch was admitted to the isolation ward for 5 days after each immunization mainly for safety assessment and to ensure that there was no risk to contaminate the external environment with the vaccine strain. Two doses of live attenuated influenza H5 vaccine candidate strain A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) were given by intranasal route on days 1 and 28. Follow up for nasal swab culture was done on days 2, 3, 5 and participants were discharged if culture-negative. Anyone who was still positive for nasal shedding on day 3 was given oseltamivir. Blood withdrawal was done on days 1 and 28 before immunization and on days 49 and 60, to measure immune responses by HAI, microneutralization, and serum IgG and IgA ELISA. 45 participants were randomized for nasal wash specimen on days 1, 14, 28 and 49. The trial could be terminated by any of those followings: If subject experienced disability or severe adverse event or death which was definitely related to the study vaccine in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion; Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) judges to terminate the trial.
