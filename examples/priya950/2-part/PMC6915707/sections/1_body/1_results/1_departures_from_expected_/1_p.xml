<p id="Par8">At the population level, the large ZIKV epidemic could plausibly have led to either increases or decreases in dengue cases. To determine if either was the case, we compared dengue surveillance data from before, during, and after the arrival of ZIKV. We constructed time series of probable case counts for each state in Brazil (1999–2017)
