<p id="Par9">We quantified the probability of departures arising by chance from expected dengue incidence using time series models with seasonal variation in autocorrelative effects (see Methods and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> for further details on model implementation and predictive ability). Biweeks with atypically large incidence occurred significantly more often than expected in Brazil in 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). In 2017, Brazil experienced an increase in both atypically high and atypically low biweeks compared to expectation. In Colombia, a significant increase in atypically low biweeks was observed in 2016 and 2017 (Fig.
