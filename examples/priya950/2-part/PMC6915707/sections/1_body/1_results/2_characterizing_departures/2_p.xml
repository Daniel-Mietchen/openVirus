<p id="Par11">In models incorporating year effects, we found that biweekly expected dengue incidence in 2015 was higher than that of corresponding biweeks in other years in both Brazil (mean: 2.21-fold increase, 95% CrI: 1.45–3.37) and Colombia (mean: 1.11-fold increase, 95% CrI: 0.96–1.29). In contrast, we found that biweekly dengue incidence in 2017 was lower in both Brazil (relative incidence mean: 0.63, 95% CrI: 0.46–0.86) and Colombia (relative incidence mean: 0.23, 95% CrI: 0.18–0.29). At the subnational-level there are differences in the significance and direction of these effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, d</xref>), with the exception of 2017 in Colombia, where there is a significant reduction in biweekly dengue incidence in all departments (Fig.
