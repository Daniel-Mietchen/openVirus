<p id="Par12">We found a positive association between the previous biweek’s Zika incidence and dengue transmission potential in Brazil (mean coefficient: 0.16, 95% CrI: 0.05–0.26, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Putting this coefficient in context, 1000 Zika cases observed in the previous biweek translates to a multiplicative increase of about three times as many expected dengue cases in the following biweek (mean: 2.92, 95% CrI: 1.40–6.15). We also found a positive association between cumulative Zika incidence on dengue transmission potential in Brazil (mean coefficient: 0.04, 95% CrI: 0.003, 0.08). No significant associations were found between Zika incidence and dengue transmission potential in Colombia.
