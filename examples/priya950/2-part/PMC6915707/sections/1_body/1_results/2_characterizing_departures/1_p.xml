<p id="Par10">To attempt to explain the significant departures that we saw in each location, we built a set of hierarchical time series models that incorporated a number of subnational covariates. These models forecasted dengue incidence using combinations of seasonal dengue terms, year effects, and recent incidence of Zika. For a baseline, we also fit models incorporating chikungunya incidence. CHIKV shares climate and vector determinants as DENV and ZIKV but is of a different viral family and thus is not expected to interact immunologically with flaviviruses.</p>
