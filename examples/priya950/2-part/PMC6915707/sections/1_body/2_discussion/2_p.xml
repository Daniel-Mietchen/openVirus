<p id="Par19">Our results demonstrate a significant decline in dengue cases in 2017 in Brazil and Colombia. Studies involving laboratory confirmed cases and enhanced serosurveillance (for example Ribeiro et al.

 </sup>) will play an important role in pinpointing the mechanism underlying this reduction. Our simulation results show that troughs in dengue incidence are followed by atypically high dengue levels. Atypically low dengue case counts observed in 2017 in Brazil and Colombia suggest that population-level susceptibility to symptomatic dengue has been building. Such high levels of susceptibility could fuel large dengue epidemics in upcoming seasons. As of August, 2019, both Brazil and Colombia have reported more cases at this point in the year than in all of 2017 and 2018, though their dengue seasons are not complete
