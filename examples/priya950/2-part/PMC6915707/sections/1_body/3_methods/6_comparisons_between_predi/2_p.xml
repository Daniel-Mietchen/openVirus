<p id="Par33">Further, we implemented a permutation test to consider whether the number of atypically high or low observed incidence values in each year (separately for each country) was significant. For each location, we reassigned the years (sampling without replacement). Then for each year we counted the number of statistically high or low values of observed incidence. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times and then found the quantile of the observed numbers of atypically high or low biweeks within the cumulative distribution function generated from the permuted data (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>). This permutation procedure preserves temporal correlation within the years. We considered a second permutation test that preserved spatial correlation within each biweek. For this test, we reassigned biweek labels. For each biweek, we sampled without replacement from the years of available predictions for the corresponding biweek category (ranging from 1–26). We then reassigned the quantiles of that particular biweek to be the corresponding incidence from that biweek category in the resampled year. Again, we performed 10,000 permutations and found the quantile of the observed counts of statistically high or low biweeks in the corresponding cumulative distribution function. Results were similar between the two permutation tests. Between the two tests, quantile differences for each year were less than 5% (median value 0.012, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 58) and significant results (
 <italic>q</italic> &gt; 95%) presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> were maintained. Note that we did not include 1999 in the permutation test for Brazil since data is not available for the entire year in Acre (the first dengue case in the dataset is in August 1999).
