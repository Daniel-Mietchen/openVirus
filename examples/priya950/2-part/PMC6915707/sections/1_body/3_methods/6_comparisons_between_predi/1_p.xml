<p id="Par32">Starting with the second biweek of data for a given location, we sampled 500 values from the posterior distribution for predicted incidence for the corresponding model (fit using data from all other years). We evaluated the median prediction for each biweek and visually compared this value to the number of observed dengue cases in that biweek (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We then evaluated the quantile of the observed incidence in that biweek in the cumulative distribution of posterior predicted values. We consider the observed state- or department-level incidence in a particular biweek to be statistically atypical if it falls outside of the 90% prediction interval (PI), i.e., if the observed quantile is less than 0.05 or greater than 0.95 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We repeated this analysis using a Bonferroni adjusted quantile (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).
