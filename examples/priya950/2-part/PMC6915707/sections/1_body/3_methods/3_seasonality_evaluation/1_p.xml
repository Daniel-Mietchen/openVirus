<p id="Par29">For each dengue season, we identified the biweeks with the three greatest numbers of cases in each subnational location (states in Brazil and departments in Colombia). In Brazil, dengue seasons were defined to range from biweek 18 to biweek 17 of the next year, to avoid splitting the season into multiple years. In Colombia, there was not a clear start and end of a dengue season, so we did not define a particular season that spans across multiple calendar years. See Supplementary Fig.Â
