<p id="Par42">To evaluate the effects of incorporating cross-protection or enhancement, we consider changes in trough duration and peak size. All scenarios that incorporated an immune-mediated interaction were evaluated against the baseline determined by the scenario with no enhancement and no cross-protection between DENV and ZIKV (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). We define the trough duration to be the length of time that aggregated DENV prevalence is consecutively less than one half of the average incidence following the introduction of ZIKV, in the baseline scenario (approximately 16 individuals per 100,000 population). We set the trough duration to zero for all simulations that did not include a complete trough within the 20 years following the introduction of ZIKV. Peak size is defined to be the maximum DENV prevalence value, aggregated across all serotypes, in the 20 years following the introduction of ZIKV. Changes in peak size resulting from incorporating cross-protection between DENV and ZIKV were evaluated by dividing the average peak size for scenarios without enhancement by the average peak size in the baseline case (where the average is taken across the 100 simulations of each scenario). Peak size and trough duration averages and inter-quantile ranges across the 100 simulations of each scenario are displayed in Supplementary Table
