<p id="Par38">We developed a four serotype DENV model that also allowed for ZIKV infection in both mosquito and human populations. There are six mosquito compartments: susceptible, infected with one of the four dengue serotypes, and infected with ZIKV. The human compartments are based on both DENV and ZIKV status. With respect to DENV infection status, individuals in the human population are either susceptible, infectious, cross-protected, or recovered. We keep track of primary and secondary DENV infections and assume that after two heterotypic DENV infections, individuals become immune to further DENV infections. Homotypic reinfections are not allowed in the model. The human classes are further stratified depending on the individualâ€™s ZIKV status: either susceptible, infectious, cross-protected (from DENV), or recovered. There are 125 total compartments in the model.</p>
