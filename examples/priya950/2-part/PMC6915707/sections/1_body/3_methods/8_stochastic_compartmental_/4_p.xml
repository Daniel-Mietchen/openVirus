<p id="Par41">We also considered the case when ZIKV was introduced after 40 years of DENV only simulations (see Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). For these simulations, introduction of DENV1-4 infected mosquitoes are introduced according to Poisson processes with rate parameter such that on average three infected mosquitoes are introduced each year for each serotype. Sample simulations displaying DENV dynamics prior to the introduction of ZIKV under both stable and recently introduced DENV conditions are displayed in Supplementary Fig.
