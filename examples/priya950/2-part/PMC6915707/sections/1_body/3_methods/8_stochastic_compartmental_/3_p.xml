<p id="Par40">We ran 100 simulations for each scenario using a tau-leap approximation of the Gillespie method in Fortran. ZIKV was introduced into the mosquito population after 100 years of DENV only simulations. Numerical solutions for the corresponding deterministic system (using randomized initial conditions) simulated for a period of 600 years (to approximate steady state) were used to determine the initial conditions for the stochastic simulations mentioned here. An additional 20 years of data was simulated after the introduction of ZIKV. We considered DENV and ZIKV reproduction numbers for all combinations of 2 and 4 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for the case when DENV and ZIKV reproduction numbers are 4 and 2 respectively), and for the case when both are set to 3 (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The human population size was 10 million and the mosquito population size was 20 million (ratio of total mosquito population to human population set to 2)
