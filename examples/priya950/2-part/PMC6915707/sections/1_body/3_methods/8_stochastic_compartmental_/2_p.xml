<p id="Par39">We considered a suite of immune-mediated interaction scenarios, considering the possibility of enhancement or cross-protection. The enhancement scenarios we considered included: no enhancement, DENV enhances DENV, DENV enhances DENV and ZIKV, and enhancement in all directions. Enhancement was incorporated as a 1.6-fold increase in the force of infection from humans to mosquitos. We incorporated a symmetric cross-protective effect, i.e. for a period of time, a dengue infection would reduce the hazard of a future Zika infection and a Zika infection would reduce the hazard of a future dengue infection. Cross-serotype dengue protection (80% hazard reduction to other DENV serotypes) was included in all scenarios. The average duration of cross-protection between DENV serotypes was one year (

 </sup>. We considered the case when cross-protection between dengue and Zika also lasted one year on average. The scenarios without cross-protection did allow for a reduced hazard for approximately 4 days (
 <italic>γ</italic> = 1/100). We considered two levels of cross-protection between DENV and ZIKV. The high-level matched the level of cross-serotype dengue protection (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.2)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. The low-level of cross-protection reduced the hazard for the other virus by only 20% (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.8). We did not incorporate seasonality in either DENV or ZIKV transmission but expect simulations with seasonality to be qualitatively similar to those presented here.
