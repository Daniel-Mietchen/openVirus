<p id="Par25">We construct biweekly time series for probable dengue, Zika, and chikungunya case counts for each state in Brazil and department in Colombia. The Epidemiological Bulletins provide estimates for the cumulative number of cases since Epiweek 1 reported up until the corresponding Epiweek. These cumulative counts are not fixed and are updated as new information becomes available, such as updated knowledge of clinical symptoms or related test results. When the diagnosis of a case is changed to another disease or when samples are negative for the originally designated pathogen, these cases are removed from the cumulative counts. Thus, the published cumulative counts sometimes decrease in consecutive bulletins.</p>
