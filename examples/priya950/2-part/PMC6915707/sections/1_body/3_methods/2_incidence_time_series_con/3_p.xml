<p id="Par27">To determine which approximation to use in our analyses, we calculated the sum of squared errors for each of the approximations using the updated previous year data (2014–2016) reported in the 2015–2017 Epidemiological Bulletins from Brazil. We found that the middle approximation best represented our target time series; this approximation was thus used for the construction of all case count time series for both Brazil and Colombia. For Brazil, we use the final (updated previous year) data to construct our time series, when it is available. When performing our analysis, we used updated data for Brazil up through Epiweek 42, 2017 (since updated data for the rest of 2017 was unavailable).</p>
