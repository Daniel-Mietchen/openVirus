<p id="Par28">For each location and disease, we fit a spline to the adjusted cumulative incidence curve by using the smooth.spline function from the stats package in R. A knot was assigned to each data point. We used a binning procedure to translate the continuous spline into a biweekly sequence of predicted case counts. Cases were assigned to biweeks with probabilities based on the difference in predicted case counts at endpoints of consecutive biweeks. When consecutive predicted spline values decreased, the probability of assigning cases to the first biweek was set to zero. We repeated the reassignment process 1000 times to create 1000 case count time-series and then calculated the mean incidence for each biweek (averaged over the 1000 simulations), rounded down to the nearest integer to obtain the final biweekly case count. In what follows, we refer to this value as the observed incidence.</p>
