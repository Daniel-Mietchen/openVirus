Severe dengue and dengue with alarm symptoms cases are clinically diagnosed based on symptoms. Case definitions have changed over time, but we use probable case counts (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases) in all of our analyses. Zika and chikungunya case counts were first reported in the Epidemiological bulletins for Epidemiological week (Epiweek) 13, 2016 and Epiweek 9, 2016 respectively.
