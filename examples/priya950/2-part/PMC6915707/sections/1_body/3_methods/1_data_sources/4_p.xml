  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. This dataset includes weekly dengue case counts for 2007–2017, with severe dengue cases reported separately for 2014–2017. We excluded cases with an unknown department and those that were considered imported from other countries. We combined counts for districts with the counts for the department in which they are located, whenever they were reported separately. We extracted additional data for probable Zika and chikungunya cases from the weekly Epidemiological Bulletins

 </sup> for 2015–2017. According to the Epidemiological Bulletins published by Colombia’s Directorate of Surveillance and Risk Analysis in Public Health, Zika has been in the country since 2015 Epiweek 40 with the number of cases first reported in the 2016 Epiweek 1 bulletin. In the updated Colombia dataset, the first documented Zika cases were in 2015 Epiweek 25. Case counts in the bulletins of both countries were given as cumulative counts.
