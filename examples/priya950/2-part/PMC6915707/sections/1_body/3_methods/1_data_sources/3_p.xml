<p id="Par22">The Epidemiological Bulletins published in Brazil for 2014–2017 also report the corresponding dengue data for the previous year. We use the available previous year data reported in the 2014–2018 bulletins to obtain probable dengue case counts for 2013–2017 Epiweek 42 since these data are most comparable to the preceding historical data. Analogous updated probable Zika and chikungunya case counts were first reported in 2017 and 2016 respectively. We use these updated counts in our analyses. We also use data on the cumulative number of microcephaly cases and other central nervous system disorders in newborns

 </sup> reported in Brazil since Epiweek 45, 2015 through the end of 2016. Cumulative number of cases later disregarded from the system was also reported. We therefore deduct the disregarded counts from the case counts.
