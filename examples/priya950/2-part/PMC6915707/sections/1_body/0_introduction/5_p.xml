 </sup> to determine whether dengue incidence has been atypical since the emergence of ZIKV. We demonstrate that dengue incidence was significantly lower than expected in both countries in 2017. Despite these unprecedented low periods, we do not find a negative association between cumulative Zika incidence and biweekly dengue incidence in either country. To gain insight into how immunological interactions would impact the relationship between ZIKV and DENV incidence in this period, we use a stochastic compartmental model of the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV under multiple assumptions. In almost all simulations incorporating strong ZIKV cross-protection against subsequent DENV infection, ZIKV epidemics are followed by a trough in dengue incidence, followed by a larger than average peak in DENV incidence. Correlated hazards of DENV and ZIKV transmission may complicate the relationship between ZIKV incidence and resulting dengue incidence. Our simulations consistently show that periods of low dengue incidence are followed by large increases in dengue incidence.
