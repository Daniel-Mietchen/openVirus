 <sup>

 </sup>. The outbreak in the Americas was extensive, affecting 48 countries and territories up through December 2017

 </sup>) to 63% (Salvador, Brazil
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>). These are comparable to seroprevalence in previous ZIKV outbreaks; 73% in Yap Island, Micronesia

 </sup>, 49% in French Polynesia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Associations between ZIKV infection and severe disease outcomes such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome were recognized by the WHO in March 2016
