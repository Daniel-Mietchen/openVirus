  <title>Simulation results incorporating immune-mediated interactions between DENV and ZIKV.</title>
  <p>Mean and 95% inter-quantile range from stochastic simulations spanning 10 years post ZIKV-introduction. 100 simulations per scenario (see “Methods” for further details). ZIKV introduced after a 100 year burn-in period for four DENV serotypes (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> for results when ZIKV is introduced 40 years after DENV). DENV and ZIKV reproduction numbers are assumed to be 4 and 2, respectively. Other reproduction number combinations are considered in Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The dashed line indicates one-half of the average incidence in (
   <bold>a</bold>) which we use to define the start and end of DENV prevalence troughs (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold> Individuals with previous dengue exposure experience 20% of the DENV force of infection (FOI) that a fully susceptible person would. 
   <bold>e</bold>–
   <bold>h</bold> Individuals with previous ZIKV exposure experience 80% of the FOI that a fully susceptible person would. 
   <bold>i</bold>–
   <bold>l</bold> Individuals with ZIKV exposure experience 20% of the DENV FOI (same amount of cross-protection between dengue and Zika than between dengue serotypes).
