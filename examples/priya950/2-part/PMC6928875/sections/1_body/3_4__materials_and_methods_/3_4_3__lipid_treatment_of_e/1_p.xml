<p>Lipid treatments of virus-infected cells were performed, as previously described, with modifications [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, RD cells were seeded into 96-well plates to reach 90% confluency for infection. The cells were pre-incubated with lipid-supplemented medium at the following concentrations for 2 h: AA and DPA = 100 µM, DHA = 50 µM, and EPA = 60 µM. Then, the cells were infected with either EV-A71 or CV-A16 (multiplicity of infection, MOI = 10.0). At 1 hpi, the cells were washed three times with DMEM. The cells were replenished with lipid-supplemented medium for 4 h of incubation. The cell lysates were then collected for qRT-PCR.
