<p>The identification of lipids was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, MS/MS fragmentation was performed on the significant features with high abundances. The significant features were identified by searching accurate MS and MS/MS fragmentation pattern data in the MS-DIAL internal lipid database [

 <uri xlink:href="http://www.lipidmaps.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.lipidmaps.org/</uri>). For confirmation of lipid identity using authentic chemical standards, the MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the chemical standards were compared with those of the candidate lipids measured under the same LC-MS condition.
