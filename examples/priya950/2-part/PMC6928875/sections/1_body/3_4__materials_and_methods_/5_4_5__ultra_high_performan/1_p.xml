<p>UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis was performed, as previously described, with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, the lipid extract was analyzed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2-Si High Definition Mass Spectrometry (HDMS) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The chromatography was performed on a Waters ACQUITY CSH C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 µm) coupled to an Acquity CSH C18 VanGuard pre-column (5 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 µm) (Waters; Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase A was 60:40 acetonitrile:water (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase B for positive mode was 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase B for negative mode was 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile (v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-05952">Table S3</xref>. The column and autosampler temperature were maintained at 55 °C and 4 °C, respectively. The injection volume was 7 µL. The mass spectral data were acquired in both positive and negative modes. The capillary voltage was maintained at 2.5kV (positive mode) and 2.0 kV (negative mode). The sampling cone voltage and source offset were maintained at 30 V and 60 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas at a flow rate of 800 L/h. The source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 120 °C and 400 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range of 100–1500. The SYNAPT G2-Si HDMS system was calibrated using sodium formate clusters and operated in sensitivity mode. Leucine enkephalin was used as a lock mass for all experiments. MS/MS acquisition was operated in the same parameters as in MS acquisition. Collision energy was applied in the range of 30–45 eV for fragmentation to allow putative identification and structural elucidation of the significant lipids.
