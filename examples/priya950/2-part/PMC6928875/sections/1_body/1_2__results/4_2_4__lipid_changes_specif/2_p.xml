<p>In the group-to-group comparison, 3/47 (6.4%) lipids belonging to diacylglycerols (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG) were uniquely different between EV-A71-infected vs. mock-infected cells, 15/47 (31.9%) lipids belonging to SM, FFA, TAG, LPE, and EtherPE were uniquely different between CV-A16-infected vs. mock-infected cells, and 3/47 (6.4%) lipids belonging to EtherPE and PC were uniquely different between EV-A71-infected vs. CV-A16-infected cells (
