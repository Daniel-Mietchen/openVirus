<p>In order to identify specific lipid changes in EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections, the significant lipid features were grouped and annotated using the MS-DIAL software [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Potential precursor ions were used to perform further MS/MS experiments to obtain their fragmentation patterns and the MS/MS spectra of some representative lipids were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-05952">Figure S3</xref>. A total of 47 significantly changed lipids were identified when the three groups of samples were compared in pairs. These lipids included those belonging to the phospholipid, glycerolipid, fatty acyls, and sphingolipid categories [

 <xref rid="ijms-20-05952-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These 47 lipids belonged to 11 lipid classes, including cardiolipin (CL), diacylglycerol (DAG), ether-linked lysophosphatidylcholine (EtherLPC), ether-linked lysophosphatidylethanolamine (EtherLPE), ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (EtherPE), free fatty acids (FFA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and triacylglycerol (TAG) (

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among them, TAG (16/47, 34.0%), EtherPE (8/47, 17.0%), and FFA (5/47, 10.6%) were the three most perturbed lipid classes upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection.
