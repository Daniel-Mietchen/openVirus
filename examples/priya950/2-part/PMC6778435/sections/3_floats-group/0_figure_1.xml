  <title>Schematic of experimental workflow and Venn diagram in V/M, L/V, and L/M.</title>
  <p>(A) Structure of lycorine. (B) Barchart of the number of unique differentially expressed proteins in different comparative groups. The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis indicates the comparisons between each two groups. The left 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis shows the number of differentially expressed proteins. (C) Venn diagrams of DEPs in different comparative groups. Venn diagram of comparisons among V-VS-M, V-VS-L and L-VS-M. (D) Cells from each group were harvested, underwent trypsin digestion, and then labeled by tandem mass tag (TMT)-10 plex, and high-pH reverse-phase liquid chromatography was used to fractionate the pooled TMT-labeled peptide mixtures before nano liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy tandem (LC-MS/MS) analysis. All raw files were searched together using Proteome Discover 2.1. The quantification data matrix was further used for statistical trend analysis and visualization by Trelliscope. Finally, Western blot experiments were conducted for trend verifications.
