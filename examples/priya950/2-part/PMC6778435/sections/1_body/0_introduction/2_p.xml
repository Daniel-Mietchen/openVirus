<p>Virusâ€“host interactions involve a complex interplay of host cellular and viral networks. The discovery of host factors that may regulate viral replication is a promising approach. In this respect, genomic and proteomic studies have provided abundant information on host genes and proteins associated with viral infection and pathogenesis (
