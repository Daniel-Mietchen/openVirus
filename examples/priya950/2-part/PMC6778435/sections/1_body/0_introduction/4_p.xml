<p>In our previous study, the efficacy and inhibitory effects of lycorine (EC
 <sub>90</sub> = 0.52 µM) were determined in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Results showed that lycorine can completely prevent H5N1 infection as indicated by the absence of any cytopathic effect (

However, the molecular mechanism of the antiviral/inhibitor action of lycorine remains unknown. Therefore, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis to determine the effects of lycorine at the protein level in GD178-infected MDCK cells to understand its mode of action.
