<p>NPCs are composed of approximately 30 proteins known as nucleoporins. Nup93 is one of the major subcomplexes of the NPC and is responsible for the correct assembly of the NPC (

 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). Nucleocytoplasmic transport is integral to the majority of the influenza virus explicative cycle and critical for the efficient replication of influenza virus. Importantly, shuttling of specific proteins out of the nucleus is essential for the regulation of the basic functions of the host cells. The functions of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport in regulating tumor growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis have become the therapeutic target of cancer (

 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Rosebeck et al., 2016</xref>). Recent data have indicated that viral genome transport through the NPC is not always smooth sailing but can be blocked. This result may be the basis for host defense mechanisms that evoke an intrinsic antiviral response (

 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Furusawa, Yamada &amp; Kawaoka (2018)</xref> showed that viral RNA accumulates in the nucleus of Nup93-depleted cells. This observation suggests that Nup93 is involved in the nuclear export of viral RNA of the viral life cycle. A deeper understanding of how AIV RNA is exported from the nucleus via NPCs will thus help in the development of new antiviral drugs.
