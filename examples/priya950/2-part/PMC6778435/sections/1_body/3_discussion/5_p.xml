<p>Compared with other pharmacological activity mechanisms, studies on anti-cancer activity have gained deep insights (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-7">Table S3</xref>). On the basis of 258 proteins being significantly modulated and the pathways associated with those proteins, the lycorine-treated cells induced more profound responses to CAMs, EGFR-related pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway through KEGG pathway-based enrichment analysis. Shen et al. authenticated that lycorine directly interacts with EGFR and inhibits EGFR activation (

 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2015)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al. (2016)</xref> showed that lycorine inactivates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Furthermore, our present results agree with these specific signaling pathways. In addition, GO enrichment analysis showed that 15 proteins involved in nuclear division were differently expressed upon lycorine administration. Notably, Nup93 expression was decreased upon lycorine treatment.
