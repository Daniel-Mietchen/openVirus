<p>An effective drug for HPAIV treatment is still a worldwide problem (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Arai et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous study found that lycorine exhibits stronger anti-influenza activity against GD178 than oseltamivir and retains vRNP in the nucleus (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, a comprehensive description of changes in viral and cellular proteins during AIV infection and lycorine treatment based on multiplex TMT-based quantitation was carried out. The interaction of the host cellular proteins with lycorine and the factor of nucleus transport are two of our main research interests.
