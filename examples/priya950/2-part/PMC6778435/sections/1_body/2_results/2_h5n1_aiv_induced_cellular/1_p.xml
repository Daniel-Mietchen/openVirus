<p>The proteome profiles of the GD178-treated MDCK cells and mock control were compared (V/M) to determine the effects of GD178 influenza virus on MDCK cells. The V/M group contained 123 upregulated (&gt;1.2-fold) and 217 downregulated (to &lt;0.8333-fold) proteins in the V/M group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Table S2</xref>). Some of the proteins in the same network were direct interaction or through intermediate partner at the PPI level, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>. Gene ontology analyses of the proteins upregulated and downregulated by GD178 were performed to map the genes involved in different cellular processes, including biological and functional events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>). A large number of biological process GO terms were identified. The DEPs were strongly represented by “catabolism, metabolism, and physiological process”; the infected cells were also assigned to numerous molecular functions, of which “binding, catalytic and molecular transducer activities” were the main ones, and cellular components, of which “extracellular region part, organelle and membrane” were dominant. GO enrichment analysis was conducted on cell periphery (90 proteins), plasma membrane (88 proteins), intrinsic component of membrane (59 proteins) and molecular transducer activity (39 proteins) to further study the impact of DEPs in cell physiological processes and discover their internal relations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Several identified proteins have known interactions with one another and function in the same biochemical pathways. Therefore, a KEGG pathway-based enrichment analysis was applied to identify the main pathways that were potentially affected by the DEPs in the V/M group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The enriched pathways showed that the proteins were involved in pathway in cancer (path: ko05200), extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interaction (path: ko04512), focal adhesion (path: ko04510), mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (path: ko04010), and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (path: ko04151). These data indicated that there are many changes in the protein profile in response to influenza virus infection at 12 h.p.i.
