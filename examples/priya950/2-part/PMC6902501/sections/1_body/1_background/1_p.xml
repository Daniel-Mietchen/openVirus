<p id="Par13">Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a leading cause of childhood viral encephalitis. It is caused by a flavivirus spread to humans by infected 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. It is related to the viruses causing dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile fevers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The first case of JE was documented in 1871 in Japan and although it is rarely symptomatic, the case-fatality rate can be as high as 30% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can also occur in 30â€“50% of those with the encephalitis. There is no cure currently for the disease, and treatment is aimed at relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection [
