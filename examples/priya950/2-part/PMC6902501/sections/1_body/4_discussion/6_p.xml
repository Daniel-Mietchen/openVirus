<p id="Par36">Our study had several limitations: there were significant missing data in key variables like severity of disease, vaccination status, treatment outcome and testing of suspected cases, which introduce bias and limits analysis and interpretation; likewise, no significant rainfall, temperature or mosquito surveillance data – which are related to JE – were collected or analyzed. However, we plotted the trends in cases showing the months in which cases peaked. This may help in further analyzing the data to determine if weather and mosquito patterns play a role and point if monitoring the changes in climate and mosquito density and control, and predicting JE tendency using the mathematical model [
