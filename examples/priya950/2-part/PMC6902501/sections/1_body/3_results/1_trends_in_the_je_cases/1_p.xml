<p id="Par25">In Yunnan Province, a total of 4780 JE cases were reported during 2005–2017. Of these, 3077 (64%) were laboratory-confirmed while 2899 (61%) were males (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Before the two-dose JE vaccination was introduced as part of routine EPI program in Yunnan in 2007, the reported incidence of JE (per 100 000 population) increased from 0.95 in 2005 to 1.69 in 2007. With the increase in uptake and coverage of vaccination, the incidence rate of JE decreased steadily from 1.16 in 2009 to 0.17 in 2017 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Even though the seasonality remained similar across the years, peaking in the months of June through September, the number of cases decreased significantly after introduction of JE vaccine (Fig.
