<p id="Par28">Overall, most cases (58%) affected children &lt; 10 years old while adults ≥20 years old accounted for 22% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As the vaccination coverage increased from 40% in 2007 to 82% in 2017 (and incidence of JE decreased), the proportion of JE cases among children &lt; 10 years old decreased from 70% in 2005 to 32% in 2017 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). On the contrary, proportion of cases among adults ≥20 years old increased from 12% in 2005 to 48% in 2017.
