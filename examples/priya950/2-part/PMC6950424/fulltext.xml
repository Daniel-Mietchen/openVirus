Viral polymerases are essential for viral replication. The Mx1 protein has been known to interact with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2, resulting in the influence of polymerase activity and providing interspecies restriction. The equine influenza virus has evolved as an independent lineage to influenza viruses from other species. We estimated the differences in antiviral activities between human MxA (huMxA) and equine Mx1 (eqMx1) against a broad range of IAV strains. We found that huMxA has antiviral potential against IAV strains from non-human species, whereas eqMx1 could only inhibit the polymerase activity of non-equine species. Here, we demonstrated that NP is the main target of eqMx1. Subsequently, we found adaptive mutations in the NP of strains A/equine/Jilin/1/1989 (H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>) and A/chicken/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 (H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>) that confer eqMx1 resistance and sensitivity respectively. A substantial reduction in Mx1 resistance was observed for the two mutations G34S and H52N in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP. Thus, eqMx1 is an important dynamic force in IAV nucleoprotein evolution. We, therefore, suggest that the amino acids responsible for Mx1 resistance should be regarded as a robust indicator for the pandemic potential of lately evolving IAVs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MxA</kwd><kwd>equine Mx1</kwd><kwd>influenza A viruses</kwd><kwd>polymerase activity</kwd><kwd>interspecies transmission</kwd><kwd>nucleoprotein</kwd><kwd>equine influenza</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-11-01114"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs), commonly termed flu viruses, belong to the <italic>Orthmyxoviridae</italic> family and are broadly associated with acute febrile respiratory disease in many animals. Wild aquatic birds are believed to be the reservoir for these viruses [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, although IAVs were initially limited to wild waterfowl, these viruses crossed the species barrier and have been spreading to other populations, including mammalian species, and have established independent lineages [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>IAV possess a segmented and negative sense single-stranded RNA genome. The eight genomic segments of IAV encode at least 10 viral proteins. IAV derives its envelope from the host cell plasma membrane and contains three transmembrane proteins: Two surface glycoproteins termed as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), along with matrix protein 2 (M2). Two non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2, collectively termed as nuclear export protein (NEP) are associated with matrix protein 1 (M1) and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The eight vRNPs comprise of eight negative-strand RNA segments associated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) subunits (PA, PB1, and PB2) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Viral vRNPs are considered as minimal functional units required for early transcription (viral mRNA synthesis) and viral replication (vRNA synthesis) [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Myxovirus resistance proteins, including MxA and MxB in humans (named Mx1 and Mx2 in other animals), belong to dynamin-like GTPases family and are considered to be cell-autonomous host restriction factors of the innate immune system against many viral pathogens. Both the type-I and type-III interferons stimulate MxA and MxB expression during innate immune signaling [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The MxA protein is an indicator gene that is induced following an interferon action and halts a broad range of viral pathogens including DNA and RNA viruses (mainly <italic>Orthomyxoviruses</italic> such as influenza [<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], measles [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], La Crosse [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and <italic>Hantaan</italic> viruses [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). HuMxA is a potent interspecies barrier for influenza viruses from other species [<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>MxA is a dynamin-like large GTPase comprised of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain, a bundle signaling element (BSE), and a C-terminal helical stalk. MxA can form stable tetramers and oligomers, which assemble in a criss-cross manner via the stalk [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of Mx1-mediated immunity to influenza viruses is still unclear, a proposed possible mechanism suggests that, upon entry of viral infectious particles, MxA recognizes the incoming vRNPs and starts to self-assemble into rings, resulting in a higher-order oligomeric complex that blocks the vRNP function [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viral NP is known to be a target of human and mouse MxA whereas PB2, which is associated with NP in the viral nucleocapsid, may serve as an additional target [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>MxA represents a considerable barrier against the zoonotic introduction of avian influenza viruses into the human population [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, several investigations reported the antiviral properties of MxA from a human and mouse [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], porcine [<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and bovine [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] origin. The interspecies transmission would have occurred when avian-origin IAV acquired certain mutations in the NP which overcome the MxA restriction [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A few of these mutations were already found in circulating IAV strains before they were even reported to cross the species barrier [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but in many cases, the adaptational mutations occurred subsequent to infection and transmission. Indeed, recent studies indicated that IAVs which successfully established stable lineages in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the NP [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was reported that a mutated H7N7 IAV carrying human signature NP mutations was more virulent in transgenic mice than the parental virus [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The equine influenza virus underwent an independent evolution pattern that can be compared with viruses from other species [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Equine IAVs can be classified into two main subtypes: H7N7 (a prototype virus A/equine/H7N7/Prague/56 that was isolated in 1956) [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and H3N8 (a prototype virus A/equine/H3N8/Miami/63 that was isolated in 1963). Equine H7N7 viruses have not been isolated since 1990 and it is believed that they are no longer circulating in the equine population. Very little genetic exchange between the equine H3N8 virus subtype and viruses from other host species has been reported [<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which was thought to signify that horses were an endpoint until the H3N8 virus was acknowledged as being of canine and equine origin. Whether the equine Mx1 is functional and plays any role in interspecies restriction remains largely known. In this study, we investigated the interspecies restriction of eqMx1 to IAVs from different species. We found that different IAV strains were Mx1 or MxA sensitive to varying degrees. We further identified that 1) viral NP interacts with eqMx1 and determines the sensitivity to Mx1, and 2) single amino acid substitution at site 52 of the NP has a key role in determining this interaction and binding to Mx1. Our results suggest that the IAVs in the equine population have gained important mutations in the NP which enable a higher chance of eqMx1 resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-01114"><title>2.

The equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) were prepared from equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as described previously [<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, three healthy equids (horses) were used to collect the blood. The buffy coat was separated from blood samples by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Later, the buffy coat was used to isolate the PBMCs by centrifugation using a HybriMax Histopaque cushion (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (d = 1.077 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). The collected PBMCs were washed three times with PBS, resuspended, and maintained in RPMI 1640 (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented with 30% horse serum and 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA). Aliquots of these isolated PBMCs were later seeded into tissue culture flasks at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and were further incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At 24 hr post-incubation, the non-adherent cells which were found floating in the medium were discarded and the adherent monocytes were again incubated for the next 3 days in order to allow their differentiation into eMDMs. The cell culture atmosphere was maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Wild type Influenza A/equine/Jilin/1/89 (H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>) and recombinant viruses were generated using a plasmid-based reverse genetics system as previously described [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The generated wild-type virus and JL89-H52N-NP mutant virus were further propagated in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 &#x000b0;C for 72 hr, and allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged, and a hemagglutination test was performed to confirm the presence of the virus. Viruses from positive-testing samples were filtered through a 0.2 &#x000b5;m syringe filter (Millex, Merck, Ireland), and the viral titers were determined using the TCID<sub>50</sub> method of Reed and Muench [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Identification of Cross-Species Antiviral Potential of Human and Equine Mx1</title><p>MxA (or Mx1) as one of the major interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is responsible for counteracting many invading viruses, especially those belonging to <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. To identify the eqMx1&#x02032;s function in the restriction of IAVs, we first cloned the equine Mx1 from eMDMs. By using bioinformatics prediction software (<uri xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">https://www.uniprot.org</uri>, SWISS-MODEL, and Phyre2), eqMx1 was predicted to be structurally similar to huMxA [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The eMDMs were treated with equine IFN-&#x003b1;1 (100 ng/&#x003bc;L) (Kingfisher Biotech, Minnesota, USA) for 24 hr to enhance the basic expressing level of eqMx1, and a 1983-bp fragment was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1-HA vector [pcDNA3.1 (+)] (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with 2X HA tags at the C-terminal. The expressions of eqMx1 and huMxA were verified by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Polymerase assay was then used to evaluate Mx1&#x02032;s effect on the replications of IAV strains from different host species, including human IAVs H1N1 (A/Sichuan/01/2009 and A/WSN/1933), avian IAVs H7N9 (A/chicken/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013) and H5N1 (A/chicken/Scotland/1959), and equine IAVs H3N8 (A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 and A/equine/Jilin/1/1989). Mx1 or MxA resistance is defined here as the comparative activity of the viral polymerase in the presence of Mx1 divided by the activity calculated in the absence of Mx1. The results suggest that huMxA has antiviral potential against the IAV strains from non-human species i.e., avian and equine strains, whereas eqMx1 could only restrict the polymerase activity of non-equine species i.e., avian and human. The antiviral activity of eqMx1 to avian IAVs (H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> and H5N1<sub>(R)</sub>) was slightly stronger than that of huMxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). The expression of all the plasmids was determined with western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). The results suggest that huMxA has antiviral potential against the IAV strains of avian and equine but not a human origin, whereas eqMx1 could inhibit the polymerase activity of avian and human but not equine stains.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-11-01114"><title>3.2. The Viral Nucleoprotein as a Possible Target of Mx1 Action</title><p>Viral NP is a major target of MxA and the adaptive mutations of NP enable the virus to escape from MxA restriction [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Analysis of a total of 153 representative nucleotide sequences of viral NPs from IAVs with different host specificities (including avian, swine, canine, equine, and human) showed that the NP proteins generate diverse lineages in a host-species-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Considering the diversity of Mx1 proteins and the different activities on viruses from different hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>), we hypothesized that the NP from equine viruses may have evolved a specific signature of adaptation to counter eqMx1, and this &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; of the equine virus may not be able to overcome the restriction of human MxA.</p><p>To confirm this idea, we used a mini-replicon system-based approach to identify the target sequence of NP for eqMx1. We swapped expression plasmids between the different strains H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> and H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> to determine whether an Mx1-sensitive mini-replicon system could be converted into a more resistant system and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The replacement PB1, PB2, or PA from H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> into H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>, did not change the polymerase activity of the re-assorted complex to a large extent. However, the replacement by H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP resulted in a complete reversal of the polymerase activity of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> equivalent to the actual H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> polymerase system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Thus, our approach identified the IAV NP as a possible target of eqMx1.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-11-01114"><title>3.3. Identification of Residues in NP of the H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> Influenza A Virus Responsible for Resistance to eqMx1</title><p>Next, we evaluated the key residues of NP from the H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> IAV that confer eqMx1 resistance in the context of the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> polymerase. The sequence analysis comparing the NPs of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> and H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> of avian origin showed 16 amino acids (AAs) variations between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Based on the sequence alignment obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, two different chimeras were constructed by fusing two NP proteins from H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> and H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) and tested their polymerase activity against eqMx1. An artificial chimera N-JL89xH7N9-C comprised of the N-terminal 200 AAs of the H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP and the C-terminal domain (AAs position 201 to 480) of the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, behaved like the full-length H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP, indicating that the eight different AAs at the C-terminal of the NP protein did not contribute to the Mx1 resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). However, a chimeric construct N-H7N9xJL89-C with the replacement of the N-terminal of H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-NP by 200 AAs from H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> made it more sensitive towards inhibition by eqMx1 in contrast to the actual H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-NP. Conversely, the opposite mutant N-JL89xH7N9-C that had an insertion of 200 AAs from H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> into the N-terminal of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP lost its activity as compared to the wild type H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP, indicating that the N-terminal played a key role in the determination of resistance or sensitivity towards eqMx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p><p>Out of eight substitutions of NP, two positions V85A and T197I were not selected for mutations as when the sequence of two strains of H3N8, H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>, and H3N8<sub>XJ07</sub>, were compared, the H3N8<sub>XJ07</sub> (GenBank accession no. EU794560.1) contained the same amino acids at these positions as that of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>, suggesting that these sites were not responsible for eqMx1 restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The other six residues were selected for single point mutations in both H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP and H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. In H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP, the mutants were G34S, G50S, H52N, K77R, M105V, and V186I. We found mutations G34S (albeit not statistically significant) and H52N altered the restriction of eqMx1, whereas the mutants G50S, K77R, M105V, and V186I remained completely unaffected by eqMx1. The effect of these point mutations was also confirmed by creating reverse mutations in the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. As expected, the reverse effect was observed for the mutation at site 52 of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP (N52H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, interestingly, mutating S34G in the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP had no distinguishable alteration in the activity towards eqMx1, rather a markedly less resistant phenotype was observed and the mutant behaved like a wild type H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. Similarly, mutations at S50G, R77K, V105M, and I186V of H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP showed no effect and mutation I186V showed more inhibition towards eqMx1. These results indicate that position 52 of equine IAV is important for NP adaptation to eqMx1.</p><p>In order to confirm the importance of site 52, common to both H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP and H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, the specific mutations were introduced into H5N1 NP and tested for its influence on eqMx1 resistance in the H5N1 polymerase reconstitution assay. H5N1 was chosen because it is another avian IAV that is blocked by eqMx1. H5N1 contains Tyrosine (Y) at position 52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). As expected, point mutations in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP (H52Y) and H5N1 NP (Y52H) showed a reverse effect against eqMx1, confirming the importance of position 52. In order to determine the effect of the two identified sites 34 and 52 in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> in resistance against huMxA, the polymerase activity of three H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP mutants G34S, H52N, and H52Y, as well as two H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP mutants S34G and N52H, were measured. The mutants G34S, H52N, and H52Y showed less pronounced polymerase activity than the wild type H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP but still could not escape the antiviral activity of huMxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). Similarly, reverse mutations in H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, S34G, and N52H did not alter the sensitivity to huMxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>E). A decent expression level of all the NP mutant plasmids was detected using western blotting. Together, these results suggested that the amino acids at position 52 of NPs from different IAVs conferred Mx1 resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-11-01114"><title>3.4. The Amino Acid Position 52 of NP Affects its Interaction with eqMx1</title><p>To further confirm the interaction between NP and eqMx1 and the importance of site 52 of the NP in determining this interaction, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment using different NP proteins and eqMx1 protein. Flag-tagged eqMx1 was co-expressed in HEK293T cells, individually or in combination with expression plasmids of PB1, PB2, PA, viral reporter RNA (FF-luc), and NP from either H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> and mutants (H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-G34S-NP, H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP) or H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> and its mutants (H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-S34G-NP, H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-N52H-NP), to mimic the viral vRNPs. Twenty four hours post-transfection, total cell lysates were harvested from transfected cells, and western blotting was performed after FLAG-IP using Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, M8823). Results showed that when the eqMx1 was co-expressed with either H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-NP or H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-G34S-NP, no interaction was identified. Expectedly, the mutant H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP showed a strong interaction with eqMx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). In contrast, Flag-tagged eqMx1 was co-immunoprecipitated with NP from H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> and its mutant &#x02013;S34G when they were co-expressed. This interaction was lost when site 52 mutated in H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> to&#x02013;N52H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). This finding gave evidence to the hypothesis that position 52 could be the most important site for interaction between eqMx1 and NP of IAV.</p><p>To confirm this result, the reverse Co-IP experiment with Anti-NP magnetic beads (MCE protein A/G magnetic beads and NP antibody from our lab) was done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D) and the results confirmed the results obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B. It has been previously reported that interaction between PB2 and NP is crucial for the establishment of an enzymatically-active influenza RdRp in RNP complexes [<xref rid="B42-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and that enzymatically-active Mx1 blocks viral replication by blocking the PB2-NP interface, signifying its direct effect on the vRNP complex. Therefore, we analyzed the PB2-NP interaction in the IP complexes in the presence of eqMx1. No PB2 was found co-immunoprecipitated with H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP, H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP, and H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>-S34G. On the other hand, in the complex where there was no interaction between eqMx1 and NP (H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>,-G34S and H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub>,-N52H) PB2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the said variants of NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D; lanes 4 to 6). This result supported the model in which eqMx1 interacts with the influenza RNP and affects its assembly by disturbing the PB2-NP interaction [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Together these results reveal a fundamental function of site 52 in altering IAV polymerase activity in the presence of eqMx1, as well as its interaction with eqMx1.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-11-01114"><title>3.5. A Single Mutation at Position 52 in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP Allows the Virus to escape from eqMx1 Restriction</title><p>To further evaluate the importance of 52H of the NP protein in the resistance of eqMx1, we rescued viruses H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> and H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> with an H52N substitution in the NP using a reverse genetic system as previously described [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Viral titers were calculated by means of the Reed and Muench methodology [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to determine relative mRNA expression levels. We found that the wild type H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> had almost the same number of copies in the presence or absence of eqMx1 during replication, whereas the number of copies of mutant virus (JL89-H52N) were drastically reduced in the cells expressing eqMx1, indicating that this mutant virus strain could be blocked by eqMx1, in contrast to the wild type H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f007">Figure 7</xref>A).

Discussion</title><p>The interferon-induced huMxA protein signifies a key interspecies barrier for a large number of zoonotic viruses, including IAVs [<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Equine Mx1, encoded by a gene located on chromosome 26, is a homolog of MxA from humans or other hosts and has been poorly studied [<xref rid="B43-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A recent study on the comparison of antiviral activity of Mx1 from different host species includes the corresponding gene from equines and suggests that its antiviral activity against the influenza virus was similar to Mx1 from water buffalo [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here we firstly compared the antiviral potentials of Mx1 proteins from human and equine hosts and identified the potential eqMx1 to inhibit IAV from different species in a species-specific manner. We further identified that NP is responsible for interaction with eqMx1 and confers resistance to the restriction of eqMx1. A single amino acid mutation H52N of NP alters this resistance and interaction to eqMx1 and changed the viral replication ability when eqMx1 was present.</p><p>Equine H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> is predicted to be evolved from an avian origin and equine IAV epizootics has a relation to IAV epidemics in humans and canines [<xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The equine IAV H3N8 strain has been seen to affect dog populations, indicating its efficiency in switching stable hosts and to evolve under antigenic drift [<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The H3N8 virus has also been isolated from a swine population in China, but this has not been confirmed as a stable host switch, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses of eight gene segments showed that the two swine isolates were of equine origin and most closely related to European equine H3N8 influenza viruses from the early 1990s [<xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. All this evidence is of rare cases and the equine IAVs keep an independent evolutionary lineage compared with IAVs from other species.</p><p>NP is known as a key module of the vRNP complex and is indispensable for virus replication. NP is the most conserved protein within IAV viral proteins and was identified as a determinant of viral sensitivity towards Mx1 proteins in previously conducted studies, for example, site mutations at 48Q, 98K, and 99K in A/swine/Belzig/2/2001 are sufficient to provide resistance to huMxA [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By using polymerase reconstitution assays, we found two positions in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP, G34, and H52, which could be a possible target for H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> IAV. In our study, we showed that in the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> NP the mutation N52H enabled it to escape the eqMx1 restriction. Interestingly, the S34G substitution in the H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> did not reverse the activity against eqMx1. Substituting tyrosine (Y) at position 52 with histidine (H) in H5N1 altered the polymerase activity of H5N1 drastically and eqMx1 almost lost its restriction affect towards H5N1-Y52H. A similar substitution in H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP (H3N8<sub>JL89</sub>-H52Y) produced a reverse effect and eqMx1 inhibited the polymerase activity, confirming the importance of this site. We concluded that site 52 is more universal for eqMx1 as it was found to be of equal importance in both IAV strains, whereas site 34 was found to alter the polymerase activity only of H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> against eqMx1. The sequence alignment of unique sequences of H7N9 and H3N8 predicted that position 52 was highly conserved in both strains, whereas site 34 was more prone to mutations in both strains, reiterating the importance of site 52. None of the mutations at sites 34 and 52 in either H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> or H7N9<sub>ZJ13</sub> had a significant effect against huMxA but showed a slight alternation of the restriction instead. These sites may be important in escaping the huMxA antiviral activity when in combination with other as yet unidentified sites.</p><p>The NP and PB2 have been found to have a major role in blocking the antiviral effect of murine Mx1 [<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As previously reported, the interaction between PB2 and PB1 is not influenced by the presence of the Mx1 protein. Mx1 inhibits the interaction between PB2 and NP, probably leaving the ternary RdRp complex intact, suggesting that Mx1 inhibits the interaction between the RdRp and the NP protein in vRNP complexes [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results helped to explain how eqMx1 could block viral replication by interacting with viral NPs, thus blocking NP-PB2 interaction and explaining how a single mutation could affect the binding of two proteins.</p><p>The interaction of Mx1 with PB2 and NP could be direct or indirect. Other cellular proteins might be involved in this interaction and could act as a bridge between Mx1 and the vRNP complex. Only a few proteins have been reported to interact with the Mx1 protein, and these interacting proteins are potential candidates as bridging factors [<xref rid="B48-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Multiple cellular proteins interact with PB2 and/or NP and might fulfill this function. The aforementioned experiments clearly demonstrate an interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP when all components of the minireplicon system are present, but Verhelst, Judith, et al. have reported that this interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP could occur in the presence or absence of other viral proteins. The authors also reported that interactions between Mx1 and PB2 or NP on the other cannot be detected in the absence of NEM [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We also observed a similar result during the IP experiment (data not shown). NEM might preserve the conformation of viral proteins or a cellular factor that mediates the interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP. It is also possible that the interactions are too transient or too weak, and inhibiting the GTPase activity of Mx1 by using NEM could stabilize these interactions.</p><p>The HEK293T cell line was selected as the first choice for the transfection of plasmids throughout the study except for virus infection experiments because the HEK293T cells are well used in previous studies [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Since influenza viruses are the pathogens that cause major respiratory tract infections, the lung epithelial cells might be used for in vitro analysis of host-virus interaction at the cellular level. We tried to transfect human lung epithelial A549 cells but found the transfection efficiency was very low (only about 10&#x02013;20%). Additionally, when compared with the endogenous MxA in both cell lines using MX1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Protientech, Rosemont, Illinois, USA), A549 cells did express notable levels of endogenous human MxA that might interfere with our results (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01114">Figure S1</xref>). A validation of interaction between eqMx1 and viral NP, and the site-specific antagonism of different viral strains, in lung epithelial cells of equine origin might be a future perspective in order to clarify the mode of action of equine Mx1 in vitro.</p><p>To summarize, like its other homologs, eqMx1 could be an efficient barrier against the transmission of IAVs into the equine population. The anti-influenza activities of eqMx1 were species-specific and the NP was the major target of eqMx1. The key sites on H3N8<sub>JL89</sub> NP determined the sensitivity and resistance to eqMx1. Further extensive studies are required to demonstrate the exact molecular mechanism involved in the structure-specific interaction and evolution, which may deliver new aims for antiviral intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Hu Zhe for providing the plasmids and advice.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary relationships among different viral strains was inferred using the maximum likelihood strategy. The analysis was conducted using the JTT matrix-based model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (2519.6632) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. The initial tree(s) for the heuristic search was obtained automatically by applying neighborhood Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model and then selecting the topology with the superior log-likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model the evolutionary rate differences among sites [five categories (+G, parameter = 0.4056)]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths representing the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 153 sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset comprised a total of 304 positions.
