<p>Equine H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> is predicted to be evolved from an avian origin and equine IAV epizootics has a relation to IAV epidemics in humans and canines [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The equine IAV H3N8 strain has been seen to affect dog populations, indicating its efficiency in switching stable hosts and to evolve under antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The H3N8 virus has also been isolated from a swine population in China, but this has not been confirmed as a stable host switch, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses of eight gene segments showed that the two swine isolates were of equine origin and most closely related to European equine H3N8 influenza viruses from the early 1990s [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. All this evidence is of rare cases and the equine IAVs keep an independent evolutionary lineage compared with IAVs from other species.
