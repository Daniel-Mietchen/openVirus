<p>The interaction of Mx1 with PB2 and NP could be direct or indirect. Other cellular proteins might be involved in this interaction and could act as a bridge between Mx1 and the vRNP complex. Only a few proteins have been reported to interact with the Mx1 protein, and these interacting proteins are potential candidates as bridging factors [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Multiple cellular proteins interact with PB2 and/or NP and might fulfill this function. The aforementioned experiments clearly demonstrate an interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP when all components of the minireplicon system are present, but Verhelst, Judith, et al. have reported that this interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP could occur in the presence or absence of other viral proteins. The authors also reported that interactions between Mx1 and PB2 or NP on the other cannot be detected in the absence of NEM [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We also observed a similar result during the IP experiment (data not shown). NEM might preserve the conformation of viral proteins or a cellular factor that mediates the interaction between Mx1 and PB2 or NP. It is also possible that the interactions are too transient or too weak, and inhibiting the GTPase activity of Mx1 by using NEM could stabilize these interactions.
