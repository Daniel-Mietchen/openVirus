<p>To summarize, like its other homologs, eqMx1 could be an efficient barrier against the transmission of IAVs into the equine population. The anti-influenza activities of eqMx1 were species-specific and the NP was the major target of eqMx1. The key sites on H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP determined the sensitivity and resistance to eqMx1. Further extensive studies are required to demonstrate the exact molecular mechanism involved in the structure-specific interaction and evolution, which may deliver new aims for antiviral intervention.
