<p>The interferon-induced huMxA protein signifies a key interspecies barrier for a large number of zoonotic viruses, including IAVs [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A recent study on the comparison of antiviral activity of Mx1 from different host species includes the corresponding gene from equines and suggests that its antiviral activity against the influenza virus was similar to Mx1 from water buffalo [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here we firstly compared the antiviral potentials of Mx1 proteins from human and equine hosts and identified the potential eqMx1 to inhibit IAV from different species in a species-specific manner. We further identified that NP is responsible for interaction with eqMx1 and confers resistance to the restriction of eqMx1. A single amino acid mutation H52N of NP alters this resistance and interaction to eqMx1 and changed the viral replication ability when eqMx1 was present.
