<p>IAV possess a segmented and negative sense single-stranded RNA genome. The eight genomic segments of IAV encode at least 10 viral proteins. IAV derives its envelope from the host cell plasma membrane and contains three transmembrane proteins: Two surface glycoproteins termed as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), along with matrix protein 2 (M2). Two non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2, collectively termed as nuclear export protein (NEP) are associated with matrix protein 1 (M1) and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The eight vRNPs comprise of eight negative-strand RNA segments associated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) subunits (PA, PB1, and PB2) [
