<p>The equine influenza virus underwent an independent evolution pattern that can be compared with viruses from other species [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Equine IAVs can be classified into two main subtypes: H7N7 (a prototype virus A/equine/H7N7/Prague/56 that was isolated in 1956) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and H3N8 (a prototype virus A/equine/H3N8/Miami/63 that was isolated in 1963). Equine H7N7 viruses have not been isolated since 1990 and it is believed that they are no longer circulating in the equine population. Very little genetic exchange between the equine H3N8 virus subtype and viruses from other host species has been reported [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which was thought to signify that horses were an endpoint until the H3N8 virus was acknowledged as being of canine and equine origin. Whether the equine Mx1 is functional and plays any role in interspecies restriction remains largely known. In this study, we investigated the interspecies restriction of eqMx1 to IAVs from different species. We found that different IAV strains were Mx1 or MxA sensitive to varying degrees. We further identified that 1) viral NP interacts with eqMx1 and determines the sensitivity to Mx1, and 2) single amino acid substitution at site 52 of the NP has a key role in determining this interaction and binding to Mx1. Our results suggest that the IAVs in the equine population have gained important mutations in the NP which enable a higher chance of eqMx1 resistance.
