<p>MxA (or Mx1) as one of the major interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is responsible for counteracting many invading viruses, especially those belonging to 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. To identify the eqMx1′s function in the restriction of IAVs, we first cloned the equine Mx1 from eMDMs. By using bioinformatics prediction software (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.uniprot.org</uri>, SWISS-MODEL, and Phyre2), eqMx1 was predicted to be structurally similar to huMxA [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The eMDMs were treated with equine IFN-α1 (100 ng/μL) (Kingfisher Biotech, Minnesota, USA) for 24 hr to enhance the basic expressing level of eqMx1, and a 1983-bp fragment was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1-HA vector [pcDNA3.1 (+)] (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with 2X HA tags at the C-terminal. The expressions of eqMx1 and huMxA were verified by western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Polymerase assay was then used to evaluate Mx1′s effect on the replications of IAV strains from different host species, including human IAVs H1N1 (A/Sichuan/01/2009 and A/WSN/1933), avian IAVs H7N9 (A/chicken/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013) and H5N1 (A/chicken/Scotland/1959), and equine IAVs H3N8 (A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 and A/equine/Jilin/1/1989). Mx1 or MxA resistance is defined here as the comparative activity of the viral polymerase in the presence of Mx1 divided by the activity calculated in the absence of Mx1. The results suggest that huMxA has antiviral potential against the IAV strains from non-human species i.e., avian and equine strains, whereas eqMx1 could only restrict the polymerase activity of non-equine species i.e., avian and human. The antiviral activity of eqMx1 to avian IAVs (H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> and H5N1
 <sub>(R)</sub>) was slightly stronger than that of huMxA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). The expression of all the plasmids was determined with western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). The results suggest that huMxA has antiviral potential against the IAV strains of avian and equine but not a human origin, whereas eqMx1 could inhibit the polymerase activity of avian and human but not equine stains.
