<p>To confirm this idea, we used a mini-replicon system-based approach to identify the target sequence of NP for eqMx1. We swapped expression plasmids between the different strains H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> and H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> to determine whether an Mx1-sensitive mini-replicon system could be converted into a more resistant system and vice versa (

 <sub>JL89</sub> into H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>, did not change the polymerase activity of the re-assorted complex to a large extent. However, the replacement by H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP resulted in a complete reversal of the polymerase activity of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> equivalent to the actual H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> polymerase system (
