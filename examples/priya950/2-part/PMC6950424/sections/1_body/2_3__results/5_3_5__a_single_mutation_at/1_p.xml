<p>To further evaluate the importance of 52H of the NP protein in the resistance of eqMx1, we rescued viruses H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> and H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> with an H52N substitution in the NP using a reverse genetic system as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Viral titers were calculated by means of the Reed and Muench methodology [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. MDCK cells expressing HA-tagged pcDNA3.1-eqMx1 or HA-tagged pcDNA3.1 empty control vector, were infected at an MOI of 0.001 for a duration of 1 hr with these harvested viruses and the supernatants were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr post-infection, and RNA was extracted. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to determine relative mRNA expression levels. We found that the wild type H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> had almost the same number of copies in the presence or absence of eqMx1 during replication, whereas the number of copies of mutant virus (JL89-H52N) were drastically reduced in the cells expressing eqMx1, indicating that this mutant virus strain could be blocked by eqMx1, in contrast to the wild type H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). Additionally, viral titers were measured using TCID
 <sub>50</sub> /mL and the results were in accordance with the qPCR analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). From these data we can conclude that a single position in the NP of the H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> virus (position 52) is essential for viral replication and to allow the virus to escape the restriction effect of eqMx1.
