<p>In order to confirm the importance of site 52, common to both H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP and H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, the specific mutations were introduced into H5N1 NP and tested for its influence on eqMx1 resistance in the H5N1 polymerase reconstitution assay. H5N1 was chosen because it is another avian IAV that is blocked by eqMx1. H5N1 contains Tyrosine (Y) at position 52 (

 <sub>JL89</sub> NP (H52Y) and H5N1 NP (Y52H) showed a reverse effect against eqMx1, confirming the importance of position 52. In order to determine the effect of the two identified sites 34 and 52 in H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> in resistance against huMxA, the polymerase activity of three H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP mutants G34S, H52N, and H52Y, as well as two H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP mutants S34G and N52H, were measured. The mutants G34S, H52N, and H52Y showed less pronounced polymerase activity than the wild type H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP but still could not escape the antiviral activity of huMxA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). Similarly, reverse mutations in H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, S34G, and N52H did not alter the sensitivity to huMxA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>E). A decent expression level of all the NP mutant plasmids was detected using western blotting. Together, these results suggested that the amino acids at position 52 of NPs from different IAVs conferred Mx1 resistance.
