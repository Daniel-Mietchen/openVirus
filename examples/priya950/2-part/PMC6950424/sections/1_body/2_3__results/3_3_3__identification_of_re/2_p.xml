<p>Out of eight substitutions of NP, two positions V85A and T197I were not selected for mutations as when the sequence of two strains of H3N8, H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>, and H3N8
 <sub>XJ07</sub>, were compared, the H3N8
 <sub>XJ07</sub> (GenBank accession no. EU794560.1) contained the same amino acids at these positions as that of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>, suggesting that these sites were not responsible for eqMx1 restriction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The other six residues were selected for single point mutations in both H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP and H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. In H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP, the mutants were G34S, G50S, H52N, K77R, M105V, and V186I. We found mutations G34S (albeit not statistically significant) and H52N altered the restriction of eqMx1, whereas the mutants G50S, K77R, M105V, and V186I remained completely unaffected by eqMx1. The effect of these point mutations was also confirmed by creating reverse mutations in the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. As expected, the reverse effect was observed for the mutation at site 52 of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP (N52H) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, interestingly, mutating S34G in the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP had no distinguishable alteration in the activity towards eqMx1, rather a markedly less resistant phenotype was observed and the mutant behaved like a wild type H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP. Similarly, mutations at S50G, R77K, V105M, and I186V of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP showed no effect and mutation I186V showed more inhibition towards eqMx1. These results indicate that position 52 of equine IAV is important for NP adaptation to eqMx1.
