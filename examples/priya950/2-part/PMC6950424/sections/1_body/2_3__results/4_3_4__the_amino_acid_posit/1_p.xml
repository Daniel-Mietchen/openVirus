<p>To further confirm the interaction between NP and eqMx1 and the importance of site 52 of the NP in determining this interaction, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment using different NP proteins and eqMx1 protein. Flag-tagged eqMx1 was co-expressed in HEK293T cells, individually or in combination with expression plasmids of PB1, PB2, PA, viral reporter RNA (FF-luc), and NP from either H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> and mutants (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-G34S-NP, H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP) or H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> and its mutants (H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-S34G-NP, H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-N52H-NP), to mimic the viral vRNPs. Twenty four hours post-transfection, total cell lysates were harvested from transfected cells, and western blotting was performed after FLAG-IP using Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, M8823). Results showed that when the eqMx1 was co-expressed with either H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-NP or H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-G34S-NP, no interaction was identified. Expectedly, the mutant H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP showed a strong interaction with eqMx1 (

 <sub>ZJ13</sub> and its mutant –S34G when they were co-expressed. This interaction was lost when site 52 mutated in H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> to–N52H (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). This finding gave evidence to the hypothesis that position 52 could be the most important site for interaction between eqMx1 and NP of IAV.
