<p>To confirm this result, the reverse Co-IP experiment with Anti-NP magnetic beads (MCE protein A/G magnetic beads and NP antibody from our lab) was done (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B. It has been previously reported that interaction between PB2 and NP is crucial for the establishment of an enzymatically-active influenza RdRp in RNP complexes [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and that enzymatically-active Mx1 blocks viral replication by blocking the PB2-NP interface, signifying its direct effect on the vRNP complex. Therefore, we analyzed the PB2-NP interaction in the IP complexes in the presence of eqMx1. No PB2 was found co-immunoprecipitated with H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-H52N-NP, H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP, and H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-S34G. On the other hand, in the complex where there was no interaction between eqMx1 and NP (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>,-G34S and H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>,-N52H) PB2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the said variants of NP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D; lanes 4 to 6). This result supported the model in which eqMx1 interacts with the influenza RNP and affects its assembly by disturbing the PB2-NP interaction [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Together these results reveal a fundamental function of site 52 in altering IAV polymerase activity in the presence of eqMx1, as well as its interaction with eqMx1.
