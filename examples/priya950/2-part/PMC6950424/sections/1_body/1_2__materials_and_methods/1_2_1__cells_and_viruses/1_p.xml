<p>Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium (DMEM) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent, Canada) and 1% antibiotics (100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin; ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) were prepared from equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, three healthy equids (horses) were used to collect the blood. The buffy coat was separated from blood samples by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Later, the buffy coat was used to isolate the PBMCs by centrifugation using a HybriMax Histopaque cushion (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (d = 1.077 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>). The collected PBMCs were washed three times with PBS, resuspended, and maintained in RPMI 1640 (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented with 30% horse serum and 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA). Aliquots of these isolated PBMCs were later seeded into tissue culture flasks at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and were further incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. At 24 hr post-incubation, the non-adherent cells which were found floating in the medium were discarded and the adherent monocytes were again incubated for the next 3 days in order to allow their differentiation into eMDMs. The cell culture atmosphere was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
