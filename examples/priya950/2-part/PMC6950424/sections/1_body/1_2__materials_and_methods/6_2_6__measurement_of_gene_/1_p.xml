<p>Total RNA from the collected supernatants was extracted using the RNeasy plus Minikit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherland) and were subjected to a one-step real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis using the AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR reagents (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. FAM-labeled probes (EIV-Tq-P) 5′-TCAGGCCCCCTCAAAGCCGA-TAMRA and specific primers targeting the M-gene of IAV, 5′-AGATGAGYCTTCTAACCGAGGTCG-3′ (EIV-Tq-forward) and 5′-TGCAAANACATCYTCAAGTCTCTG-3′ (EIV-Tq-reverse) were used for the amplification of RNA, and relative mRNA expression levels were determined using double-standard curve methods.</p>
