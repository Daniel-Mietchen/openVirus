<p>In order to determine polymerase activity, we transfected the minigenome reporter (enclosing a firefly luciferase gene linked with non-coding regions of the HA gene of influenza containing human polI as the promoter and a mice terminator sequence) with NP and viral polymerase expression plasmids. We generated the chimeric mutants of the NP gene by overlapping PCR and verified it by the sequencing technique. To predict the viral polymerase activity due to mutations in the NP, a previously described protocol was followed [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with expression plasmids of all viral polymerases i.e., PB1 (40 ng), PB2 (40 ng), PA (20 ng), and NP (80 ng), together with 40 ng of minigenome reporter (FF-Luc) and 10 ng of

Cells were maintained at 37 °C. To perform the cell lysis, we employed 200 μL of 1X reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, USA) after 24 hr of transfection. To measure the luciferase activities of

The levels of polymerase protein expression were detected using western blotting, with specific mouse monoclonal antibodies for NP and anti-HA tag antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for eqMx1-HA and huMxA-HA proteins. In the present study, all experimentation was performed independently at least thrice. The calculated results demonstrate mean ± SEM within one experiment.
