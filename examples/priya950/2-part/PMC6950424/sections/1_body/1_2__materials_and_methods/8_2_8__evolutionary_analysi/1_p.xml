<p>In order to determine the evolutionary relationships between NPs from IAV strains from different hosts, a total of 153 representative nucleotide sequences of viral nucleoproteins from IAVs with different host specificities (including avian, porcine, canine, equine, and human) were retrieved from the GenBank and aligned manually using Bioedit alignment tools. The evolutionary history was inferred by the maximum likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model.</p>
