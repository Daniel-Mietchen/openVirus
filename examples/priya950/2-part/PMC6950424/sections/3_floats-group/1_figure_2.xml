  <p>Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the relationship of influenza A virus NP from distinct hosts. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary relationships among different viral strains was inferred using the maximum likelihood strategy. The analysis was conducted using the JTT matrix-based model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (2519.6632) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. The initial tree(s) for the heuristic search was obtained automatically by applying neighborhood Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model and then selecting the topology with the superior log-likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model the evolutionary rate differences among sites [five categories (+G, parameter = 0.4056)]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths representing the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 153 sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset comprised a total of 304 positions. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 software [
