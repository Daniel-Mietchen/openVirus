<p>We examined the sensitivity of 23 IRDTs commercially available in the 2018–2019 influenza season (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All of the IRDTs tested employed an immunochromatographic method to detect seasonal influenza A and B viruses. Therefore, the sensitivity of the IRDTs was primarily determined by the binding kinetics of the monoclonal antibody used in the IRDT. RapidTesta FLU⋅NEXT uses a rat monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus, whereas the others use mouse monoclonal antibodies against the NPs of influenza A and B viruses. Because the epitopes of these monoclonal antibodies on the NP of influenza A virus are conserved among influenza A viruses, 19 of the 23 IRDTs (the exceptions being QuickNavi Flu, QuickNavi-Flu + RSV, Nanotrap Flu A⋅B, and QuickNavi Flu2) claim to be able to detect several animal influenza A viruses, including subtypes H1 through H16, in their appendixes. Although amino acid substitutions in NP are found less frequently than those in HA, NP mutations do occur in seasonal influenza viruses and may affect the sensitivity of IRDTs.
