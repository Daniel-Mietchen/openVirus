<p>The sensitivity of the analyzer-based IRDTs was similar to or better than that of the IRDTs assessed by the human eye. In the case of seasonal viruses, virus titers usually reach 10

Therefore, all of the IRDTs tested here would, in theory, detect these influenza viruses in patients during this period. However, to detect influenza viruses within 24 h of onset, more sensitive IRDTs are required. Sofia Influenza A + B FIA, Spotchem FLORA FluAB, and Fuji dri-chem immuno AG cartridge FluAB may be suitable for such use because of their higher sensitivity compared with the others. We also need novel rapid detection kits that can detect NA- or PA-inhibitor resistant viruses to help physicians select the most appropriate antiviral therapy. Sofia Influenza A + B FIA detected the H5 and H7 viruses at a high sensitivity, identical to that for seasonal influenza A and B viruses; the detection limit was 10
