<p>The composition of the lysis buffer, the proportion of sample in the analyte, and the method used to visualize the result also affect the sensitivity. The proportion of sample in the analyte is heavily determined by the format of the IRDT; that is, whether it has the test strip format or the well format (Format column, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The entire test sample can be utilized with the test strip format, whereas the input ratio of the test samples is limited to between 6.7 and 30% for the well format (Input ratio column, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The method for visualization of the results also differs among the 23 IRDTs: Espline Influenza A&amp;B-N uses alkaline phosphatase and its substrate, Spotchem FLORA FluAB uses a fluorescent latex microsphere, Sofia Influenza A + B FIA uses europium, and the others use gold-, gold plus silver-, gold plus platinum-, or latex-non-fluorescent microspheres for visualization of the immune-complex. The visualized results are assessed by a specific analyzer for QuickNavi Flu2, BD Veritor System Flu, Fuji dri-chem immuno AG cartridge FluAB, Spotchem FLORA FluAB, and Sofia Influenza A + B FIA; the human eye is used for the others (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All 23 IRDTs requires 1â€“15 min to complete each test.
