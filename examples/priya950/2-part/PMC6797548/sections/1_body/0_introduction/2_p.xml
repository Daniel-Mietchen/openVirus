<p>For antiviral drugs against influenza to be effective, it is important to identify patients infected with influenza virus as soon as possible. In particular, NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) should be administered within 2 days of symptom onset for optimal efficacy (

Although basic virologic approaches such as virus isolation and RT-qPCR have been used, they are not suitable in the clinical setting because of time constraints and the need for specialized equipment and technique. Influenza rapid diagnostic tests (IRDTs) are now widely used even at the local, small clinic level in Japan. However, conventional IRDTs that are read by the human eye fail to detect influenza viruses at early timepoints after onset (

Here, we examined the sensitivity of 23 IRDTs (5 IRDTs that use analyzers and 18 that are assessed by the human eye) that are available in 2018â€“2019 to detect various isolates of seasonal influenza A and B viruses as well as human and avian H5Nx and H7N9 viruses, which possess the potential to transmit to humans (
