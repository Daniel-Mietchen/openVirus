<p>The influenza viruses listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> were propagated in MDCK cells, AX4 cells, which express higher amounts of 6-linked sialic acids compared with MDCK cells on their cell surface via exogenous expression of human β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal) (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Virus titers (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined by using MDCK cells. Test samples (100 μl) were adjusted to 10

 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> with Eagle’s minimal essential medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin.
