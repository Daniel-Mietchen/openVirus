<p>Development of sample preparation methodologies, highly sensitive mass analyzers as well as tailored bioinformatics processing pipelines (comprehensively summarized in [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) have caused MS to flourish in the last years. MS is no longer a niche technology reserved to a limited number of experts but is now available for a wide range of scientists interested in biological sciences. This, however, also led to generation of datasets that are exceedingly difficult to compare and to interpret due to the complexity of the underlying analysis and the wealth of data that is generated. Here we review current literature on proteomic approaches that were employed to study flaviviruses.
