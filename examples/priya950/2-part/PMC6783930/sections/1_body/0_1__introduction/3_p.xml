<p>Technical advancement in mass-spectrometry analysis and the availability of replication competent epitope-tagged viruses and individual viral proteins have prompted several studies to investigate persistent modulation of protein abundances, post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions on a global scale and with unprecedented sensitivity and quantitation [

Given its unique properties and the urgent need to further understand ZIKV biology, a number of laboratories started to use large-scale approaches to study how this pathogen interacts with cellular proteins. Here we review current approaches, in particular proteomic-based datasets, which have been used to identify ZIKV–host interactions.
