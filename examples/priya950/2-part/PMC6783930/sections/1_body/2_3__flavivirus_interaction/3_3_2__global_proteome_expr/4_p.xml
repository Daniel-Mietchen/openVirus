<p>A unifying theme crystallizing from proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of ZIKA virus infected neuronal cells is that ZIKV infection has a profound effect on expression of proteins involved in neurogenesis or on proteins that are markers of neuronal differentiation. At this stage it is not clear whether this effect is limited to ZIKA virus or whether other viruses elicit similar effects in a neuronal background. Along these lines would be important to test whether neuropathic flaviviruses share certain binding patterns that may be etiologically linked to their pathology. Similarly, it would be of great interest to investigate the differential proteomes of diverse flaviviruses from primary biopsies of infected patients.</p>
