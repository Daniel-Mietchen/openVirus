<p>In addition to proteins recruited by several flavivirus capsids, the ZIKV capsid is the only one reported to specifically associate with cellular factors that are involved in neuronal development or neurological disorders [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These proteins include neuroguidin (NGDN), an eIF4E-interacting protein mediating CPEB-mediated translation of essential genes in early development and neuronal synaptic plasticity. Further ZIKA capsid interactors are several members of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is important for proper splicing, neuronal migration and differentiation. It would be interesting to assess binding specificity of other flavivirus capsid proteins in a similar neuronal background and investigate further their contribution to viral replication or pathogenesis. Such studies could pinpoint novel viral pathogenesis determinants and assist in the identification of druggable binding surfaces required for specific proteinâ€“protein interactions.
