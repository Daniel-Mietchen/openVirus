<p>Among the other novel capsid interactors, additional work by the Ott and the Ramage groups identified the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway and the exon-junction complex (EJC) as targets of the WNV, DENV and ZIKA virus capsids [

While the antiviral activity of individual members of these complexes appears moderate in knock-down studies, further experimental evidence supports a direct interaction between the viral RNA and RBM8A (a central component of the EJC), suggesting a depletion of the cellular PYM1 pool upon recruitment by the WNV capsid to protect viral RNA from decay. Similarly, direct involvement of the NMD pathway in flavivirus is corroborated by the identification of the regulator of nonsense transcripts 1 (UPF1) among the ZIKV capsid interactors and the upregulation of several NMD substrate mRNAs upon ZIKV infection both in Huh7 and hNPC. Furthermore, depletion of UPF1 leads to a 50% increase in virus replication, supporting the notion that NMD acts as flavivirus restriction machinery that is counteracted by viral activities [
