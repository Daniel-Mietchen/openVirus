<p>Only one study to date reported the systematic analysis of ZIKV and DENV gRNA-associated proteins, using the ChIRP-MS (comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry) method. In this method, target RNA and associated proteins are retrieved after formaldehyde-based cross-linking using hybridization with antisense biotinylated oligos and streptavidin-conjugated beads, and protein complexes eluted via incubation with biotin [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], confirming association with previously reported flavivirus RBPs (e.g., YBX1, MOV10 and ADAR) and host-dependency factors (e.g., STT3B and MAGT1). Importantly, intersection of these large datasets with previously published genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screens, as well as four newly performed surveys using all four DENV serotypes, identified Vigilin and RRBP1 (ribosome-binding protein 1) as novel RBPs not previously linked to flavivirus infection. Interestingly, both of these proteins promote DENV infection and gRNA stability, positively modulating translation and replication of the gRNA.
