<p>NS4B also appeared to associate with cellular proteins that could be associated with the whole spectrum of ZIKV-associated pathogenesis including neurodegenerative disorders and retinal degeneration (CLN6, BSG), neuronal differentiation defects (CEND1, RBFOX2) and axonal dysfunction (CHP1, TMEM41b) [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While these cellular factors appeared as specific binders of arthropod-borne flaviviruses in neuronal cells (such as DENV and ZIKV), a subset of proteins exhibited ZIKV specificity (TMEM41b, CEND1, CLN6), suggesting that similarly to capsid, also NS4B might have evolved partially divergent binding affinities across different flaviviruses, with potential consequences for the distinctive pathogenic outcome. Interestingly CLN6, a poorly characterized protein associated with a neurodegenerative disease with late-infantile onset, shares several cellular binding partners with NS4B, and specifically associates with mTOR. These results support reports associating ZIKV infection or NS4B overexpression to defective neurogenesis via suppression of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway [
