<p>Initial studies by the Cao group focused on the global protein phosphorylation status in WNV- and JEV-infected cells [

In the case of WNV, 1657 proteins were found as significantly regulated at the phosphorylation level, and gene ontology enrichment analysis identified ErbB, NFκB and mTOR signaling pathways as the strongest deregulated pathways. Furthermore, several important kinases and substrates such as RNKP, RB1 and GSK3B were hyperphosphorylated, and depletion of these proteins by RNA interference significantly reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in WNV-infected cells. Similarly, analysis of the cellular phosphoproteome upon JEV infection identified over 1200 differentially modulated phosphoproteins, including AKT, GSK-3β and PKC as well as ERK and p53. Interestingly, in case of JEV, a specific enrichment of JNK1 and CK2 substrates was identified among hyperphosphorylated and hypophosporylated proteins, respectively. Importantly, pharmacological modulation of JNK1 signaling reduced JEV-induced production of inflammatory cytokines in the brain of infected mice, suggesting an important role for stress-mediated responses in JEV-mediated neurotoxicity [
