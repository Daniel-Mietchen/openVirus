 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04179-f003">Figure 3</xref>A–C show the Spearman rank correlation between the epidemic size of the index virus and the cumulative complementary incidence, up to epidemiological weeks 22–24 from 2010 to 2019. Although some correlations were marginally- or non-significant, negative correlation was identified in this dynamic assessment of the relationship.
