 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04179-f005">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the interrelationship of timings at which the peak incidence is observed among the three virus types. When comparing influenza type A viruses (i.e., A/H1N1 vs. A/H3N2), the mean difference between the two peak weeks was estimated at 0.11 weeks. Comparing the timing of peak weeks between influenza type A and B viruses, the mean differences were 2.22 and 2.11 weeks between influenza type B and A/H1N1 and influenza type B and A/H3N2, respectively. Standard deviations ranged from 2.51 to 4.18 weeks.
