<p>Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to reduce the risk of infection or severe forms of infection [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of existing vaccines is limited because antigenic drift in influenza viruses over time requires annual immunization and that vaccines are updated frequently [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To develop an effective vaccine strategy, it is vital to predict the likely predominant virus type (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B) and its antigenic characteristics [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, co-circulation of virus types does not take place in an independent manner. Sonoguchi et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that Japanese high school students who were infected with influenza had a lower risk of subsequent infection with A/H1N1 during the period of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 co-circulation, indicating short-term cross-subtype protection induced by the initial influenza infection. In observational studies, Skowronski et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that people who received influenza vaccination during 2008–2009 were more likely to have symptoms owing to influenza A/H1N1pdm in 2009 than those who did not receive influenza vaccination during 2008–2009. Cowling et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that the risk of infection with influenza A/H1N1pdm in 2009 among people who were infected with seasonal influenza A during 2008–2009 was significantly lower than that among people without seasonal influenza A infection; those authors believed that the temporary nonspecific immunity theory could explain short-term protection induced by influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several modeling studies [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have applied the temporary nonspecific immunity theory to describe influenza virus dynamics and evolution, although biological evidence is limited. Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that possible interference among three influenza virus types, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B, as a consequence of cross protection and early onset of one virus type, could lead to reduced incidence of other co-circulating influenza viruses. Additionally, those authors indicated that routine surveillance data could be used to predict the epidemic size for each influenza virus type. The interference among different virus types is also important in the context of pandemic preparedness. It is argued that the required stockpiles of antiviral drugs (e.g., oseltamivir) should be estimated, as part of preparedness for future pandemics [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The Japanese government has maintained additional antiviral stockpiles to prepare for possible simultaneous epidemics caused by seasonal influenza viruses. If influenza viruses do not independently cause epidemics, such arguments require additional insights into the mutual interference mechanisms.
