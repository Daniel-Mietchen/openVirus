<p>To estimate the type-specific influenza incidence, the present study analyzed two datasets: sentinel surveillance data and laboratory-based virus surveillance data, across all 47 prefectures of Japan. Two sets of data were combined, because sentinel surveillance informs the overall incidence of influenza, while virus surveillance data with typing information are based on a small portion of confirmed cases. Multiplying the percentage of each virus type with sentinel reports of influenza notifications, we obtain type-specific proxy of influenza incidence. Adhering to the Infectious Disease Law and under the National Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NESID) program, influenza cases are notified to local health centers via health care facilities. The weekly number of influenza cases is reported from approximately 5000 sentinel health care facilities in Japan [

Virus surveillance is independently conducted, reporting the weekly frequency of virus types (i.e., A/H1N1pdm, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) using specimens collected from approximately 500 health care facilities sampled from sentinel health care facilities [

Diagnostic criteria for notified influenza cases are either a positive RDT for influenza and/or the presence of symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as satisfying all of the following: (1) sudden onset of illness, (2) high-grade fever, (3) upper respiratory symptoms, and (4) systemic symptoms including general fatigue [

As briefly described in the introduction, physicians in Japan regularly use RDT in patients with suspected influenza infection, because the use of RDT is financially covered by health insurance under their universal health coverage. Thus, most notified cases of influenza are considered to represent the true influenza diagnoses using RDT, mirroring the influenza incidence in a more appropriate manner than ILI-based surveillance in other countries.
