<p id="p0110">Among the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 deaths, average time lag between onset of illness and hospital admission was 5.7 days (Range 0–15 days) and the mean duration of hospital stay of cases leading to death was 3.4 days (Range 0–13 days). There was an average delay of 6.4 days for Tamiflu use. Hence it can be presumed that delay in antiviral therapy can be a main determinant for mortality.</p>
