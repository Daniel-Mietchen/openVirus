<p id="p0085">The characteristic feature of this pandemic influenza infection was that, case distribution was disproportionate among all age groups but the patients belonging to 46–60 years followed by 30–45 years of age group found to be more affected than the other age groups, which was also reflected in other studies [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reporting higher prevalence in elder age group which was not exposed previously. In our study it was observed that infection rate was higher among male individuals (50.6%) than females (49.3%) though the difference is not significant. Similar observation was reported in some studies indicating different behaviour, hormone response and susceptibility to infectious diseases may be the reason for this difference among males and females [
