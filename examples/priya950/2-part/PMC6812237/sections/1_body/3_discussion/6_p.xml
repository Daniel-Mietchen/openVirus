<p id="p0100">Studies showed that various risk factors like age, co-existence of chronic diseases, pregnancy and the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, with particularly elevated risk among elders, infants, pregnant women, hypertension, immune-suppression, or delayed hospital admission [

There was underlying disease in at least 49% of documented fatal cases worldwide which is comparable to our study, where 52.74% of the deaths among patients with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had reported co-existing chronic illness. In contrast few studies that had shown up to 90% patients having any one underlying conditions like pregnancy, obesity etc. [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Neurological complication has been reported in 15.4% among H1N1 2009 associated deaths in our study. A study from California reported neurological complication among 20% of H1N1 infected patients [

It was noted that hypertension and diabetes were other co-morbid conditions, those were associated with 4 (4.4%) and 6 (6.6%) death cases among Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patients during 2009 which was also reported by previous studies identifying diabetes to be significantly associated with death and severity of disease [
