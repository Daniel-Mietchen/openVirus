<p id="p0015">The pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 started in the eastern part of Odisha in September, 2009 and spread rapidly to all parts of the state and lasted until the end of year 2010. A large number of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases (n = 118) and deaths (n = 32) were reported during this pandemic. In next two-three years only sporadic influenza activity was reported i.e. 2 confirmed cases of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were reported in 2012, while only one case confirmed in 2013. Virulence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus became once again active and caused another epidemic in 2015. The number of new cases, including fatal cases continued to increase since September, 2015. In this period, we reported 60 new Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases and 5 deaths. We carried out a retrospective analysis of the available information, in order to study the clinico-epidemiological features and establish the magnitude and severity of recent Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemics in hospitalized patients from the state of Odisha.</p>
