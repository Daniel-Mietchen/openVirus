<p id="p0035">Upper respiratory tract specimens including nasal and throat swabs were collected using plastic shafted dacron swabs placed into viral transport medium (VTM). RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer instruction. Amplification and detection for each RNA isolate was performed on Applied Biosystem's RealTime PCR 7500 instrument by using primers and probe sets for Influenza A, Universal Swine (swA), Swine H1 (swH1) and RNaseP (Applied Biosystems, USA) as per the CDC real-time RT-PCR protocol (RealTime PCR, Applied Biosystems, USA) [
