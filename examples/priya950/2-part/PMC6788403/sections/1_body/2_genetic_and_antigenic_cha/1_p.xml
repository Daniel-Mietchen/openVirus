<p>CDC genetically characterized 867 influenza viruses submitted by U.S. and international laboratories during May 19–September 28, 2019, including 263 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 427 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 177 influenza B viruses. All A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to genetic subclade 6B.1A. Among 25 antigenically characterized A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 96% were similar

Multiple subclades within the 3C.2a clade cocirculated with the majority of viruses belonging to subclade 3C.2a1, with regional differences in which subgroup of 3C.2a1 predominated. A(H3N2) viruses with a clade 3C.3a HA, which reemerged last season, continue to circulate in the WHO Region of the Americas. Among the 74 representative A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized, 70% were similar to the cell-culture propagated 2019–20 Northern Hemisphere vaccine virus component. Thus, although ferret antisera clearly distinguish antigenic differences between 3C.2a and 3C.3a viruses there is some cross-reactivity.
