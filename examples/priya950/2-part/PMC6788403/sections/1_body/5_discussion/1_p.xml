<p>From May to September 2019, influenza activity remained low in the United States, as is typical for that time of year. Influenza A and B viruses cocirculated throughout the summer months with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating overall and influenza B/Victoria, subclade V1A-3Del, viruses the most common influenza B virus reported by public health laboratories. Influenza A and B viruses also circulated widely in the Southern Hemisphere with the predominant virus varying by region and country. It is too early in the season to know which viruses will circulate in the United States later this fall and winter or how severe the season might be; however, regardless of what is circulating, the best protection against influenza is an influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk for influenza illness associated with outpatient health care visits and hospitalizations and reduces the risk for serious influenza outcomes that can result in hospitalization or death. CDC recommends that all persons aged 6 months and older who do not have contraindications get vaccinated, but vaccination is especially important for persons at high risk for serious influenza-associated complications, including persons aged ≥65 years, children aged &lt;5 years, pregnant women, and persons with certain underlying medical conditions.</p>
