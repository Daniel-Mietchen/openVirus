<p>In late September, WHO issued its recommendations for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Compared with the composition of the 2019–20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation, these recommendations reflect changes to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. The update for the B/Victoria-lineage component reflects the global spread and increase of V1A-3Del viruses, which had reduced reactivity to ferret antisera raised to V1A.1 viruses used in 2019–20 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. Apart from North and South America, the majority of A(H3N2) viruses circulating elsewhere globally belonged to subclade 3C.2a1 and were antigenically different from the Northern Hemisphere 3C.3a vaccine component, leading to a change in the A(H3N2) component to a 3C.2a1 subclade virus for the Southern Hemisphere. These recommendations were made specifically for the Southern Hemisphere using many factors, including evolutionary approaches to forecast specific subgroups likely to circulate 6 months into the future, determining which candidate vaccine viruses induce immunity that blocks the largest variety of viruses and which viruses escape population immunity from prior infection or vaccination. These factors vary among countries within the Southern Hemisphere and certainly vary between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. For example, activity in Australia during recent seasons has not reflected influenza virus activity in the subsequent U.S. season. Changes to the Southern Hemisphere vaccine composition, therefore, might not be a good predictor of the upcoming U.S. influenza season. Although Australia experienced an early start to its 2019 season with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating initially and A(H3N2) virus eventually predominating (
