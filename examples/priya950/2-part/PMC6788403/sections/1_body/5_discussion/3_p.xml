<p>Except for one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and one influenza B virus, all influenza viruses tested remained susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, and only one virus contained a genetic mutation that has previously been associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. Influenza antiviral medications are a valuable adjunct to annual influenza vaccination, and early treatment with influenza antiviral medication, especially within 48 hours of symptom onset, is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who 1) have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; 2) require hospitalization; or 3) are at high risk for influenza-related complications
