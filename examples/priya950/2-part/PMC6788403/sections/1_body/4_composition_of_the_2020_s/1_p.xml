 </xref> The recommended components for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere egg-based influenza trivalent vaccines are an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria lineage). For egg-based quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage), is recommended. It was recommended that the A(H3N2) component of non–egg-based vaccines be a cell-propagated A/Iowa/60/2018-like virus.
