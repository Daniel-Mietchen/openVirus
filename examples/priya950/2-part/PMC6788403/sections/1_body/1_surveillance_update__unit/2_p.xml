This virus had hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase gene segments derived from the seasonal human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that were likely introduced into swine by a recent reverse zoonosis and were closely related to influenza A(H1N1) viruses now circulating in the U.S. swine population. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza from CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System was below the epidemic threshold during this period. Five influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during this period were reported to CDC. Additional information on influenza surveillance methods is available at
