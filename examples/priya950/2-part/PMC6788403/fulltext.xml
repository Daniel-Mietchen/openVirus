In late September, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended components for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and included an update to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. Annual influenza vaccination is the best means for preventing influenza illness and its complications, and vaccination before influenza activity increases is optimal.

Multiple genetically and antigenically distinct B/Victoria lineage viruses cocirculated.

Ferret antisera raised to recent V1A.1 viruses, however, had reduced reactivity with many viruses expressing V1A and V1A-3Del HA proteins indicating some antigenic differences between viruses in the different B/Victoria lineage subclades. Nevertheless, sera from humans vaccinated with a V1A.1 virus cross reacted well with V1A-3Del viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other3"><title>Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses</title><p>CDC tested 812 influenza virus specimens collected during May 19&#x02013;September 28 from the United States and worldwide for resistance to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. All but two of the viruses tested (245 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [161 international and 84 U.S. viruses], 406 influenza A(H3N2) viruses [284 international and 122 U.S.], and 161 influenza B viruses [71 international and 90 U.S.]) were susceptible to these influenza antiviral medications. One (0.1%) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus contained the H275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and exhibited highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir, and one (0.1%) influenza B virus contained the amino acid substitution I221T and exhibited reduced inhibition by the same two neuraminidase inhibitors. Among 824 influenza virus specimens (253 A(H1N1)pdm09, 406 A(H3N2) and 165 type B assessed for susceptibility to baloxavir, one (0.1%) A(H3N2) virus contained amino acid substitution I38L in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein, which was previously associated with at least a threefold decreased baloxavir susceptibility. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persisted among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which is consistent with the current recommendation to avoid use of these medications against influenza.

For egg-based quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage), is recommended. It was recommended that the A(H3N2) component of non&#x02013;egg-based vaccines be a cell-propagated A/Iowa/60/2018-like virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>From May to September 2019, influenza activity remained low in the United States, as is typical for that time of year. Influenza A and B viruses cocirculated throughout the summer months with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating overall and influenza B/Victoria, subclade V1A-3Del, viruses the most common influenza B virus reported by public health laboratories. Influenza A and B viruses also circulated widely in the Southern Hemisphere with the predominant virus varying by region and country. It is too early in the season to know which viruses will circulate in the United States later this fall and winter or how severe the season might be; however, regardless of what is circulating, the best protection against influenza is an influenza vaccination.&#x000a0;Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk for influenza illness associated with outpatient health care visits and hospitalizations and reduces the risk for serious influenza outcomes that can result in hospitalization or death. CDC recommends that all persons aged 6 months and older who do not have contraindications get vaccinated, but vaccination is especially important for persons at high risk for serious influenza-associated complications, including persons aged &#x02265;65 years, children aged &#x0003c;5 years, pregnant women, and persons with certain underlying medical conditions.</p><p>In late September, WHO issued its recommendations for the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Compared with the composition of the 2019&#x02013;20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation, these recommendations reflect changes to the A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage components. The update for the B/Victoria-lineage component reflects the global spread and increase of V1A-3Del viruses, which had reduced reactivity to ferret antisera raised to V1A.1 viruses used in 2019&#x02013;20 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. Apart from North and South America, the majority of A(H3N2) viruses circulating elsewhere globally belonged to subclade 3C.2a1 and were antigenically different from the Northern Hemisphere 3C.3a vaccine component, leading to a change in the A(H3N2) component to a 3C.2a1 subclade virus for the Southern Hemisphere. These recommendations were made specifically for the Southern Hemisphere using many factors, including evolutionary approaches to forecast specific subgroups likely to circulate 6 months into the future, determining which candidate vaccine viruses induce immunity that blocks the largest variety of viruses and which viruses escape population immunity from prior infection or vaccination. These factors vary among countries within the Southern Hemisphere and certainly vary between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. For example, activity in Australia during recent seasons has not reflected influenza virus activity in the subsequent U.S. season. Changes to the Southern Hemisphere vaccine composition, therefore, might not be a good predictor of the upcoming U.S. influenza season. Although Australia experienced an early start to its 2019 season with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating initially and A(H3N2) virus eventually predominating (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>), influenza is unpredictable, and circumstances can change very quickly. Analysis of surveillance and laboratory data to date continues to support the appropriateness of the Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses used in production of influenza vaccines for the upcoming U.S. season.</p><p>Except for one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and one influenza B virus, all influenza viruses tested remained susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, and only one virus contained a genetic mutation that has previously been associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. Influenza antiviral medications are a valuable adjunct to annual influenza vaccination, and early treatment with influenza antiviral medication, especially within 48 hours of symptom onset, is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who 1) have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; 2) require hospitalization; or 3) are at high risk for influenza-related complications<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7"><sup>&#x000a7;&#x000a7;</sup></xref> (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). Early treatment has been shown to decrease time to symptom improvement (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>) and to reduce secondary complications associated with influenza (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Health care providers should not delay treatment until test results become available because treatment is most effective when given early in the illness.
