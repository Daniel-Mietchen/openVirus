<p>The virus genomic data reveal that WNV spread even faster across the US than the surveillance data show (

 </bold>). When combining spatial and phylogenetic data, it is estimated that the WNV “wave” moved from the East Coast to the West Coast at an average dispersal velocity of approximately 1,000 km/year during the first few years (1999–2003) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The rapid geographical expansion of WNV between 2001 and 2002 is consistent with a large increase in virus genetic diversity (i.e., a “polytomy,” as a result of many new transmission chains being introduced;
