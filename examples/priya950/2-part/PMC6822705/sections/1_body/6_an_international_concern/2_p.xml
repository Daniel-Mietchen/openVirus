<p>Although many partial WNV genomes (primarily envelope coding sequences) were generated from the Americas outside of the US (e.g., [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]), complete or near-complete virus genomes are necessary to accurately reconstruct spread and outbreak dynamics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. To this end, there are currently only 11 WNV genomes available from Mexico [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], seven from the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], and none from Canada. These limited data do reveal that the southwards spread into Latin America and the Caribbean began during the early stages of the outbreak in the US and occurred independently multiple times [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] (

 </bold>). In Mexico, multiple introductions of the WN02 and SW03 genotypes suggest that viruses may be commonly moving across the US–Mexico border [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Moreover, WNV genetic data from the British Virgin Islands [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] and Puerto Rico (partial sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]) reveal that at least the WN02 genotype was introduced into the Caribbean. Interestingly, the NY99 genotype that was displaced in the US (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008042.g003">Fig 3</xref>
 </bold>) was detected in Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil, likely via separate introductions, and may still be in circulation in South America [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. However, the paucity of complete WNV genomes makes it difficult to understand the patterns of spread and diversity outside of the US.
