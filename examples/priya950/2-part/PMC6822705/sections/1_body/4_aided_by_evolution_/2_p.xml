<p>The defining feature of the NY99 genotype displacement is a single amino acid substitution in the WNV envelope protein (E-V159A) that emerged around 2001 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Thus, the events leading to the extinction of NY99, either by stochastic processes or through an unknown selective disadvantage, remain unknown.
