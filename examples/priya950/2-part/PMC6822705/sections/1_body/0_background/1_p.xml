<p>West Nile virus (WNV; family Flaviviridae; genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) is globally distributed and maintained by a complex transmission cycle involving multiple species of mosquitoes and birds [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since its emergence in the Americas in 1999, the virus has resulted in over 48,000 reported cases, 24,000 reported neuroinvasive cases, over 2,300 deaths [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and an estimated 7 million total human infections in the continental US [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At present, WNV is considered one of the most important zoonotic diseases of concern to the US population [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. WNV is also a significant animal pathogen, having caused over 28,000 reported equine cases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and mortality in over 300 bird species [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], resulting in massive population declines reported among at least 23 bird species [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This includes a reported 45% decline in the American Crow (
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>) population following the introduction of WNV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The impact of WNV has not been limited to the US, as more than 5,000 human infections have been reported in Canada [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the virus is recognized as an emerging threat across the Americas [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
