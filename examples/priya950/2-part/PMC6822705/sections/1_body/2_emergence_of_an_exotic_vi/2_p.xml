<p>WNV was first isolated in Uganda in 1937 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and has since become endemic to many parts of Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Despite its global distribution, WNV was not detected in the Americas before the outbreak in 1999, raising two important questions: (
 <bold>1</bold>) where did the virus originate from and (
 <bold>2</bold>) when was it first introduced? Phylogenetic comparisons of the virus sequences isolated from New York in 1999 to WNV sequences from around the world revealed that it was most closely related to a WNV isolate from the brain of a dead goose found in Israel in 1998 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], suggesting a potential origin from the Middle East [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (

 </bold>). Further genetic studies revealed that WNV was likely introduced in 1998 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008042.g001">Fig 1</xref>
 </bold>). Thus, WNV may have been circulating in the US for a year before the first outbreak was detected during the summer of 1999.
