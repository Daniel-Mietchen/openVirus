<p>Longer length of stay in dengue-endemic countries was also found to be associated with dengue virus infection among febrile passengers. A previous study revealed that length of stay was correlated with seropositivity [

The finding is not surprising, because long-term travelers are clearly at higher risk of exposure to dengue virus than short-term travelers. However, the incubation period of dengue and the time of screening should also be considered in this study setting. The incubation period of dengue is 4–10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Therefore, travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries &lt;7 days are less likely to present at the border with fever, even if they have been infected. In addition, previous studies also showed that purpose of travel could be an important predictor of dengue infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For example, group travelers tend to stay shorter and hence have a lower risk of dengue infection than travelers who stay longer for visiting friends and relatives or for business. Univariate analysis results indeed showed a lower risk of dengue infection among group travelers than other travelers. However, further stepwise regression analysis didn’t select for travel purpose in the model. Such a discrepancy could be explained by the high correlation between length of stay and the purpose of the travel. Therefore, targeting for screening the febrile passengers who did not participate in travel groups or who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for more than 1 week could increase the possibility of detecting dengue virus infection at international airports and could reduce unnecessary testing.
