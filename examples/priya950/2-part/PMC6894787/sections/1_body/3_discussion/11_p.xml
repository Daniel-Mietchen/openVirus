<p>The findings in this study are subject to at least four limitations. First, active surveillance at the airports identified only the febrile inbound passengers whose fevers were detected by infrared thermometer or who reported to the quarantine station voluntarily. Some passengers might take antipyretics to avoid fever detection and testing, which would lead to underestimation of the number of dengue infections among inbound passengers. Second, although all inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries with febrile illnesses are required to be tested for dengue virus infection, the quarantine officers made decisions about blood sampling on a case-by-case basis, so the inclusion criteria were not consistent. For example, an infant or young child with febrile illness might not undergo blood sampling because of a lack of equipment or training. Third, all information collected from the questionnaire was self-reported, including demographics, travel history before entering Taiwan, and symptoms. Despite careful review, misclassification might have occurred because of incomplete or inaccurate self-reports. Nonetheless, because the patients were asked to complete questionnaire before the diagnosis of dengue, recall bias would not have differentially affected dengue patients from non-dengue patients. Finally, the results in this study were based on data from the year 2011, and the results may differ by year. The proportion of dengue-positive cases among inbound passengers with all causes of fever also could differ by year.</p>
