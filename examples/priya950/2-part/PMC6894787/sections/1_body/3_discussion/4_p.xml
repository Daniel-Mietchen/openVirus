<p>Rapid, convenient diagnostic testing for acute-phase dengue is crucial to early identification of imported cases among febrile passengers at borders. Although IgM and IgG ELISAs for dengue are widely used in routine laboratories, there are variations in detection limits in the acute phase of dengue [

In addition, serologic diagnosis of dengue may require testing of a convalescent-phase specimen, which is usually not available in this setting. NS1 antigen detection kits can be used in field settings with limited equipment, such as at quarantine stations, and can provide results in less than an hour [
 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the sensitivity of NS1 antigen rapid testing in this study was only approximately 60%. Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR allows early diagnosis in the febrile phase. The combination of NS1 and PCR detected approximately 90% of dengue cases in this study and therefore should be considered for diagnosis of dengue at borders.
