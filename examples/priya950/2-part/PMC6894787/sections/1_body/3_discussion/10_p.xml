<p>Upper respiratory symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, are often recognized as uncommon presentations among patients with dengue infection. However, a review of patients with laboratory-confirmed dengue in Taiwan showed that approximately 40% of patients had cough [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Even though this study found a negative association between upper respiratory symptoms and dengue virus infection, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was very close to 1. This association could also be influenced by the activity of other respiratory pathogens that could cause febrile illness, for example, influenza virus. Hence, in a primary care setting or at the airport border, physicians or quarantine officers should not use only upper respiratory symptoms to exclude a diagnosis of dengue in febrile travelers.
