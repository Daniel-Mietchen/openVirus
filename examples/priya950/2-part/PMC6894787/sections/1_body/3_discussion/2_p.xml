<p>Following the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, many countries started to establish entry screening systems using non-contact infrared thermometers at international airports for detecting febrile passengers [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. After publication of the International Health Regulations (2005) by the World Health Organization, exit and entry screening became mandatory in certain situations for the member states [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A previous review article concluded that the effectiveness of non-contact infrared thermometers in detecting symptomatic passengers was limited when fever prevalence among passengers was less than 1% [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although other factors might affect the sensitivity and specificity of infrared thermometers for disease detection, the overall efficiency of screening could be increased with the addition of a questionnaire on travel history and symptoms.
