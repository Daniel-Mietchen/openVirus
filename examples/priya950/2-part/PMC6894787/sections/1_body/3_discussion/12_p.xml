<p>In conclusion, analyzing data from non-contact infrared thermometerâ€“based active surveillance at an international airport revealed that dengue virus infection in febrile inbound passengers was associated with older age, a stay in dengue-endemic countries exceeding 1 week, skin rashes, and higher body temperature. Targeted screening of passengers with these characteristics could increase the efficiency of active surveillance for dengue infection at the border and could help prevent virus transmission in the community. Travelers should be advised to take preventive measures against mosquito bites before visiting dengue-endemic areas.</p>
