<p>This study found that old age could be used as a predictor of dengue virus infection among inbound passengers with febrile illness. This finding is consistent with previous results showing a higher likelihood for older adults to be infected with dengue [

 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Compared with those of a younger age, older persons could be more likely to develop clinical dengue with typical symptoms/signs that can be detected by this surveillance system. Furthermore, the severity of the disease also increases with the age of the patient [
 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and older age has been found to be an important determinant of mortality in several studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Early recognition of dengue in senior passengers can potentially improve the outcome of infection through appropriate supportive treatment.
