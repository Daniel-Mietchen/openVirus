<p>The study was conducted at the quarantine station of Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), which is the largest airport in Taiwan. Before being allowed to enter the border, inbound passengers must self-report any illness to quarantine officers. In the arrival area they pass the quarantine station, which is equipped with non-contact infrared thermometer cameras (ThermaCAM P20; FLIR, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The quarantine officers calibrate these infrared thermal cameras every day. When passengers walk by, a visual alarm alerts quarantine officers if a camera detects a surface temperature exceeding 36°C. Suspected febrile passengers are then asked to have their tympanic temperature measured. Passengers with confirmed febrile illness (tympanic temperature ≥38°C) complete a standard questionnaire that collects information on demographics, nationality, travel history before entering Taiwan, personal medical history, symptoms/signs, and a contact address and phone number in Taiwan. All information is entered in the database of the National Quarantine Surveillance System of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC). Because this study was for public health surveillance, it was exempt from human subject review and did not require informed consent.</p>
