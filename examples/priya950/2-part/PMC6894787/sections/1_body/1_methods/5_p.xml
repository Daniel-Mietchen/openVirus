<p>We used a chi-square test to analyze the difference in variables between febrile passengers who tested positive and negative for dengue virus infection. We conducted univariate logistic regression analysis to generate crude odds ratios (ORs) of each variable with a 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.10. We further analyzed all these variables with statistical significance by stepwise logistic regression to predict a model of factors associated with dengue virus infection among febrile inbound passengers and generate adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Using stepwise selection, a significance level of 0.10 is required to allow a variable into the model, and a significance level of 0.05 is required for a variable to stay in the model. All tests were two-sided, and 
 <italic>p</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
