<p>Moreover, passengers who had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5–4.1), skin rash (aOR, 10.1; 95% CI, 3.4–35.2), and tympanic temperature ≥39°C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7–4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue, whereas those with respiratory tract symptoms were not (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0). Longer length of stay in dengue-endemic countries was associated with increased likelihood of testing positive for dengue infection. Compared with those who traveled for ≤7 days, those who traveled 8–14, 15–21, 22–28, and ≥29 days were more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2, 14.9, 39.0 and 12.0, respectively). The proportion of the variance explained by the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.2086.</p>
