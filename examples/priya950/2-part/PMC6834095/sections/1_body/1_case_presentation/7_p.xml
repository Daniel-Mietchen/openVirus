<p>She presented respiratory insufficiency, even after new pulse therapy with methylprednisolone for five days, being intubated, requiring continuous mechanical ventilatory assistance. The disease course was thus clinically progressive and worsening, andÂ five plasmapheresis sessions were performed, without clinical improvement. New ENMG revealed a pattern consistent with diffuse axonal motor neuropathy with no fasciculations and no conduction block, without bulbar involvement, without dysphagia. She presented joint pain with joint edema and hypotrophy, flaccidity, osteotendinous hyperreflexia. In this phase, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for arboviruses was negative in CSF and synovial fluid of the knees, but IgG for CHK was elevated in the CSF. Serology for Zika virus was negative. She presented signs of arthritis in the hands, in agreement with arbovirus, and was treated with chloroquine. After 188 days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient suffered respiratory complications, leading to death.</p>
