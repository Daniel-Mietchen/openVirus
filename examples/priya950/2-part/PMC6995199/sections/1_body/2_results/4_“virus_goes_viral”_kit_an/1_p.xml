<p id="Par38">The slides generated in previous sections were used to compose the “Virus Goes Viral” kit. The kit has a total of 15 labeled slides: five viral particle slides, nine CPE slides, and one viral factory slide (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The kit includes associated teaching materials on a CD-ROM, including an infographic material, which aims to assist in understanding what is being observed (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and also high-resolution model images of each slide and CPE images from several giant viruses in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vermiformis</italic> that were not fixed and stained in slide form (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). These CPEs include: cell rounding for CVG, Marseillevirus, PDV, TPV, and KAUV; cell stretching for OBRV; cell bunches for TPV; lysis plaques for FSTV (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). The “Virus Goes Viral” kit and its attached material encompass 13 different viral species and 17 miscellaneous effects in host cells. This kit has been used in practical virology classes for the Biological Sciences course (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais [UFMG], Brazil). The students seemed very receptive to the proposal and many were excited about the practice. Some expressed interest in starting research with giant viruses and initiated contact with our laboratory.
