 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> cells in PYG medium were cultured in cell culture flasks (25 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). After the amoebae adhered to the flask, NYMV was inoculated with a MOI of 1. After 12-h infection, cells were removed from the flask and centrifuged at 885 x g for 10 min and stained with hemacolor reagents (Renylab, Brazil). Once dried, the stained region was covered with a 13 mm glass coverslip using Canada balsam.
