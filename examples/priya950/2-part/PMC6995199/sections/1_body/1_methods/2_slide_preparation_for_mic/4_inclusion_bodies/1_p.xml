<p id="Par34">BSC-40 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were plated on sterile 13 mm coverslips, grown in MEM with 5% FBS for 24 h, and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere that contained 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were infected with CPXV (MOI: 10), and once CPEs were detected, the coverslips were fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% v/v) for 2 h and stained with the solution rich in eosin from the hemacolor kit for 10 min. After staining, the coverslips were washed, dried, and affixed to glass slides using Canada balsam.
