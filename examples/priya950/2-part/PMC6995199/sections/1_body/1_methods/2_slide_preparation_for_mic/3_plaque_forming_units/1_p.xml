<p id="Par33">Two cell lines were used for visualization of virus plaque-forming units. For MAYV, CHIKV, and YFV, Vero cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were plated on sterile 13 mm coverslips, grown in MEM with 5% FBS for 24 h, and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The next day, the cells were infected with viruses and observed until the characteristic CPE appeared (lysis plaques). Once CPEs were detected, the coverslips were fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% v/v) for 2 h and stained with crystal violet. After staining, the coverslips were washed, dried, and affixed to the glass slides using Canada balsam. For viruses from both VACV groups and CPXV, lysis plaque visualization was performed by infecting BSC-40 cells. The same procedure described above was followed to prepare this slide.
