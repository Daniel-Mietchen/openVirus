<p id="Par42">Our kit covers 13 viral species, including vertebrate viruses, protozoan viruses, and arboviruses. This range of viral models illustrates for students the diversity of the virosphere. Besides, the CPEs covered by the kit are an important discussion point with students about specific interactions between virus and host. An interesting example of virus-host interactions is the mechanism of TPV and amoebas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Virus-induced infected cells can aggregate with uninfected cells to form bunches that can increase TPV fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These bunches are present in the “Virus Goes Viral” attached material. Another example is the VACV isolates that show a biological diversity that allows separating the viruses into different groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The VACV strain shows plaque phenotypes that differ in size; for example, the VACV group II has larger plaques than the VACV group I [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our kit contains slides with VACV differentiation to make it clear to students that even within the same viral species there is variation.
