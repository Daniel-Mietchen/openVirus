<p>Vaccines can increase the resistance of an animal to infection making them an increasingly important tool in the health management of swine herds. Although, many vaccines are efficacious, continual pathogen mutation and the emergence of new virus threats drives a constant need for new and improved vaccines. Not surprisingly, many of the significant-economic-disease viruses are viruses for which there are no vaccine, or the current vaccine has limited efficacy. Any solution to the current swine vaccine problem will involve a better understanding of the pig's immune response to these pathogens with the hope of applying this knowledge toward the development and improvement of vaccines, and other more rapid responses to new diseases in the future.</p>
