The increasingly efficient production of pork has made it more readily available and it has become the number one meat consumed worldwide (

Meeting the demand for pork has forced the evolution of swine production from traditional inefficient husbandry practices involving a few pigs or small herds to an intensive concentration of swine that is divided into stages of production housed at different sites often far apart. This dramatic change has made the production of pork very efficient, but it has also changed the ecology of many swine diseases. Moreover, this style of production may encourage the emergence of new diseases, and amplifies their economic impact.
