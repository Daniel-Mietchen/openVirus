<p>The control of influenza A viruses in swine (IAV-S) exemplifies the challenges of passively acquired maternal immunity in modern swine production. In the late 1990s, a novel IAV-S H3 subtype was first detected in the United States, and similar to the then endemic North American H1 subtype, the new virus caused respiratory disease in fattening hogs and sows (

In response to this new H3 subtype lineage, specific inactivated vaccines were produced and combined with H1 vaccines to form new polyvalent vaccines that were efficacious in na√Øve older swine when administered prior to the onset of disease. However, as the intensification of swine production expanded, the ecology of IAV-S began to change with younger pigs becoming clinically affected which supported strategies to immunize the sows to provide passive immunity to their piglets. This was helpful, but the practice also jeopardized the ability to vaccinate young pigs to protect them against disease in later stages of production illustrating the passive immunity conundrum when using inactivated vaccines given intramuscularly to young pigs. Recently, an attenuated IAV-S vaccine has been released for sale in the US that is given intranasally to neonatal pigs to circumvent passively acquired immunity. It is reported to provide protection to young pigs and induce a broader protective immune response when compared to inactivated vaccines given intramuscularly (
