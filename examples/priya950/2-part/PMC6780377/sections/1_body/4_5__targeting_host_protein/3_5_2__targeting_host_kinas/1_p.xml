<p>Host kinases are involved in DENV assembly and secretion. Protein kinase inhibits the dengue replication cycle and, in the absence of a cytotoxicity cause, multilog decreases in the viral titer. Dasatinib and saracatinib (AZD0530) are inhibitors of the protein kinase c-Src [

 <xref rid="B109-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Many compounds that inhibit kinase activity by regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK or MAP kinase) have been developed. Examples of such compounds are CGP57380 that inhibits extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) and p38 pathways in DENV-2 infected cells; and PD98059, U0126, and FR180204 that inhibit the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK); while AR-12 inhibits PI3K/JAKT pathway by expressing GRP-78 for all four DENV serotypes. Sunitinib and erlotinib, as well as isothiazolo[5,4-b] pyridines and Imidazo[1,2-b] pyridazine, are inhibitors of AAK1 and GAK pathways that inhibit DENV replication, whereas U0126 inhibits the ERK pathway to reduce the replication DENV-2 and -3 infected cells (
