<p>Host proteins and enzymes play an integral role in Flaviviruses and are necessary for their entry into the host, as well as for replication and assembly. DENV dominates some processes to manipulate the host cell proteins and metabolic pathways. Post-translational modifications, especially the carbohydrate modification pathways (e.g., glycosylation), have been demonstrated as targets against Flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B99-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. However, the potential of such compounds for screening purposes is tremendous. The host proteins are potential antiviral targets and have been shown in extant studies focusing on inhibiting such compounds so as to not be toxic for the host [
