<p>Several host factors at the cellular level play a key role in the DENV virus entry process, but attachment factors and receptors are deemed the most important factors. Molecules in mammalian cells can act as attachment factors and receptors. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [
