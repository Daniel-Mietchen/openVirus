<p>It has been demonstrated that excessive inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of the severe form of dengue disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; interleukin (IL)-6, 8, 10; chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, 3; CXCL-8, 10; and interferon (IFN)-γ, all of which are responsible for primary and secondary DENV infection in humans, are excessively elevated and have been reported in patients with severe dengue disease [
