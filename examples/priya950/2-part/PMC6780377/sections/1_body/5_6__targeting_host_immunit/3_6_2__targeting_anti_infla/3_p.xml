<p>The chemokine system that plays a protective and pathologic role during DENV infections produces CXCL10 and activates CXCR3 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 3) to improve host resistance against DENV infection [

Clinical studies in endemic areas indicated the presence of a correlation between DENV outcome and the level of CCL2, 3, 4 concentrations that were related to hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic shock. Another study also found a link between CCL5 and DENV-induced hepatic dysfunction [

Hence, we can conclude that CXCR3 expresses protective host responses, but CCR2 and CCR4 cause infection rather than providing protection against DENV infection [
