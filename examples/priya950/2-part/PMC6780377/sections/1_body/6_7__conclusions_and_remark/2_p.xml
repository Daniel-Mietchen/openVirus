<p>In the case of viral infection, initial attachment to the target cell is necessary to continue the viral life cycle. This process can occur in DENV through the interaction between viral surface proteins and host attachment factors, or receptor molecules present at the host cell surface. These factors are responsible for the binding of a viral protein that leads to viral cell entry and subsequent genome release into the cytoplasm. If the early steps of DENV infection cycle can be blocked by targeting host attachment factors or receptor molecules, this would be significant progress in the development of antiviral drugs.</p>
