<p>DENV-infected small 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> bite humans and thus initiate DENV transmission. These mosquitos lay eggs and rest indoors in coconut shells, artificial containers, vases with wastewater, and old automobile tires found in and around homes. At dawn, 2–3 h after sunrise, as well as during sunset (in daylight hours), adult mosquitoes prefer to feed on humans, to which these periods are known as the “two peaks of biting activity”. 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> females very often feed on several persons, thus rapidly accelerating the transmission of DENV [
 <xref rid="B49-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After transmission into the human host and following a 3 to 14-day incubation period, most affected individuals enter a 2 to 10-day acute febrile period and experience nonspecific signs and symptoms. During this viremic stage, other biting mosquitoes become infected and viruses circulate in the peripheral blood.
