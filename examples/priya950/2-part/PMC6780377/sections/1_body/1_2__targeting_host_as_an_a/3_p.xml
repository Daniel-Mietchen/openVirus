<p>Different host and viral factors play a crucial role in promoting more severe dengue cases. This may occur via two routes: (i) Severe diseases occurring along with secondary infections, where a heterologous antibody virus (IgG–DENV) complex forms to FcγR receptors on the macrophage and aid in amplifying the infections [

(ii) Secondly, the amplified infections aid in the increased viral load leading to an immunopathogenic response. From the hypothesis, we can understand that DENV serotypes are propagated in endemic areas, and pre-existing immunity to one serotype does not defend against infection with other serotypes, as some serotypes are more virulent than other serotypes and may enhance the severity of disease [

Hence, evaluation of the host and viral factors (e.g., isoform of enzymes, serotypes of virus) must be considered carefully when choosing host pathway as a target for anti-DENV therapy that could play a role in the progression of severe dengue cases in the frame of all the four DENV serotypes. Prior to evaluation, sometimes targeting the factors is very difficult, and may be toxic for the host. Difficulties in attenuation, lack of stability, less broad, potent, and durable immune response are some of the biggest drawbacks for targeting host factors as potential antiviral therapeutics [
