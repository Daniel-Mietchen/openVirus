<p>Viral infections can modify many physiological as well as metabolic pathways. Metabolic changes include lipid metabolism, in addition to stimulation of glycolytic pathways toward an energetically favorable state, which modifies membrane lipid and other composition for viral replication and virion envelopment. Targeting intracellular metabolic pathways and their pharmacological inhibition can reduce DENV RNA synthesis and infectious virion production [

For example, lipid and glucose metabolic pathways are necessary for every step in the replication cycle of DENV. Both steps in the replication cycles of DENV can be inhibited by different pharmacological agents, and the agents/inhibitors developed mainly target the host factors that mediate lipid synthesis, lipid and glucose metabolism, and trafficking pathways. Despite this, targeting host glucose and lipid metabolism and trafficking as an antiviral strategy by blockade of entire pathways may be limited because of host toxicity [

Knowledge of the molecular details of lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, regulatory enzymes of the pathways and metabolic function in replication, and the mechanisms by which specific glucose and lipids are generated during DENV infection, as well as its trafficking to the relevant factors, will help to enable more targeted antiviral strategies without creating any toxic effects on the host cell.
