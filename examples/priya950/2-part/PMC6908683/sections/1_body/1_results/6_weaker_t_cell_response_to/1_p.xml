 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV at E0.5. At E18.5, mouse spleens were harvested for T cell analysis by culturing splenocytes, stimulating them with ZIKV or a viral envelope peptide

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In both maternal and non-maternal groups, 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV elicited robust ZIKV-specific IFN-γ

 <sup>+</sup>TNF-α
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b–d</xref>). Consistently, the splenocytes from 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-immunized animals produced significantly higher levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-γ than those from the mock-vaccinated animals (Fig.

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and IFN-γ

 <sup>+</sup> T cells. It also induced lower levels of IL2 and IFN-γ production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). The results indicate that pregnancy has a lower T cell response to 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV vaccination.
