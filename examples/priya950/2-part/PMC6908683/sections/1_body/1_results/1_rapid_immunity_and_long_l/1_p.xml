<p id="Par6">We chose 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV in the current study because it elicits rapid and long-lasting protective immunity after one immunization. A single immunization of ten-week-old A129 mice with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV elicits neutralizing antibody titers (NT
 <sub>50</sub>, defined as a sera dilution that inhibits 50% viral infection, data represents 1/NT
 <sub>50</sub> ± standard deviations) of 1/1300 ± 310, 1/6800 ± 900, and 1/13,900 ± 3000 on days 6, 10, and 14 post-immunization, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The NT
 <sub>50</sub> values remain above 1/20,000 at week 55 post-immunization (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Given the short gestation period of 20 days in mice, a rapid development of immunity after 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV immunization is required to study maternal vaccination in a mouse pregnancy model. Other vaccine platforms that require multiple doses (e.g., inactivated vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine) are not suitable for studying maternal vaccination in mice because they cannot elicit protective immunity within the short gestation period in the mouse model. Thus, we chose 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV to evaluate maternal vaccination in a pregnant A129 mouse model.
