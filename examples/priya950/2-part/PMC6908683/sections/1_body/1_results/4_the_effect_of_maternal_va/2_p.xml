<p id="Par14">The second experiment examined the longevity of maternal immunity in offspring. The neutralizing antibody titers in the offspring gradually waned from ~1/4400 ± 1200 on day 21 to ~1/90 ± 60 on day 70 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). This is in contrast with no decrease in neutralizing antibody titers in adult animals immunized with 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). After challenging the 70-day-old pups with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59, 32% of the animals were protected against viremia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Correlation analysis between NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers and viremia development suggested that a minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 1/120 is required to prevent ZIKV infection accompanied by viremia (Fig.
