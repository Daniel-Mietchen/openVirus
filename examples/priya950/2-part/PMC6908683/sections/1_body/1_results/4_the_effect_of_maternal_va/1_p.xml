<p id="Par13">It is important to characterize the effect of maternal vaccination on offspring protection against ZIKV infection. We performed three experiments to address this question (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The first experiment examined the protection of maternally transferred immunity against ZIKV infection in pups. Dams subcutaneously immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV at E0.5 developed comparable neutralizing antibody titers of ~1/10,000 at E10.5 and E21 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). One-day-old pups born to the vaccinated dams showed an average neutralizing titer of ~1/3000 ± 1100 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The milk recovered from the pups’ milk spot exhibited an average neutralizing titer of ~1/2500 ± 800 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). These one-day-old pups survived a subcutaneous challenge of 100 PFU PRVABC59 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), whereas naïve pups succumbed to challenges as low as 1 PFU ZIKV (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The results demonstrate that maternal antibodies (transferred to pups through placenta and milk) can protect neonates against ZIKV infection.
