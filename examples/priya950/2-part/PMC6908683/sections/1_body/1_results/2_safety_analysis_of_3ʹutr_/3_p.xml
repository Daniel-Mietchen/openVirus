<p id="Par9">The third safety experiment examined the effect of maternal vaccination on pups’ development and behavior. Behavior tests are believed to provide a more sensitive readout for potential adverse effects than the parameters measured in the two preceding safety experiments. Pups delivered from maternally vaccinated dams (subcutaneously immunized with 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV at E0.5) were subjected to three behavior tests (including rotarod, grip strength, and tail pressure tests) when they reached 6-week-old of age (Supplementary Fig.
