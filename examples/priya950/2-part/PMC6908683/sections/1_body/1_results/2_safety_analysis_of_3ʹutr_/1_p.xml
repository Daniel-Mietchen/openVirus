<p id="Par7">Safety is paramount for vaccine development. We performed three experiments to test the safety of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV in A129 pregnant mice. The first experiment examined potential adverse effects when mice were immunized during early pregnancy. Ten- to twelve-week-old A129 female mice were mated and closely observed for vaginal plugs [that define embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5)]. At E0.5, the pregnant mice were subcutaneously infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU wild-type (WT) ZIKV or 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV. At E18.5, the animals were sacrificed and analyzed for fetal development, viral loads, and neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In the WT virus group, 54% of the fetuses were resorbed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and the weights of non-resorbed fetuses were significantly lower than those from the PBS-challenged placebo group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In contrast, 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV infection did not affect fetal resorption or fetal body weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–d</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in maternal spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), placenta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), or fetal head (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>) from both WT- and 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-infected groups at E18.5, suggesting that viral infections had been cleared by this time point. To increase the detection sensitivity, we also measured viral RNA loads in placenta and fetal head using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). No viral RNA was detected in placenta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>) or fetal head (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>) from the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-infected mice at E18.5; however, the WT virus-infected animals developed viral RNA in every placenta (100%), but none in fetal head from the non-absorbed fetus (0%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i–j</xref>). To further demonstrate that 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV does not infect fetuses at earlier gestation timepoints, we performed qRT-PCR on the placenta and fetus/fetal head harvested at E10.5 and E14.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>); the results showed that 34.6% (9/26) and 7.4% (2/27) of the placenta developed viral RNA, respectively; no viral RNA was detected from any of the fetus/fetal head (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b, c</xref>). At E18.5, robust neutralizing antibody titers were detected in dams (~1/15,300 ± 7000; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>) and fetuses (~1/3700 ± 1800; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>) from both the WT and 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV groups. These results suggest that maternal vaccination of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV does not cause fetal infection, and that maternal-to-fetal antibody transfer may contribute to the neutralizing activity in fetuses.
