<p id="Par16">To validate that antibody alone is sufficient to prevent vertical transmission, we performed passive transfer experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Ten- to twelve-week-old pregnant mice were passively transferred at E9.5 with different amounts of neutralizing antibodies (derived from ZIKV-immunized mice). At E10.5, the pregnant mice were measured for NT
 <sub>50</sub> levels and subcutaneously challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59. The animals were assayed for viremia at E12.5 and organ viral loads at E18.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The passively transferred antibodies at E9.5 led to detectable neutralizing activities at E10.5, and conferred protection against maternal viremia and viral organ loads at E18.5 in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–i</xref>). Correlation analysis showed that distinct minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers were required to protect different tissues/organs against viral infection: ≥1/100 for viremia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>); ≥1/460 for maternal brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>), spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref>), and placenta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h, i</xref>). In addition, a minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> titer of ≥1/460 was required to prevent fetal weight loss during pregnancy infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). Notably, pregnant mice transfused with low levels of neutralizing antibodies (i.e., NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers &lt;1/100) developed higher viral load in maternal spleen than the animals transfused with placebo control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), possibly due to antibody-mediated enhancement. However, no such enhancement was observed for viremia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), maternal brain viral load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), or placenta viral load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>) in the antibody-transfused animals.
