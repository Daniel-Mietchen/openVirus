<p id="Par17">The above results prompted us to examine if pregnant and non-pregnant mice require distinct levels of neutralizing antibodies to prevent apparent ZIKV infection. Ten- to twelve-week-old non-pregnant mice were passively transferred with different amounts of neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). On the next day, the mice were bled for measuring NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers and subcutaneously challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59. Viremia was assayed on day 2 (peak viremia time) and organ viral loads on day 9 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). Correlation analysis suggested that a minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> titer of ≥1/130 was required to prevent non-pregnant mice from viremia and viral loads in brain and spleen (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b–g</xref>). Thus, the minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> titer required to protect pregnant mice (≥1/460) was about 3.5-fold higher than that required to protect non-pregnant mice (≥1/130).
