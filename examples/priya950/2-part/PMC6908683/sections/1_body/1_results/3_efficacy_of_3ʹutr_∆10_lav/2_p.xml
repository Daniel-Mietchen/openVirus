<p id="Par12">Besides vaccination at E0.5, we also tested the efficacy of vaccination at E4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In the mouse pregnancy model, E4.5 is the latest time that could be rationalized for maternal vaccination because (i) six days are needed to allow 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV to elicit protective immunity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and (ii) E10.5 is an optimal infection time to achieve analyzable fetal viral loads and developmental defects

 </sup>. Similar to vaccination at E0.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), immunization at E4.5 elicited robust neutralizing antibody titers (~1/5325 ± 2148; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>) that fully prevented maternal and fetal infections as well as fetal weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c-h</xref>). Challenge with ZIKV PRVABC59 did not significantly boost maternal neutralizing antibody titers in the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-vaccinated dams (Compare Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b, i</xref>). Maternal antibody titers of ~1/980 ± 528 were detected in the fetuses collected at E18.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7j</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that a single maternal vaccination of 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV prevents in utero transmission during pregnancy. Under both vaccination schemes at E0.5 and E4.5, maternal neutralizing antibodies (1/2600 ± 600 and 1/980 ± 530, respectively) were transferred to pups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7j</xref>).
