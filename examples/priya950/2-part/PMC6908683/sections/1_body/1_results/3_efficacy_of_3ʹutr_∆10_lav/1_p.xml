<p id="Par11">We tested the efficacy of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV in maternal vaccination in A129 mice. Ten- to twelve-week-old pregnant A129 mice were subcutaneously immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV at E0.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). High neutralizing antibody titers of ~1/13,200 ± 1700 were detected at E10.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). After subcutaneously challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU Puerto Rico ZIKV strain (PRVABC59) at E10.5, the PBS placebo group developed 8.9 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/ml viremia at E12.5, whereas no viremia was detected from the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). At E18.5, infectious virus was recovered from maternal spleen (50%), brain (83%), placenta (100%), and fetal brain (8%) from the placebo group; whereas no virus was detected in any organs from the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-vaccinated animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d-g</xref>). In addition, 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV vaccination also prevented fetal weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h-i</xref>). Compared with the neutralizing antibody titers detected at E10.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), ZIKV challenge did not increase the maternal neutralizing titers at E18.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>), indicating that the pregnant mice had achieved sterilizing immunity after vaccination. In addition, high maternal neutralizing antibody titers (1/2,600 ± 600) were detected in the fetuses from the vaccinated dams (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>).
