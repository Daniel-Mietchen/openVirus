<p id="Par4">Despite the above promising progress, a number of important questions about ZIKV vaccine research remain to be addressed. Could maternal vaccination (i.e., vaccination during pregnancy) protect against viral infection and in utero transmission? Does pregnancy affect immune responses to ZIKV vaccination? Does maternal immunity derived from vaccination during pregnancy protect newborns against infection? Do pregnant and non-pregnant individuals require different levels of immunity to prevent ZIKV infections? Is neutralizing antibody alone sufficient to prevent in utero transmission? The answers to these questions are critical to guide the clinical development and regulatory approval of ZIKV vaccines.</p>
