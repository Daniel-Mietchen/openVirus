 </sup>. Our results show that maternal vaccination of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV is safe for pregnant mice and fetuses. A single-dose maternal immunization fully protects dams against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission. Neutralizing antibody alone is enough for protection against in utero transmission. However, a higher neutralizing titer is required to prevent in utero transmission in pregnant mice than that required to prevent viral infection in non-pregnant mice. In addition, pregnancy weakens T cell response to 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV immunization. Furthermore, maternal neutralizing antibodies are transferred to offspring to prevent ZIKV infection.
