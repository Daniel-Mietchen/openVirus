<p id="Par20">Besides prevention of in utero transmission, ZIKV vaccine development also has to overcome the challenge of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of closely related dengue virus and vice versa

 </sup>. Recent studies reported that passively transferred DENV-specific antibodies or previous DENV infection could increase ZIKV pathogenesis in pregnant mice through increasing damage to the placenta and developing fetus

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. However, some epidemiologic data do not support the presence of immune enhancement in naturally infected humans

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. More epidemiologic studies are needed to further determine if pre-immunity derived from natural DENV or other flavivirus infection enhances ZIKV infection and congenital syndromes

 </sup>. Vaccination with 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV may mitigate the risk of ADE because it can elicit both humoral and cellular immunity against viral structural and non-structural proteins
