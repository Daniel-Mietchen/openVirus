<p id="Par22">The current study took the advantage of rapid immune response to 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV immunization to study maternal vaccination and protective immunity for vertical transmission in a ZIKV pregnant mouse model. Compared with LAVs, other vaccine platforms (particularly inactivated ZIKV vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine) may be more appropriate for immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women because of their non-infective nature. Although both inactivated ZIKV vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine require multiple doses, the gestation period of human pregnancy is long enough for using them for maternal vaccination. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of different vaccine technologies, it is important to develop multiple vaccine platforms in parallel to provide complementary options for preventing ZIKV infection and disease. Finally, caution should be taken when extrapolating the mouse results to humans because placental biology and antibody transfer are fundamentally different between mouse and human pregnancy.</p>
