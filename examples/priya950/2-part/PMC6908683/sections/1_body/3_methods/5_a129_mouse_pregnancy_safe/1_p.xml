<p id="Par28">A129 mice were bred and housed in pathogen-free mouse facilities at UTMB. Ten- to twelve-week-old female A129 mice were paired with ten-week-old male mice. The vaginal plug was checked daily. Once the plug was identified, the mice were defined at starting embryotic stage (E0.5). The mice were infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU WT ZIKV or 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV by subcutaneous route at E0.5 or E10.5. At E18.5, mice were euthanized and necropsied. Maternal blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Maternal spleen, brain, and placenta were harvest for measuring viral loads. Fetal body weight was measured immediately after necropsy. After decapitation, fetal head and blood were collected for viral load by plaque assay and neutralizing antibody measurement, respectively. All sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min prior to measuring neutralizing antibodies by the mCherry ZIKV reporter virus as described above.
