<p id="Par31">Ten- to twelve-week-old A129 mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV or PBS (placebo group) at E0.5. All the pregnant mice gave birth at full term. The following behavioral experiments were performed on 6-week-old mice. (i) Rotarod test: The motor ability of mice was assessed by determining their performance on a rotarod (AccuScan EzRod, Omnitech Electronics, Inc., Columbus, OH). After three days of training, mice were placed on a rotarod in a ramp acceleration mode (20 rpm/min), and the latency to fall was measured. The values obtained from three trials were averaged on each test day. (ii) Grip strength test: this test was used as another measurement of motor functions. Mice were individually placed on a metal grid attached to a force transducer in a grip strength meter (GT3, Bioseb, Pinellas Park, FL). The mouse was pulled until its grip onto the metal grid is released, and the maximum grip force developed during this procedure was recorded. The values obtained from two trials were averaged. (iii) Tail pressure test: the mechanical nociceptive sensory function of mice was assessed by using a custom-made Randall Selitto device. The tail base of mouse was pressed until the mouse withdraws its tail, and the force evoking such withdrawal was recorded.
