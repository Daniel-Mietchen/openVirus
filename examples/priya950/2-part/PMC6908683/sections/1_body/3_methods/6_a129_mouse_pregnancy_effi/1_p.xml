<p id="Par29">Ten- to twelve-week-old female A129 mice were paired with ten-week-old male mice. The pregnant mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV (∆10) by subcutaneous route at E0.5 or E4.5. At E10.5, the mice were bled by retro orbital sinus (R.O.), and immediately challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 via subcutaneous route. At E12.5, mice were anesthetized and bled via the R.O. for viremia testing. At E18.5, mice were euthanized and necropsied. Maternal blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Maternal spleen, brain, and placenta were harvest for measuring viral loads by plaque assay as described above. Fetal body weight was measured immediately after necropsy. After decapitation, fetal head and blood were collected for viral load by plaque assay and neutralizing antibody measurement as mentioned above, respectively.
