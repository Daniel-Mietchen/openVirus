 </sup>. Briefly, Serum was prepared after coagulation and centrifugation. Then 15 µl of sera was used for 10-fold serial dilutions. For each dilution, 100 µl of diluent was added to 24-well plate with 90% confluency Vero cells for infection of 1 h with swirling every 15 min. After 1 h incubation, 0.5 ml of overlay containing 0.8% methyl cellulose, 2% FBS, and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin was added to each well. The plates were incubated 4 days at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> followed with fixing and staining. The maternal and fetal tissues (harvested at E18.5 from pregnant A129 mice) were homogenized by Qiagen TissueLyser II. The supernatant was used for plaque assay to measure the viral load in tissues after centrifuge. To quantify the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV virus from tissues or blood, immunostaining was performed as previous report

 </sup>. Briefly, after 4 days of incubation, the methyl cellulose overlay was removed, 0.5 ml methanol-acetone (1:1) fixation solution was added per well, and the plate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After removing the fixation solution, the plates were washed three times with PBS, incubated in PBS with 3% FBS for 1 h, and reacted with ZIKV-specific HMAF for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 1 h with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and detected for immunostaining by addition of amino ethylcarbazole substrate following the manufacturer’s instructions (ENZO Life sciences, Farmingdale, MA).
