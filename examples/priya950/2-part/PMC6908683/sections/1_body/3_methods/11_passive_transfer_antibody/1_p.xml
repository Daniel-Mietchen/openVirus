<p id="Par34">Ten- to twelve-week-old female mice were paired with 12-week-old male mice. Mouse immune sera from 3’UTR-∆10-LAV-immunized A129 mice were pooled and passively transferred into pregnant A129 mouse via I.V. route at E9.5. At E10.5, the mice were bled and immediately challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 via subcutaneous route. The mice were bled for measuring viremia at E12.5. At E18.5, dams were euthanized and blood were collected by cardiac puncture. Maternal organs (brain, spleen, and placenta) and fetuses were harvested. Fetal weight was measured immediately after necropsy. After decapitation, fetal head and blood were collected. The viral loads in maternal brain, spleen, and placenta and fetal head were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells
