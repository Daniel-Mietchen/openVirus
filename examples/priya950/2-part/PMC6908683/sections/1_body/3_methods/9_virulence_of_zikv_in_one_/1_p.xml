<p id="Par32">To determine the lethal dose of ZIKV PRVABC59 on one-day-old A129 pups, pups were injected with 1, 10, or 100 PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 via subcutaneous route and monitored for morbidity and mortality. To test the maternal antibody protection against ZIKV infection, one-day-old pups from 3’UTR-∆10-LAV- or PBS-immunized mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 PFU ZIKV PRVABC59. The infected pups were monitored for morbidity and mortality for 21 days.</p>
