 <sup>3</sup> FFU ZIKV-3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV by subcutaneous route. The blood was collected by retro orbital sinus (R.O.) bleeding on days 6, 10, and 14 post-immunization. The sera were collected and used to measure the neutralizing antibody titer using an mCherry ZIKV reporter virus

Briefly, sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, then sera were 2-fold serially diluted starting at 1:50 in DMEM containing 2% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and then incubated with an equal volume of mCherry ZIKV reporter virus at 37 °C for 1 h. Antibody-virus complexes were added to Vero cell monolayers in a 96-well plate which was seeded one day before. At 48 h post-infection (p.i.), mCherry fluorescence-positive cells were quantified by Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Biotek). The fluorescence-positive cells from serum-treated wells were normalized to those of non-treatment controls (set as 100%). A dose-response curve was plotted using GraphPad Prism 7 software (La Jolla, CA), and the effective dilution of sera to reduce 50% of mCherry-positive cells (NT
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis.
