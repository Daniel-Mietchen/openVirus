  <title>The efficacy of 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV in pregnant A129 mice when immunized at E0.5.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Experimental scheme. At E0.5, ten- to twelve-week-old pregnant mice were subcutaneously immunized with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV (Δ10, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) or PBS placebo (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). At E10.5, the pregnant mice were bled for NT
   <sub>50</sub> measurement and subcutaneously challenged with 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU of ZIKV PRVABC59. Viremia was quantified by at E12.5. Maternal and fetal tissues were harvested for analysis at E18.5. 
   <bold>b</bold> Neutralizing antibody titers from PBS- or Δ10-immunized pregnant mice at E10.5. 
   <bold>c</bold> Viremia at E12.5. Viral loads at E18.5 are presented for maternal spleen (
   <bold>d</bold>), brain (
   <bold>e</bold>), placenta (
   <bold>f</bold>), and fetal head (
   <bold>g</bold>). (
   <bold>h</bold>) Fetal body weights at E18.5 from three experimental groups: non-immunized, un-challenge (mock; 
   <italic>left panel</italic>); Δ10-vaccinated, challenged (
   <italic>middle panel</italic>); and PBS-immunized, challenged (
   <italic>right panel</italic>). Asterisks indicate significant differences (one-way ANOVA). ****
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; non-significant (n.s) 
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5. Because the experiments in Figs. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 2 were performed at the same time, the mock group in (
   <bold>h</bold>) is the same as the mock group in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>; this reduced the number of animal use. (
   <bold>i</bold>) Representative images of fetuses collected at E18.5 from the three groups in (
   <bold>h</bold>). Scale bar, 5 mm. (
   <bold>j</bold>) Maternal neutralizing antibody titers from pregnant mice at E18.5. (
   <bold>k</bold>) Fetal neutralizing antibody titers from fetuses at E18.5. Duplicate technical replicates were performed for (
   <bold>j</bold>) and (
   <bold>k</bold>). Error bars represent standard deviations. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
