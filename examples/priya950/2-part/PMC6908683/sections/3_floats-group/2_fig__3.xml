  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Experimental scheme. Ten- to twelve-week-old female A129 mice were subcutaneously immunized with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV (Δ10, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 8) or PBS (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4) at E0.5. At E10.5, the pregnant mice were bled for measuring neutralizing antibody titers. The pups were delivered after a full-term pregnancy at E21. Maternal and fetal blood was harvested on the day of delivery for neutralizing antibody assay. The neonates were divided into three groups. Group 1 pups were collected for fetal blood and milk spots at one-day-old and measured for neutralizing antibody titers. Group 2 pups were subcutaneously challenged at one-day-old with 100 PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 and monitored for survival for 21 days. Group 3 pups were bled every week after weaning to monitor the decline of neutralizing antibody titers; on day 70, these mice were subcutaneously challenged with 10
   <sup>6</sup> FFU ZIKV PRVABC59 and measured for viremia on day 72.
