Maternal immunization with 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV does not cause any adverse effects on pregnancy, fetal development, or offspring behavior. One maternal immunization fully protects dams against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission. Although neutralizing antibody alone is sufficient to prevent in utero transmission, a higher neutralizing titer is required to protect pregnant mice against in utero transmission than that required to protect non-pregnant mice against viral infection. The immunized dams transfer maternal antibodies to pups, which protect neonates against ZIKV infection. Notably, pregnancy weakens maternal T cell response to 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV vaccination.

The most devastating disease of ZIKV infection is congenital Zika syndrome, including microcephaly, congenital malformations, and demise fetuses from infected pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In adults, ZIKV infection is associated with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease that can lead to paralysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. One out of seven infants born to mothers with laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy has birth defects, most likely due to in utero transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Its teratogenic potential and explosive epidemics led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Since then, various ZIKV vaccine platforms have been developed, with the goal to control future epidemics and to prevent congenital syndrome. These vaccine platforms include inactivated, subunit, and live-attenuated vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, some of which have already entered clinical phase I/II trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We previously developed a live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine with a 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3&#x002b9;UTR of viral genome (3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV). A single-dose immunization of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV protected against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission in mice and non-human primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This vaccine candidate has an excellent safety profile, as evidenced by &#x0003e;1000-fold lower neurovirulence than the two licensed, live-attenuated flavivirus vaccines (yellow fever 17D and Japanese encephalitis SA 14-14-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite the above promising progress, a number of important questions about ZIKV vaccine research remain to be addressed. Could maternal vaccination (i.e., vaccination during pregnancy) protect against viral infection and in utero transmission? Does pregnancy affect immune responses to ZIKV vaccination? Does maternal immunity derived from vaccination during pregnancy protect newborns against infection? Do pregnant and non-pregnant individuals require different levels of immunity to prevent ZIKV infections? Is neutralizing antibody alone sufficient to prevent in utero transmission? The answers to these questions are critical to guide the clinical development and regulatory approval of ZIKV vaccines.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we have addressed the above questions by testing 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV in the A129 (interferon &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor-deficient) pregnancy mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our results show that maternal vaccination of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV is safe for pregnant mice and fetuses. A single-dose maternal immunization fully protects dams against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission. Neutralizing antibody alone is enough for protection against in utero transmission. However, a higher neutralizing titer is required to prevent in utero transmission in pregnant mice than that required to prevent viral infection in non-pregnant mice. In addition, pregnancy weakens T cell response to 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV immunization. Furthermore, maternal neutralizing antibodies are transferred to offspring to prevent ZIKV infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rapid immunity and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies</title><p id="Par6">We chose 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV in the current study because it elicits rapid and long-lasting protective immunity after one immunization. A single immunization of ten-week-old A129 mice with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV elicits neutralizing antibody titers (NT<sub>50</sub>, defined as a sera dilution that inhibits 50% viral infection, data represents 1/NT<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviations) of 1/1300&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;310, 1/6800&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;900, and 1/13,900&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3000 on days 6, 10, and 14 post-immunization, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The NT<sub>50</sub> values remain above 1/20,000 at week 55 post-immunization (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Given the short gestation period of 20 days in mice, a rapid development of immunity after 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV immunization is required to study maternal vaccination in a mouse pregnancy model. Other vaccine platforms that require multiple doses (e.g., inactivated vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine) are not suitable for studying maternal vaccination in mice because they cannot elicit protective immunity within the short gestation period in the mouse model. Thus, we chose 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV to evaluate maternal vaccination in a pregnant A129 mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Safety analysis of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV for maternal vaccination</title><p id="Par7">Safety is paramount for vaccine development. We performed three experiments to test the safety of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV in A129 pregnant mice. The first experiment examined potential adverse effects when mice were immunized during early pregnancy. Ten- to twelve-week-old A129 female mice were mated and closely observed for vaginal plugs [that define embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5)]. At E0.5, the pregnant mice were subcutaneously infected with 10<sup>5</sup> FFU wild-type (WT) ZIKV or 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV. At E18.5, the animals were sacrificed and analyzed for fetal development, viral loads, and neutralizing antibody titers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In the WT virus group, 54% of the fetuses were resorbed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and the weights of non-resorbed fetuses were significantly lower than those from the PBS-challenged placebo group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In contrast, 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV infection did not affect fetal resorption or fetal body weight (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b&#x02013;d</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in maternal spleen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), brain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), placenta (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), or fetal head (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>) from both WT- and 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV-infected groups at E18.5, suggesting that viral infections had been cleared by this time point. To increase the detection sensitivity, we also measured viral RNA loads in placenta and fetal head using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). No viral RNA was detected in placenta (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>) or fetal head (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>) from the 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV-infected mice at E18.5; however, the WT virus-infected animals developed viral RNA in every placenta (100%), but none in fetal head from the non-absorbed fetus (0%; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i&#x02013;j</xref>). To further demonstrate that 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV does not infect fetuses at earlier gestation timepoints, we performed qRT-PCR on the placenta and fetus/fetal head harvested at E10.5 and E14.5 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>); the results showed that 34.6% (9/26) and 7.4% (2/27) of the placenta developed viral RNA, respectively; no viral RNA was detected from any of the fetus/fetal head (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b, c</xref>). At E18.5, robust neutralizing antibody titers were detected in dams (~1/15,300&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7000; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>) and fetuses (~1/3700&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1800; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>) from both the WT and 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV groups. These results suggest that maternal vaccination of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV does not cause fetal infection, and that maternal-to-fetal antibody transfer may contribute to the neutralizing activity in fetuses.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The safety of 3&#x02032;UTR-&#x00394;10-LAV in pregnant A129 mice when vaccinated at E0.5.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Experimental scheme.

Compared with the licensed flavivirus vaccines, a successful ZIKV vaccine has to overcome the unique challenge of protecting pregnant women against in utero viral transmission. Thus, it is essential to determine the correlations of protection against ZIKV infection in non-pregnant individuals as well as against in utero transmission in pregnant women. Given the decline of ZIKV human cases, identifying these parameters has become even more critical to guide the ongoing clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Our study has demonstrated that neutralizing antibody alone is sufficient to protect against apparent ZIKV infection as well as in utero transmission in mice. However, a higher neutralizing antibody titer is required to prevent in utero transmission (NT<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1/460) than that required to prevent apparent ZIKV infection in non-pregnant mice (NT<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1/130). The requirement of NT<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1/460 for prevention of in utero transmission was supported by two different types of experiments: pregnant mice with waned antibody levels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>) and pregnant mice with passively transferred antibodies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The requirement of NT<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1/130 for prevention of apparent ZIKV infection in non-pregnant mice is in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Besides the different requirements for protective NT<sub>50</sub> titers between pregnancy and non-pregnancy, we also found that pregnancy has a lower T cell response and cytokine production after 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV vaccination. This is not surprising as pregnancy has been well documented to alter systemic immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Future studies are needed to define the mechanism and impact of such pregnancy-mediated T cell attenuation on the development of humoral immunity.</p><p id="Par20">Besides prevention of in utero transmission, ZIKV vaccine development also has to overcome the challenge of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of closely related dengue virus and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Recent studies reported that passively transferred DENV-specific antibodies or previous DENV infection could increase ZIKV pathogenesis in pregnant mice through increasing damage to the placenta and developing fetus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, some epidemiologic data do not support the presence of immune enhancement in naturally infected humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. More epidemiologic studies are needed to further determine if pre-immunity derived from natural DENV or other flavivirus infection enhances ZIKV infection and congenital syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Vaccination with 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV may mitigate the risk of ADE because it can elicit both humoral and cellular immunity against viral structural and non-structural proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This concept has been proposed to explain the undesirable outcome for the licensed Dengvaxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">We explored the possibility of maternal vaccination to prevent in utero transmission during pregnancy. Our results indicate that 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV has an excellent safety profile for maternal vaccination: no detectable infectious virus or viral RNA in fetal heads after vaccination, and no detectable adverse effects on murine pregnancy, fetal development, or offspring behavior. Despite these promising results, we could not exclude the possibility that maternal vaccination may cause subtle adverse effect on fetal development that could not be detected by the current assays. Infection of placenta with WT ZIKV was recently shown to mediate pregnancy complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, suggesting that even a very low level of 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV replication in maternal organs might cause potential immunopathology in developing fetuses. Nevertheless, we showed that a single maternal vaccination of 10<sup>3</sup> FFU 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV probably conferred sterilizing immunity, prevented apparent in utero transmission, transferred maternal antibodies to pups, and protected neonates against ZIKV infection. However, the protection of offspring declined as the maternal neutralizing antibody titers waned. Altogether, the results suggest that 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV may be considered for maternal vaccination. In support of this idea, maternal vaccination is recommended by the WHO for yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines during outbreaks in endemic regions or when the risk of viral infection is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Other successful maternal vaccines, such as Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), are recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to all pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. After all, it should be emphasized that an ideal vaccination strategy for ZIKV is to immunize children before they reach child-bearing age.</p><p id="Par22">The current study took the advantage of rapid immune response to 3&#x002b9;UTR-&#x02206;10-LAV immunization to study maternal vaccination and protective immunity for vertical transmission in a ZIKV pregnant mouse model. Compared with LAVs, other vaccine platforms (particularly inactivated ZIKV vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine) may be more appropriate for immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women because of their non-infective nature. Although both inactivated ZIKV vaccine or DNA subunit vaccine require multiple doses, the gestation period of human pregnancy is long enough for using them for maternal vaccination. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of different vaccine technologies, it is important to develop multiple vaccine platforms in parallel to provide complementary options for preventing ZIKV infection and disease. Finally, caution should be taken when extrapolating the mouse results to humans because placental biology and antibody transfer are fundamentally different between mouse and human pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par23">Mouse studies were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).
