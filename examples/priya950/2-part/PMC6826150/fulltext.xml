The development of a specific inflammation in mice that had been infected by
two influenza virus strains, A/chicken/Kurgan/5/2005 (H5N1) and A/Hamburg/2009
MA (H1N1), was studied. We investigated the effect of a non-toxic
lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter capsulatus PG on the survival and body
weight of the mice, production of IgG antibodies, and the induction of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines in blood serum. The administration of the R.
capsulatus PG lipopolysaccharide was shown to induce interferon-&#x003b2;
synthesis, both in healthy and influenza A virus-infected mice, and to promote
production of antiviral antibodies in the blood of the influenza-infected
animals.

Influenza epidemics have, to date, affected millions of people across the world
despite the use of recommended vaccines, whose effectiveness proves lower than expected [
<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
Influenza A viruses have a high degree of genomic variation
and produce resistant strains that can be controlled by vaccines or antiviral
systemic medication for some time. The development of safe and effective
vaccines remains an important public health goal.
</p><p>
The interaction of viral components with various receptors activates the
intracellular pathways responsible for the secretion of type I IFN,
pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. The key factors involved in the
recognition of viral ligands are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of innate
immune cells. TLR2 and TLR4, situated on the cell surface, recognize viral
envelope glyco/lipoproteins, while intracellular endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8,
and TLR9 recognize nucleic acids [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Toll-like receptors can interact with
other receptors, thereby stimulating the response of innate immune cells to
pathogens, including influenza viruses [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
TLR4 can be activated by damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), which are molecular structures released by virus-infected
cells [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Different influenza strains
activate cells through various mechanisms, which lead to the synthesis of
various cytokines and chemokines [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
</p><p>
Compound E5564 (Eritoran), a synthetic analogue of the non-toxic lipid A from
Rhodobacter sphaeroides, when administered in a certain regimen to C57BL/6J
mice, was shown to protect mice from death caused by the mouse-adapted H1N1
influenza virus [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The nuclear
non-histone high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein/amphoterin, which is a
DAMP, is known to be released relatively late after the infection onset and is
involved in the development of both gram-negative sepsis and influenza
complications, interacting with MD-2 and activating TLR4
[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TLR4 activation leads to a cytokine storm
with an accentuated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
interferons, tumor necrosis factors, interleukins, and chemokines
[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pharmacological blockade of TLR4 by
Eritoran can significantly reduce mouse mortality from avian influenza
[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a
phototrophic bacterium R. capsulatus PG (Rb.) strain
[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with a lipid A structure
similar to that of lipid A from
R. sphaeroides, is an endotoxin antagonist that inhibits activation of the
synthesis of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines by human blood cells
[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], an indication of its ability to block
TLR4.
</p><p>
Mice are the main tools used for studying the human immune system and immune
responses. However, there are significant differences between the innate and
adaptive immune systems of mice and those of humans, which reside in the blood
cell ratio, plasma composition, surface receptors, the expression levels of
various cytokines and chemokines, etc.
[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
This should be considered when using mice as human disease models.
</p><p>
In this paper, we studied the effect of a non-toxic Rb. LPS on the induction of
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and survival rates of mice infected with
various influenza A strains. The study aim was to investigate the features of
the inflammatory processes caused by H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses.
</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><p>
The following ELISA kits were used: mouse TNF alpha platinum ELISA, mouse IL-6
platinum ELISA, mouse IL-10 platinum ELISA, and mouse INF gamma platinum ELISA
(eBioscience, USA), as well as a mouse IFN beta ELISA kit (PBL Assay Science,
USA).
</p><p>
The Rb. LPS was produced in a laboratory of the Institute of Basic Biological
Problems, according to the procedure described previously
[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
</p><p>
<bold>Viruses</bold>
</p><p>
We used the following influenza A virus strains: chicken/Kurgan/5/2005 (H5N1)
and mouse-adapted Hamburg/2009 MA (H1N1). Viruses were cultured in chicken
embryos. The virus median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was
determined by titration in a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture. The
median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) was determined by titration in mice.
Experiments with the highly pathogenic A/ chicken/Kurgan/5/2005 virus were
performed in boxes with the BSL-3 safety level.
</p><p>
<bold>Mice</bold>
</p><p>
We used 10&#x02013;14 g Balb/c mice, 36&#x02013;38 days of age, regardless of
gender. The animals originated in the nursery of the Scientific Center for
Biomedical Technology of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency. All
manipulations with the animals were performed according to the Rules of
Laboratory Practice in the Russian Federation
[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], in compliance with biological
ethics in experiments on laboratory animals.
</p><p>
<bold>Experimental influenza infection in mice infected with the influenza
virus strain H5N1</bold>
</p><p>
Mice were divided into six groups depending on the received drugs. Each group
included at least 12 animals. The animals in the five groups were infected,
under light ether anesthesia, intranasally (50 &#x003bc;L each) with the highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 at doses of 10 to 105 TCID50 per mouse,
which amounted to 10&#x02013;1 to 103 LD<sub>50</sub>. The sixth control group
remained uninfected. After 24 h, all groups were divided in half. One half of
the animals was injected intraperitoneally with 500 &#x003bc;L/mouse of saline
daily for the following 4 days, and the other half was injected with the Rb.
LPS at a dose of 400 &#x003bc;g/500 &#x003bc;L/mouse. Mice not injected with any
agents were the controls. The experimental design is shown
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Blood was
sampled from the animals that survived by the end of the experiment (day 14),
after euthanasia in a CO<sub>2</sub> chamber; blood cells were precipitated;
and the resulting serum was frozen at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until the H5N1 influenza
virus antibody titer in the serum was determined by ELISA.

The mice were divided into three groups depending on the received drugs. Each
group included at least 12 animals. Two groups of mice were infected, under
mild ether anesthesia, intranasally (50 &#x003bc;L each) with the mouse-adapted
H1N1 influenza virus at doses of 10 and 300 TCID50 per mouse. The control group
included uninfected mice. Two days after infection, all groups were divided in
half. One half of the animals was injected intraperitoneally with 500
&#x003bc;L/mouse of saline daily for the following 4 days, and the other half was
injected with the Rb. LPS at a dose of 400 &#x003bc;g/500 &#x003bc;L/mouse. Mice not
injected with any agents were the controls. The experimental design is shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>.
Five hours after administration of the Rb. LPS, blood was sampled in
three mice from each group, after euthanasia in a CO<sub>2</sub> chamber, on
days 3, 4, and 5. The blood was centrifuged, and the resulting serum was frozen
at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C until the cytokine levels were determined by ELISA. Blood
was sampled from the animals that had survived by the end of the experiment
(day 14), after euthanasia in a CO<sub>2</sub> chamber; blood cells were
precipitated, and the resulting serum was frozen at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C until the
serum levels of the H1N1 influenza virus IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were
determined by ELISA.

<bold>Determining influenza virus antibody levels</bold>
</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p>
To determine the levels of antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) of the H5N1 and
H1N1 influenza viruses in the serum of the mice, allantoic fluid containing 64
HA units of one of the viruses was added to a plate sensitized with fetuin,
kept at 40&#x000b0;C overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4
with 0.1% Tween-20, and blocked with buffer A (0.1% Tween-20, 0.2% BSA in PBS)
for 1 h. To determine the IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, each serum sample was
titrated on two different plates. The blocking solution was removed, and wells
were added with 100 &#x003bc;L of the serum from H5N1-infected mice at 1 : 40 to 1
: 2,560 dilutions or from H1N1-infected mice at 1 : 50 to 1 : 3,200 dilutions
in buffer A. Plates were incubated at 40&#x000b0;C for 4 h, washed with PBS, added
with horseradish peroxidase- labeled rabbit antibodies against mouse
immunoglobulins (Sigma, USA) or against mouse IgG1 or IgG2a, and incubated at
40&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Then, the plates were washed with PBS and stained with
ortho-phenylenediamine. The optical density of the samples was measured using
an AIFR-01 Uniplan immunoassay analyzer (Picon, Russia) at a wavelength of 492
nm. Control wells without viral particles were used to exclude nonspecific
binding. The antibody level in the samples was expressed as serum dilution
enabling a signal exceeding twice the background value.

Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (AtteStat plugin) and OriginPro 7.5 were used for
statistical analysis and graphical presentation of our data. Statistically
significant differences between the results were evaluated using a
nonparametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. Differences were considered
significant at a significance level p &#x0003c; 0.05.

The condition of the experimental animals was evaluated based on survival and
body weight changes. The administration of the Rb. LPS into the control mice,
as well as infection with a minimum dose of 10 TCID50 of the H5N1 virus,
regardless of Rb. LPS administration, did not affect the survival rates of the
animals up to the end of the experiment (day 14)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Deaths of animals in
the groups infected with doses of 102/103 and 104/105TCID50 of the H5N1 virus
began on days 8 and 6 after infection, respectively. All mice that had received
103, 104, and 105 TCID50 of the influenza virus died by day 10 after the
infection, regardless of Rb. LPS administration. Additional administration of
the Rb. LPS to mice infected with the influenza virus at a dose of 102 TCID50
increased their mortality
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).
The curves of weight changes revealed that
introduction of the Rb. LPS into healthy animals did not affect their condition
and weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).
Mice infected with 10&#x02013;102 TCID50 of the virus
continued to gain weight throughout the experiment. Infection with doses of
103&#x02013;105 TCID50 significantly affected the condition of the animals,
causing significant inflammation and rapid weight loss. Additional
administration of the Rb. LPS to infected animals led to even greater weight
loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

The administration of the Rb. LPS to the control mice and infection with a dose
of 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 influenza virus, followed by the administration of the
Rb. LPS, did not affect the survival rate of the animals until the end of the
experiment (day 12). In the group of mice infected with the influenza virus at
a dose of 300 TCID50, 14% of the mice survived until the end of the experiment;
additional administration of the Rb. LPS increased mortality in mice
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).
An analysis of weight change curves showed that the administration of the Rb.
LPS to healthy mice did not affect the condition and weight of the control
animals. Mice infected with 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 virus showed no signs of
disease and began rapidly gaining weight on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after
infection, until the end of the experiment (day 12). Additional administration
of the Rb. LPS to the animals infected with the virus at this dose led to a
decrease in the animals&#x02019; weight after day 7 of the experiment. Virus
infection (300 TCID50) markedly affected the condition of the mice, causing
significant inflammation and weight loss. The administration of the Rb. LPS to
infected mice worsened the condition of the animals and led to additional
weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).

Survival and weight changes in the animals infected with the H5N1 or H1N1
influenza virus revealed the absence of a protective effect on the part of the
Rb. LPS on mice against a lethal infection
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>,

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Daily (for 5 days)
intravenous administration of Eritoran starting 2 days after infection was
shown to protect mice from the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Protection
from DAMPs released from influenza infected and destroyed cells that occurred
through the TLR4- dependent mechanism [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
The virus type determines the response mechanisms of
innate immunity to infection. The signaling pathways in an infection caused by
different H5N1 and H1N1 virus strains differ and determine the survival rate
and pathology of the inflammation [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
Obviously, the infection in our experiments develops through molecular
mechanisms other than cell activation through the TLR4 pathway. Probably, the
administration regiment and Rb. LPS concentration used in our experiments were
ineffective in protecting against these viral strains.

Signs of viral infection include an increased induction of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3;,
which have antiviral effects [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AN20758251-11-3-046-g007"/></fig><p>
The administration of the Rb. LPS to mice caused a 1.5-fold increase in the
TNF-&#x003b1; level in blood serum compared to that in the control mice by day 3,
which remained at about the same level until day 5 of the experiment. It should
be noted that the serum TNF-&#x003b1; level in the control mice was quite high
(74.7 &#x000b1; 8.7 pg/mL), indicating a sensitized state of the animals.
Production of TNF-&#x003b1; in the blood of the influenza-infected mice depended
on the virus dose and showed positive dynamics during the experiment. The
administration of the Rb. LPS to infected mice enhanced TNF-&#x003b1; production
in their blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>).
</p><p>
The dynamics of IL-6 synthesis in all experiment variants was similar. The IL-6
level increased significantly (1000- to 2000-fold) by day 4 of the experiment.
IL-6 production in the infected mice depended on the virus dose. The IL-6 level
in response to the introduction of the Rb. LPS was comparable to that in the
influenza-infected mice. The administration of the Rb. LPS to infected mice
slightly increased IL-6 production by day 5 of the experiment
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). These
findings demonstrate that a viral infection causes a dose-dependent induction
of the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, with
the induction increasing with time. These cytokines are produced mainly by
monocytes and macrophages in response to both bacteria and viruses, using
independent signaling pathways involving different surface and intracellular
receptors but the same adapter proteins and transcription factors. The data on
the induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 synthesis show that the administration of
the Rb. LPS to influenza-infected mice enhanced the pro-inflammatory response

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>).
This worsened the condition of the animals,
as evidenced by the data on the survival rate and weight changes
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).

The administration of the Rb. LPS into mice caused an increase in the
anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine level that exceeded the baseline level 3-fold
by day 5. The influenza virus, regardless of the dose, had no effect on the
production of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine. The administration of the
Rb. LPS into infected mice, regardless of the virus dose, had almost no bearing
on the induction of IL-10 synthesis compared to the administration of the Rb.
LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).
The immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 is a key component of
the system that regulates excessive immune responses by suppressing the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-1
[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
Levels of IL-10 production in response to LPS are
significantly higher than those in a viral infection
[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
The obtained results indicate an increase in the IL-10 level in response to the
administration of the Rb. LPS into both healthy and influenza-infected mice.
This may indicate that the Rb. LPS promotes enhanced anti-inflammatory
responses by cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).
</p><p>
These findings indicate a lack of IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to the
administration of the Rb. LPS to mice. The influenza virus increases the blood
IFN-&#x003b3; level in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, additional
administration of the Rb. LPS to mice infected with the H1N1 influenza virus
reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production in their blood
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>).
</p><p>
Having no effect on the production of IFN-&#x003b3;, the Rb. LPS caused a 4-fold
increase in the IFN-&#x003b2; production compared to the control level by day 4 of
the experiment. On day 5, the IFN-&#x003b2; level had decreased to its baseline
value. In response to a H1N1 virus infection at a dose of 10 TCID50, the
IFN-&#x003b2; level increased 3-fold by day 5 of the experiment. The influenza
virus at a dose of 300 TCID50 significantly increased the induction of
IFN-&#x003b2; (16-fold), compared to the baseline value by day 4. The
administration of the Rb. LPS to mice infected with 10 TCID50 and 300 TCID50 of
the influenza virus enhanced or decreased, respectively, the cytokine level,
compared to that in mice infected with the influenza virus alone
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>).
</p><p>
These results demonstrated that the levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and IFN-&#x003b2;
synthesized in response to the used Rb. LPS administration schedule were
insufficient for an effective antiviral protection against the virus strains
under study.
</p><p>
IFN-&#x003b2;, a component of the influenza vaccine, acts as a powerful adjuvant
and helps induce the synthesis of IgG2a and IgA, providing protection against
infection. Production of IgG2a antibodies, which is characteristic of the
response to a viral infection, has a protective and neutralizing effect against
influenza viruses. Expression of type I IFN and generation of IgG2a antibodies
in a viral infection are interrelated events of biological significance for
subsequent protective immunity [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

The action of existing vaccines against an influenza virus infection is based
mainly on the induction of neutralizing antibody synthesis in response to viral
HA [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Determination of the level of
H5N1 virus HA antibodies in mouse serum revealed that the higher the infective
virus dose, the higher the titer of serum antibodies in the infected animals.
Additional administration of the Rb. LPS to H5N1-infected mice resulted in a
significant increase in the antibody titer (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in blood serum
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).

Determination of IgG1 and IgG2a antibody levels in response to the H1N1 virus
infection showed that IgG2a titers were significantly higher than the IgG1
titers in all the groups of animals. Introduction of the Rb. LPS statistically
significantly increased the serum IgG2a level compared to influenza-infected
mice without additional administration of the Rb. LPS (p &#x0003c; 0.05)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>).
</p><p>
The innate immune response is crucial in the fight against viruses and plays a
key role in the induction and regulation of adaptive immune responses. For this
reason, TLR ligands are considered as potential adjuvants for inclusion in
vaccines. Simultaneous delivery of a TLR ligand and an antigen of interest is
believed to be more effective than vaccination with a mixture of an adjuvant
and an antigen [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
</p><p>
Our findings demonstrate that the administration of the Rb. LPS to mice
promotes IFN-&#x003b2; production
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>)
or controls the blood IFN-&#x003b2; level
in mice infected with various doses of the influenza virus. IFN-&#x003b2; promotes
antibody production by acquired immunity cells [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
Our findings also demonstrate that additional
administration of the Rb. LPS leads to the production of antibodies in the
blood of animals infected with the influenza A virus
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>).
</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
Our study has demonstrated that the nontoxic natural Rb. LPS promotes the
production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IFN-&#x003b2; both in healthy mice and
in animals infected with influenza A/chicken/Kurgan/ 5/2005 (H5N1) and
A/Hamburg/2009 MA (H1N1) strains and also promotes the production of antibodies
to the HA of these strains in the blood of infected animals.
