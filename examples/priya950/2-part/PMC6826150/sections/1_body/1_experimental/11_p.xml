<p> The mice were divided into three groups depending on the received drugs. Each group included at least 12 animals. Two groups of mice were infected, under mild ether anesthesia, intranasally (50 μL each) with the mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus at doses of 10 and 300 TCID50 per mouse. The control group included uninfected mice. Two days after infection, all groups were divided in half. One half of the animals was injected intraperitoneally with 500 μL/mouse of saline daily for the following 4 days, and the other half was injected with the Rb. LPS at a dose of 400 μg/500 μL/mouse. Mice not injected with any agents were the controls. The experimental design is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. Five hours after administration of the Rb. LPS, blood was sampled in three mice from each group, after euthanasia in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber, on days 3, 4, and 5. The blood was centrifuged, and the resulting serum was frozen at –20 °C until the cytokine levels were determined by ELISA. Blood was sampled from the animals that had survived by the end of the experiment (day 14), after euthanasia in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber; blood cells were precipitated, and the resulting serum was frozen at –20 °C until the serum levels of the H1N1 influenza virus IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were determined by ELISA.
