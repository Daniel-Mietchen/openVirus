<p> We used the following influenza A virus strains: chicken/Kurgan/5/2005 (H5N1) and mouse-adapted Hamburg/2009 MA (H1N1). Viruses were cultured in chicken embryos. The virus median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined by titration in a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture. The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by titration in mice. Experiments with the highly pathogenic A/ chicken/Kurgan/5/2005 virus were performed in boxes with the BSL-3 safety level.
