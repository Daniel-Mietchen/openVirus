<p> Our study has demonstrated that the nontoxic natural Rb. LPS promotes the production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IFN-Î² both in healthy mice and in animals infected with influenza A/chicken/Kurgan/ 5/2005 (H5N1) and A/Hamburg/2009 MA (H1N1) strains and also promotes the production of antibodies to the HA of these strains in the blood of infected animals. </p>
