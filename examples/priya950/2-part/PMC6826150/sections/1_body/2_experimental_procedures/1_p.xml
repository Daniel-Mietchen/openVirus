<p> To determine the levels of antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) of the H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses in the serum of the mice, allantoic fluid containing 64 HA units of one of the viruses was added to a plate sensitized with fetuin, kept at 40°C overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 with 0.1% Tween-20, and blocked with buffer A (0.1% Tween-20, 0.2% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. To determine the IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, each serum sample was titrated on two different plates. The blocking solution was removed, and wells were added with 100 μL of the serum from H5N1-infected mice at 1 : 40 to 1 : 2,560 dilutions or from H1N1-infected mice at 1 : 50 to 1 : 3,200 dilutions in buffer A. Plates were incubated at 40°C for 4 h, washed with PBS, added with horseradish peroxidase- labeled rabbit antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins (Sigma, USA) or against mouse IgG1 or IgG2a, and incubated at 40°C for 2 h. Then, the plates were washed with PBS and stained with ortho-phenylenediamine. The optical density of the samples was measured using an AIFR-01 Uniplan immunoassay analyzer (Picon, Russia) at a wavelength of 492 nm. Control wells without viral particles were used to exclude nonspecific binding. The antibody level in the samples was expressed as serum dilution enabling a signal exceeding twice the background value. </p>
