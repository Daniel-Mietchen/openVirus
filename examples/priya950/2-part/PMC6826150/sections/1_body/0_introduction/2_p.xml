<p> The interaction of viral components with various receptors activates the intracellular pathways responsible for the secretion of type I IFN, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. The key factors involved in the recognition of viral ligands are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of innate immune cells. TLR2 and TLR4, situated on the cell surface, recognize viral envelope glyco/lipoproteins, while intracellular endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 recognize nucleic acids [
