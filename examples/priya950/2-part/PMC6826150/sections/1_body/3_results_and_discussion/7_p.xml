<p> The administration of the Rb. LPS into mice caused an increase in the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine level that exceeded the baseline level 3-fold by day 5. The influenza virus, regardless of the dose, had no effect on the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine. The administration of the Rb. LPS into infected mice, regardless of the virus dose, had almost no bearing on the induction of IL-10 synthesis compared to the administration of the Rb. LPS alone (
