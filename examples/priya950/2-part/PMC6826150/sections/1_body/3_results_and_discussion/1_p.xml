<p> The condition of the experimental animals was evaluated based on survival and body weight changes. The administration of the Rb. LPS into the control mice, as well as infection with a minimum dose of 10 TCID50 of the H5N1 virus, regardless of Rb. LPS administration, did not affect the survival rates of the animals up to the end of the experiment (day 14) (

All mice that had received 103, 104, and 105 TCID50 of the influenza virus died by day 10 after the infection, regardless of Rb. LPS administration. Additional administration of the Rb. LPS to mice infected with the influenza virus at a dose of 102 TCID50 increased their mortality (

Infection with doses of 103–105 TCID50 significantly affected the condition of the animals, causing significant inflammation and rapid weight loss. Additional administration of the Rb. LPS to infected animals led to even greater weight loss (
