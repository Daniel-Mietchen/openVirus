<p> Having no effect on the production of IFN-γ, the Rb. LPS caused a 4-fold increase in the IFN-β production compared to the control level by day 4 of the experiment. On day 5, the IFN-β level had decreased to its baseline value. In response to a H1N1 virus infection at a dose of 10 TCID50, the IFN-β level increased 3-fold by day 5 of the experiment. The influenza virus at a dose of 300 TCID50 significantly increased the induction of IFN-β (16-fold), compared to the baseline value by day 4. The administration of the Rb. LPS to mice infected with 10 TCID50 and 300 TCID50 of the influenza virus enhanced or decreased, respectively, the cytokine level, compared to that in mice infected with the influenza virus alone (
