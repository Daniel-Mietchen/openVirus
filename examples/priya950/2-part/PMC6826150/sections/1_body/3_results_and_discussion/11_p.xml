<p> IFN-Î², a component of the influenza vaccine, acts as a powerful adjuvant and helps induce the synthesis of IgG2a and IgA, providing protection against infection. Production of IgG2a antibodies, which is characteristic of the response to a viral infection, has a protective and neutralizing effect against influenza viruses. Expression of type I IFN and generation of IgG2a antibodies in a viral infection are interrelated events of biological significance for subsequent protective immunity [
