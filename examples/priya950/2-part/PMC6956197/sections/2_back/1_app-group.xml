RNA of five workers from each of the three additional colonies (colony 1–3, denoted as C1, 2 and 3) was extracted and used as the template for cDNA synthesis using oligo-dT primer and the strand-specific primer. cDNA was then added to the subsequent PCR reaction in which the target viral fragment was amplified. The presence of TR44839 virus is conformed if a 130 bp fragment is amplified by the PCR reaction with template cDNA synthesized using oligo-dT primer (lane 1–3), whereas active replication is evident if a 130 bp fragment is amplified by the PCR reaction with template cDNA synthesized using the strand-specific primer (lane 4–6). M, 100 bp DNA ladder; B, blank; N, negative control; P, positive control. Supplementary Figure S2: Intercolonial aggression level of colony pairs involving two colonies collected from the same site. The numbers of pairwise aggression test are 6, 21 and 9 in Okinawa, Taiwan and Penang, respectively. Different letters indicate the significant differences in aggression level between islands (
