<p>We inoculated three virus-free 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic> colonies by feeding them with a 10% virus-contaminated honey solution, and all the colonies were invariably found positive to TR44839 virus infection as both positive and negative strands of the virus were detected at Day 7 after feeding (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-10-00436">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Hence, we confirmed that the TR44839 virus can be horizontally transmitted among colonies and actively replicate in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic>. TR44839 virus occurred in all 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic> colonies in Okinawa and Taiwan (infection rate 100%), while variations in viral prevalence were observed across the study sites in Penang. Virus-infected colonies in Penang were mostly found in MY1 (100%), whereas the infection rate was lower in sites MY2 (31%), and none in MY3 (0%) (
