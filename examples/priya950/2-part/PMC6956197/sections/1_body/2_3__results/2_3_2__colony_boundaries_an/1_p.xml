<p>We found significant differences in aggression levels between the three islands (Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test: χ

Interestingly, individual workers from within-site colony pairs in Taiwan frequently displayed “biting”, but rarely “prolonged aggression”. The highest level of within-site aggression (i.e., level 4) was commonly observed in colony pairs involving colonies collected from the Penang island (

In Taiwan, the within-site aggression level could be divided into two groups, with one group showing little aggression (TW1-TW4) and the other group showing high aggression (TW5-TW7). Mapping the aggression level onto the map revealed a general trend in which aggressive behavior decreased as the latitude increased (
