Zika subunit vaccines, however, have shown poor performance in preclinical studies, most likely because the antigens tested do not display critical quaternary structure epitopes present on Zika E protein homodimers that cover the surface of the virus. Here, we produce stable recombinant E protein homodimers that are recognized by strongly neutralizing Zika specific monoclonal antibodies. In mice, the dimeric antigen stimulate strongly neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes that are similar to epitopes recognized by human antibodies following natural Zika virus infection. The monomer antigen stimulates low levels of E-domain III targeting neutralizing antibodies. In a Zika challenge model, only E dimer antigen stimulates protective antibodies, not the monomer.

As a member of the flavivirus genus, ZIKV shares many structural features with other medically important flaviviruses such as Wes Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and dengue virus (DENV). The flavivirus envelope (E) protein is a major target of neutralizing and protective human antibodies. E oligomers form complex quaternary structure epitopes on the viral surface which are of particular importance as protective human antibodies bind to these higher order protein structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">ZIKV infection during pregnancy can result in neurodevelopmental defects (congenital Zika syndrome). This has stimulated work on subunit vaccines, as live attenuated and other replicating virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy. However, for flaviviruses subunit vaccines based on recombinant E proteins (rE) have performed poorly in preclinical studies compared with virus or virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In aqueous solution, flavivirus rE proteins are in a dynamic equilibrium that favors the monomer over the dimer at physiological temperature, which likely explains poor binding by potently neutralizing human antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes and the overall poor immunogenicity of these antigens in preclinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we investigate if ZIKV rE dimers are better subunit vaccine antigens than monomers. Unlike the E monomer, the dimer is recognized by strongly neutralizing mAbs isolated from ZIKV patients and the dimer, not the monomer, stimulates strongly neutralizing and protective antibodies that targeted epitopes that were similar to epitopes recognized by human antibodies following natural Zika virus infection. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines. The flavivirus field has a long history of using E monomers as vaccine antigens with limited success. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines, and are applicable to developing second generation subunit vaccines against Zika as well as other medically important flaviviruses like dengue and yellow fever.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Expression of ZIKV rE monomers and homodimers</title><p id="Par6">Here, to investigate if ZIKV rE dimers are better subunit vaccine antigens than monomers, we expressed ZIKV rE variants (aa1&#x02013;402) that are monomers (rE<sup>M</sup>) or stable dimers (rE<sup>D</sup>) under physiological conditions.

Many flavivirus type-specific antibodies recognize relatively simple epitopes on domain III of the E protein (EDIII), whereas other type-specific antibodies recognize more complex quaternary structure epitopes displayed on E protein homodimers or higher order structures that cover the viral surface. Most EDIII-specific neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from mice immunized with inactivated flavivirus antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, most quaternary epitope directed neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from people infected with wild-type flaviviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In fact, recent studies demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to flavivirus infections or effective live attenuated vaccines predominantly recognize quaternary epitopes, with simple EDIII epitopes accounting for only a minor fraction of neutralizing antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To compare levels of EDIII directed antibodies in animals immunized with rE<sup>M</sup> or rE<sup>D</sup>, we used recombinant ZIKV-EDIII conjugated to magnetic beads to deplete mouse immune sera of EDIII-binding antibodies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We tested control-depleted and EDIII antibody depleted immune sera to estimate the levels of binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and neutralizing antibodies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) in each sample targeting epitopes on EDIII. In mice immunized with rE<sup>M</sup>, ~70% (rE<sup>M</sup> group) and ~60% (rE<sup>M</sup>+alum group) of total ZIKV-specific IgG recognized epitopes on EDIII (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). On the other hand, significantly less EDIII-specific antibodies were induced after immunization with rE<sup>D</sup> (~30% for rE<sup>D</sup> and ~20% for rE<sup>D</sup>+alum). The antibody binding patterns were also reflected in the ZIKV neutralization assays. The majority of neutralizing antibodies in the rE<sup>M</sup>+alum group were lost following depletion with EDIII antigen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

We conclude that the rE<sup>M</sup> antigen induces an EDIII focused antibody response that is poorly neutralizing, whereas rE<sup>D</sup> antigens stimulate robust neutralizing antibody responses that target epitopes distinct from simple EDIII epitopes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>ZIKV rE<sup>D</sup> stimulates antibodies that target complex epitopes on the virion. <bold>a</bold> Method for depleting EDIII-binding antibodies from mouse immune sera.

While effective live attenuated vaccines have been developed for several flaviviruses, they are contraindicated in pregnant women. Live vaccines typically are ineffective during the first year of life because maternal antibodies interfere with vaccine replication. It has been difficult to formulate tetravalent live attenuated DENV vaccines that stimulate balanced and effective responses to each serotype because of differential replication of vaccine virus components. Subunit vaccines may address some of these challenges, but progress has been slow and subunit vaccines have not performed well in non-human primate models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our studies offer a potential explanation for the poor performance of subunit vaccines and a strategy for developing more effective flavivirus vaccines. Our results demonstrate that a critical aspect of rE antigen design is to develop E proteins that display complex quaternary epitopes that recapitulate antigen presentation on the surface of infectious virus particles. Here we demonstrate that ZIKV rE<sup>M</sup> and rE<sup>D</sup> subunit antigens induce antibody responses that differ in functionality and domain focus. ZIKV rE monomers stimulated an EDIII biased, poorly neutralizing IgG response. In contrast, ZIKV rE dimers induced strongly neutralizing and protective antibodies that also blocked the binding of strongly neutralizing human mAbs to quaternary epitopes on ZIKV. While finer mapping studies are required to comprehensively map the specificity of rE<sup>D</sup> stimulated antibodies, our studies suggest that by designing the E protein to be a stable homodimer, it is possible to induce strongly neutralizing and protective antibodies that mimic properties of protective antibodies induced by natural infection. It is possible that inactivated whole virus or virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines will also stimulate antibodies to quaternary structure epitopes. An advantage to using rE<sup>D</sup>-protein subunits over inactivated virion or VLP vaccines is the absence or prM protein in subunit vaccine but not virus or VLP vaccines. PrM antibodies are non-neutralizing and some studies suggest that enhance the replication of flaviviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Additional studies are needed to compare the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of ZIKV rE-dimer, inactivated virus and VLP vaccines.
