  <p>Expression pf ZIKV rE monomers and rE homodimers. 
   <bold>a</bold> The soluble ZIKV rE-monomer (rE
   <sup>M</sup>, aa1–404) was expressed and purified from mammalian cells. The soluble stable ZIKV rE-homodimer (rE
   <sup>D</sup>) was generated by an A264C substitution, resulting in a disulfide bridge in the E-domain II dimer interphase (yellow). 
   <bold>b</bold> Purified rE
   <sup>M</sup> and rE
   <sup>D</sup> were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and exhibited predicted molecular weights of ~49 kDa (monomer) and ~98 kDa (dimer). 
   <bold>c</bold> Binding of ZIKV specific (A9E, G9E, and ZKA-230) and flavivirus cross-reactive (4G2, 1M7, C8, and C10) mAbs to ZIKV rE
   <sup>M</sup> and rE
   <sup>D</sup> was analyzed. Binding of mAbs that have a quaternary footprint (Q) was only observed for rE
   <sup>D</sup>. The DENV2 specific mAb 2D22 was used as a negative control. Results from 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 independent experiments are shown. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
