  <p>ZIKV rE
   <sup>D</sup> stimulates antibodies that target complex epitopes on the virion. 
   <bold>a</bold> Method for depleting EDIII-binding antibodies from mouse immune sera. Recombinant ZIKV E-domain III (EDIII, His-tagged) was coupled to nickel beads
   <sup>i</sup> then incubated with immune sera
   <sup>ii</sup>. Magnetic pull down removes nickel beads and EDIII-binding antibodies
   <sup>iii</sup>, leaving behind sera depleted from EDIII-binding antibodies
   <sup>iv</sup>. 
   <bold>b</bold> The level of EDIII-binding antibodies in the serum of mice immunized with the indicated antigens is shown as a percentage of the total level of ZIKV-specific IgG, as measured by ELISA of EDIII-depleted and control-depleted serum. 
   <bold>c</bold> The neutralizing activity of EDIII-depleted (green) and undepleted sera (black) was determined and expressed as the dilution at which 50% of the virus was neutralized (Neut
   <sub>50</sub>). 
   <bold>d</bold> A blockade of binding (BOB) assay was used to evaluate if mice immunized with rE
   <sup>M</sup> (black) or rE
   <sup>D</sup> (gray) developed antibodies that blocked the binding of A9E, G9E, and EDE C10 human mAbs. Data points represent individual mice. Statistical differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test (*
