  <p>ZIKV rE
   <sup>D</sup> induce protective antibodies in mice. 
   <bold>a</bold> Wild-type mice were immunized with rE
   <sup>M</sup>+alum or rE
   <sup>D</sup>+alum. Five hundred microliters of heat-inactivated immune sera (16 weeks post immunization) (or 200 µg of neutralizing mAb G9E) was transferred by intraperitoneal injection to Ifnar1
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice 24 h prior to challenge with 1000 FFU of ZIKV by subcutaneous footpad inoculation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 for rE
   <sup>M</sup> and rE
   <sup>D</sup> and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 for controls). 
   <bold>b</bold> Challenged mice were weighed daily for 14 days; weights are shown percent of starting weight. Data represent the mean +/−SEM of 3–5 mice per group and were censored once one mouse in a group died. 
   <bold>c</bold> Viremia was measured at 4 days post challenge by qRT-PCR. 
   <bold>d–e</bold> ZIKV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were determined for challenged mice prior to challenge (day 0) and at the end of the experiment (day 14). Statistical differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test (*
