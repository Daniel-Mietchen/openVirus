<p id="Par7">After confirming that rE
 <sup>D</sup> was a dimer displaying native quaternary epitopes, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with 5 µg rE
 <sup>M</sup>, 5 µg rE
 <sup>D</sup>, 5 µg rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum, or 5 µg rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum and analyzed ZIKV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In the absence of alum, rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> induced minimal IgG titers after the initial immunization, but this response increased upon boosting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). In the alum adjuvanted groups, high IgG titers were observed even after the prime alone, with minimal change upon boosting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Although rE
 <sup>M</sup> elicited ZIKV-binding antibodies in the absence of alumn, these antibodies failed to neutralize ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In contrast, non-adjuvanted rE
 <sup>D</sup> elicited ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The addition of alum adjuvant elevated neutralizing antibody levels in both groups, but neutralizing titers were significantly higher after rE
 <sup>D</sup> immunization compared with rE
 <sup>M</sup>. Our results demonstrate that, while both antigens stimulated ZIKV-specific IgG, the rE
 <sup>D</sup> stimulated antibodies that are more potently neutralizing compared with the rE
 <sup>M</sup> stimulated antibodies.
