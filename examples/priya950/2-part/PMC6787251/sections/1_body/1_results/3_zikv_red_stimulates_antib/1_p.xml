<p id="Par8">We next performed experiments to determine if antibodies stimulated by rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> antigens recognized different epitopes on the ZIKV E protein. Many flavivirus type-specific antibodies recognize relatively simple epitopes on domain III of the E protein (EDIII), whereas other type-specific antibodies recognize more complex quaternary structure epitopes displayed on E protein homodimers or higher order structures that cover the viral surface. Most EDIII-specific neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from mice immunized with inactivated flavivirus antigens

 </sup>. In fact, recent studies demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to flavivirus infections or effective live attenuated vaccines predominantly recognize quaternary epitopes, with simple EDIII epitopes accounting for only a minor fraction of neutralizing antibodies

 </sup>. To compare levels of EDIII directed antibodies in animals immunized with rE
 <sup>M</sup> or rE
 <sup>D</sup>, we used recombinant ZIKV-EDIII conjugated to magnetic beads to deplete mouse immune sera of EDIII-binding antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We tested control-depleted and EDIII antibody depleted immune sera to estimate the levels of binding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) in each sample targeting epitopes on EDIII. In mice immunized with rE
 <sup>M</sup>, ~70% (rE
 <sup>M</sup> group) and ~60% (rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum group) of total ZIKV-specific IgG recognized epitopes on EDIII (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). On the other hand, significantly less EDIII-specific antibodies were induced after immunization with rE
 <sup>D</sup> (~30% for rE
 <sup>D</sup> and ~20% for rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum). The antibody binding patterns were also reflected in the ZIKV neutralization assays. The majority of neutralizing antibodies in the rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum group were lost following depletion with EDIII antigen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In contrast, no loss of neutralization was observed in the animals immunized with rE
 <sup>D</sup> or rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum after the removal of EDIII-binding antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We conclude that the rE
 <sup>M</sup> antigen induces an EDIII focused antibody response that is poorly neutralizing, whereas rE
 <sup>D</sup> antigens stimulate robust neutralizing antibody responses that target epitopes distinct from simple EDIII epitopes.
