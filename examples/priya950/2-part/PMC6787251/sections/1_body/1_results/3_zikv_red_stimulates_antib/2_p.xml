 <sup>M</sup> or rE
 <sup>D</sup> developed antibodies that recognize A9E or G9E epitopes on ZIKV. We also tested if rE
 <sup>M</sup> or rE
 <sup>D</sup> antigens stimulated antibodies that targeted the epitope of human mAb EDE C10
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> which binds to a E dimer-dependent epitope that is conserved between DENV and ZIKV. Sera from mice immunized with rE
 <sup>M</sup> did not block binding of A9E, G9E, and C10 mAbs to ZIKV (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In contrast, sera from mice immunized with rE
 <sup>D</sup> antigen efficiently blocked binding of A9E and G9E (~80%) and partially blocked binding of EDE C10 (~35%) to ZIKV. These results demonstrate that the rE
 <sup>D</sup> antigen and natural ZIKV infections stimulate antibodies that target similar complex epitopes on the virion. The rE
 <sup>M</sup> fails to induce similar antibodies and directs the antibody response to simple epitopes on ZIKV EDIII.
