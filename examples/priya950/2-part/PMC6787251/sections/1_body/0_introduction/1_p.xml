<p id="Par3">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped single stranded RNA virus that is transmitted by mosquito vectors. As a member of the flavivirus genus, ZIKV shares many structural features with other medically important flaviviruses such as Wes Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and dengue virus (DENV). The flavivirus envelope (E) protein is a major target of neutralizing and protective human antibodies. E oligomers form complex quaternary structure epitopes on the viral surface which are of particular importance as protective human antibodies bind to these higher order protein structures
