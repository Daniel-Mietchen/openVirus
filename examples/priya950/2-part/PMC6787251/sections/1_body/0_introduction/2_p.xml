<p id="Par4">ZIKV infection during pregnancy can result in neurodevelopmental defects (congenital Zika syndrome). This has stimulated work on subunit vaccines, as live attenuated and other replicating virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy. However, for flaviviruses subunit vaccines based on recombinant E proteins (rE) have performed poorly in preclinical studies compared with virus or virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines

 </sup>. In aqueous solution, flavivirus rE proteins are in a dynamic equilibrium that favors the monomer over the dimer at physiological temperature, which likely explains poor binding by potently neutralizing human antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes and the overall poor immunogenicity of these antigens in preclinical studies
