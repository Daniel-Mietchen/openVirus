<p id="Par20">Neutralizing antibody titers were determined using a flow cytometry based assay. Vero-81 cells were seeded (25,000 cells per well) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Immunized mice sera was serially diluted in OptiMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with the amount of ZIKV previously determined to infect ~15% of the cells. Cells were subsequently washed with OptiMEM and overlaid with the diluted sera/virus mix for 2 h at 37 °C. Next, the cells were washed with growth medium and incubated overnight in growth medium at 37 °C. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and detached from the plate by trypsin (Gibco). Cells were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed in permeabilization buffer and blocked with 1% normal mouse serum in perm buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, infected cells were detected by staining with Alexa-488 conjugated 1M7 mAb (5 µg per µl) for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed in perm buffer and resuspended in 200 µl FACS buffer. The percentage of infected cells were determined using the Guava Flow Cytometer (EMD Millipore) and the neutralizing capacity was expressed as neut
 <sub>50</sub> (the dilution where 50% of the virus is neutralized), calculated by GraphPad Prism software.
