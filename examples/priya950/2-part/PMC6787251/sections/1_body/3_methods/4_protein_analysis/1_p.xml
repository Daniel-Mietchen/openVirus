<p id="Par15">The oligomeric state of purified rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> proteins was characterized by ELISA and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. For SDS-PAGE, 1 µg of rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> were incubated in denaturing gel loading buffer for 10 min at 95 °C. After centrifugation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and gels (original gel in Source Data File) were incubated with CBB stain (0.1% coomassie blue, 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol). Protein confirmations were analyzed by antigen-capture ELISA. ZIKV rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> were captured on Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-coated ELISA plates and subjected to binding of ZIKV-specific 2 ng per µl mAbs (A9E, G9E, and ZKA-230)
