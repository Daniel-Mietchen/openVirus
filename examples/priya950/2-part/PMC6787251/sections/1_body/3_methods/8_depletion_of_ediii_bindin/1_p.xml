<p id="Par21">Bacterially expressed ZIKV EDIII proteins (C-terminal 6 × His-tag) were conjugated to Ni-NTA Magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) following manufacturers protocol. In short, 1 mg of Ni-NTA beads were washed in equilibration buffer and incubated on a rotator with 60 µg of ZIKV-EDIII or MBP-His (control depletions) for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the beads were washed in equilibration buffer and divided in two tubes for two rounds of depletions. Mouse immune serum was diluted 1:20 in PBS and incubated with magnetic beads for 1 h at 37 °C on a rotator. Following incubation, the depleted serum was separated from the beads and stored at 4 °C for subsequent IgG ELISA and neutralization assays. The percentage of ZIKV EDIII-binding antibodies was calculated by dividing the EDIII-depleted IgG titers by the control-depleted IgG titers. The percentage of ZIKV EDIII neutralizing antibodies was calculated by dividing the EDIII-depleted neut
 <sub>50</sub> by the control-depleted neut
 <sub>50</sub>.
