<p id="Par19">ZIKV-specific IgG responses were measured by antigen-capture ELISA. Briefly, ZIKV was captured on 1M7 (2 ng per µl)-coated ELISA plates and incubated with 1:50 or serially diluted mouse sera 3, 4, 10, and 16 weeks post immunization. Next, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2500; Sigma A9044) diluted anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were developed using alkaline phosphatase substrate and adsorbance was measured at 405 nm. Endpoint dilution (EPD) titers where mice sera signals reached background (vehicle control) levels was determined using GraphPad Prism software.</p>
