<p>The 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions were inoculated with the 5 virus isolates as described above, with 10 replicates per treatment and accession. In these plants, virus multiplication, virulence, short-term seed survival, and efficiency of seed transmission were quantified as described below. Using these data, 6 out of the 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions were selected (An-1, Bay-0, Cad-0, Cum-0, Ll-0, and Fei-0) such that (i) accessions represented a range of TuMV and CMV seed transmissions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and (ii) accessions with different life cycles were included (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also selected one CMV isolate (Fny-CMV) and one TuMV isolate (JPN1-TuMV) for further experiments because they showed a wide range of percentages of seed transmission across accessions and were transmitted in a larger number of accessions.
