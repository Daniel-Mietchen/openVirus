<p>To validate the accuracy of the constructed models, we went back to the set of 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, retrieved the values of the parameters identified by our models as being relevant to predicting the efficiency of virus seed transmission, and interpolated these values in the constructed models. This allowed predicted values of seed transmission to be obtained, which were then compared with the values obtained experimentally. This approach allowed analysis of whether our models could be extrapolated to plant-virus interactions other than those utilized to build them and testing of their general accuracy.
