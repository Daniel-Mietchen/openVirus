<p>Aboveground plant structures were harvested at complete senescence. The weights of the rosette (
 <italic>RW</italic>), inflorescence (
 <italic>IW</italic>), and seeds (
 <italic>SW</italic>) were obtained. 
 <italic>RW</italic> was used as an estimate of plant resources dedicated to growth, and 
 <italic>IW</italic> and 
 <italic>SW</italic> were taken as estimates of plant resources dedicated to reproduction (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The effect of virus infection on these traits was quantified by calculating ratios of infected to mock-inoculated plants for each of them, dividing the value of each infected plant by the mean value for the mock-inoculated plants of the same accession (Trait
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>/Trait
 <italic>
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>, where 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>m</italic> denote infected and mock-inoculated plants, respectively). Virulence (
 <italic>V</italic>) was estimated as 1 minus the ratio of the total seed weight of infected (
 <italic>SW
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) to the total seed weight of mock-inoculated (
 <italic>SW
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>) plants. The total numbers of seeds produced per mock-inoculated (
 <italic>SN
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>) and infected (
 <italic>SN
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) plant were also quantified. To do so, we obtained the weight of 200 seeds for each replicate and derived the weight of a single seed. Using this value and the total seed weight of the corresponding plant, we calculated 
 <italic>SN</italic>. Virus infection did not affect the weight of 200 seeds (
 <italic>F</italic> ≤ 2.79; 
 <italic>P</italic> ≥ 0.114).
