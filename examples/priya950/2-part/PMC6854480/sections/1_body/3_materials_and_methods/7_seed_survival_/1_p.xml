<p>We measured short-, medium-, and long-term seed survival as surrogates of the effect of infection on seed viability. Short-term seed survival was measured as percent germination of seeds derived from infected and mock-inoculated plants 4 months after harvest to avoid biases due to seed dormancy, according to the protocol described above. To estimate medium- and long-term seed survival, seeds were artificially aged, and their germination percentage was measured. The artificial aging process was a modification of the “basal thermotolerance assay” described previously (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Briefly, seeds were incubated at 42°C for 24 h (medium term) or 48 h (long term) with a relative humidity of 100% and afterwards stratified for 3 days at 4°C. The germination percentage was measured every 24 h for 11 days, until a constant germination percentage was reached. Values of seed survival measures were derived from every replicate of each treatment and 100 seeds per replicate. Short-term (

We quantified these three measures of seed survival because they can yield different information on the processes determining the efficiency of seed transmission: short-term survival occurs prior to our measures of seed transmission, and it can be considered a predictor of this trait. On the other hand, seed aging is posterior to our measures of seed transmission, and modifications of medium- and long-term survival can be considered a consequence of seed infection that modify the efficiency of seed transmission in the long run. In any case, the three seed survival measures can be considered potential estimators of virus efficiency of seed transmission.
