<p>The speed of virus within-plant movement (
 <italic>SM</italic>) in the plant inflorescence was quantified as centimeters per day from flower meristem formation to silique ripening, thus covering the time interval during which the virus can enter the seed. Following methods described previously (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), at the time points defined in “Experimental design” above, the presence/absence of the virus in the 1-cm inflorescence pieces was monitored. Virus was detected via qRT-PCR as described above. As a result, we obtained a matrix of inflorescence height (in centimeters) versus time postbolting (days), in which we incorporated data on virus presence/absence for each height-time pair (see Table 3 in reference 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> for an example). The number of newly infected 1-cm segments (height) divided by the number of days that elapsed between two consecutive time points was used to calculate the speed of virus within-plant movement along the monitored period. Because virus speed of movement was analyzed for at least 15 time points, a minimum of 14 values were obtained. Virus speed of within-plant movement per accession was calculated by averaging these values between every two consecutive time points.
