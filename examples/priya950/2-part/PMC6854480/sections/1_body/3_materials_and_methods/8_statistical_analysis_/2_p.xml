<p>The relationship between TuMV and CMV infection traits and the efficiency of seed transmission was analyzed by utilizing mixed-effect multiple-regression tests (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). We considered the following infection traits as potential estimators of the percentage of infected seeds: effect of the virus on plant rosette and inflorescence weights, virulence, speed of within-host movement, within-host multiplication in the rosette and inflorescence, and short-, medium-, and long-term seed survival. The same variables plus the percentage of infected seeds and the total number of seeds produced per plant were used as estimators of the total number of infected seeds. For model construction, the log transformation of the total number of seeds and of infected seeds per plant was used, which allowed scaling of all estimators. The cross-correlation between the estimators was analyzed using variance inflation factor (VIF). VIF values were lower than 3 for all variables, indicating minimal cross-correlation. Thus, all variables were included in the models. A set of models that included a global model containing all infection traits as fixed effects and nested models that contained all possible combinations of these traits were fitted for each response variable using general linear mixed models (R package glmmTMB [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]). The models combining data for TuMV and CMV included virus isolate and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession as random effects, and TuMV- and CMV-specific models included only the latter random effect. Models for percent seed transmission were constructed using a Poisson function and a log-linked function, as this function best reflected the distribution of the data according to Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) (R package rriskDistributions [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]). Models for data on the number of infected seeds were constructed using a normal distribution and an identity-linked function. Global and nested models were ranked according to AIC scores, and the model with the lowest AIC score was selected as the best-ranked one. We calculated AIC Delta (Δ
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) as the difference between the AIC of a given model and that of the best-ranked model (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Finally, the Akaike relative weight (ω
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) of each model was calculated according to the expression ω
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> = exp(−0.5Δ
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>)/Σexp(−0.5Δ
 <italic>
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>). The relative importance of a given estimator included in the best-ranked model was calculated by decomposing the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> value of the model into components corresponding to each estimator using the R package relaimpo (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Bivariate tests were used to analyze the association between the most relevant infection traits and the efficiency of virus seed transmission (R package stats [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]).
