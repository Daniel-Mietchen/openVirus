<p>Variables of virus seed transmission, virulence and the effect of virus infection on plant growth and reproduction, and seed survival were not normally distributed, and variances were heterogeneous according to Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. None of these variables could be normalized except for

  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>IS</italic>, which were normalized using a log transformation. Therefore, differences between virus species and plant accessions were analyzed by generalized linear models (GzLMs), applying the corresponding linked function and considering virus isolate nested to virus species and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession as random factors. Virus species-specific analyses considered virus isolate and
