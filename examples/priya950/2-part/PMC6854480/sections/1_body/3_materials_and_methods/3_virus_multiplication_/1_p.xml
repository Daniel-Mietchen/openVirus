<p>TuMV and CMV multiplication was quantified as viral RNA accumulation via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) for each individual plant. For plants included in the time course experiment, at each time point, virus accumulation in the rosette (

Form these plant samples, total RNA extracts were obtained using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 10 ng of total RNA was added to Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR green qRT-PCR master mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Specific primers were used to amplify a 70-nucleotide (nt) fragment of the TuMV coat protein (CP) gene and a 106-nt fragment of the CMV CP gene (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Each plant sample was assayed in duplicate on a LightCycler 480 II real-time PCR system (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Absolute viral RNA accumulation was quantified as nanograms of viral RNA per microgram of total RNA, utilizing internal standards. For TuMV, internal standards consisted in 10-fold dilution series of plasmid-derived RNA transcripts of the same 70-nt CP fragment from UK1-TuMV. For CMV, 10-fold dilution series were prepared using purified viral RNA. All internal standards ranged from 2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> ng to 2 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> ng.
