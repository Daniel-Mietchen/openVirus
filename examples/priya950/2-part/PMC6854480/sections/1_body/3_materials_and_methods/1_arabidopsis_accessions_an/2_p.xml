 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Plant seeds were stratified for 7 days at 4°C in pots with a diameter of 15 cm, in a 0.43-liter volume containing a 3:1 peat-vermiculite mix. Afterwards, pots were moved for seed germination and plant growth to a greenhouse at 22°C, under 16 h of light (intensity,120 to 150 mol s/m
 <sup>2</sup>). Plants were mechanically inoculated, either with
