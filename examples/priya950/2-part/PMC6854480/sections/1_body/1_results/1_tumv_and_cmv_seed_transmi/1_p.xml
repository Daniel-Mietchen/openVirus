<p>We quantified seed transmission as a percentage (
 <italic>ST</italic>) and as the total number (
 <italic>IS</italic>) of TuMV- and CMV-infected seeds in 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In TuMV-infected plants, the virus was detected in 12/18 accessions, whereas seeds harboring CMV were detected in all accessions. On average, the percentage of infected seeds was higher in TuMV-infected (4.17% ± 1.53%) than in CMV-infected (2.60% ± 0.23%) plants (Wald χ

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). Similar results were obtained when seed transmission was quantified as the number of infected seeds (2.13 ± 0.19 versus 1.35 ± 0.07 for TuMV and CMV, respectively) (Wald χ

 <sub>17,759</sub> ≥ 199.62;
