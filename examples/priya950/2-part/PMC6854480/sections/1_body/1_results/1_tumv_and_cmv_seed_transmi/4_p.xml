<p>These results indicated that the efficiency of seed transmission depended on the host-virus genotype-per-genotype interaction. Thus, infection traits under the control of the host and/or the virus may modulate this process. We subsequently quantified, in different 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions inoculated with TuMV and CMV, a set of infection-related traits, and we analyzed their relationship with the efficiency of seed transmission.
