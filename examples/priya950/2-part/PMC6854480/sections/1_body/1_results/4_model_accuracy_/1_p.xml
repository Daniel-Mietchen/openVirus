<p>It could be argued that our multivariate models are based on data from six 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and one isolate per virus inoculated at a given host phenological stage, and therefore, the derived results are specific only for these particular plant-virus genotype-per-genotype interactions and inoculation conditions. We analyzed the applicability of our models to other 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and TuMV/CMV isolates by using them to estimate the efficiency of seed transmission in the set of 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and 5 virus isolates inoculated at the same phenological stage as the 6 accessions used for model construction. To do so, we quantified the relevant infection traits identified by the models (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material), and we incorporated these values into the best-ranked global and virus-specific models to predict percentages and numbers of virus-infected seeds. The resulting values were compared with those obtained by experimental testing of seed infection (
