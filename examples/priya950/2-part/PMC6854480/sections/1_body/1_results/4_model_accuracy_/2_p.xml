<p>Bivariate analyses of the relationship between TuMV and CMV experimental and predicted percentages of seed transmission indicated a significant positive correlation between both variables using either the global model or the virus-specific ones (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.70; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). However, prediction accuracy depended on the model. The equations of the linear correlations indicated that virus-specific models accurately predicted percentages of CMV and TuMV seed transmission (
 <italic>x</italic> coefficients near 1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). Similar results were obtained when predic tions for each isolate were analyzed separately (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand, the global model underestimated TuMV 
 <italic>ST</italic> (
 <italic>x</italic> coefficient = 3.63) and overestimated CMV 
 <italic>ST</italic> (
 <italic>x</italic> coefficient = 0.10), particularly at seed transmission values of &gt;10% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). Virus isolate-specific comparisons yielded similar biases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Experimental and predicted numbers of infected seeds per plant were also significantly correlated for both global and virus-specific models (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.50; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), although 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values were generally lower than those for percent seed transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">H</xref>). Again, virus-specific models performed better (
 <italic>x</italic> coefficient near 1) than the global one, but under- and overestimates of TuMV and CMV 
 <italic>IS</italic>, respectively, were smaller than in the case of 
 <italic>ST</italic>-estimating models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Note that prediction of the absence of infected seeds was poorer in 
 <italic>IS</italic> than in 
 <italic>ST</italic> models. Similar results were obtained when data for each virus isolate were analyzed separately (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).
