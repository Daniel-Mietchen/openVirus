<p>Hence, for the host phenological stage at inoculation used in our experiments, our multivariate models fairly estimate trends of TuMV and CMV seed transmission across 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, i.e., high versus low seed transmission, and virus-specific models infer seed transmission values more accurately than the global ones.
