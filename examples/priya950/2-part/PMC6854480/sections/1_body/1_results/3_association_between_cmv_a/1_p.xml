<p>Since the efficiency of seed transmission depended on the plant-virus genotype-per-genotype interaction, and we showed a similar variation for most infection traits proposed to be associated with this mode of transmission, we considered these infection traits as potential estimators of seed transmission. Thus, we performed more-detailed analyses of the association between infection traits and virus seed transmission utilizing multiple-regression model selection analyses (
