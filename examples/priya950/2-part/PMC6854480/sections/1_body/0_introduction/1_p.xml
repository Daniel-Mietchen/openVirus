<p>The ability to be transmitted is arguably the most important determinant of parasite fitness. Indeed, most theoretical models of the evolution of parasites consider infection traits, such as virulence, i.e., the effect of infection on host fitness (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), or within-host multiplication, as relevant factors for parasite fitness because they affect the efficiency of between-host transmission (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Parasites can be transmitted from host to host, for instance, by vectors or by contact (i.e., horizontal transmission) and/or from parents to offspring (i.e., vertical transmission) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most effort devoted to understanding parasite transmission has focused on identifying ecological and genetic determinants of horizontal transmission (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and comparatively much less is known about the determinants of vertical transmission. However, a wide range of human, animal, and plant parasites that are causal agents of severe diseases are vertically transmitted or have both horizontal and vertical transmission (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Hence, vertical transmission is a major component of parasite fitness, and exploring the factors involved in its efficiency is central to understanding host-parasite interactions (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
