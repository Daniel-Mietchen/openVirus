<p>The efficiency of seed transmission may also affect parasite evolution. The fitness of vertically transmitted parasites is highly dependent on host reproductive potential, as hosts need to reproduce for the parasite to infect new individuals. Accordingly, the “continuum hypothesis” proposes that parasites with a higher efficiency of vertical transmission will evolve toward lower virulence and, because virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite growth, toward lower within-host multiplication (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These predictions have seldom been experimentally tested, particularly for plant viruses (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Moreover, these works commonly estimated the efficiency of vertical transmission by determining the proportion of offspring that carry the parasite. This measure of the efficiency of seed transmission does not account for variation in the number of propagules that different host genotypes can produce, which may affect parasite fitness. Indeed, it has been proposed that the total number of infected progeny reflects more accurately the contribution of vertical transmission to parasite fitness and therefore is more directly linked to parasite evolution (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). According to this theory, parasite vertical transmission-related fitness is the result of the interplay between the percentage of infected progeny, virulence, and the amount of progeny produced by the host. The first determines the proportion of infected progeny, the second determines the reduction of the host’s maximal progeny production, and the third determines progeny production upon infection (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, understanding how the efficiency of seed transmission affects virus evolution requires considering both the percentage of seed transmission and the total number of infected propagules.
