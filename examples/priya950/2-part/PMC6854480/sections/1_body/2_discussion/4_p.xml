<p>It is worth noting that we identified the same determinants of percent vertical transmission in two virus species with very different life histories and outcomes of infection. This suggests that our results would be applicable to the prediction of virus seed transmission in other host-virus interactions. Indeed, although some of the parameters used for model validation were estimates, both global and virus-specific ones predicted trends of seed transmission (i.e., higher versus lower transmission rates) in other 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and TuMV/CMV isolates with medium to high accuracy. More-accurate prediction of seed transmission values required the use of virus-specific models, which indicates that fine-tuning of the model estimative power needs to include virus-specific secondary determinants of seed transmission. Whether our models are applicable to other viruses or host species should be explored further. In any case, at least for TuMV and CMV, our results will help map the host and virus genes controlling the infection traits associated with the efficiency of seed transmission. This will allow the identification of candidate genetic determinants of this process, which currently remain elusive.
