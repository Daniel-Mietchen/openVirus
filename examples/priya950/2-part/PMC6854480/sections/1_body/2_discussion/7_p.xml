<p>Multivariate models also detected percent of seed transmission and the number of seeds produced by infected plants as the main estimators of the number of infected seeds, with both estimators being positively associated with this trait. The six 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions utilized to build multivariate models were selected to represent plants with short and long life cycles (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the absence of infection, short-lived accessions generally produce more seeds than long-lived ones (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Upon infection by JPN1-TuMV, these short-lived accessions showed a smaller reduction in seed production and a higher percentage of seed transmission than long-lived ones, which would explain the positive association between the number of infected seeds and the three main estimators of this trait. On the other hand, the efficiency of Fny-CMV seed transmission was higher in long-lived accessions. These accessions are known to display higher tolerance to CMV than short-lived ones (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Under our conditions, this allowed long-lived accessions to produce a larger number of seeds upon CMV infection than short-lived ones (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As a consequence, again, a higher level of seed production upon Fny-CMV infection was positively associated with the percentage of seed transmission and, by extension, with the number of infected seeds. Hence, the role of percent seed transmission and the number of seeds produced by infected plants as major estimators of the total number of infected seeds can be explained as a combination of plant allometry and tolerance to virus infection.
