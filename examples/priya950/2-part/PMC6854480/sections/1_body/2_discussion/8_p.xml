<p>Not surprisingly, models generally included the speed of within-host movement of the virus and its multiplication in the inflorescence as secondary determinants of the number of infected seeds, the two traits associated with percent seed transmission. This is likely the consequence of the major contribution of the percentage of seed transmission to the number of infected seeds. Indeed, equivalent models for
