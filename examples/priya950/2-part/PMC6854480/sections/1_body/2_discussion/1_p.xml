<p>The ability to be transmitted is a key component of parasite fitness (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Here, we tested the hypothesis that virus transmission through seeds is associated with (i) the ability of the virus to move from the entry points to the plant reproductive structures, (ii) the ability of the virus to invade these reproductive structures, (iii) the capacity of the infected plant to produce progeny, and (iv) the capacity of infected progeny to survive (
