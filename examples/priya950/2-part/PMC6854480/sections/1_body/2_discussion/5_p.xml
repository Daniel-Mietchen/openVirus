<p>More than one-quarter of all known plant viruses have been reported to be vertically transmitted (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and this is likely an underestimate, as every year, more species, either long known or newly discovered, are described to be transmitted through seeds. CMV vertical transmission has been extensively reported (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), whereas to date, TuMV has been considered strictly horizontally transmitted through insect vectors (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our results indicate that in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, TuMV is transmitted through seeds and in some accessions with high efficiency, adding this to the list of vertically transmitted plant viruses. As mentioned above, in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, TuMV is considered a sterilizing virus (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Host sterilization allows host resources to be diverted from reproduction to survival, which increases the infectious period and the level of parasite multiplication. These modifications maximize horizontal transmission but at the cost of no vertical one (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Hence, host sterilization is thought to be selectively advantageous for parasites that have strict horizontal transmission. However, our results show that TuMV maintains a mixed mode of transmission. Similarly, the fungus 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Atkinsonella hypoxylon</named-content> has both modes of transmission in species of the genus 
 <italic>Danthonia</italic> despite inducing plant sterility (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In this pathosystem, the coexistence of vertical and horizontal transmission has been explained on the basis of a vertical transmission-virulence trade-off. That is, in plants with most flowers sterilized, the few that are fertile produce a higher proportion of infected seeds than plants with fewer sterilized flowers (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Thus, higher virulence favors vertical transmission. This is not the case for TuMV, as the most virulent isolate (UK1-TuMV) had a seed transmission efficiency similar to that of a less virulent one (JPN1-TuMV). More importantly, the percentage of JPN1-TuMV seed transmission was negatively correlated with virulence and positively correlated with the number of seeds produced per infected plant, indicating no vertical transmission-virulence trade-off (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). On the other hand, tolerance to TuMV infection may explain why seed transmission is maintained in the virus population: One-third of the 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions analyzed here avoided UK1-TuMV sterilization, and in all of them, the virus was seed transmitted. In these accessions, tolerance is attained by shortening the host growth period, which triggers plant reproduction before the plant experiences the full cost of infection (Montes et al., submitted). This reduces the resources available for virus multiplication, which in turn prevents maximization of horizontal transmission (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Thus, TuMV seed transmission may compensate for the loss of virus fitness due to suboptimal horizontal transmission in tolerant accessions.
