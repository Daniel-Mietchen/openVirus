<p>Our global and virus species-specific models explaining the total number of infected seeds, which best reflects the contribution of vertical transmission to virus fitness (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), support the link between virulence/tolerance and seed transmission. Indeed, these models identified virulence as one of the most important estimators, which was negatively associated with the number of infected seeds per plant. These results are therefore compatible with theoretical elaborations on parasite evolution under mixed modes of transmission (see the introduction).
