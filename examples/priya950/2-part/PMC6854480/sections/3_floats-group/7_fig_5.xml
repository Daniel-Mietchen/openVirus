  <p>Association between experimental and estimated virus seed transmission of 5 TuMV and CMV isolates in 18 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. Correlations between estimated values of percent TuMV seed transmission derived from the TuMV-specific model (A) and from the global model (B), percent CMV seed transmission derived from the CMV-specific model (C) and from the global model (D), the log number of TuMV-infected seeds derived from the TuMV-specific models (E) and from the global model (F), and the log number of CMV-infected seeds derived from the CMV-specific models (G) and from the global model (H) and the corresponding experimental values are shown. Data for UK1-TuMV (gray), JPN1-TuMV (black), LS-CMV (green), Fny-CMV (blue), and De72-CMV (red) are represented. Note the different scale of each panel.
