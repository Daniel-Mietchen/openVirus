  <p>Association between experimental and estimated virus seed transmission of the 2 TuMV and 3 CMV isolates in 18 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. (A to D) Correlations of percent TuMV seed transmission derived from the TuMV-specific model (A and B) and from the global model (C and D) to the corresponding experimental values. (E to J) Correlations of percent CMV seed transmission derived from the CMV-specific model (E to G) and from the global model (H to J) to the corresponding experimental values. Data for JPN1-TuMV (black), UK1-TuMV (gray), LS-CMV (green), Fny-CMV (blue), and De72-CMV (red) are represented.
