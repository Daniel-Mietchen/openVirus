 <caption>
  <p>Bivariate relationships between the number of virus-infected seeds and infection traits. Regressions considering data for both viruses together (A to C), only JPN1-TuMV (D to F), and only Fny-CMV (G to I) are shown. Linear relationships of the log number of virus-infected seeds and percent virus seed transmission (brown), virulence as 1 âˆ’ (
   <italic>SW
    <sub>i</sub>/SW

   </italic>) (light blue), virus multiplication in the inflorescence in nanograms of viral RNA per microgram of total RNA (orange), and log number of seeds per infected plant (dark blue) are represented.
