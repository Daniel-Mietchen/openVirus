The emergence of drug-resistant viruses requires the development of new antiviral chemicals. Our study applied a cell-based approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of a series of newly synthesized benzoic acid derivatives, and 4-(2,2-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)amino). benzoic acid, termed NC-5, was found to possess antiviral activity. NC-5 inhibited influenza A viruses A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and oseltamivir-resistant mutant A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) for H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y were 33.6 &#x003bc;M and 32.8 &#x003bc;M, respectively, which showed that NC-5 had a great advantage over oseltamivir in drug-resistant virus infections. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) of NC-5 was greater than 640 &#x003bc;M. Orally administered NC-5 protected mice infected with H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y, conferring 80% and 60% survival at 100 mg/kg/d, reducing body weight loss, and alleviating virus-induced lung injury. NC-5 could suppress NP and M1 protein expression levels during the late stages of viral biosynthesis and inhibit NA activity, which may influence virus release. Our study proved that NC-5 has potent anti-influenza activity in vivo and in vitro, meaning that it could be regarded as a promising drug candidate to treat infection with influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>benzoic acid derivatives</kwd><kwd>antiviral activity</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase inhibition</kwd><kwd>oseltamivir-resistant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-20-06261"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The influenza A virus belongs to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and is a major cause of severe epidemics of respiratory illness [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genome of the influenza virus contains eight segmented and negative-stranded RNAs, encoding for eleven proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), Non-structural protein 1 (NS1), NS2, polymerase acidic protein (PA), Matrix protein 1 (M1), M2, polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and PB2, PB1-F2. Neuraminidase is on the surface of the envelope; its function is to cleave the sialic acid residues that attach the progeny virus to infected cells, thereby detaching the progeny virus and completing the cycle of virus infection and propagation [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The NA and M1 proteins have proven to be effective targets for anti-influenza viral therapy [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Influenza NA is a homotetramer classified into two phylogenetically distinct groups; compared to group two (N2, N3, N6, N7 and N9), group one (N1, N4, N5 and N8) has an &#x0201c;150-cavity&#x0201d; near the active area [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The &#x0201c;150-cavity&#x0201d; is a loop of amino acids adopting an open conformation, consisting of residues 147&#x02013;152 together with the active site residues Asp151 and Glu119 [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Benefitting from alkylation and guanidylation of the oseltamivir C-5 amino acid and the same transformations at position C-4 of zanamivir, the two molecules target the &#x0201c;150-cavity&#x0201d; of the NA protein, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and preventing the tethered progeny virus from escaping from host cells [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, due to the frequent emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses, the usage of these drugs has been greatly limited [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], making the discovery of novel anti-influenza drugs an even more urgent task.</p><p>Benzoic acid derivatives have been reported to possess anti-influenza virus activities. Among them, BANA-206, the first achiral molecule, was reported to show sub-micromolar antiviral potency against the influenza A virus [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some compounds have been successfully designed by the conjugation method, including compounds BTA938 [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and ZA-7-CA [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; their anti-influenza activity was enhanced. Based on combination principles as well as the principle of functional groups, we integrated triazole into BANA-206 on the C3 side chain and designed a series of benzoic acid derivatives to obtain potential influenza virus inhibitors with improved antiviral activity. In our research, five compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were evaluated for their antiviral activities in infected-cell models. Ultimately, 4-(2, 2-Bis (hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl) amino) benzoic acid, termed NC-5, emerged as the most effective compound. We tested its antiviral activity against A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in vitro and against H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y in vivo. The mechanistic studies indicated that NC-5 may cause the virus to be unable to escape from its host cells through inhibiting NA activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-06261"><title>2.

The Antiviral Activities of NC-5 and its Analogs against Influenza Virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1)</title><p>BANA-206, a benzoic acid derivative, was reported to show potent antiviral activity [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The analogs of oseltamivir and zanamivir that possess a triazole substituent had been reported to inhibit the influenza virus via insertion into the 150-cavity near the active site of NA. These results prompted us to consider the use of triazole substituents to increase the NA-inhibitory effect. The cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay was utilized to screen and identify compounds that displayed a reduction in the CPE on the influenza H1N1 virus at 10 &#x003bc;M and 100 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="ijms-20-06261-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that the derivatives possessed antiviral activity ranging from 7.3% to 16.7% at 10 &#x003bc;M, and 7.8% to 83.7% at 100 &#x003bc;M. The data in <xref rid="ijms-20-06261-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that all of the compounds exhibited a low viral inhibitory effect at 10 &#x003bc;M. Compounds bearing a saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon (Compound 5) showed a better effect than compounds with phenyl substituents (Compounds 1 and 2) or chain substituents (Compounds 3 and 4). Substituents consisting of large groups with saturated rings might be advantageous options for designing antiviral compounds because of the possibility of the triazole group fitting into the 150-cavity in NA. Compound 5, a diethyl triazole benzoic acid derivative named 4-(2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)amino) benzoic acid, significantly reduced the viral CPE in Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with an inhibition rate of 83.7% at 100 &#x003bc;M, the highest inhibition rate among the derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-06261"><title>2.2. NC-5 has the Ability to Inhibit Neuraminidase Activity</title><p>In the NA activity inhibition assay, the NA activities of wild-type H1N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and H3N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) as well as the CHO-K1 expression of NA proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>D) and H7N9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) were suppressed by NC-5. The NA activities of oseltamivir-resistant viruses H1N1-H275Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and H7N9-R294K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) were also inhibited by NC-5 with a weaker or similar inhibition effect. The inhibition rate of NC-5 at 480 &#x003bc;M on all NAs was above 25% and the IC50 of each strain was higher than 480 &#x003bc;M. For oseltamivir-resistant strains, the inhibition rates of oseltamivir at 1 nM were less than 2% compared with inhibition rates of approximately 50% toward wild-type strains. NC-5 suppressed the NA activity of H1N1-H275Y and H7N9-R294K and the inhibition rates were both 25.8% at 480 &#x003bc;M. The effectiveness of NC-5 on wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus strains indicated that NC-5 might be a mild NA inhibitor that could be employed in the treatment of drug-resistant viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-20-06261"><title>2.3.

In the additional CPE reduction experiments, NC-5 exhibited a considerable protective effect. H1N1, H1N1-H275Y and H3N2 were tested with oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) as a control. NC-5 (10&#x02013;160 &#x003bc;M) showed significant dose-dependent anti-influenza activity. The inhibition rates at 80 &#x003bc;M against H1N1 and H3N2 were 81.1% and 42.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), respectively, with minimal adverse effects on the host cell at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The effects were also confirmed when cells were infected with different viruses with a tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50)of 1, 0.5, and 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D).

The reduction in CPE caused by H1N1-H275Y was confirmed by direct microscopic observation, which detected a far lower CPE than the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control and the OC-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). NC-5 at 20&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M was able to protect cells from necrobiosis and detachment, while OC at 80 &#x003bc;M showed little inhibitory activity.</p><p>The results of the Western blot analysis, conducted to investigate the influence of NC-5 on H1N1 virus NP and M1 protein level, showed that NC-5 could significantly decrease the expression of NP and M1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C) 48 h post-infection in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that NC-5 inhibits influenza virus infection by interfering with viral replication.

Effective Protection by NC-5 in Mice Infected with Influenza Virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) and Oseltamivir-Resistant Mutant A/FM/1/47 (H1N1-H275Y)</title><p>A dose-response study in a virus-infected murine model was designed to evaluate the efficacy of NC-5 against the influenza virus in vivo. Body weight, survival and clinical manifestations were recorded for 14 days. The mice infected with wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant viruses presented with severe clinical manifestations, including a ruffled coat, inappetence, inactivity, shudder and body weight loss three days after infection.

The lungs of mice given NC-5 exhibited reduced histopathological symptomatic changes in a dose-dependent manner. The lung parameters showed that treatment with NC-5 could significantly decrease the lung index and lung injury score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D) of the H1N1 infected mice, exhibiting a significant effect at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d (lung index: 0.9, lung injury score: 3.8) compared with the model group (lung index: 1.8, lung injury score: 7.7). The lung parameters of mice infected with H1N1-H275Y and the mice administered OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D, lung index: 1.2, lung injury score: 7.3) were similar to those of the corresponding models (lung index: 1.4, lung injury score: 7.7), while the groups that received NC-5 at 100 mg/kg/d showed a significant improvement in condition (lung index: 1.0, lung injury score: 3.5). The results above and other parameters indicate that NC-5 could prolong survival, release pathological changes in the lungs and reduce body weight loss.

NC-5 Suppressed Influenza Virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) in the Late Stages of its Life Cycle by Interfering NP and M1 Protein Expression but Showed no Effect on RNA Polymerase</title><p>We tried to explore the potential mechanisms by which NC-5 inhibits influenza infection. The complete life cycle of the influenza virus is approximately 8&#x02013;10 h and it is divided into the following three stages: virus entry (0&#x02013;2 h), viral genome replication and translation (2&#x02013;8 h), and progeny virion release (8&#x02013;10 h) [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A time-of-addition experiment was performed via adding NC-5 to influenza-infected cells at different stages of the virus replication cycle and then measuring the relative level of NP and M1 proteins 10 h later. The cells were co-incubated with the virus at 4 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, then, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, the cells were cultured at 37 &#x000b0;C. Two milliliters of medium was added to each well and NC-5 (80 &#x003bc;M) was added at 0&#x02013;2 h, 2&#x02013;4 h, 4&#x02013;6 h, 6&#x02013;8 h, and 8&#x02013;10 h post-infection. When NC-5 was added during the replication stage and release stage (4&#x02013;6 h or 6&#x02013;8 h after infection), the M1 protein level was significantly reduced with an inhibition rate of 48.2% in 6&#x02013;8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,C). NP protein expression showed a slight decrease at the late biosynthesis stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B). However, in the adsorption stage or the early biosynthesis stage (0&#x02013;2 h or 2&#x02013;4 h after infection), no inhibitory activity was observed. The results suggest that NC-5 may disrupt RNA polymerase-mediated transcription and replication as well as the virus assembly and release stages. However, the results of the luciferase experiments did not indicate inhibition of RNA polymerase compared with the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f007">Figure 7</xref>E). The NP and M1 RNA levels at 6 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f007">Figure 7</xref>D) had not decreased much in the qPCR analysis results.

However, for influenza virus H3N2, the EC<sub>50</sub> value was greater than 160 &#x003bc;M, possibly because the inelastic 150-loop differs from that in N1 [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This difference may make it difficult for triazole substituents to insert into the 150-cavity in NA, which is of great importance in virulence. The oral administration of NC-5 significantly enhanced the survival rates of wild-type- and oseltamivir-resistant virus-infected mice, as 80% and 60% of mice were protected from death, respectively, at 100 mg/kg/d. However, OS failed to protect mice infected with H1N1-H275Y virus, and all of the mice died on day nine post-infection. Lung injury and all other parameters also confirmed the remarkable therapeutic effects of NC-5. Together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that NC-5 exhibits outstanding antiviral activity. The compound reduces viral replication, protein synthesis and CPE in cell culture, and it suppresses viral propagation and alleviates associated severe symptoms caused by viral infections in mice. All the data demonstrate that NC-5 possesses potent activity against influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant viruses.</p><p>Nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) are structural proteins that are essential for the integrity of a virus [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both can reflect the expression state of virus replication. In experiments exploring the mechanism of antiviral activity, we found that the activity against influenza virus took effect in the biosynthesis stage with the protein synthesis of both NP and M1. NC-5 slightly decreased the NP and M1 RNA levels. However, it did not affect RNA polymerase activity and NC-5 did not interfere with the entry of the virus into the host cells but rather played an important role in the virus release stage due to its NA inhibitory activity, which was effective against all strains and NA proteins employed. The experimental results showed that NC-5 has potential as a new candidate NA inhibitor. We hypothesize that NC-5 may affect the post-transcriptional regulation that functions in the viral protein synthesis process which we may explore in subsequent studies.</p><p>Compared to the two widely used anti-influenza drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir, BANA-206 and NC-5 are achiral molecules exhibiting great potent anti-influenza activity, which can avoid chemical synthesis difficulty and high production cost. The Molecular Operating Environment(MOE) software was used for the molecular simulation docking of NC-5 and NA, and the docking simulation results showed that the benzene ring of NC-5 was conjugated with Arg118, two hydroxyls at pyrrolidone hydrogen-bonded with Tyr347, and Arg371 in H1N1-NA, respectively. It has been reported that the resistance mutations of influenza virus H1N1 mostly occur at His275 and Arg292 sites [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], different from the active amino acid sites which interact with NC-5, which makes NC-5 a good potential drug for the treatment of drug-resistant influenza. However, to corroborate the docking simulation results, further experiments should be designed to investigate the exact amino acids of the viral NA that interact with NC-5.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-20-06261"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we explored the anti-influenza activity of the diethyl triazole benzoic acid derivative, NC-5. This compound can inhibit influenza A viruses A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and oseltamivir-resistant mutant A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the cytopathic effect assay, it showed a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) over 640 &#x003bc;M. Moreover, it can provide a great protective effect against wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus-infected mice. In summary, NC-5 possesses potent antiviral activity including towards oseltamivir-resistant mutants both in vitro and in vivo, which means that it presumes broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Therefore, it can be regarded as a promising candidate for influenza virus infection therapy. Its modification to improve the efficacy, further mechanistic studies and additional preclinical development will form part of our future work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We sincerely thank Xin Ye (Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for technical assistance in the luciferase assay.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed experiments: M.G., C.Z., J.D. and J.Y.
