  <p>NC-5 suppressed influenza A virus replication by inhibiting NP and M1 protein expression without affecting mRNA transcription of NP and M1 or RNA polymerase. (
   <bold>A</bold>) MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and NC-5 was given at intervals of 0–2 h, 2–4 h, 4–6 h, 6–8 h, and 8–10 h post-infection. The cell lysates were harvested at 10 h and subjected to Western blot analysis. The results were analyzed with ImageJ software. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Relative amounts of NP protein calculated in comparison to the DMSO control. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Relative amounts of M1 protein calculated in comparison to the DMSO control. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Relative RNA levels of the NP and M1 genes determined in a real-time qPCR experiment. The experiment was performed in triplicate and normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), relative to the DMSO control. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The relative luciferase activity of 293T cells transfected with plasmids containing PB1, PB2, PA, NP, influenza virus-like RNA encoding firefly luciferase (vNS-Luc) and pCMV β-gal for 24 h. Cell lysates were used for the luciferase assay. The activities were normalized, and the relative luciferase activity was calculated to the DMSO control. The results are represented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments, *
