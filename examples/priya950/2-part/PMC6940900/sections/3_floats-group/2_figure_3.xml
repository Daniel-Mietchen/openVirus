  <p>Inhibitory effect of NC-5 on wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cellular toxicity of NC-5 in MDCK cells. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The inhibition rate of NC-5 (10–160 μM) on influenza A virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) and A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2). MDCK cells were infected with 100 TCID50 of A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) and A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2). Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) (10 μM) was used as a positive control. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The inhibition rate of NC-5 (20–80 μM) against influenza A virus H1N1 in MDCK cells at different TCID50. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The inhibition rate of NC-5 (20–80 μM) against influenza A virus H3N2 in MDCK cells at different TCID50. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Microscopic image for A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) virus-infected NC-5 (20–80 μM) treated MDCK cells at 48 h post-infection. MDCK cells were infected with 100 TCID50 of H1N1-H275Y. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. OC (80 μM) was also used as a control. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Inhibition rate of NC-5 (10–160 μM) on H1N1-H275Y virus infected MDCK cells. OC (80 μM) was used as a control. The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
