   <sup>3</sup> TCID50 at 24 h post-infection. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) (10 μM) was used as a positive control. (
   <bold>B</bold>) MDCK cells were infected with 1.5 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> TCID50 of H1N1, treated with NC-5 (10–80 μM) or OC (10 μM) and administered 2 h post-infection (p.i.). Cells at 24 h p.i. were harvested and subjected to Western blotting with NP and M1 antibodies. (
