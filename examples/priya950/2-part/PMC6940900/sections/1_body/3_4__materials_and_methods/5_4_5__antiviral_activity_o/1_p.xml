<p>Male ICR mice (6 weeks old) were supplied by the Model Animal Center of Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China) and kept in the animal center at China Pharmaceutical University. Experiments were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. NC-5 was first dissolved in DMSO and then mixed with 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) solution for in vitro experiments; the final concentration of DMSO was 5% as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The ICR mice were divided into a control group (mice without viral infection), a placebo group (infected mice without treatment), an NC-5 treated group (50 mg/kg/d, 75 mg/kg/d, and 100 mg/kg/d), and an oseltamivir-treated group (100 mg/kg/d), each group consisting of 10 mice. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of diethyl ether and then intranasally infected with 50 μL of a suspension of 8 × LD50 of the mouse-adapted influenza A/FM1/1/47 (H1N1), A/FM/1/47-H275Y virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two hours later, NC-5 (50 mg/kg/d, 75 mg/kg/d and 100 mg/kg/d) or oseltamivir phosphate (OS) (100 mg/kg/d) was given twice daily for 5 days through oral administration.
