<p>The lung index was calculated using the equation: lung index = (lung weight)/weight × 100. The lung injury score was evaluated according to the degree of congestion and edema of the lungs, the degree of bronchial necrosis, the degree of alveolar and bronchial epithelium injury, and the degree of inflammatory infiltration by a professional. In order to evaluate the infection in the mice, we homogenized the lungs of the mice, and filtered them using a 0.22 μm filter to evaluate the lung virus titer. The remaining processes were similar to the operation of measuring TCID50.</p>
