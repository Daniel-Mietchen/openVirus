<p>MDCK cells were plated in a 6-well plate and infected with 1.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID50 of the H1N1 influenza virus for 2 h then treated with NC-5 (10 μM, 40 μM and 80 μM), DMSO and 10 μM OC for 24 h. After that, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS containing 0.5% saponin was used to permeabilize the cells. Subsequently, the cells were stained with primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. The nuclei were stained with 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope.
