<p>MDCK cells in 6-well plates were infected with 1.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID50 of the H1N1 influenza virus and treated with NC-5 (10 μM, 40 μM, and 80 μM) and OC (10 μM). Cells were lysed after 24 h. In a time-addition experiment, the MDCK cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and co-incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After changing the supernatant, the cells were cultured at 37 °C. NC-5 (80 μM) was added at distinct time-points, as described in Results. Ten hours post-infection, cell lysates were harvested. The following antibodies were applied for immunoblotting: anti-M1 (Catalog No. GTX125928, GeneTex), anti-NP (Catalog No. GTX83054, GeneTex), and anti-β-actin (Catalog No. SC-47778, Santa Cruz). A Bio-Imaging system was applied for band intensity detection, and the proteins were quantified using ImageJ, which was normalized to β-actin levels.
