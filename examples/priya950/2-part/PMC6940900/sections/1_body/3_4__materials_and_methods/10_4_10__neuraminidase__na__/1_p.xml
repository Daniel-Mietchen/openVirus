<p>NA enzyme inhibition assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Influenza viruses H1N1, H1N1-H275Y, and H3N2 or CHO-expressed viral NAs H5N1, H7N9 and H7N9-R294K were incubated with NC-5 at different concentrations at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, 20 μM of fluorescent substrate 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The fluorescence was measured with an AFLx 800 fluorescence microplate reader, and the excitation wavelength and emission wavelength were set to 360 nm and 450 nm, respectively.
