<p>Here we report a diethyl triazole benzoic acid derivative, NC-5, that displays anti-influenza virus activity in vitro and in vivo. The influenza virus produces clear and rapid CPE following cell death in vitro [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The compound exhibited relatively broad-spectrum activity among the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus strains with limited cytotoxicity. NC-5 effectively alleviated the CPE and inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y viruses with 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 33.6 μM and 32.8 μΜ. However, for influenza virus H3N2, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value was greater than 160 μM, possibly because the inelastic 150-loop differs from that in N1 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This difference may make it difficult for triazole substituents to insert into the 150-cavity in NA, which is of great importance in virulence. The oral administration of NC-5 significantly enhanced the survival rates of wild-type- and oseltamivir-resistant virus-infected mice, as 80% and 60% of mice were protected from death, respectively, at 100 mg/kg/d. However, OS failed to protect mice infected with H1N1-H275Y virus, and all of the mice died on day nine post-infection. Lung injury and all other parameters also confirmed the remarkable therapeutic effects of NC-5. Together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that NC-5 exhibits outstanding antiviral activity. The compound reduces viral replication, protein synthesis and CPE in cell culture, and it suppresses viral propagation and alleviates associated severe symptoms caused by viral infections in mice. All the data demonstrate that NC-5 possesses potent activity against influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant viruses.
