<p>Nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) are structural proteins that are essential for the integrity of a virus [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both can reflect the expression state of virus replication. In experiments exploring the mechanism of antiviral activity, we found that the activity against influenza virus took effect in the biosynthesis stage with the protein synthesis of both NP and M1. NC-5 slightly decreased the NP and M1 RNA levels. However, it did not affect RNA polymerase activity and NC-5 did not interfere with the entry of the virus into the host cells but rather played an important role in the virus release stage due to its NA inhibitory activity, which was effective against all strains and NA proteins employed. The experimental results showed that NC-5 has potential as a new candidate NA inhibitor. We hypothesize that NC-5 may affect the post-transcriptional regulation that functions in the viral protein synthesis process which we may explore in subsequent studies.
