<p>Compared to the two widely used anti-influenza drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir, BANA-206 and NC-5 are achiral molecules exhibiting great potent anti-influenza activity, which can avoid chemical synthesis difficulty and high production cost. The Molecular Operating Environment(MOE) software was used for the molecular simulation docking of NC-5 and NA, and the docking simulation results showed that the benzene ring of NC-5 was conjugated with Arg118, two hydroxyls at pyrrolidone hydrogen-bonded with Tyr347, and Arg371 in H1N1-NA, respectively. It has been reported that the resistance mutations of influenza virus H1N1 mostly occur at His275 and Arg292 sites [

However, to corroborate the docking simulation results, further experiments should be designed to investigate the exact amino acids of the viral NA that interact with NC-5.
