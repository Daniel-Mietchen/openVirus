<p>In this paper, we explored the anti-influenza activity of the diethyl triazole benzoic acid derivative, NC-5. This compound can inhibit influenza A viruses A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and oseltamivir-resistant mutant A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the cytopathic effect assay, it showed a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) over 640 Î¼M. Moreover, it can provide a great protective effect against wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus-infected mice. In summary, NC-5 possesses potent antiviral activity including towards oseltamivir-resistant mutants both in vitro and in vivo, which means that it presumes broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Therefore, it can be regarded as a promising candidate for influenza virus infection therapy. Its modification to improve the efficacy, further mechanistic studies and additional preclinical development will form part of our future work.
