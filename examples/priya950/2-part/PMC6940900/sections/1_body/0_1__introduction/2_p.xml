<p>Benzoic acid derivatives have been reported to possess anti-influenza virus activities. Among them, BANA-206, the first achiral molecule, was reported to show sub-micromolar antiviral potency against the influenza A virus [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some compounds have been successfully designed by the conjugation method, including compounds BTA938 [

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; their anti-influenza activity was enhanced. Based on combination principles as well as the principle of functional groups, we integrated triazole into BANA-206 on the C3 side chain and designed a series of benzoic acid derivatives to obtain potential influenza virus inhibitors with improved antiviral activity. In our research, five compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were evaluated for their antiviral activities in infected-cell models. Ultimately, 4-(2, 2-Bis (hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl) amino) benzoic acid, termed NC-5, emerged as the most effective compound. We tested its antiviral activity against A/FM/1/47 (H1N1), A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in vitro and against H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y in vivo. The mechanistic studies indicated that NC-5 may cause the virus to be unable to escape from its host cells through inhibiting NA activity.
