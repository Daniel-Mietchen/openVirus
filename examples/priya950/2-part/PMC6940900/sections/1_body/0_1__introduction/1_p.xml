<p>The influenza A virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and is a major cause of severe epidemics of respiratory illness [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genome of the influenza virus contains eight segmented and negative-stranded RNAs, encoding for eleven proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), Non-structural protein 1 (NS1), NS2, polymerase acidic protein (PA), Matrix protein 1 (M1), M2, polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and PB2, PB1-F2. Neuraminidase is on the surface of the envelope; its function is to cleave the sialic acid residues that attach the progeny virus to infected cells, thereby detaching the progeny virus and completing the cycle of virus infection and propagation [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The NA and M1 proteins have proven to be effective targets for anti-influenza viral therapy [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Influenza NA is a homotetramer classified into two phylogenetically distinct groups; compared to group two (N2, N3, N6, N7 and N9), group one (N1, N4, N5 and N8) has an “150-cavity” near the active area [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The “150-cavity” is a loop of amino acids adopting an open conformation, consisting of residues 147–152 together with the active site residues Asp151 and Glu119 [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Benefitting from alkylation and guanidylation of the oseltamivir C-5 amino acid and the same transformations at position C-4 of zanamivir, the two molecules target the “150-cavity” of the NA protein, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and preventing the tethered progeny virus from escaping from host cells [

 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, due to the frequent emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses, the usage of these drugs has been greatly limited [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], making the discovery of novel anti-influenza drugs an even more urgent task.
