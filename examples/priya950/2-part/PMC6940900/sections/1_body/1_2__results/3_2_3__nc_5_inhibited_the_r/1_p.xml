<p>Based on the results of the CPE reduction assay (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-06261-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we tested other influenza virus strains including an oseltamivir-resistant strain to confirm the results above. In the additional CPE reduction experiments, NC-5 exhibited a considerable protective effect. H1N1, H1N1-H275Y and H3N2 were tested with oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) as a control. NC-5 (10–160 μM) showed significant dose-dependent anti-influenza activity. The inhibition rates at 80 μM against H1N1 and H3N2 were 81.1% and 42.1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), respectively, with minimal adverse effects on the host cell at high concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The effects were also confirmed when cells were infected with different viruses with a tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50)of 1, 0.5, and 0.3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). As in the case of H1N1-H275Y, the inhibition rate of NC-5 at 80 μM was 72.9%, while that of OC was only 4.0% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). The reduction in CPE caused by H1N1-H275Y was confirmed by direct microscopic observation, which detected a far lower CPE than the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control and the OC-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). NC-5 at 20–80 μM was able to protect cells from necrobiosis and detachment, while OC at 80 μM showed little inhibitory activity.
