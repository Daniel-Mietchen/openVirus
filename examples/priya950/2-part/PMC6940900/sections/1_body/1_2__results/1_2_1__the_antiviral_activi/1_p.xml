<p>BANA-206, a benzoic acid derivative, was reported to show potent antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The analogs of oseltamivir and zanamivir that possess a triazole substituent had been reported to inhibit the influenza virus via insertion into the 150-cavity near the active site of NA. These results prompted us to consider the use of triazole substituents to increase the NA-inhibitory effect. The cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay was utilized to screen and identify compounds that displayed a reduction in the CPE on the influenza H1N1 virus at 10 μM and 100 μM (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-06261-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that the derivatives possessed antiviral activity ranging from 7.3% to 16.7% at 10 μM, and 7.8% to 83.7% at 100 μM. The data in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-06261-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that all of the compounds exhibited a low viral inhibitory effect at 10 μM. Compounds bearing a saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon (Compound 5) showed a better effect than compounds with phenyl substituents (Compounds 1 and 2) or chain substituents (Compounds 3 and 4). Substituents consisting of large groups with saturated rings might be advantageous options for designing antiviral compounds because of the possibility of the triazole group fitting into the 150-cavity in NA. Compound 5, a diethyl triazole benzoic acid derivative named 4-(2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)amino) benzoic acid, significantly reduced the viral CPE in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with an inhibition rate of 83.7% at 100 μM, the highest inhibition rate among the derivatives.
