<p>In the NA activity inhibition assay, the NA activities of wild-type H1N1 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) as well as the CHO-K1 expression of NA proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>D) and H7N9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) were suppressed by NC-5. The NA activities of oseltamivir-resistant viruses H1N1-H275Y (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and H7N9-R294K (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) were also inhibited by NC-5 with a weaker or similar inhibition effect. The inhibition rate of NC-5 at 480 μM on all NAs was above 25% and the IC50 of each strain was higher than 480 μM. For oseltamivir-resistant strains, the inhibition rates of oseltamivir at 1 nM were less than 2% compared with inhibition rates of approximately 50% toward wild-type strains. NC-5 suppressed the NA activity of H1N1-H275Y and H7N9-R294K and the inhibition rates were both 25.8% at 480 μM. The effectiveness of NC-5 on wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus strains indicated that NC-5 might be a mild NA inhibitor that could be employed in the treatment of drug-resistant viral infections.
