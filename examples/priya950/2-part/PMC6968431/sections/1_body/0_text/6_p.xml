<p>Manual and automated phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the generated genomes belong to CHIKV-ECSA genotype. ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses showed that since 2014, Bahia has experienced different events of CHIKV re-introduction and epidemic spread (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel B). The first re-introduction event dates back to July 2015 (95% Bayesian credible interval, BCI, January 2015–November 2016). Thus, samples from the municipalities of Itamarajú and Coaraci in South Bahia, are related to a basal strain from Feira de Santana, that was shown to be the founder ECSA virus from Angola [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (clade i, 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel B). The second re-introduction event, which dates back to January 2017 (95% BCI, October 2016–August 2017) suggests the persistence of a second lineage in the municipality of Ipecaetá (clade ii, 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel B). Interestingly, a 2015 strain from the capital city of Bahia (Salvador, at 150Km from Ipecaetá) is associated with this re-introduction. Finally, a third re-introduction to several municipalities in the metropolitan regions of Salvador and Feira de Santana (clade iii, 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel B) is estimated to date back to November 2018 (95% BCI, August 2017 to May 2018) with source in Rio de Janeiro (Southeastern Brazil); a city that experienced an explosive ECSA epidemic between 2016–2018 (5).
