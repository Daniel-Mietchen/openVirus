<p>Due to the co-circulation of different mosquito-borne viruses (i.e. zika, dengue, Mayaro, oropouche, yellow fever viruses) exanthematic disease is increasing in prevalence in Brazil, making it difficult for epidemiological data alone (e.g. case counts) to help us understand the transmission of any one of the viruses. Genomics plays a crucial role in rapidly detecting and tracking mosquito-borne viral transmission. Our study shows that genomic data generated using portable sequencing technology can be employed to assist public health laboratories in monitoring the diversity of circulating mosquito-borne viruses in order to better understand the complex dynamics of viral importation and persistence among regions of Brazil.</p>
