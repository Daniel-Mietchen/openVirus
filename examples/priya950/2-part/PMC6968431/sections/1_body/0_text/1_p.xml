<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and poses a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CHIKV infection results in an acute, debilitating febrile illness, but may also become a chronic condition, with persistent or relapse symptoms of arthropathy [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Virus diversity can be classified into four distinct virus genotypes
 <bold>:</bold> the Asian, the West African, the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) and the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In September 2014, the first autochthonous CHIKV infections were confirmed in Brazil. They were characterized by two distinct genotypes: the CHIKV Asian genotype was found in Oiapoque, a city in the North of Brazil, close to the Caribbean; and CHIKV-ECSA, which originated from an infected individual in Angola and was found in Feira de Santana, Bahia in Northeast Brazil [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since then, CHIKV-ECSA has been detected in several other Brazilian states in the Northeast, Southeastern and Northern regions, exerting significant pressures on local public health systems [
