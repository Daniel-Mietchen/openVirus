<p>Diagnostic assays showed that, of the viruses tested, all the samples were positive only for CHIKV infection. From serum sampled during the two outbreaks in 2017 and 2018, we selected 20 RT-qPCR+ samples geographically widespread across eight municipalities in Bahia with a cycle threshold (Ct) ≤30 (mean 23.08, range: 16.25–27.09). From these samples near-complete genomes were obtained (coverage range 63%–96%, mean = 73%) using a nanopore sequencing approach and the pipeline from Quick et al. for the generation of consensus sequences (Supplementary table 1) (9).</p>
