  <p>Return of the CHIKV-ECSA genotype into Bahia state northeast Brazil. (A) Spatial estimation of index P across the Bahia state, with Salvador, Feira de Santana and Vitoria da Conquista identified. Each pixel is the yearly mean index P (≈ 20 Km2) estimated using WorldClim V2 dataset as in [
   <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Values coloured according to scale on the left. (B) Molecular clock phylogeny obtained using 20 new CHIKV near-complete genome sequences from the 2017–2018 epidemic in the municipality of Feira de Santana (black tips). Salvador, Camaçari, Coração de Maria, Conceição do Jacuipe, Coaraci, Itamarajú e Ipecaetá, in the Bahia State, Northeastern Brazil plus 47 publicly available Brazilian CHIKV-ECSA lineage sequences. Numbers along branches represent clade posterior probability &gt;0.90. Colours represent different locations. (C) Weekly number of laboratory confirmed cases of CHIKV between 2016 and 2018, superimposed with daily mean index P and 95% confidence interval (second Y axis). At the bottom, black bars indicate the collection dates of the viral genome sequences (
   <italic>n</italic> = 20) generated in this study.
