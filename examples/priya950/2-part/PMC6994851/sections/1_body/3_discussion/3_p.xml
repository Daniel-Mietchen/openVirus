<p id="p0080">The findings of our study suggest that influenza A/H3 was the predominant strain circulating in Nepal in year 2016. A previous study by Upadhyay et al. also reported similar finding according to which influenza A/H3 was responsible for 60.1% of the total infection in year 2014 in Nepal [

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The difference in prevalence rate reported in various study is probably due to different time and places the study have been carried out. Furthermore, it seems likely that the geographical and climatic condition of different locations around the world is different that might be reason for high prevalence of dissimilar subtypes of influenza virus in different study.
