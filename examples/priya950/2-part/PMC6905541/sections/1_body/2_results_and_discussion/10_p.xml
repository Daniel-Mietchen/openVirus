<p>The phenomenon of DENV-2 lineage replacement across successive epidemic outbreaks has been well demonstrated by Mir and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It should be considered that the circulation of lineage III (that dominated the Caribbean and South America in the 1990s) and IV in the state of Rio de Janeiro, was separated by an 8-year period. This might mean that, aside from the potential viral differences between both lineages itself [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a generation of children born during this inter-lineage silent period had never be exposed to this serotype, by the time lineage IV entered the state. This fact could be somehow involved in the changes observed in 2007â€“2008 outbreak regarding the age-group affected.
