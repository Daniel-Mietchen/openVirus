<p>In effect, a recent PAHO web bulletin is warning Latin American countries about a particular characteristic of the current dengue epidemic, which is threatening not only Brazil but the whole region too: DENV-2 seems to be affecting mostly children and adolescents under the age of 15. In Guatemala, they represent 52% of total cases of severe dengue, while in Honduras, they constitute 66% of all confirmed deaths.
