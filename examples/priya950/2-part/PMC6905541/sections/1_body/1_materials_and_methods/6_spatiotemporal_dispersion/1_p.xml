<p>Sequences generated within this work plus other 135 DENV-2 sequences obtained from the GenBank (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225879.s001">S1 Table</xref>), also employed for phylogenetic analysis, were used, together with their corresponding epidemiological data, to carry on further temporal and geographical estimations of the evolutionary process. First, the presence of sufficient temporal signal in the dataset was evaluated with the TempEst v1.5.1 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], to proceed then with phylogenetic molecular clock analysis. The time scale of the evolutionary process was assessed employing the sequences collection dates obtained from the GenBank annotations, and a GTR+I+G4 nucleotide substitution model, a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model, and a Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior. Migration events and their most reliable migration pathways were estimated using a non-reversible discrete phylogeography model with the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection approach, and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) migration rate reference prior. The analysis was implemented in BEAST v1.8.1 software package [

The 95% highest posterior density (HPD95%) interval was considered to estimate uncertainty for each estimated parameter. A maximum clade credibility tree (MCCT) was constructed with the TreeAnnotator v1.8.1 software (part of the BEAST package) after discarding 10% of the sampling, and visualized with the FigTree v1.4.3 program (available at
