 <p content-type="fig-fn">A. Phylogenetic diversity of the 
  <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> genus. Red circles: viruses from species known to cause disease in humans. MEGA (

 <p content-type="fig-fn">B. Phylogenetic diversity of the 
  <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> species. Strains are given by country and outbreak year. Red circles: variants responsible for the largest EBOV outbreaks to date. The tree was calculated with the same methods as in panel A.

 <p content-type="fig-fn">C. Sequence identity plot comparing diversity within 
  <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> variants and within the 
  <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> genus; and generic ebolavirus assay scheme. Header: scheme of ebolavirus genome organisation; numbered horizontal lines in light blue: position of the amplicons of the first round; vertical lines: the specific position of the first and second round primers; red lines: forward primers; blue lines: reverse primers. The identity plot was calculated in SSE (

  <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (as in panels A and B); a fragment length of 500 nt. and an increment between fragments of 25 nt were selected.
