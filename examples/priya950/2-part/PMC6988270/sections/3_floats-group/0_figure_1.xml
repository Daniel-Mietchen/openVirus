 <p content-type="fig-fn">The assay from Quick et al. comprises two primer schemes of 11 and 19 primer pairs and was validated for use on the MinION platform. Notably, the authors made their assay available in July 2015, almost 1 year ahead of publication [
  <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The assay from Arias et al. [
  <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] relies on a proprietary workflow termed Ion Ampliseq and comprises two sets of 72 and 73 primer pairs each, which are to be amplified in two separate multiplexed reactions and sequenced on an Ion Torrent platform; the Artic schemes are part of a set of online resources for EBOV MinION-based sequencing. The first version has been available since 2017 in github (

The current version of the assay comprises 61 primer pairs to be multiplexed in two PCR reactions containing 30 and 31 primer pairs each.
