<p>To address this, we retrieved and aligned all available ebolavirus full or partial genomes from GenBank (accessed on 22 June 2019) and removed identical sequences (n = 2,368 sequences in the final dataset). We included the most closely related Lloviu virus, retrieved from Spanish bats and classified in the 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> sister genus 
 <italic>Cuevavirus</italic> in the alignment, to allow for the identification of highly conserved sites across the genomes. This was done because mutations are not spread evenly across viral genomes and conserved areas exist because of functional domains or RNA secondary structures limiting mutations in a given genomic region. With this approach, the assay can be used long-term and predictably for divergent ebolaviruses, as shown for other viruses before [

Following several rounds of primer design and experimental validation of assay sensitivity on quantified EBOV Makona RNA, the final protocol comprised two PCR rounds comprising 31 overlapping assays per run, with an average product size of around 900 bp and at least 50 nt overlap (

In those genomic areas where it was not possible to identify conserved regions across the ebolavirus species, species-specific primers were developed and multiplexed (
