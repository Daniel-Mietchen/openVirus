<p>Reactive set-up of protocols for genomic surveillance in outbreak settings takes months of laboratory development and dissemination within the scientific community, hindering timely outbreak response. The generic ebolavirus PCR protocol presented here is designed to circumvent these limitations and contribute to genomic surveillance of current and emerging ebolavirus variants. This will be useful both in resource-limited areas, exemplified by the current outbreak affecting the DRC, and in laboratories testing healthcare workers and travellers from outbreak areas.</p>
