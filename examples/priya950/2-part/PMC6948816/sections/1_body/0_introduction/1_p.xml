<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus, which is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>. Before 2007, circulation of the virus only occurred sporadically in African and Asian countries [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Between 2007 and 2013, ZIKV caused large-scale epidemics in the populations of Micronesia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and other Pacific islands [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV probably became established in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in the Americas between 2013-2014, [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and then spread rapidly across the continent. In 2015, doctors in Brazil started reporting clusters of infants born with microcephaly, a severe congenital abnormality, and of adults with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a paralyzing neurological condition, resulting in the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. WHO stated, in September 2016, that ZIKV in pregnancy was the most likely cause of the clusters of microcephaly, and other adverse congenital outcomes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The risk of an affected pregnancy appears highest during the first trimester, with estimates between 1.0 and 4.5% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By the beginning of 2018, over 220,000 confirmed cases of ZIKV infection had been reported from Latin America and the Caribbean [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is estimated to be only 1.02% (± 0.93%) of the total number of cases, based on mathematical modelling studies [
