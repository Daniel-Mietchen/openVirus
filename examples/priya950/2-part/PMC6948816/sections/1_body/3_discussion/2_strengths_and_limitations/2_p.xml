<p>We chose a simple approach based on an SIR structure, similar to the model used by Netto et al. (2017), to focus on the dynamics of infection and immunity in the human population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We did not model vector populations and behavior explicitly, as in some other studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This simplification limits the mechanistic interpretation of the epidemic parameters, but provides a phenomenological description of the transmission dynamics. We believe that this approach is appropriate because our main objective was to determine the risk of an outbreak after reintroduction of ZIKV, which is mostly influenced by the level of protective immunity in the human population. We acknowledge that the future occurrence of ZIKV in the area also depends on the presence of a competent vector. Our choice is supported by sensitivity analyses that show that more complex model structures (delayed SIR and Ross-MacDonald-type models) were not superior to a simple SIR structure in describing the 2016 ZIKV epidemic of Managua (Supporting information S1). Similarly, Pandey et al. (2013) showed that additional model complexity does not result in a better description of the dynamics of transmission of dengue virus (another Aedes-borne virus) in a human population compared with a SIR model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our model, the transmission rate (
