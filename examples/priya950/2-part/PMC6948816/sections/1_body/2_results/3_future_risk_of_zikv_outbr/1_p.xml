<p>Reintroductions of ZIKV in the population of Managua are unlikely to develop into sizeable outbreaks before 2035, 24 years after the 2016 epidemic, assuming lifelong immunity for individuals infected in 2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007978.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). After this point, attack rates resulting from ZIKV reintroduction will rise steeply. By 2047, we predict that ZIKV reintroductions will have a 50% probability of resulting in outbreaks with attack rates greater than 1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007978.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In 2047 the median attack rate of successful introductions is 3.6% (IQR: 2.0â€“6.2).
