<p>We implemented the model in ‘Stan’ version 2.18 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and we conducted analyses with R version 3.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Bayesian inference framework Stan permits the use of probability distributions over parameters instead of single values, allowing for the direct propagation of uncertainty. Stan models are compiled in C++, which improves the efficiency of simulations. The algorithm in Supporting information S1 describes the ABM in pseudo code. The model code and data are available from
