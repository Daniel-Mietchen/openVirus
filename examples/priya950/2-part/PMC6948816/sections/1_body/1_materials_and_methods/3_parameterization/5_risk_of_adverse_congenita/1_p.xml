<p>The estimated number of microcephaly cases resulting from the reintroduction of ZIKV depended on the exposure, i.e. the number of pregnant women infected by ZIKV during their first trimester, to which we applied three different levels of risk, based on published estimates [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We obtained the number of ZIKV infections among women aged 15â€“49 years from ABM simulations. As gender was not explicitly considered in the model, we assumed that women represented 50% of the population. We assumed a uniform distribution of births during the reproductive period, and considered that the first trimester constituted a third of ongoing pregnancies at a given time. We explored three different levels of risk of microcephaly in births to pregnant woman with ZIKV infection during the first trimester, as reported by Zhang et al. (2017), based on data from French Polynesia (0.95%, called low risk) and Brazil (2.19% and 4.52%, called intermediate and high risk, respectively) [
