  <p>Ffar2 enhances IAV replication in mouse RAW 264.7 cells. (A) Mouse RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with mouse 
   <italic>Ffar2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA for 48 h, and the knockdown of Ffar2 was confirmed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-FFAR2 pAb. (B) Mouse RAW 264.7 cells were treated with mouse 
   <italic>Ffar2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA and cultured at 37°C for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by using a CellTiter-Glo assay. (C and D) 
   <italic>Ffar2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-transfected RAW 264.7 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 0.1 (C) or 5 (D). Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points, and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells. **,
