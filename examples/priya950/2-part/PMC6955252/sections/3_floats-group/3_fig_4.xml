  <p>FFAR2 knockdown does not stimulate IFN pathways. (A and B) 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-transfected A549 cells were left untreated or were treated with IFN-α (A) or IFN-β (B) for 24 h. The cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-Mx1 pAb for the detection of Mx1 protein. (C) HEK293T cells were treated with 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA for 24 h and then transfected with the ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid and the pRL-TK control plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. After normalization with cotransfected 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity, the relative firefly luciferase activity of the FFAR2 knockdown cells was expressed as the fold induction of the ISRE firefly luciferase activity compared to control cells.
