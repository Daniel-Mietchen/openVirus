<p>Studies have established that β-arrestins are essential for the internalization of many GPCRs (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), acting as adaptors that link the receptors to clathrin-coated pits (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Mammalian cells express four arrestin members, arrestin-1, β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, and arrestin-4, of which only the β-arrestins (β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2) are ubiquitously expressed (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We therefore asked whether β-arrestins were recruited during FFAR2-mediated IAV endocytosis by evaluating the effect of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 downregulation on IAV infection. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting showed that the expression levels of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were reduced in specific siRNA-treated A549 cells and retrovirally mediated β-arrestin1- or β-arrestin2-overexpressing cells but not in cells treated with nontargeting siRNA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">B</xref>). siRNA knockdown of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 had no toxic effects on the viability of A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). The siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 0.1), and the virus titers in the supernatant were determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>, only β-arrestin1 downregulation led to a significant decrease in virus titers compared with the scrambled siRNA-treated cells. We then investigated whether β-arrestin1 was involved in FFAR2-mediated IAV endocytosis. To achieve this, we conducted a BiFC assay in which FFAR2 was fused in frame with N-terminal residues 1 to 173 of Venus protein (FFAR2-VN) and β-arrestin1 was fused with C-terminal residues 174 to 239 of Venus (β-arrestin1-VC). We detected an intense Venus fluorescence signal in HeLa cells cotransfected with the two fusion constructs, indicating that β-arrestin1 strongly interacts with FFAR2 (
