<p>We identified FFAR2 as a potential host factor for the replication of IAV by using a whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screen (our unpublished data) targeting 21,585 mRNAs and a replication-competent Venus-expressing H5N1 virus (H5N1 NA-Venus) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). To confirm this finding, we analyzed the impact of siRNA-mediated FFAR2 knockdown on the growth of different reporter viruses expressing Venus fluorescent protein, namely, H1N1 NA-Venus, H5N1 NA-Venus, and H9N2 NA-Venus viruses. We found that 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA treatment efficiently reduced the expression of FFAR2 without adversely affecting cell viability (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). At 24â€‰h postinfection (p.i.), the fluorescence intensity of the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated A549 cells was normalized to that of the scrambled siRNA-treated cells. FFAR2 downregulation by siRNA silencing produced at least a 30% reduction in fluorescence intensity in the cells infected with H1N1 NA-Venus, H5N1 NA-Venus, or H9N2 NA-Venus virus (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">E</xref>). The inhibitory effect of FFAR2 knockdown on the growth of the NA-Venus reporter viruses was also apparent when NP staining was used as an indicator to quantify the percentage of infected cells (
