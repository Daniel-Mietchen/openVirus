<p>We further evaluated the role of Ffar2 in IAV replication in mouse RAW 264.7 cells. Western blotting showed that the expression of Ffar2 was reduced in specific siRNA-treated RAW 264.7 cells but not in cells treated with scrambled siRNA (

 <italic>Ffar2</italic> had no cytotoxic effects on RAW 264.7 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), as measured by using a luminescent cell viability assay. Strikingly, 46- and 14-fold decreases in virus titers were observed at 24 and 48 h p.i., respectively, in 
 <italic>Ffar2</italic> siRNA-treated RAW 264.7 cells infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (

 <italic>Ffar2</italic> siRNA treatment led to an 8-fold reduction in the virus titer at 8 h p.i. when the cells were infected at an MOI of 5 (
