<p>The role of FFAR2 in IAV replication was also explored by using 4-CMTB and compound 58 (Cmp58) [(
 <italic>S</italic>)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide], which are allosteric agonists of FFAR2 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Treatment with 100 or 10 μM 4-CMTB and 10 μM Cmp58 had no adverse effect on the viability of A549 cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>, treatment with 100 μM 4-CMTB led to a 13-fold decrease in the AH05 (H5N1) virus titer at 24 h p.i. compared with that in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells, whereas a slight inhibitory effect on virus replication was observed in response to treatment with 10 μM 4-CMTB, indicating that 4-CMTB inhibited IAV replication in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment with 10 μM Cmp58 reduced the viral titer by 17-fold at 24 h p.i. (
