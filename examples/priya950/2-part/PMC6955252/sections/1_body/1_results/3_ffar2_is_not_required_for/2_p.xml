<p>Next, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of FFAR2 on viral attachment to cell membrane SA receptors. A549 cells were transfected with the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or control siRNA for 48 h and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4°C, which allows virus attachment but prevents virus internalization (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The cells were washed, trypsinized, fixed, stained with an anti-HA or an anti-NP monoclonal antibody (mAb), and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">E</xref>, there was no difference in the percentage of membrane-bound viruses between FFAR2 knockdown and control cells, indicating that FFAR2 knockdown did not adversely affect the attachment of IAV to the cell surface. We also carried out a binding experiment with AH05 (H5N1) virus on ice at 4°C for 1 h. After washing to remove unbound viruses, the cells were frozen and thawed three times to allow for the release of viruses bound to the surface of the cells into the supernatant. The viruses in the supernatant were then titrated by the use of a plaque assay on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>, there was no difference in the amounts of infectious virus attached on the surface between the FFAR2 knockdown cells and the control cells. Taken together, these data indicate that FFAR2 is not required for IAV attachment to the cell surface.
