<p>To further explore the function of FFAR2 in IAV replication, we determined the impact of FFAR2 knockdown on the early steps of the viral life cycle. Since the binding of viral HA to SA receptors on the cell surface is the first step for an IAV to invade a host cell (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), we first determined whether FFAR2 knockdown affects SA expression on the surface of the cell membrane. To this end, we used Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin, which specifically recognizes SA moieties, to detect whether the cell surface SAs are differentially expressed between FFAR2 knockdown A549 cells and control cells by flow cytometry analysis. FFAR2 knockdown did not affect the expression of SAs on the surface of the cell membrane (

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Maackia amurensis</named-content> lectin (MAL) (specific for α-2,3-SA) and 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sambucus nigra</named-content> lectin (SNA) (specific for α-2,6-SA). No difference in the amounts of these two types of cell surface SA receptors was observed between FFAR2 knockdown A549 cells and control cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the restricted replication of IAV in FFAR2-knocked-down cells was not caused by a change in the cell surface expression of the total or specific types of SAs.
