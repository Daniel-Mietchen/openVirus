<p>The binding of viral HA protein to the SA receptors on the cell membrane rapidly initiates the endocytosis process of IAV. Therefore, we examined whether FFAR2 functions in the step of internalization after attachment of viral HA to the SA receptors. First, A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4°C and then washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) or PBS-HCl (pH 1.3). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>, the NP signal was completely lost from cells washed with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3), whereas washing with PBS did not affect the NP signal of infected cells. Therefore, the viral NP protein was suitable to act as an internalization marker to indicate whether virions were internalized into the cells or removed from the cell surface. Next, 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4°C, followed by a culture temperature shift to 37°C for 30 min to allow for internalization. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove virions retained on the cell surface and lysed for the detection of internalized viral NP protein by Western blotting. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>, the amount of viral NP protein inside the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated A549 cells was dramatically decreased compared with that in the control siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that most of the IAV particles were not internalized into the infected cells when the expression of FFAR2 was downregulated. These data clearly show that FFAR2 is important for the internalization of IAV into cells.
