<p>Most of the GPCRs are phosphorylated at the C terminus by GRKs (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), followed by binding of β-arrestins to mediate the internalization of the receptor and the subsequent signaling cascade (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). There are seven isoforms of GRKs, GRK1 to GRK7, among which only GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6 are widely expressed in different cell types (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We therefore assessed the role of GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6 in the regulation of IAV replication by means of siRNA silencing. Real-time PCR showed that the expression of GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, or GRK6 was reduced in specific siRNA-treated A549 cells but not in cells treated with control siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>) and that siRNA treatment had no toxic effect on A549 cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). The knockdown efficiency of siRNAs was also validated by the reduced expression of cotransfected GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 protein expression constructs in HEK293T cells as well as by the decreased endogenous expression of GRK6 protein in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>). The siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 0.1), and the virus titers in the supernatant were determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D</xref>, downregulation of three of the four GRKs, that is, GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6, dramatically decreased the virus titers compared with those in the scrambled siRNA-treated cells. We then investigated whether GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 interacts with FFAR2. HeLa cells were cotransfected with FFAR2-VN and GRK2-VC, GRK5-VC, or GRK6-VC, in which the GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 protein was fused with C-terminal residues 174 to 239 of Venus protein, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9E</xref>, a strong Venus fluorescence signal was detected in HeLa cells cotransfected with FFAR2-VN and GRK2-VC, GRK5-VC, or GRK6-VC, which indicates that GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 interact with FFAR2. Together, these results suggest that GRK2-, GRK5-, or GRK6-mediated phosphorylation of FFAR2 facilitates downstream signaling by promoting the recruitment of β-arrestin1 and AP2B1, ultimately enhancing the endocytosis of IAV through the CME pathway.
