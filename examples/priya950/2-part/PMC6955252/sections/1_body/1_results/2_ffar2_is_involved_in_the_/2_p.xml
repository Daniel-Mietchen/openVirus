<p>We also examined the cellular distribution of viral NP in A549 cells pretreated with 100 μM 4-CMTB, 10 μM Cmp58, or DMSO. Significantly, pretreatment of cells with 4-CMTB or Cmp58 led to inhibition of NP nuclear accumulation at 3 and 4 h p.i. compared to cells treated with DMSO (

 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or agonists indicates that the host factor FFAR2 is involved in the early stage of IAV replication.
