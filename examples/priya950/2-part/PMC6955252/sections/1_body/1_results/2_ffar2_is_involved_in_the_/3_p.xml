<p>Next, we validated the inhibitory effect of FFAR2 knockdown on viral NP localization by performing a cell fractionation experiment. 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- and control siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 5. At 2 and 3 h p.i., the infected cells were lysed, separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and subjected to Western blotting. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, the marker proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and LaminB1 were detected only in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Notably, the NP level was markedly reduced in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of the FFAR2-knocked-down A549 cells compared with those in the control siRNA-treated cells at 2 and 3 h p.i., thereby confirming that FFAR2 downregulation causes a defect in the early stage of virus replication.
