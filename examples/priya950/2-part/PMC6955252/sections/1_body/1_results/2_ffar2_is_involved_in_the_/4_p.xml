<p>We further investigated whether FFAR2 had an effect on the transcription and replication of the IAV genome by using a minigenome replicon assay. 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing the four viral RNP proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus, along with a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene flanked by the terminal coding and noncoding sequences of the viral NS segment under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter and terminator. Thirty-six hours later, the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was determined as a measure of the viral RNP activity. We found that the viral RNP activity remained unchanged when the expression of FFAR2 was knocked down by specific siRNA compared with that in control siRNA-treated cells (
