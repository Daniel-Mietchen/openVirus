<p>The initial step of IAV infection is to bind to SA receptors conjugated to glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. This binding triggers subsequent viral entry steps. For IAV, the principal route of entry into host cells is the CME pathway. A number of studies have demonstrated that IAV internalization requires the engagement of various cellular factors, for example, the EPN1 adaptor protein (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), or protein kinase C (PKC) (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). However, the role of these factors was mostly demonstrated in a limited number of IAV subtypes, such as H1N1 or H3N2. Moreover, it has been reported that distinct signaling pathways are specifically activated by different IAV subtypes to facilitate virus internalization (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These facts prompted us to investigate potential cofactors involved in the entry of H5N1 virus into host cells.
