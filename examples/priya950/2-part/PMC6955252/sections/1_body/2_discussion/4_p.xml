<p>The arrestins are a family of four proteins: arrestins 1 and 4 are primarily expressed in the eye and are associated with visual transduction, whereas the nonvisual arrestins 2 and 3 (also known as β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2) are more widely expressed (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The ubiquitously expressed β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are best known for functioning in the regulation of phosphorylated GPCR desensitization and internalization (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). To date, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 have been reported to be involved in the internalization process of many viruses, such as HIV (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and JC polyomavirus (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The GPCR family proteins have different binding affinities for β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Lee et al. used a bimolecular luminescence complementation assay and coimmunoprecipitation to demonstrate that FFAR2 can interact with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). In our study, the introduction of β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic> siRNA into A549 cells attenuated H5N1 virus replication, whereas treatment with β-
 <italic>arrestin2</italic> siRNA had no observable effect. It may be that β-arrestin1 interacts with FFAR2 with a higher affinity than β-arrestin2 during H5N1 virus infection.
