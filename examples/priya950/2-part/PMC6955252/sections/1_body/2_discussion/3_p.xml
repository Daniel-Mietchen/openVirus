<p>The mechanism of FFAR2 function during IAV uptake was unraveled by dissecting the roles of associated adaptors in the signaling cascade. Typically, mammalian GPCR endocytosis upon activation is dependent primarily on the regulation of arrestins through a CME pathway (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). GRKs are involved in this process and specifically phosphorylate activated GPCRs (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In our study, we found that GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 knockdown in A549 cells inhibited IAV replication. However, it remains unknown whether these kinases simultaneously or sequentially regulate the phosphorylation of FFAR2. In addition, Western blotting showed that only GRK6 in A549 cells was abundantly expressed, and the endogenous expression levels of GRK2 and GRK5 were relatively low. Taking into account that GRK6 knockdown produced the most significant inhibitory effect on IAV replication in A549 cells, we speculated that GRK6 may play a more important role in the C-terminal phosphorylation of FFAR2 during IAV infection than GRK2 and GRK5.
