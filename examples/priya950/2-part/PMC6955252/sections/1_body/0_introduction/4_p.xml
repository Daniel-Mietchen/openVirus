<p>Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) (also known as GPR43), together with FFAR1 and FFAR3, is classified as a rhodopsin-like receptor and clusters at chromosome 19q13.1 in humans (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), dendritic cells (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and regulatory T cells (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). FFAR2 can be activated by short-chain fatty acids such as acetate and propionate (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and this activation is coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> release, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation, inhibition of cAMP accumulation (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and modulation of the p38, Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and Akt signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). FFAR2 has also been linked to the severity of inflammation, although different studies have reached contentious conclusions (
