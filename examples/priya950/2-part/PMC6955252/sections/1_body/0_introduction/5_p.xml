<p>In the present study, we demonstrate that FFAR2 is a novel host factor for the efficient replication of IAV and discover that FFAR2 plays an important role in the entry step of the virus life cycle. We further found that FFAR2-mediated IAV internalization involves downstream signaling molecules such as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), Î²-arrestin1, and the AP-2 complex.</p>
