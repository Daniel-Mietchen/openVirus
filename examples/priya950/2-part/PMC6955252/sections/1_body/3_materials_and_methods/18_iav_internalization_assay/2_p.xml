<p>A549 cells in 6-well plates were treated with siRNA targeting 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> or 
 <italic>AP2B1</italic> or with scrambled siRNA (30 nM) for 48 h and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) on ice at 4°C for 1 h, followed by a culture temperature shift to 37°C for 30 min to allow for internalization. The cells were then washed five times with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove the attached but not-yet-internalized virions and then subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb.
