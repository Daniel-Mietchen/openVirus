<p>A549 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 90% confluence and then treated with DMSO, 4-CMTB (100 μM), or Cmp58 (10 μM) for 3 h at 37°C prior to infection with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) at 37°C. The cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) at the indicated time points p.i. to remove the attached but not-yet-internalized virions and then subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb.</p>
