<p>A549 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 90% confluence and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4°C. The infected cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.2) or PBS-HCl (pH 1.3). Afterwards, the cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and then subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb.</p>
