<p>A549 cells in 6-cm dishes were treated with siRNA targeting 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> or with scrambled siRNA (30 nM) for 48 h and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) on ice at 4°C for 1 h. The cells were trypsinized, fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, and then stained with the corresponding primary (mouse anti-NP mAb, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and mouse anti-HA mAb, without permeabilization) and secondary [Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L)] antibodies. After three washes with PBS, the cell suspensions were subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed by using FlowJo software.
