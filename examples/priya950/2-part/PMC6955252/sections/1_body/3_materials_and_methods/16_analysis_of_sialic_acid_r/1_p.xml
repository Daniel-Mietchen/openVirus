<p>A549 cells were transfected with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA (30 nM). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized, fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min, and then stained with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Invitrogen), a commonly used agent for the detection of sialic acids (SAs) on the cell surface. After two washes with PBS, the cell suspensions were subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). In a separate experiment, A549 cells treated with siRNA and fixed with PFA were stained with biotinylated 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Maackia amurensis</named-content> lectin (MAL) (α-2,3-SA) or 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sambucus nigra</named-content> lectin (SNA) (α-2,6-SA) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The bound biotinylated lectins were captured by streptavidin conjugated with Cy-5 (Life Technologies). After three washes, the cell suspensions were subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A549 cells pretreated with neuraminidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 2 h were stained with WGA, MAL, or SNA and used as negative controls. The data were analyzed by using FlowJo software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR).
