<p>Cell viability was determined by using the CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Briefly, A549 cells seeded in opaque-walled 96-well plates containing 100 or 10 μM 4-CMTB or Cmp58 were cultured for 24 h, and A549 cells transfected with different siRNAs at a concentration of 30 nM were cultured for 48 h. CellTiter-Glo reagent (100 μl) was then added directly into each well to induce cell lysis on a shaker for 10 min before luminescence was measured with a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega).
