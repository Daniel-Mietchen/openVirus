<p>The retroviral construct pQCXIN-FFAR2 or the empty pQCXIN vector was transfected into the AmphoPack-293 packaging cell line (catalog number 631505; Clontech) cultured in 10-cm dishes by using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents. At 48 h posttransfection, viral supernatants from the packaging cell line were collected and used to transduce 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells cultured in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells were retransduced with viral supernatants. The confluent transduced cells were trypsinized and cultured for 1 week in medium supplemented with 1,000 μg/ml G418 for selection. The surviving cells were individually cloned in 96-well plates by using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) and propagated, resulting in the generation of 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells. The complementation of FFAR2 in 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells was verified by Western blotting. The 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells or control A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1) virus. Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells.
