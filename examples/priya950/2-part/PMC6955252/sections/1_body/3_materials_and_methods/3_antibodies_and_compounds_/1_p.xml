The mouse anti-NP mAb and rabbit anti-NP pAb were made and stored in our laboratory. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (catalog number A11029) and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (catalog number A21071), obtained from Life Technologies, were used as secondary antibodies for confocal microscopy. The secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (catalog number 072-07-18-06) and DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (catalog number 072-07-15-06), purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Agonists of FFAR2, 4-CMTB (catalog number SML0302) and Cmp58 [(
 <italic>S</italic>)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide] (catalog number 371725), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. An inhibitor of the β-arrestin1/AP2B1 complex, Barbadin {3-amino-5-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenyl]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one} (catalog number B118250), was purchased from TRC (Ontario, Canada).
