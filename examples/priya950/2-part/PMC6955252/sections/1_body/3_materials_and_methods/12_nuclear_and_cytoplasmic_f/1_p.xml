 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells grown in 6-cm dishes were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 5. At 2 and 3 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the siRNA-treated cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 200 μl of cytoplasmic extraction reagent I containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and a protease cocktail inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min before 11 μl of ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent II was added; the suspension was then vortexed for 5 s, incubated on ice for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 ×
