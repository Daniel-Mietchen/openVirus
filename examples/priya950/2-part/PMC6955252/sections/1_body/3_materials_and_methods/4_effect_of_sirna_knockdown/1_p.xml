<p>A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and then transfected with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA (5′-GCCUCUGUAUGGAGUGAUU-3′) or with a scrambled siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) at a concentration of 30 nM by using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At 48 h posttransfection, knockdown of FFAR2 was verified by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-FFAR2 pAb. siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected for 24 h with H1N1 NA-Venus, H5N1 NA-Venus, or H9N2 NA-Venus virus (MOI = 0.1). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained for nuclei by using Hoechst 33342. Images were captured by using the Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and used to calculate the cell infection ratio according to the Venus fluorescence intensity. The inhibitory effect of siRNA on virus replication is shown as a relative ratio, which was calculated by dividing the average fluorescence intensity of three cell wells containing 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA with that of three wells containing scrambled siRNA. In an independent experiment, A549 cells that were treated with siRNA and infected as described above were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and incubated with blocking buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The viral NP protein was stained by immunostaining with a rabbit anti-NP pAb and goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 633. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Blue and red fluorescence images were collected from the same area and used to quantify the percentage of infected cells. The percentage of infection was calculated as follows: number of cells expressing NP protein (red)/total number of cells (blue) (&gt;300 cells were examined).
