<p>A549 cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA (30 nM) for 48 h and then left untreated or treated with 100 U/ml of IFN-α (Sigma-Aldrich) or 25 pg/ml of IFN-β (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-Mx1 pAb to determine the level of Mx1 protein expression.
