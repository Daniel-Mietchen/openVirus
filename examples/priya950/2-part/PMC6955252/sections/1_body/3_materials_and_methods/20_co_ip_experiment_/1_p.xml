<p>HEK293T cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids by using the Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents. At 36 h posttransfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.2) and lysed with IP lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and PMSF for 30 min on ice. The supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with glutathione magnetic agarose beads (Pierce) or with a rabbit anti-GST pAb and protein A/G-agarose (Abmart, Berkeley Heights, NJ) and rocked at 4°C overnight. The beads were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting.</p>
