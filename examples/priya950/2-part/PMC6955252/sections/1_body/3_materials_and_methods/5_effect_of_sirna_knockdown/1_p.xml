At 48 h posttransfection, the knockdown efficiency was determined by qRT-PCR or Western blotting. The siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 0.01), AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1), or SH13 (H9N2) (MOI = 0.1) virus. Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points, and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells (
