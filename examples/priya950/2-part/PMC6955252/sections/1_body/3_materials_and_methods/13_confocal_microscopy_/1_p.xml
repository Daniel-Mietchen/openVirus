<p>A549 cells treated with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA (30 nM), 4-CMTB (100 μM), Cmp58 (10 μM), or DMSO in glass-bottom dishes were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 5. At 2, 3, or 4 h p.i., cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The permeabilized cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with the rabbit anti-NP pAb for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) for 1 h. After three washes, the cells were incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min to stain the nuclei. Images were acquired by using the LSM 800 confocal microscope with Airyscan (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
