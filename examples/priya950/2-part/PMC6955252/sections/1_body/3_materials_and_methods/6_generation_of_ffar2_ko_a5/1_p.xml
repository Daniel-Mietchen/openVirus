 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells were established using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Each of the four sgRNA sequences (5′-CGCAGCCTCGATGATCTTGA-3′, 5′-GTCTGCGCCCTCACGAGTTT-3′, 5′-CACCGATAACCAGTTGGACG-3′, and 5′-CTGGTGGCGGTCAATAGCCG-3′) was inserted into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458) vector (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), which also contains an expression cassette for Cas9 and EGFP. Two micrograms of each pX458 plasmid containing one of the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>-targeting sequences was simultaneously electrotransfected into A549 cells by using the Neon transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The electrotransfected cells were trypsinized 48 h later, and single cells were then seeded into each well of a 96-well plate by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The knockout of FFAR2 expression was confirmed by PCR, sequencing, and Western blotting. The 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells or control cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells.
