<p>HEK293T cells were treated with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA (30 nM) for 24 h and then transfected with the ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) and the pRL-TK control plasmid (0.01 μg) for 24 h. The luciferase activity of the transfected cells was determined by performing a dual-luciferase reporter assay.
