  <p>Effect of neuraminidase on replication of EV-D68 isolates. Time course of replication of multiple isolates of EV-D68 from RD and N2A cells untreated or treated with neuraminidase at 37°C for 30 min prior to virus infection. Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and incubated at 33°C, and at indicated times, cultures were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Bottom, effect of neuraminidase treatment on yield of influenza virus. MDCK cells were pretreated with neuraminidase as described above, infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3, and incubated at 33°C. At 24 h postinfection, supernatants were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay.</p>
