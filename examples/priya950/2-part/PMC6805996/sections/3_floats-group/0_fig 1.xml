  <p>Replication of EV-D68 isolates in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells. Time course of replication of multiple isolates of EV-D68 from a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (N2A). Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and incubated at 33°C, and at the indicated times, cultures were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
