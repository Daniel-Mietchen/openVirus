  <p>Replication of EV-D68 isolates in human cortical neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Time course of replication of multiple isolates of EV-D68 from hiPSCs cortical neurons or astrocytes derived from induced human pluripotent stem cells. Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and incubated at 33°C, and at indicated times, cultures were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
