  <p>Replication of EV-D68 isolates in primary murine astrocytes. (A) Primary murine astrocytes stained with antibody against GFAP. (B) Time course of replication of multiple isolates of EV-D68 in astrocytes isolated from P1 to P3 mouse brains. Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and incubated at 33°C, and at indicated times, cultures were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Results are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
