<p>To determine if mouse cells are susceptible and permissive for EV-D68 infection, a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (MEF) and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (N2A) were infected with multiple isolates of EV-D68 including Fermon and Rhyne from the initial virus outbreak in 1962; NY from 2009; and 2014 isolates, including 947, 949, 952, 953, and 956. Virus replication was assessed by plaque assay. The NY, 947, and Rhyne isolates replicated in MEFs, while all but the Rhyne isolate replicated in the N2A cultures (
