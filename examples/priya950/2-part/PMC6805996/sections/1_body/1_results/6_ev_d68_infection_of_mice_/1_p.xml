<p>EV-D68-associated paralysis is predominantly diagnosed in children under the age of 6 years. To determine if neuropathogenesis of EV-D68 infection of mice is age dependent, 10-day- and 4-week-old wild-type C57/BL6 animals were intracranially inoculated with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of the NY 68, Fermon, 947, and 952 isolates. No mouse developed paralysis (

 <sup>5</sup> PFU of the NY 68, Fermon, 947, and 952 isolates. By 3 days postinfection, all but one mouse developed paralysis, which was independent of sex (
