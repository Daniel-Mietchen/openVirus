<p>The requirement for sialic acid can also be investigated by its removal from the cell surface with neuraminidase prior to virus infection. To further refine understanding of the requirement for sialic acid for infection with EV-D68, cultures of various cells, including rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, the cells used for propagation and titration of the virus, and N2A cells, were incubated with medium containing neuraminidase 30 min prior to infection to remove sialic acid. At the indicated time postinfection, viral replication was determined by plaque assay. All EV-D68 isolates with the exception of Rhyne were able to infect neuraminidase-treated N2A cells, albeit with diminished efficiency (

The Rhyne isolate did not replicate in N2A cells; however, upon neuraminidase treatment, a higher background titer was observed, although no replication took place (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Neuraminidase treatment might have prevented efficient removal of nonabsorbed virus despite two washings with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after absorption. This observation may reflect a role for sialic acid in increasing the local concentration or proper localization of the cell receptor within the cell membrane; infection with the Rhyne isolate might be more dependent upon these properties. Alternatively, the Rhyne isolate might have a lower affinity for the cell receptor than other isolates, and the presence of sialic acid aids could increase the affinity/avidity of the interaction between virion and receptor; consequently, entry into neuraminidase-treated cells is slower for this isolate than others, leading to a higher background after adsorption. Without knowledge of the receptor and receptor-virus particle kinetics, it is difficult to resolve this observation. The activity of neuraminidase was assessed by incubating Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or human RBCs with neuraminidase-containing medium for 30 min prior to the addition of influenza A virus. Production of infectious virus after infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells pretreated with neuraminidase was severely attenuated (

These results suggest that interaction with sialic acid may be necessary in only certain contexts to facilitate virus attachment to the cell surface, as described for Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus, enterovirus 70, and coxsackievirus A24 (
