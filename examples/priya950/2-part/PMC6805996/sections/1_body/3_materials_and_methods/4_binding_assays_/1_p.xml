<p>Hemagglutination assays were done in V-shaped microtiter plates (Fisher, 07-200-698). Equal volumes of 0.5% washed human (David Fidock, Columbia University, NY) or guinea pig (Rockland, R402-0050) red blood cells were added to serial 2-fold dilutions of virus. Plates were incubated at 4°C, and readings were made every 30 min for 2 h. Activity of neuraminidase was verified by lack of influenza virus hemagglutination on treated guinea pig red blood cells (data not shown).</p>
