<p>At either 0 h or 96 h postinfection, the medium was removed from EV-D68 virus-infected or uninfected organotypic brain slice cultures and the cultures were placed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixative dissolved in 1× PBS at 4°C. Following fixation, cultures were incubated in blocking solution of PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 3% horse serum. Cultures were incubated overnight in at 4°C in blocking solution containing appropriate primary antibodies. Sections were washed in 1× PBS and incubated in the presence of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution. Sections were mounted on slides using Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.) or Fluorsave (Millipore, Fisher) and imaged using an iZ80 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV100 spectral confocal system). Brain sections were imaged using an 60× 1.42-numerical-aperture (NA) oil objective or a 10× 0.40-NA air objective. All images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p>
