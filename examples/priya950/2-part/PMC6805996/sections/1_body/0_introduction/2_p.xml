<p>EV-D68 is a unique enterovirus, as its physical and genetic properties are similar to both human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and poliovirus. Akin to the HRV particle, the EV-D68 virion is acid labile and optimal virus growth occurs at 33Â°C (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Like HRVs, the sites of infection for EV-D68 are the nasopharyngeal cavity and the respiratory tract, but not the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa, which are sites of entry for poliovirus. Transmission of EV-D68 is also very different from that of poliovirus and occurs via respiratory aerosols, not fecal-oral contamination (
