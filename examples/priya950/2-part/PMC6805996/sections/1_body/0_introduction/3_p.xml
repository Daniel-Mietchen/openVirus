<p>Children with AFM associated with EV-D68 display limb weakness and cranial nerve abnormalities (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This conclusion has been made by using neuroblastoma cells, which are not primary cells of the nervous system. Two murine models of EV-D68-induced paralytic myelitis have been established. These two models address the question of neuroinvasion, the ability of the virus to enter the central nervous system (CNS) from a peripheral site of infection, and neurovirulence, the ability to cause disease. One model utilizes infection of 1-day-old mice, and intramuscular inoculation of the virus is required for efficient development of paralysis (

Unlike poliovirus, EV-D68 is a respiratory virus not known to infect the musculoskeletal system, nor has virus been observed to traffic into the CNS via the neuromuscular junction. Furthermore, the respiratory tract is a passive conduit for gas exchange and, with the exception of the diaphragm, lacks skeletal muscle. In this model, virus replication in the brain was not detected. However, radiological images of EV-D68-infected patients have identified lesions within the brain stem, specifically the cranial nerve motor nuclei (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In a second model, mice lacking the alpha/beta/gamma interferon (IFN-α/β/γ) response inoculated intraperitoneally or intranasally develop limb paralysis (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), yet evidence of viral replication is absent.
