<p>Other animal models of EV-D68 infection, including cotton rats and ferrets, have also been described. These models have been predominantly used to investigate the respiratory disease associated with virus infection. In the cotton rat model, replication in the respiratory tract and the induction of neutralizing antibodies were studied after intranasal inoculation with the virus (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In this model, no obvious pathology within the respiratory tract was observed in virus-infected animals, which is in contrast to the result observed in EV-D68-infected air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial epithelium, nor was virus replication observed (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). A transient viremia developed in ferrets after intranasal inoculation, and virus-specific RNA was detected in feces from infected animals, neither of which is observed during most human infections. No neurological disease developed, nor did virus replicate in this animal model of EV-D68 infection (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>).
