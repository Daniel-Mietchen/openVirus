<p>We find that all EV-D68 isolates replicate in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, except for isolate 952 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5</xref>), which replicates, together with all other isolates, in human iPSC-derived astrocytes. However, the 952 isolate was most efficient at inducing limb weakness in the 1-day-old murine model of EV-D68 pathogenesis and was recently found to infect human iPSC-derived motor neurons (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Differences in cells or virus stocks might explain why we did not observe replication of this isolate in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in contrast to the findings from others in mice. Only 3 of the 7 EV-D68 isolates productively infected primary murine astrocytes. The observed difference between human iPSC-derived astrocytes and primary murine astrocyte cultures may be explained by the methods for preparation of the cultures. Induced astrocytes are clonal, generated by reprogramming a population of cells, while primary murine astrocytes are composed of terminally differentiated positionally defined cells. The regional position of astrocytes influences induction of the interferon response; the cerebellar astrocytes possess a more efficient antiviral response than those found in the cerebral cortex (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The observation that only a subset of EV-D68 isolates replicated in primary astrocyte cultures may reflect differences in the sensitivity of isolates to the interferon response.
