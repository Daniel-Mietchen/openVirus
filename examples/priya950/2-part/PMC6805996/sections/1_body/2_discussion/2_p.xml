<p>The second mouse model of EV-D68-associated neurologic dysfunction examines the outcome of infection in adult mice either intracranially or intranasally inoculated with the virus. These animals are immunocompromised, lacking the IFN-α, -β, and -γ genes. Results from these mouse studies as well as our results reported here indicate that EV-D68 infection is sensitive to the type I and II interferon responses. These observations reinforce the role of the interferon response in limiting picornavirus infection (
