<p>The results of phylogenetic analysis of EV-D68 isolates suggest that infection with viruses from specific evolutionary lineages (subclades B1 and B3) is associated with the development of AFM (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This postulate has been furthered by work examining EV-D68 infection of both undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells. These cells were initially defined to be “neuronal like” by the presence of dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity and more recently by comparison of their transcriptome with that of HeLa cells, an ovarian cancer-derived cell line, not with that of neurons (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Despite being morphologically similar to neurons, these cells were initially isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with neuroblastoma and are known to lose their neuronal characteristics upon passage. Consequently, SH-SY5Y cells are less suitable for defining viral neurotropism than neurons induced from stem cells or organotypic brain slice cultures.
