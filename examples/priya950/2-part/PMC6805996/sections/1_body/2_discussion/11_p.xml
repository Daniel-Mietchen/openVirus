<p>Presumably, replication in neurons would lead to the symptoms of AFM, including muscle and cranial nerve dysfunction. Despite astrocytes being the major producer of IFN within the CNS, the mechanism by which virus replication in astrocytes would lead to neuronal dysfunction and paralysis is not known. Replication of EV 71 in astrocytes is thought to participate in development of paralysis observed in virus-infected humans, nonhuman primates, and mice (
