<p>Four mouse models of EV-D68 infection have been established (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). One model examined the immune response within the respiratory tract elicited after intranasal inoculation with EV-D68 using 8- to 10-week-old wild-type BALB/c mice; however, no virus replication was observed in these animals (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The other three models use either postnatal day 1 or immunocompromised mice to examine neuroinvasion and neurovirulence of EV-D68. Paralysis was observed after intracranial or intramuscular inoculation with multiple isolates of EV-D68 in 1-day-old mice (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In-depth characterization of virus replication and induction of paralysis, however, was determined for only one EV-D68 isolate, and approximately 50% of the animals were paralyzed after intracranial inoculation. However, development of paralysis following intracranial inoculation of suckling mice with the Rhyne isolate was first reported in 1967 when EV-D68 was initially described (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These data question the conclusion that neurotropism and neurovirulence are a recently acquired phenotypes of EV-D68 infection. Furthermore, little to no neuronal dysfunction was observed when 1-day-old mice were intranasally infected, which is the natural route of infection in humans. Moreover, in this same mouse model paralysis occurred most frequently when mice were intramuscularly injected (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Yet, virus replication within skeletal muscle was not assessed. It remains unknown if EV-D68 can infect and replicate within skeletal muscle and if the production of infectious progeny correlates with the onset of paralysis, as observed in the murine model of poliomyelitis (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Despite the absence of evidence that EV-D68 replicates in skeletal muscle, the authors suggest that EV-D68 may invade the CNS in a manner similar to poliovirus—via the neuromuscular junction—but this hypothesis was not addressed, e.g., by severing the nerve that innervates the limb prior to intramuscular inoculation to impair trafficking. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus not known to infect the musculoskeletal system in patients; rarely is a viremia established during human infection, and aside from the diaphragm, the respiratory system lacks skeletal muscle. The mechanism by which the virus traffics from the respiratory tract into the CNS is not known. Moreover, postnatal day 1 mice are known to develop paralysis when intracranially injected with a Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), questioning the utility of using 1-day-old mice as models for EV-D68 pathogenesis.
