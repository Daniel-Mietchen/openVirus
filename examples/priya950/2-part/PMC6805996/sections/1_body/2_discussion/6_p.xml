<p>To understand EV-D68 neurotropism, we examined isolates from multiple lineages, including subclade B1, initially associated with the outbreak of AFM in 2014, for the ability to infect the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A; organotypic brain slice cultures from day 1 to 10 postnatal mice, developmental stages that correlate with the years 1 to 6 in human brain development; primary murine astrocytes and human neurons and astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells; and mice lacking the IFN-α/β receptor. We find that the EV-D68 isolates examined can replicate in N2A cells, brain slice cultures, and 4-week-old mice lacking the IFN-α/β receptor. The exception is the Rhyne isolate, which did not replicate in murine N2A cells. Nevertheless, this isolate did replicate in organotypic brain slice cultures derived from wild-type mice. The Lansing isolate of poliovirus type 2 displays a similar phenotype, in that it replicates in and causes paralysis in wild-type mice but yet does not replicate in mouse cell cultures (
