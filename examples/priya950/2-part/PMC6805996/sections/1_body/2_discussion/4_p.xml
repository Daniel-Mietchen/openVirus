<p>Organotypic brain slice cultures are ideal for separating neurotropism from neuroinvasion and for an in-depth study of EV-D68 neurotropism. Neuroinvasion, the ability to enter the CNS from the periphery, may not only reflect how the subtleties of host genetics modulate the host-pathogen interaction but may also reflect differences between isolates dictated by the biochemical and biophysical properties of the virion. Moreover, sensitivity to the innate immune response may vary between isolates, influencing the neuroinvasive and neurovirulence properties of the virus. Although production of brain slices severs nerve connections, and the cultures lack immune cells from the periphery that infiltrate the CNS during virus infection, organotypic brain slice cultures nevertheless maintain many aspects of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> brain biology, including functional local synaptic circuitry with preserved brain architecture and vascularization and the presence of environmental cues required for neuronal function, and can remain viable for several days in culture. Their utility has been well established in hundreds of publications. They have been extensively used to understand neuronal connectivity and neurodegenerative disorders and are the experimental system for initial testing of viral vectors for gene therapy (

Findings from organotypic brain slice cultures complement those from established animal models and can be used to elucidate questions of mechanism and cell biology. Organotypic brain slice cultures allow for the direct assessment of neurotropism of a virus by placing the virus inoculum directly on target cells. Intracranial inoculation does not fully separate neuroinvasion from neurotropism, because virus is also delivered to the space surrounding the brain. Organoid cultures, while very popular, are unable to faithfully mimic the cellular and structural complexity of the postnatal brain, are heterogeneous with respect to cell type composition and structure, become hypoxic as they increase in size, and lack external cues which influence the reproducibility of any findings (
