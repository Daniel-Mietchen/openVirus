<p>In contrast to the infection of human neurons and astrocytes by other isolates, the virus titer at time zero was below detection for the 952 and 956 isolates. As the virus titer after the adsorption period is influenced by receptor-mediated uncoating of the particle, this observation suggests that there are relevant differences in capsid structure and acid sensitivity among these isolates. This hypothesis is consistent with reported differences in uncoating of EV-D68 isolates and rhinoviruses by low pH (
