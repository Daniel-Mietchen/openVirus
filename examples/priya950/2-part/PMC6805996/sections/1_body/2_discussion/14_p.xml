<p>The results presented here establish organotypic brain slice cultures as a pharmacologically and genetically amenable system to study EV-D68 neurotropism and elucidate the mechanism of virus-induced damage, with distinct advantages over live animals and organoid cultures. For example, when assessing the effects of experimental drugs on viral replication in brain slice cultures, the added compounds are confined to the culture medium, rather than potentially altering the physiology of the entire animal. Slice cultures can be produced from mice of any genetic background, and DNA for mutant alleles can be readily introduced by 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> electroporation prior to generating cultures to study the effects of host protein variants on viral replication. The alternative, to knock in alleles in mice, is far more time- and reagent-consuming. The use of brain slice cultures, induced motor neurons, and astrocytes will provide mechanistic insight into EV-D68 neurotropism.
