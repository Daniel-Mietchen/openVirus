<p>Zika virus infection presents with a symptom complex consisting of a diffuse maculo-papular rash, fever, asthenia, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and retroorbital pain. The frequency and degree of symptomatology has, however, varied between studies. A retrospective study immediately following the outbreak on Yap Island found that only 19% of survey participants reported symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection [
