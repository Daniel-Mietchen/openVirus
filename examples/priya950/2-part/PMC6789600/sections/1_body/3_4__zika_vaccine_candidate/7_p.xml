<p>Clinical trial data for the other vaccines has not yet been reported as of the date of this monograph, however, pre-clinical data has been reported for three candidate vaccines. An mRNA vaccine that incorporates the prM-E genes of a Micronesian strain of Zika virus was created incorporating with or without four-point mutations in the fusion-loop segment of the DII region of the envelope gene that abolished binding of antibodies directed against the fusion-loop region to reduce the potential risk for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [

Immunization of AG129 mice with un-modified lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated vaccines mRNA was immunogenic and protective against lethal infection; immunization of C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice followed by treatment with anti-ifnar1 blocking antibody showed protection against viremia in approximately 60% of animals [

 <xref rid="B49-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A measles-vectored vaccine encoding the Zika virus prME was shown to lessen viremia in pregnant IFNAR mice and prevented clinical disease in mouse pups [
