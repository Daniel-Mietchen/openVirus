<p>Two additional DNA vaccines, based on the French Polynesian H/PF/2013 strain were developed as chimeras that included the JEV prM signal sequence followed by the Zika envelope (E) gene (VRC5283) or a similar construct with the terminal 98 amino acids of E, representing the stem and transmembrane regions, exchanged for the analogous JEV sequence (VRC5288) [

Both vaccine candidates were advanced into clinical trials with 4 mg of administered intramuscularly at weeks 0, 4 and 8 with vaccine VRC5288 administered by needle and syringe while VRC5283 was administered either as a single dose or split dose by needle and syringe or as a split dose given by the Pharmajet needle-free device [

Seroconversion was 100% in the group administered vaccine with the needle-free device, less for vaccine administered as split-dose by needle and syringe, and lowest for vaccine given as a single injection with needle and syringe. The VRC5283 vaccine was advanced into Phase II studies in the Americas that utilized 140 clinical sites with clinical site selection guided by epidemiologic modeling [
