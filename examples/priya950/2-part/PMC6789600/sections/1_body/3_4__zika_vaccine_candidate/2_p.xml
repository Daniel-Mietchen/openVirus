<p>Poland et al. provide a comprehensive listing of almost 40 Zika virus vaccines in development as of 2017 [
 <xref rid="B37-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Diamond et al. discuss potential immunoreactive epitopes on the Zika envelope and provide further information on those vaccines that progressed into clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B38-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The large number of delivery platforms include live attenuated and inactivated whole-viruses; viral-vectored vaccines utilizing adeno-associated virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus, and dengue or Yellow Fever chimeric vaccines; DNA and mRNA vaccines; and peptide and protein subunit vaccines. Most have been assessed in animal models utilizing non-human primates and/or lethal challenge experiments involving immunosuppressed mice [
