<p>As reviewed above, published studies provide estimates that Zika virus infection is relatively asymptomatic and self-limited for the majority of individuals, however, methodology in these studies varies widely. In adults, two sets of complications warrant consideration for a proposed CHIM study. As reviewed above, a Guillain–Barre-like syndrome occurs in approximately 1 of 5000 Zika virus infections [

 <xref rid="B54-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [
 <xref rid="B54-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] are rare. Second, and perhaps more important, is the risk of transmission to a sexual partner and the potential for infection during pregnancy. Zika virus commonly persists in the male urogenital tract for 3 months, and may persist in some individuals for up to 8 months [

 <xref rid="B30-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], raises yet another as yet theoretical concern for humans. These questions as well as the theoretical potential for vector-borne transmission were debated in detail in late 2016 with the conclusion that the benefits of a human challenge infection did not outweigh the risks [
 <xref rid="B55-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], however, this analysis was performed just as the initial epidemic wave in the Americas was ending. The group published a follow-up in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B56-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Despite the recognition that conducting a placebo-controlled vaccine trial had become significantly more difficult due to declining case rates, the group’s conclusion was essentially unchanged.
