<p>In late 2015 and through mid-2016, global concern for this spreading epidemic was increasing, however, the experience in the two prior epidemics was predictive of the subsequent epidemiology in the Americas. The Zika virus outbreaks in Yap Island and French Polynesia were characterized by rapid onset and rapid resolution over a span of 3â€“4 months [
