<p id="Par30">Regarding the phylogenetic analysis of 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), all Spanish sequences formed a monophyletic cluster where a Hungarian sequence was also included. The average nucleotide identity among Spanish isolates was 90.0%. It is worth noting that the depth of the terminal branches in the phylogenetic tree was very high compared to the inner branches, indicating a low number of shared mutations.
