<p id="Par27">The NGS approach used allowed the comparison of the relative frequencies of each viral species in the examined samples. Thus, when the number of reads for a given virus was compared to the total number of reads attributable to a mammalian RNA virus in the sample, it was evident that Rotaviruses, particularly 
 <italic>RVA</italic> and 
 <italic>RVB</italic>, clearly outnumbered any other virus that could be present (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In only nine cases, 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> or 
 <italic>SAV</italic> reads were predominant among viral reads (8 and 1 cases, respectively). In all 47 cases, one virus represented at least 45% of the total viral reads. Interestingly, when mixed rotavirus infections were detected (
 <italic>RVA</italic>-
 <italic>RVC</italic> or 
 <italic>RVB-RVC</italic>), the proportion of one virus clearly predominated against the other. When coupled with the viral load, the relative frequencies per virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) showed that for a majority of cases (40/47, 85.1%), the predominant virus in the sample represented read proportions higher than 0.5 and viral reads figures larger than 10E3. Nearly all of them (36/40, 90.0%) corresponded to 
 <italic>Rotavirus</italic> – either 
 <italic>RVA</italic> (21), 
 <italic>RVB</italic> (6) or 
 <italic>RVC</italic> (9) –, with 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> and 
 <italic>SAV</italic> being much less frequent (3 and 1 cases, respectively). Besides, few cases (4 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> and 1 
 <italic>RVA</italic>) represented simultaneously high proportions with viral reads below 10E3.
