<p id="Par29">The filtering results included both whole genome (complete) and partial (less than 90% of the genome covered) sequences of the virus listed above (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Despite 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> was more commonly reported than 
 <italic>RVA</italic>, the number of full-length genome sequences obtained was higher in 
 <italic>RVA</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23) than in 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17). The full-length sequences obtained – 17 
 <italic>KobuV</italic>, 23 
 <italic>RVA</italic>, 11 
 <italic>RVC</italic>, 8 
 <italic>RVB</italic>, 4 
 <italic>SAV</italic> and 2 
 <italic>AstV</italic>3 – were deposited in GenBank with the Accession Numbers MH238075 to MH238338, MK936372 to MK936426, MK953017 to MK953236, and MK962320 to MK962342. Considering the segmented nature of the 
 <italic>Rotavirus</italic> genome, every segment for every genome was uploaded separately. For the remaining RNA viruses, every complete genome was uploaded in a single file.
