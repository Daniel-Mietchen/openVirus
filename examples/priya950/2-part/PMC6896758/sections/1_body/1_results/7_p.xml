<p id="Par32">For 
 <italic>RVC</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), the nucleotide identities with the sequences available in GenBank ranged between 83 and 91%. The most common genotype was G6P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (8 samples), while the remaining 3 genomes would present two new 
 <italic>RVC</italic> VP7 genotypes in combination with P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] – one with GX1P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and one with GX2P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] – and one GX2P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
