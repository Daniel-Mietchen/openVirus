<p id="Par31">The genotyping of the 23 
 <italic>RVA</italic> genomes obtained indicated that the most common combination was G9P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (12 cases; 52%), with G4P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (3 cases; 13%) and G3P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (2 cases; 9%) being much less frequent. The genotypes G3P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], G3P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], G4P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], G5P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], G5P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and G4P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] were reported only once (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The nucleotide identities reported for the 
 <italic>RVA</italic> segments compared to the existing GenBank sequences ranged between 89 and 98%. In contrast, for the 8 
 <italic>RVB</italic> complete genomes characterized in this work (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), the overall nucleotide identities (among the 11 segments of the 
 <italic>RVB</italic> genome) with the closest GenBank sequences ranged from between 74 and 90%. In fact, according to the proposed nucleotide cut-off values for VP7 (80%), two undescribed VP7 genotypes were reported in nearly all (7 out of 8) the 
 <italic>RVB</italic> positive samples. Similarly, for VP4, 3 samples could harbour a new 
 <italic>RVB</italic> genotype (tree not shown). The 
 <italic>RVB</italic> genotypes reported and its frequency would be: GX2P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (3, 37.5%), GX1P[X] (2, 25%), GX1P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (2, 25%), and G12P[X] (1, 12.5%).
