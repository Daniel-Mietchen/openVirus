<p id="Par47">The assessment of the diversity of viral RNA within each sample was directly characterised from the total RNA extracted, without any previous amplification step (no primers were required), applying a NGS approach previously applied to faeces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Briefly, the procedures included: (i) the construction of a genomic library for Illumina NGS sequencing from the total RNA extracted, using a commercial protocol and reagents (Protocol for use with Purified mRNA or rRNA Depleted RNA and NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®, New England Biolabs); ii) the NGS runs using an Illumina MiSeq platform available at the Genomics and Bioinformatics Service of the UAB and a read length of 250 bp; iii) the trimming of low quality reads (those showing a QC score &lt; 20 as determined by FastQC©software, Babraham informatics), using Trimmomatic© [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; iv) the taxonomic classification of the quality reads against a pre-built database containing the viral genomes available at GenBank with Kraken [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; v) the initial filtering of quality reads against a reference file containing the concatenated sequences of a panel of RNA viruses described in faeces (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>); vi) the mapping of quality reads against the complete genomes of the RNA virus identified in the steps iv) and v), with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], applying the BWA-MEM algorithm for long reads [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; and vii) the assembly of a consensus sequence in fasta format for every sample and RNA species identified, using the program QUASR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For the software programs used in steps iii), iv), vi) and vii) - FastQC©software, Kraken, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and QUASR, respectively -, the default parameters of every program were applied. Next, a database for every RNA species identified was constructed by downloading the available complete genome sequences from GenBank. Finally, the sequences obtained were aligned and phylogenetically compared with the datasets constructed for every complete genome, or segment in the segmented genomes identified. The phylogenetic relationships among sequences were analysed using the software MEGA7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], by means of a Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm, using the matrix of pairwise p-distances and 10,000 bootstrap replicates to estimate the confidence of the internal branches of the trees.
