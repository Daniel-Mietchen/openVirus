<p id="Par45">The study was conducted with samples selected from cases of neonatal diarrhoea (less than 7 days old) routinely submitted for diagnosis during 2017 to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the 
 <italic>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</italic> (UAB, Barcelona, Spain) and 
 <italic>Universidad de León</italic> (UL, León, Spain). Four samples from healthy non-diarrhoeic piglets were also included to be used as negative controls. In the cases studied, a bacteriological cause for the diarrhoea had been excluded after a microbiological culture for aerobes and anaerobes and molecular analyses (PCR for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> virulence factors and 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxins). Only cases apparently unrelated (different farms with no evident connection) were included. Finally, 47 faecal samples, each one representing an outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in 47 farms from 
 <italic>Catalonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Castile and Leon</italic>, 
 <italic>Aragon</italic>, 
 <italic>Galicia</italic> and 
 <italic>Valencia</italic> were analysed (Additional file
