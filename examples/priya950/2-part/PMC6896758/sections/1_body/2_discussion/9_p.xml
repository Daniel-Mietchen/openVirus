<p id="Par43">It is worth noting that the phylogenetic analyses for all the examined viruses indicated the existence of local clusters except for 
 <italic>RVA</italic> (discussed above). This, together with the depth of the corresponding branches in the trees, suggested a long evolutionary history on a local basis. Certainly, we cannot discard the existence of other clusters for any of the reported viruses. However, the detection of several new genotypes for 
 <italic>RVB</italic> and 
 <italic>RVC</italic> plus the relative low nucleotide identity with other available sequences in GenBank reinforces the idea of local evolution at least for these two viruses. Moreover, with the results obtained we propose to define for 
 <italic>RVB</italic> one new VP4 (P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) and two new VP7 (G27 and G28) genotypes; as well as genotypes G14 and G15 for 
 <italic>RVC</italic>. The geographical pattern observed in the 
 <italic>RVB</italic> phylogenetic trees agrees with the notion that 
 <italic>RVB</italic> genotypes may be specific for host species and region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Regarding 
 <italic>KobuV</italic>, no differences in the clustering pattern were observed between those strains coming from cases in which 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> was predominant or not. This suggests that phylogenetic clustering probably is not predictive of virulence for this virus and most probably, other causes (i.e. immunity) are more relevant with regards to the clinical expression of the disease. Similarly, for 
 <italic>SAV</italic> no differences were seen, and all isolates clustered together within genogroup III, the most commonly reported porcine 
 <italic>SAV</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].
