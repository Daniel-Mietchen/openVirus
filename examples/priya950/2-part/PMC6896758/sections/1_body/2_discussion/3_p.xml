<p id="Par37">In this work, we examined the RNA virome present in faecal samples from 47 cases of diarrhoea plus four non-diarrhoeic negative controls in which specific bacteriological agents were excluded. The approach taken using NGS did not include any previous enrichment or PCR step; hence, the results obtained represented not only the RNA viruses present in a sample analysed but also their relative abundances. This may contribute to our understanding of the role of each virus in a given case.</p>
