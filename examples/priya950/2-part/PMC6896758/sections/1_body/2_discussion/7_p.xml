<p id="Par41">Our results agree with a number of studies that reported different Rotavirus species as agents of neonatal diarrhoea (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). One interesting observation from the present study is that coinfections or 
 <italic>RVA-RVC</italic> and 
 <italic>RVB-RVC</italic> was very common, suggesting the need for simultaneous testing all three agents in cases of neonatal diarrhoea. Regarding 
 <italic>KobuV</italic>, our results also agree with an increased prevalence of this agent observed in cases of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide: Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Korea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; despite several studies have observed non-significant differences in 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> infection between diarrheic and healthy piglets in several European countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As mentioned above, two different patterns were observed in cases where 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> was present: one with high proportion of 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> reads and high number of viral reads, and others where these two circumstances were not fulfilled. The first pattern could correspond to clinical cases caused by 
 <italic>KobuV</italic>, while the second could correspond to secondary or concomitant infections by this agent. A similar pattern would apply to 
 <italic>SAV</italic>. Regarding the other agents, since they were always in combination and their reads were not preeminent, its role must be seen as secondary at best. For instance, no differences in 
 <italic>Astrovirus</italic> prevalence between diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets were reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], nor for 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> prevalence between healthy and diarrheic pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>PEDV</italic> was seldom found in our samples and when found only traces could be detected. Prior to this, a higher frequency for this pathogen could be expected. However, while PEDV has caused recently severe epidemics in America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], in Europe the incidence seems to be much lower [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Of note is the total absence of TGEV, a virus which was widespread in Europe, but has consistently declined, or even disappeared, after the apparition and fast spread worldwide in the nineties of 
 <italic>Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].
