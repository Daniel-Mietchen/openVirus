<p id="Par40">Interestingly, in the non-diarrhoeic samples analysed the number of mammalian reads was very scarce, but a higher number of plant and fungi viruses was reported. This is somewhat surprising, since the examined animal were suckling piglets (less than 1Â week of age) that do not eat feedstuff. It is difficult to explain the origin of those viruses, since samples were taken from the rectum and thus, environmental contamination is little likely.</p>
