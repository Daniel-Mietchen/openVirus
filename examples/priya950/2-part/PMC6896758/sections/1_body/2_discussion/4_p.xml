<p id="Par38">In the samples examined, the predominance of Rotaviruses reads reinforce the notion of these viruses as primary agents of neonatal diarrhoea; although, occasionally, 
 <italic>KobuV</italic> and 
 <italic>SAV</italic> may have a role in this process. The examination of the relative proportions of viral reads versus the number of reads showed that for any given case always one virus predominated, representing more than 45% of the mammalian viral reads obtained. This value can be tentatively proposed as a cut-off for the assignment of an etiological agent. In contrast, for all the other viruses examined, the relative abundance of their genomes would be more consistent with a subclinical infection. Whether this could be the consequence of a limited virulence, because of some level of passive immunity, or other causes, cannot be addressed in the present study.
