<p id="Par42">In any case, it is somewhat surprising to detect that many different viruses (up to seven in a single sample) in so young animals, even though the pattern was already observed in diarrhoeic piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While it is easy to understand that the introduction of a new enteric virus in the farm will result in its rapid spread and the eventual development of an epidemic, it is more difficult to understand how so many viruses can be present in the maternities without generating a herd immunity resulting in colostral and lactogenic protection of suckling piglets. One possibility is that, most often, maternal immunity could be enough to limit the replication of those agents but not to completely prevent the infection; namely only provided partial immunity. In other cases, on farms reporting disease even in sows, 
 <italic>RVA</italic> was present. This is compatible with its assumed role as primary agent. We have recently described the introduction of a new 
 <italic>RVA</italic> strain that rapidly spread across pig farms in Spain and that was also present in the samples of this study as well [
