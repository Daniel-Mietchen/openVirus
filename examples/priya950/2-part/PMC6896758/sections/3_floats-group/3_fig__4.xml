 <caption>
  <p>Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the VP7 segment for 
   <italic>Rotavirus A</italic>. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 41 reference sequences representing RVA strains isolated in different species, included for comparison purposes, plus the 23 sequences – marked in green and with a circle – reported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the 80% nucleotide cut-off values proposed by the RotaC 2.0 genotyping tool [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the RVA genotype determination tool of Virus Pathogen Resource [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]
