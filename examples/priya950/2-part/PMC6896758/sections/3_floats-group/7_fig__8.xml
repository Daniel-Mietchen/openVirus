  <p>Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of 
   <italic>Porcine Astrovirus 3</italic>. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains the 11 complete genomes available so far in swine plus the 2 complete sequences – marked with a circle – reported in this work
