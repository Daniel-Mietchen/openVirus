 <caption>
  <p>Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of 
   <italic>Porcine Sapovirus</italic>. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 37 reference genomes representing the 8 
   <italic>Sapovirus</italic> genogroups described so far in swine plus the 4 complete sequences – marked with a circle – reported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the classification proposed by [
