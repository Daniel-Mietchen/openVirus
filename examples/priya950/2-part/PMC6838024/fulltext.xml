Knowledge of interactions between host proteins and viral proteins or viral RNA may provide clues for developing novel antiviral strategies. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a water-borne pathogen that causes acute hepatitis in humans, is responsible for epidemics in developing countries. HEV pathology and molecular biology have been poorly explored due to the lack of efficient culture systems. A contemporary approach, to better understand the viral infection cycle at the molecular level, is the use of system biology tools depicting virus-host interactions. To determine the host proteins which participate in the regulation of HEV replication, we indentified liver cell proteins interacting with HEV RNA at its putative promoter region and those interacting with HEV polymerase (RdRp) protein. We employed affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) to identify the interacting host proteins. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were plotted and analyzed using web-based tools. Topological analysis of the network revealed that the constructed network is potentially significant and relevant for viral replication. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that HEV RNA promoter- and polymerase-interacting host proteins belong to different cellular pathways such as RNA splicing, RNA metabolism, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, unfolded protein response, innate immune pathways, secretory vesicle pathway, and glucose metabolism. We showed that hnRNPK and hnRNPA2B1 interact with both HEV putative promoters and HEV RdRp, which suggest that they may have crucial roles in HEV replication. We demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of hnRNPK and hnRNPA2B1 proteins with the HEV targets in the study, assuring the authenticity of the interactions obtained through mass spectrometry. Thus, our study highlights the ability of viruses, such as HEV, to maneuver host systems to create favorable cellular environments for virus propagation. Studying the host-virus interactions can facilitate the identification of antiviral therapeutic strategies and novel targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>host-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>protein interactions network</kwd><kwd>system biology</kwd><kwd>gene ontology analysis</kwd><kwd>hepatitis E virus</kwd><kwd>viral RNA</kwd><kwd>viral polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a hepevirus that is transmitted via contaminated drinking water to cause acute hepatitis in humans. Although prevalence of HEV has been mainly observed in developing countries, its spread has been reported in many industrialized countries across the globe in recent years. In infected adults, mortality rate due to HEV is up to &#x0223c;2% while in infected pregnant women, it increases up to 30% (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Meng, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Nan and Zhang, 2016</xref>). Due to the lack of efficient culture systems and robust animal models for HEV propagation, molecular mechanisms underlying the HEV lifecycle are not known (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Himmelsbach et al., 2018</xref>). Non-specific treatment with pegylated interferons along with ribavirin is recommended in rare instances for severe cases because specific antiviral drugs or vaccines against HEV are still not available worldwide (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">van de Garde et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Hepatitis E virus belongs to the Orthohepevirus genus, and its genome consists of positive sense, single-stranded RNA comprised of three open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kenney and Meng, 2018</xref>). First step of HEV replication cycle is the translation of ORF1 present on the positive sense genomic RNA to form non-structural polyprotein, which consists of functional domains of methyltransferase, protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Two additional ORFs present in the sub-genomic intermediate RNA, ORF2 and ORF3, encode capsid protein and a small multifunctional phosphoprotein, respectively (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kenney and Meng, 2018</xref>). HEV replication cycle involves the formation of a negative sense RNA complementary to the positive sense genomic RNA. HEV RdRp recognizes and starts the transcription at the promoter present at the 3&#x02032; end of the positive sense strand to form a complementary negative strand RNA. Negative strand RNA bears two putative promoters: one is the genomic promoter (3&#x02032; end of negative sense RNA) for the synthesis of positive sense RNA and the other is the sub-genomic promoter for the synthesis of sub-genomic RNA. Transcription at different viral promoters has to be regulated to maintain the correct stoichiometry of positive sense, negative sense and sub-genomic intermediate RNA. Host proteins, binding at viral promoters as components of the viral replicase complex, help in the regulation of molecular switches responsible for maintaining viral RNA stoichiometry, and their temporal synthesis.</p><p>Viruses bear relatively compact genomes, encoding a limited number of proteins and, therefore, rely on host factors to establish replication in the infected cell. Being obligatory intracellular parasites, viruses have to subvert the biosynthetic pathways of the host cell. Constant interactions between the virus and its host during the process of co-evolution have shaped the anti-viral immune system of the host and, in turn, the capability of viruses to manipulate host control mechanisms to facilitate their propagation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Stebbing and Gazzard, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fermin and Tennant, 2018</xref>). Classical scientific approaches to understanding the molecular basis of such virus-host interactions involve analysis of individual gene or protein targets and study of their functional significance. However, these approaches have not been sufficient to address the challenges of the host-pathogen interface. System biology tools provide a multidimensional approach for a comprehensive view of the biological system at molecular network levels. High throughput genomic and proteomic studies, such as siRNA and microRNA screens, and microarrays have greatly expanded our understanding of virus-host networks. Advances in several tools for data acquisition, processing, integration and computation provide rapid, and promising strategies for the development of new therapies for infectious diseases (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aderem et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xue and Miller-Jensen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studies on several viruses reveal that viral proteins or viral RNA interact with host proteins to regulate viral replication. Previous studies on the HEV ORF1 and ORF2 interactome showed the involvement of factors associated with different biological processes, such as ubiquitin proteasome system, innate immunity and RNA metabolism (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ojha and Lole, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Subramani et al., 2018</xref>). In another study by Paingankar et al. host factors have been found to interact with the untranslated region on HEV genomic RNA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Paingankar and Arankalle, 2015</xref>). However, no conclusive studies have been carried out to analyze host factors present in HEV replicase complex. Also, host factors interacting with promoter sequences on HEV negative sense RNA have not been explored so far. We hypothesized that the set of host proteins interacting with HEV polymerase protein and HEV RNA at its promoter region must play crucial roles in tightly regulating the synthesis of viral RNAs. The host factors may form differential replicase complexes along with HEV RNA and polymerase protein at the promoter region. Therefore it was interesting to find out the proteins which bind at both the genomic and sub-genomic promoters on negative sense RNA of HEV and those which bind to only one specific promoter along with the RdRp. Proteins binding at both the promoters may act as primary transcription factors while, the differential proteins may guide RdRp for where to bind and which strand to synthesize at a given time. We thus believe that host factors interacting with HEV polymerase and promoters play crucial roles in regulating the molecular switches in HEV replication.</p><p>In order to better understand the HEV-host interface, we identified liver cell proteins interacting with the HEV polymerase and HEV putative promoters and generated a protein-protein interaction network. We further utilized a bioinformatics approach to analyze these interaction networks and assess their significance. Our study identified host proteins related to cellular processes like RNA metabolism, unfolded protein response, stress granules, secretory vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and innate immune pathways. HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 proteins were found to be interacting with both HEV promoters and HEV RdRp. We demonstrated the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of HEV promoters and HEV RdRp with HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1, confirming the validity of interactions obtained by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Virus Replicon and Cells</title><p>Infectious replicon of Sar55 strain of genotype 1 of HEV (pSK-HEV2) and a subclone of a human hepatoma cell line Huh7 S10-3 which is permissive for the replication of HEV infectious clone was obtained from Dr. Suzanne U.

Primary interactions revealed through mass spectrometry in this study have been shown with black edges, while the secondary protein-protein interactions revealed through IntAct have been shown in red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We then calculated the topological parameters of the generated PPI network to access its modularity using the network analyzer tool of Cytoscape. It is revealed that 70 nodes representing HEV-host interactions were connected via a total of 141 edges. The average degree centrality, average path length distribution, and the clustering coefficient of the network were observed to be 0.748, 2.365, and 0.348, respectively.

The GO annotation resulted in classification of the proteins based on their functional clusters or GO categories. The enrichment analysis performed using Panther (Gene Ontology Consortium&#x02019;s web tool) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figures 1A&#x02013;C, 2</xref>), Gprofiler (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), STRING (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), and Enricher was in agreement and showed a significant enrichment of similar GO terms. FDR &#x0003c;0.05 was set as a statistical threshold for GO analysis. Enrichment of proteins in three different categories, namely biological processes, molecular function, and cellular component, was performed using Enricher (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>). Proteins were arranged according to the combined enrichment score, which is a combination of the <italic>p</italic>-value and z-score calculated by multiplying the two scores. The <italic>p</italic>-value is the probability of any gene belonging to any set and is calculated by using exact Fisher&#x02019;s test. The Z-score is calculated by using a modified Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and assesses the deviation from the expected rank. The combined score provides a compromise between the available methods for multiple test corrections to control the FDRs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Enrichment of GO terms in biological process category revealed the enrichment of proteins related to mRNA splicing (GO: 0000380; <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), response to unfolded proteins (GO: 0006986; <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup>), nucleic acid metabolic process (GO: 0090304, <italic>p</italic>-value: 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup>), and regulation of protein processing (GO: 0010954, <italic>p</italic>-value: 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 4A</xref>). A vital characteristic of any virus-host interaction is the manipulation of cellular gene expression in order to establish favorable cellular conditions for efficient viral replication. Eukaryotic genes are highly regulated at post-transcriptional stages, such as splicing, export, regulation of translation, subcellular localization and mRNA turnover. Viruses have often been observed to target these RNA processing stages to hijack the host RNA metabolism which is evident from the enrichment of host RNA splicing and nucleic acid metabolism related protein in our data. Such enhancement could also hint at the reliance of HEV on host systems for the regulation of viral RNA translation, transcription, and stability within the host cell (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahlquist et al., 2003</xref>). We observed the highest number of proteins having nucleic acid-binding activity in our data, which further confirms the dependence of HEV on the host for viral RNA metabolism. We have incorporated the data of classification of proteins on the basis of protein class in the HEV-host interaction network using different color codes as indicated on the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Gene ontology analysis of HEV- host interactions based on <bold>(A)</bold> biological process, <bold>(B)</bold> molecular function, and <bold>(C)</bold> cellular component category. <italic>Y</italic>-axis represents the combined enrichment score computed using Enricher.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-10-02501-g005"/></fig><p>We also observed enrichment of stress granule proteins (GO:1903608; <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>) in our data. Stress granules are dynamic structures that are formed when cellular translational rates decline after external stresses are applied to cells. Viral infection into the host cell has been shown to induce cytoplasmic stress granule formation in the host cells due to the upregulation of stress granule proteins, such as helicase DDX3X and DHX9 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ariumi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e8;ne et al., 2015</xref>). As stress granules regulate the cycle of mRNA turnover and gene expression, they happen to be another vital point for viruses to manipulate cellular systems. Stress granules have also been reported to play a role in promoting innate immune responses (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Reineke and Lloyd, 2013</xref>). This is an additional reason why viruses must counteract the effects of such granules for efficient replication by interacting with proteins of stress granules.</p><p>Virus replication alters the normal metabolic processes of the host by interacting with components of different molecular pathways. Enrichment of GO terms in molecular function category also resulted in enrichment of proteins involved in RNA metabolism processes, which again highlights the need of the virus to interact with proteins of host RNA turnover. The enriched proteins in molecular function category belong to Translation elongation factor activity (GO: 0003746, <italic>p</italic>-value: 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), RNA binding (GO: 0003723, <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;25</sup>) and RNA stem loop binding (GO: 0035613, <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>).</p><p>MHC protein complex-binding proteins (GO: 0023023, <italic>p</italic>-value: 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>) have also been observed to be enriched in the molecular function category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 4B</xref>). The anti-viral responses of the host and the invading strategies of the pathogens have evolved concurrently for millions of years. Infecting pathogens have developed several escape strategies to cripple the immune system. Several viruses have evolved with proteins that interfere with antigen presentation and which target both MHC-I and MHC-II antigen processing pathways in order to distort the anti-viral immune response of the host. Several viruses such as HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, Bovine herpes virus and cytomegalovirus have been shown to have evolved strategies to combat MHC-mediated host immunity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yewdell and Bennink, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f8;der et al., 2008</xref>). However, there are no literature reports of HEV interactions with MHC molecules. In the HEV interactome reported in this study, we observed the presence of MHC-interacting proteins, such as HSP90AA1 and PKM, which could be explored further for their ability to alter host immune response in the context of HEV infection.</p><p>Enrichment analysis of GO terms according to cellular component enhanced the representation of GO terms, such as ribonucleoprotein granules (GO: 0035770, <italic>p</italic>-value: 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup>), secretory granule lumen (GO: 0034774, <italic>p</italic>-value: 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;9</sup>) and endocytic vesicle lumen (GO: 0071682, <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 4C</xref>). HEV has been reported to enter liver cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kapur et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with this, our data also suggest enrichment of proteins belonging to endocytic vesicle lumen. HEV replication takes place in the cytoplasm. Along with the replicase complex, HEV RdRp has been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Rehman et al., 2008</xref>). A recent report also concluded that ORF1 polyprotein co-localizes with the markers of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, suggesting the involvement of secretory pathway during replication (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Szkolnicka et al., 2019</xref>).

HNRNPK binds to the core protein of Dengue virus, whereas in Sindbis virus infection, it binds to its non-structural protein and sub-genomic RNA to regulate viral replication (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Burnham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">LaPointe et al., 2018</xref>). HNRNPK binds to hepatitis C virus RNA near the miR-122 binding site to facilitate its replication (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). In another study, the role played by HNRNPK in HCV virion production is reported to be mediated by viral RNA binding (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Poenisch et al., 2015</xref>). HNRNPK binds to Influenza M1 RNA and regulates its splicing while maintaining appropriate ratio of M2/M1 protein (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). HNRNPH binds to the negative regulator of splicing elements in Rous sarcoma virus to regulate the splicing and polyadenylation machinery (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fogel and McNally, 2000</xref>). A quantitative proteomics study by <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rog&#x000e9;e et al. (2015)</xref> evaluating the alteration of host factors during HEV infection in swine revealed an upregulation of HNRNPK in infected livers (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rog&#x000e9;e et al., 2015</xref>). In another study of modulation of host factors during HEV infection in A549 cells, a significant increase in the expression of HNRNPH was observed in response to virus infection (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Our study is consistent with these findings as it underlines a putative role of hnRNP proteins in modulating HEV RNA transcription by binding at the promoter site and HEV polymerase.</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS5"><title>Validation of Interactions Between HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 With HEV Promoters and RdRp</title><p>Analysis of HEV-host protein interactions suggested that HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 are common factors associating with HEV RNA promoters and polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>). To demonstrate the validity of the interactions obtained through mass spectrometry, we further <italic>in vitro</italic> validated the interactions between HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with that of HEV promoters and RdRp. In order to confirm the interaction of RdRp with host proteins, coimmunoprecipitation technique was employed. HEV RdRp encoding sequence and the coding sequence of selected host protein were cloned in pTandem vector. pTandem vector was chosen for its additional feature which enables cloning of two different genes in the same construct to increase the co-transfection efficiency. Huh7 S10-3 cells transfected with pTandem_Flag-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPK or pTandem_Flag-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPA2B1 plasmids. Post 48 h of transfection co-immunoprecipitation was performed by using anti myc antibody or isotype IgG antibody. After co-immunoprecipitation, interaction of host factors with RdRp was confirmed by western blot using anti FLAG antibody. We observed that both HNRNPK and HNRPA2B1 specific immunoprecipitation could pull down HEV RdRp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A,B</xref>). Our results confirmed the binding of both of these proteins with HEV RdRp as obtained in the mass spectrometry data.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Validation of interactions between HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with HEV promoters and RdRp. <bold>(A)</bold> pTandem_FLAG-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPK plasmid was transfected in Huh 7 S10-3 cells. 48 h post transfection co-IP was performed with anti c-Myc antibody.

Huh7 S10-3 cell lysate was incubated with G or Sg promoter RNA followed by pull down by anti-HNRNPK or anti-HNRNPA2B1 or isotype IgG antibody. From the eluted complexes, total RNA was isolated and presence of promoter region RNA sequence was checked by RT PCR. We observed that both HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 could successfully pull down HEV genomic and sub-genomic promoter RNA as evident by the specific band on agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore we could successfully demonstrate the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with HEV RdRp and HEV promoters as obtained from the mass spectrometry data, further increasing the confidence level of the obtained interactions. Thus, we believe that HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 play crucial roles in HEV replication and their functional significance in the context of HEV replication can be further assessed. Taken as a whole, our study reveals the importance of host cellular machinery in HEV lifecycle regulation. Studying host pathways targeted by HEV can facilitate the hunt for putative anti-viral candidates for therapeutic purposes. In conclusion, our study shows that analyzing host-virus interactions through system biology approach can be beneficial in understanding the molecular regulation of viral lifecycle and can put forth set testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S4"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated/analyzed for this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary&#x02009; Material</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>GK, KP, and YK conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
