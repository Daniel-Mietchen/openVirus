<p>Studies on several viruses reveal that viral proteins or viral RNA interact with host proteins to regulate viral replication. Previous studies on the HEV ORF1 and ORF2 interactome showed the involvement of factors associated with different biological processes, such as ubiquitin proteasome system, innate immunity and RNA metabolism (

Also, host factors interacting with promoter sequences on HEV negative sense RNA have not been explored so far. We hypothesized that the set of host proteins interacting with HEV polymerase protein and HEV RNA at its promoter region must play crucial roles in tightly regulating the synthesis of viral RNAs. The host factors may form differential replicase complexes along with HEV RNA and polymerase protein at the promoter region. Therefore it was interesting to find out the proteins which bind at both the genomic and sub-genomic promoters on negative sense RNA of HEV and those which bind to only one specific promoter along with the RdRp. Proteins binding at both the promoters may act as primary transcription factors while, the differential proteins may guide RdRp for where to bind and which strand to synthesize at a given time. We thus believe that host factors interacting with HEV polymerase and promoters play crucial roles in regulating the molecular switches in HEV replication.
