<p>Hepatitis E virus belongs to the Orthohepevirus genus, and its genome consists of positive sense, single-stranded RNA comprised of three open reading frames (ORFs) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kenney and Meng, 2018</xref>). First step of HEV replication cycle is the translation of ORF1 present on the positive sense genomic RNA to form non-structural polyprotein, which consists of functional domains of methyltransferase, protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Two additional ORFs present in the sub-genomic intermediate RNA, ORF2 and ORF3, encode capsid protein and a small multifunctional phosphoprotein, respectively (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kenney and Meng, 2018</xref>). HEV replication cycle involves the formation of a negative sense RNA complementary to the positive sense genomic RNA. HEV RdRp recognizes and starts the transcription at the promoter present at the 3′ end of the positive sense strand to form a complementary negative strand RNA. Negative strand RNA bears two putative promoters: one is the genomic promoter (3′ end of negative sense RNA) for the synthesis of positive sense RNA and the other is the sub-genomic promoter for the synthesis of sub-genomic RNA. Transcription at different viral promoters has to be regulated to maintain the correct stoichiometry of positive sense, negative sense and sub-genomic intermediate RNA. Host proteins, binding at viral promoters as components of the viral replicase complex, help in the regulation of molecular switches responsible for maintaining viral RNA stoichiometry, and their temporal synthesis.
