<p>A combined list of proteins interacting with HEV promoters and RdRp was generated, and a protein network named the HEV-host interaction network was constructed using “Cytoscape version 3.6.1” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). A list of total 70 HEV-interacting proteins was generated, amongst which two proteins, HNRNPA2B1 and HNRNPK, were found to be present in all the three data sets. One more protein (HNRNPH) was found to be shared between RdRp and G promoter data, while another protein (HNRNPU) was common between the Sg promoter and G promoter besides HNRNPA2B1 and HNRNPK. However, about 94% of the proteins were found to be specifically interacting with only one of the HEV partners in the study (
