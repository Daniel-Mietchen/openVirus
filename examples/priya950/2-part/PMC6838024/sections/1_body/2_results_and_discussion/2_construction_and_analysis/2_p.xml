<p>We then searched for the proteins interacting with other host proteins within our data to plot the protein-protein interaction network. We used advanced search options of IntAct database by providing “direct interactions” filter to find experimentally proven protein-protein interactions within our data and plotted a second network named HEV-host PPI network using Cytoscape 3.6.1 (

IntAct database reports evidences like pull down, X-ray crystallography, functional assays, etc under experimentally proven criteria of interaction prediction. IntAct tool sources the molecular interaction data from several curated databases like MINT, Uniprot, molecular connections, EMBL-EBI, and DIP. Primary interactions revealed through mass spectrometry in this study have been shown with black edges, while the secondary protein-protein interactions revealed through IntAct have been shown in red (

It is revealed that 70 nodes representing HEV-host interactions were connected via a total of 141 edges. The average degree centrality, average path length distribution, and the clustering coefficient of the network were observed to be 0.748, 2.365, and 0.348, respectively. The topological parameters were compared with HEV-human protein interaction networks previously reported in literature which validated the significance of HEV-host protein interaction network constructed in our study (
