<p>To pull down HEV RdRp-binding proteins, the HEV RdRp protein was expressed as a FLAG-tagged recombinant protein in Huh7 S10-3 cells. pcDNA_FLAG-RdRp construct was transfected in the cells, and the expression of RdRp was confirmed at 48 h post-transfection by western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Protein G magnetic beads were used to pull down specific interactions using the anti-FLAG antibody in a classical immunoprecipitation experiment from the RdRp-expressing cell lysate. The eluted complexes were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining with the ProteoSilver kit (Sigma) for visualizing protein bands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mock-transfected Huh7 S10-3 cell lysate was taken as control to detect the non-specific interactions. For the pull down of specific HEV RNA-interacting proteins, biotinylated HEV putative sub-genomic (Sg), or putative genomic promoter (G) RNA was synthesized

 <italic>In vitro</italic> synthesized Sg RNA includes the recently mapped intragenomic promoter region regulating the Sg RNA transcription which is conserved across all HEV genotypes (

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the elutes were subjected to protein identification. Non-biotin RNAs of sub-genomic and genomic promoters were taken as control. The eluted complexes were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,D</xref>). A distinct banding pattern could be observed in specific pull-down experiments as compared to the negative control. We further employed liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) to identify the interacting proteins. Proteins represented by at least two unique peptides and having less than 1% FDR were considered for analysis Proteins represented in respective negative control data were eliminated. The list of proteins identified to be interacting with HEV is shown in
