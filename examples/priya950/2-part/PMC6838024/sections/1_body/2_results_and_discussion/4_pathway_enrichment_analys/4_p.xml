<p>In our analyses, the spliceosome pathway was found to be enriched by 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of 5.9 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>). Different heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, such as HNRNPK, HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPH, HNRNPE1, HNRNPE2, HNRNPC and HNRNPU, and other spliceosomal accessory complex proteins, such as HSP73 and SR, interact with HEV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Spliceosomal complex proteins help in the generation of stable RNA structures, while ribonucleoproteins play roles in RNA stability and transport (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have reported the binding of HNRNPA2B1 to Influenza virus and Dengue virus RNA and explained its role in regulation of viral transcription (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Paranjape and Harris, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). HNRNPK binds to the core protein of Dengue virus, whereas in Sindbis virus infection, it binds to its non-structural protein and sub-genomic RNA to regulate viral replication (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Burnham et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">LaPointe et al., 2018</xref>). HNRNPK binds to hepatitis C virus RNA near the miR-122 binding site to facilitate its replication (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). In another study, the role played by HNRNPK in HCV virion production is reported to be mediated by viral RNA binding (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Poenisch et al., 2015</xref>). HNRNPK binds to Influenza M1 RNA and regulates its splicing while maintaining appropriate ratio of M2/M1 protein (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). HNRNPH binds to the negative regulator of splicing elements in Rous sarcoma virus to regulate the splicing and polyadenylation machinery (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rogée et al. (2015)</xref> evaluating the alteration of host factors during HEV infection in swine revealed an upregulation of HNRNPK in infected livers (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rogée et al., 2015</xref>). In another study of modulation of host factors during HEV infection in A549 cells, a significant increase in the expression of HNRNPH was observed in response to virus infection (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Our study is consistent with these findings as it underlines a putative role of hnRNP proteins in modulating HEV RNA transcription by binding at the promoter site and HEV polymerase.
