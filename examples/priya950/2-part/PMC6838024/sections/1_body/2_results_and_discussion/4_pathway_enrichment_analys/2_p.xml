<p>Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway was enriched (
 <italic>p</italic>-value 1.2 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>). Seven proteins of this pathway, namely, CKAP4, HSPA5, HSP90B1, PDIs, HSP70, HSP90, and VCP were found to interact with HEV RNA and polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These factors are involved in proper folding and processing of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. As HEV virus replicates on the ER membrane and its polymerase localizes onto the ER, its interaction with proteins residing at the endoplasmic reticulum is apparent during its replication.
