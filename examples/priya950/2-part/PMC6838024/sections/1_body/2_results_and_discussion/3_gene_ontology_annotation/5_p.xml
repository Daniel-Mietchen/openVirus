The anti-viral responses of the host and the invading strategies of the pathogens have evolved concurrently for millions of years. Infecting pathogens have developed several escape strategies to cripple the immune system. Several viruses have evolved with proteins that interfere with antigen presentation and which target both MHC-I and MHC-II antigen processing pathways in order to distort the anti-viral immune response of the host. Several viruses such as HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, Bovine herpes virus and cytomegalovirus have been shown to have evolved strategies to combat MHC-mediated host immunity (

In the HEV interactome reported in this study, we observed the presence of MHC-interacting proteins, such as HSP90AA1 and PKM, which could be explored further for their ability to alter host immune response in the context of HEV infection.
