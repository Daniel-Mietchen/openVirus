<p>To investigate the cellular components or pathways that have been enriched in the HEV-host protein interaction network, we performed gene ontology analysis (GO annotation) of the data using various web-based tools. The GO annotation resulted in classification of the proteins based on their functional clusters or GO categories. The enrichment analysis performed using Panther (Gene Ontology Consortium’s web tool) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), and Enricher was in agreement and showed a significant enrichment of similar GO terms. FDR &lt;0.05 was set as a statistical threshold for GO analysis. Enrichment of proteins in three different categories, namely biological processes, molecular function, and cellular component, was performed using Enricher (

 <italic>p</italic>-value and z-score calculated by multiplying the two scores. The 
 <italic>p</italic>-value is the probability of any gene belonging to any set and is calculated by using exact Fisher’s test. The Z-score is calculated by using a modified Fisher’s exact test and assesses the deviation from the expected rank. The combined score provides a compromise between the available methods for multiple test corrections to control the FDRs (
