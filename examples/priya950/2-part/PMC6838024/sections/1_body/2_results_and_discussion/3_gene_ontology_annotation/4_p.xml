<p>Virus replication alters the normal metabolic processes of the host by interacting with components of different molecular pathways. Enrichment of GO terms in molecular function category also resulted in enrichment of proteins involved in RNA metabolism processes, which again highlights the need of the virus to interact with proteins of host RNA turnover. The enriched proteins in molecular function category belong to Translation elongation factor activity (GO: 0003746, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 1 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>), RNA binding (GO: 0003723, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.9 × 10
 <sup>–25</sup>) and RNA stem loop binding (GO: 0035613, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.4 × 10
 <sup>–2</sup>).
