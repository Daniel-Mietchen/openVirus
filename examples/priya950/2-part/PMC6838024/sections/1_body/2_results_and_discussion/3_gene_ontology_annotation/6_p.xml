 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kapur et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with this, our data also suggest enrichment of proteins belonging to endocytic vesicle lumen. HEV replication takes place in the cytoplasm. Along with the replicase complex, HEV RdRp has been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Rehman et al., 2008</xref>). A recent report also concluded that ORF1 polyprotein co-localizes with the markers of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, suggesting the involvement of secretory pathway during replication (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Szkolnicka et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have also indicated that HEV forms membrane-associated particles in the cytoplasm by means of budding into intracellular vesicles. HEV exploits the multivesicular body pathway to release infectious virion particles outside the cell through the cellular exosomal pathway (
