<p>All the experimentally derived data sets were used to generate HEV-host proteins interaction network by using “Cytoscape version 3.6.1” (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). To analyze the interaction among host proteins, IntAct protein interaction database was used. Only interactions confirmed by direct physical binding were considered for plotting inter protein interaction map. Topological parameters and central measures of the network were calculated by using a network analyzer tool in Cytoscape. Human protein-protein interaction analysis was also performed by using STRING database. In all the networks and throughout the study, we have used NCBI gene names to represent the proteins in order to have a consensus in protein accession. Corresponding gene names, protein names, and Uniprot protein identifiers have been listed separately (
