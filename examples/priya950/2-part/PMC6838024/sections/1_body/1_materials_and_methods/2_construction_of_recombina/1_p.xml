<p>Coding sequence of HEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was amplified from pSK-HEV2 replicon. RdRp coding sequence was cloned in pcDNA 3.1/myc-His (-) mammalian expression vector in such a way that it will be expressed as FLAG tagged RdRp at its N terminal. This clone has been designated as pcDNA_FLAG-RdRp. Primers used for the amplification have been listed in
