<p>Huh7 S10-3 cells were harvested at ∼80% confluency in cold DPBS. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5% Tritin X-100 with protease inhibitor cocktail) for 20 min at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Clear supernatant was incubated with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs of either putative genomic or sub-genomic promoters of HEV for 2 h at 4°C on rotator. 25 μl of protein G dynabeads were incubated with 4 μg of anti-hnRNPK antibody produced in rabbit (Gene Tex) or anti-hnRNPA2B1 antibody produced in rabbit (Gene Tex) or a non-specific isotype IgG antibody in antibody binding buffer (PBS + 0.0.2% Tween 20) for 35 min at room temperature. Beads bound antibody complexes were added to previously incubated lysate plus RNA complex for 1 h at 4°C on rotator. Three washes of lysis buffer were given followed by a final wash of PBS. Complexes were eluted with 80 μl of elution buffer. Elutes were processed for total RNA isolation using phenol-chloroform method. The RNA was transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) with Superscript III first strand synthesis kit followed by PCR amplification using Platinum taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using specific primers for the detection of promoter regions. The PCR product was visualized on 2% Agarose gel.
