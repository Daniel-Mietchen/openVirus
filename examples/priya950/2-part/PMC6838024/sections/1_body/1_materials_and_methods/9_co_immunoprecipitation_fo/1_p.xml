<p>Huh7 S10-3 cells expressing FLAG-RdRp and Myc-hnRNPK/hnRNPA2B1 were harvested at 48 h post transfection and resuspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1% IGEPAL detergent) for half an hour at 4°C. Cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 30 min. Clear supernatant was mixed with anti Myc antibody or isotype IgG antibody attached to protein G dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Three washes of IP lysis buffer were given to remove non-specific interactions. Interacting RdRp-host cellular protein complexes were eluted by using elution buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% Tween 20). Eluted proteins were subjected to western blot to confirm RdRp-host protein interaction using anti-FLAG antibody.</p>
