<p>A total of 2 μg of each of biotinylated RNA corresponding to either HEV putative genomic or sub-genomic promoter were coupled with M280 streptavidin dynabeads (Invitrogen) in the presence of nucleic acid binding and washing buffer (B&amp;W buffer: 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2M NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature on a rotator. Before RNA binding step, beads were washed with solution A (DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaOH, 0.05M NaCl) followed by solution B (DEPC treated 0.1 M NaCl) to remove RNase. Huh7 S10-3 cells were harvested at ∼80% confluency in the lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5% Tritin X-100 with protease inhibitor cocktail). The lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min. The bound RNA-beads complexes were incubated with Huh7 S10-3 cell lysate pre-cleared with 20 μl beads for 1 h at 4°C. Cell lysate and RNA-beads complexes were mixed and incubated together at 4°C on a rotator for 2 h. Bound complexes were washed with B&amp;W buffer and proteins bound to RNA were eluted in 100 μl elution buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% Tween 20). Eluted proteins were loaded on 12% SDS PAGE followed by silver staining for visualization of protein bands using ProteoSilver staining kit (Sigma). Eluates from three independent RNA affinity chromatography experiments were pooled together and subjected to protein identification by mass spectrometry.
