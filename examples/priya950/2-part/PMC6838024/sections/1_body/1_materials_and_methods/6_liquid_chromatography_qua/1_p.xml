<p>Hepatitis E virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA interacting proteins isolated by immunoprecipitation and RNA affinity chromatography, respectively, were subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Total 30 μg of each of the protein samples was acetone precipitated, and the protein pellets were dissolved by adding 10 μl of 8 M urea, and the volume was brought to 15 μl with water. Samples were then reduced by the addition of 1.5 μl of 100 mM DTT and heated at 90°C for 15 min. The sample was cooled and alkylated by adding 1.5 μl of 200 mM IAA and incubated in the dark at RT for 15 min. 82 μl of ABC was added, and proteins were digested by adding 1 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin protease and incubating at 37°C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1–2 μl of concentrated TFA. Then peptides were dissolved in 0.1% TFA, 5% ACN in water for MS-analysis. Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC-Chip/MS system is a microfluidic chip-based technology was used for peptide enrichment and separation. Charged peptides from HPLC-Chip system were directly infused into mass-spectrometer for detection. Agilent Mass Hunter software was used for data acquisition and analysis of total ion chromatograms. Protein searches were carried out using Morpheus software. Protein identification was performed with the following criteria: (a) Trypsin digested peptides with 2 missed cleavages allowed, (b) peptide tolerance &lt;10 ppm, (c) &gt;2 unique peptides, (d) FDR &lt;1%. Fasta files for Human Proteome database were downloaded from the UniProt was used for protein searches. Proteins found in respective negative control sample were eliminated from the dataset to remove non-specific interactions.</p>
