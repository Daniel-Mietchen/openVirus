  <p>Validation of interactions between HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with HEV promoters and RdRp. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> pTandem_FLAG-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPK plasmid was transfected in Huh 7 S10-3 cells. 48 h post transfection co-IP was performed with anti c-Myc antibody. Interaction of c-Myc tagged HNRNPK with that of FLAG tagged RdRp was checked with western blot by using anti c-Myc antibody. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> pTandem_FLAG-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPA2B1 plasmid was transfected in Huh 7 S10-3 cells. 48 h post transfection co-IP was performed with anti c-Myc antibody. Interaction of c-Myc tagged HNRNPA2B1 with that of FLAG tagged RdRp was checked with western blot by using anti c-Myc antibody. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Huh 7 S10-3 cell lysate was incubated with HEV G and Sg promoter RNA followed by immunoprecipitation with anti HNRNPK or anti HNRNPA2B1 antibody. RT-PCR was performed to detect HNRNP-bound HEV RNAs in the elutes. Figure shows amplified PCR products on 2% agarose gel.
