  <p>Identification of HEV interacting host proteins. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> pcDNA_FLAG-RdRp construct was transfected into Huh7 S10-3 cells. Post 48 h of transfection cells were harvested and checked for expression of RdRp by western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Mock-transfected Huh 7 S10-3 cells or cells transfected with pcDNA_FLAG_RdRp (expressing FLAG-tagged RdRp) were harvested after 48 h of transfection. Immunoprecipetation was performed by anti-FLAG antibody or an isotype control antibody. RdRp interacting host proteins were eluted with protein G dynabeads and analyzed on SDS PAGE followed by silver staining. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> HEV sub-genomic promoter (Sg) RNA interacting cellular proteins were pull down by using RNA affinity chromatography. Biotinylated HEV sub-genomic promoter RNA were immobilized on M280 streptavidin dynabeads. RNA immobilized beads were incubated with cell lysate of Huh7 S10-3. Interacting host proteins were eluted and checked on SDS PAGE followed by silver staining for visualization. Non-biotin RNA of the sub-genomic promoter was taken as control. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> HEV genomic promoter (G) RNA interacting cellular proteins were pull down by using RNA affinity chromatography. HEV genomic promoter RNA interacting host proteins were eluted and checked on SDS PAGE followed by silver staining. For 
   <bold>(Bâ€“D)</bold> lane 1, protein molecular weight ladder; lane 2, negative control pull-down; lane 3, experimental test pull down.
