  <p>Construction of HEV-host interaction network. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> HEV-host interaction network: Interaction map of HEV sub-genomic promoter (Sg), genomic promoter (G) and RdRp with interacting host proteins constructed in Cytoscape 3.6.1. Proteins were classified on the basis of their protein class by Panther gene ontology tool. The corresponding symbols indicating different protein classes have been mentioned on the figure. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Venn diagram comparing HEV interacting host proteins with different HEV components. Blue, yellow and green colors indicate proteins interacting with the sub-genomic promoter, genomic promoter, and RdRp, respectively. Common proteins within the data sets have been indicated in the colored intersections. Proteins have been represented as the respective NCBI gene names.
