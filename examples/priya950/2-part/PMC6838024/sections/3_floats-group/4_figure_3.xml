  <p>Construction and analysis of HEV-host PPI network. Interaction map of HEV interacting host proteins further interacting with the other proteins of our data. Black edges represent interactions revealed through mass spectrometry reported in this study. Secondary protein-protein interactions among host proteins revealed through literature mining have been indicated in red colored edges. Proteins have been represented as the respective NCBI gene names.</p>
