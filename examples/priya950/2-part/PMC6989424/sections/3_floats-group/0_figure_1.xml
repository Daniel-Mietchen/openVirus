  <p>CD4 T Cell Responses to WN Virus. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of immature and mature flavivirus particles. The virion contains three structural proteins: C (capsid), prM (pre-membrane) in immature and M (membrane) in mature virus particles, and E (envelope). The E protein consists of three domains, DI (red), DII (yellow), DIII (blue), as well as the stem (purple) and transmembrane region (gray). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Individual CD4 T cell responses from WN virus-infected subjects and na√Øve controls to WN virus peptide pools covering the entire sequences of structural proteins C, prM and E, as determined by IL-2 ELISPOT assays. Results are shown as spot forming cells (SFCs) per million CD8-depleted PBMCs. Medians are displayed as black lines. The dashed line represents the cut-off value for assay positivity. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Percentage of spots contributed by C, prM and E in WN virus-infected subjects.
