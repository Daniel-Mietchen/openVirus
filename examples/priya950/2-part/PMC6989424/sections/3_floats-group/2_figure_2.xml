  <p>Mapping of CD4 T Cell Epitopes to WN Virus C and E Proteins. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Total spot counts of positive responses to single peptides. Amino acid positions of peptides in C and E protein sequences are indicated on the x-axes. Peptides recognized in two or more individuals are indicated by asterisks and are designated by the first amino acid of the 15 mer peptide. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Ribbon diagram of the WN virus lineage 1 variant Kunjin C protein (PDB 1SFK) (
   <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), comprising four helices (H1-H4). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Ribbon representation of the WN virus soluble E (sE) ectodomain (PDB 2I69; side view) (
   <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), consisting of three domains (DI-DIII). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Surface representation of the Japanese encephalitis virus pre-fusion sE dimer (top view, PDB 3P54) (
   <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and the full-length E dimer (side view, PDB 5WSN) (
   <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Surface depiction of the St. Louis encephalitis virus post-fusion E protein trimer (PDB 4FG0; side view) (
   <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); the unresolved stem is added schematically to the structure and shown as dotted line along domain II (purple). Immunodominant WN virus peptides are colored as follows: C, green; E, DI-red, DII-yellow, DIII-blue, and stem-purple.
