<p>Our study demonstrates that dominant CD4 T helper cell responses are directed to two helices in the virus capsid and to surface-exposed regions of the viral envelope protein E in its pre- and post-fusion forms. This immunodominance pattern was strikingly similar to those previously identified for distantly related flaviviruses, including Zika (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and YF (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) viruses. Especially with epitopes of the capsid protein, the immunodominance patterns were remarkably similar for each of the different flaviviruses. Also in the case of E, we observed a strong overlap of specific epitope regions, particularly with respect to three epitope sites (E41, E245, and E381) that were almost uniformly present in the flaviviruses examined. In our study, epitope reactivities of WN virus-specific CD4 T cells were determined in an

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). It was shown that most of the peptide-specific CD4 T cells are polyfunctional (e.g., triple- [IL-2
 <sup>+</sup>TNF-α
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>] or dual-positive [IL-2
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>]) cells with at least as many CD4 T cells secreting IL-2 as compared to IFN-γ (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) or IFN-γ ELISPOT assays (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that our approach could miss epitopes targeted by single IFN-γ positive cells. Further studies that involve dual IFN-γ and IL-2 ELISPOT testing will be required to address this issue.
