<p>Analyses in the context of the atomic structures of the corresponding E proteins showed that the common epitopes are displayed in structurally conserved elements and preferentially locate to surface-exposed regions of E (e.g., the domain I-II hinge regions [E41 and E125] as well as the lateral ridge of domain III [E325 and E381]) which have been shown to be important sites for potent neutralizing antibodies against WN virus in humans (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Our findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that CD4 T cell epitopes are preferentially located at exposed protein sites or at flanks of conformationally flexible loops (

Interestingly, the only immunodominant WN virus epitope (E149) that had no overlap with epitopes from other flaviviruses, included an α-helix that is absent from Zika and DEN viruses. Its protrusion from the upper part of DI may increase its accessibility for proteolytic processing and/or MHC binding. Further evidence for the structural influence on epitope selection was obtained by our finding that several peptides predicted to bind a considerable number of HLA molecules were not observed experimentally. This is especially true for peptides from the transmembrane region that are shielded in the lipid bilayer, which might impose strong constraints on peptide generation (
