<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that WN virus infection elicits CD4 T cell responses to peptides that cluster in specific regions of the viral structural proteins and are frequently predicted as strong binders for individual HLA alleles. The immunodominant epitopes locate to structurally conserved antigen regions which are also frequently targeted in other clinically relevant flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue and Zika viruses. Together, these data provide novel insights into a key aspect of flavivirus immunity, namely how virion protein structure shapes CD4 T cell responses, which is an important issue to consider in rational vaccine design.</p>
