<p>Factors responsible for controlling the immunodominance of certain epitope sites of viral proteins in CD4 T cell responses are poorly defined but can be of great importance for generating protective immunity. A better understanding of these fundamentals requires unbiased exploration of the 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> T cell epitope repertoire, defining the structural features and the host genetic factors that underlie the preferential selection of epitopes. Toward these objectives, we examined the CD4 T cell epitope specificities in 29 WN virus-infected individuals, using a library of overlapping peptides covering the entire virion proteins. We focused on CD4 T cells directed against epitopes within the virus structural proteins, because these can mediate help to B cells by direct cell-cell interactions and are therefore essential for the production of neutralizing antibodies, the major protective correlate in flavivirus infections (
