<p>In addition to protein structure-specific factors that are responsible for characteristic immunodominance patterns, our ELISPOT data revealed considerable individual variation in epitope specificities, indicating additional influences of individual-specific factors that control epitope recognition. Evaluations based on 
 <italic>in silico</italic> predicted peptide-MHC II affinities provide evidence that most immunodominant peptides were predicted as strong binders and could potentially be presented in combination with multiple different MHC II molecules. Our results are consistent with recent studies (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), demonstrating that CD4 T cells could be detected in direct 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> samples by peptide-matched tetramers, which included a number of different alleles. Comparing the characteristics of WN virus-specific CD4 T cells in individuals with either neuroinvasive disease or asymptomatic infection, the same study found that individuals with neuroinvasive disease had higher numbers of virus-specific CD4 T cells (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that the only patient in our study with neuroinvasive disease (patient #519) demonstrated a substantially higher magnitude of response than other patients, which could be an effect of increased viral replication and/or delayed viral clearance, as described in a significant percentage of patients with WN virus encephalitis (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Apart from this single case and in line with previous findings (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), we observed no differences with respect to the overall magnitude of response between individuals with WND or asymptomatic infection, and no difference was apparent in the breadth of responses among these groups.
