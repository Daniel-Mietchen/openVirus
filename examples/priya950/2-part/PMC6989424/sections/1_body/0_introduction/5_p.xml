<p>Here, we exploited this model to obtain insights into the selection of CD4 T cell epitopes in WN virus infection. By measuring responses in 29 individuals with either West Nile virus disease (WND) or asymptomatic infection, we identified 67 peptides in the viral capsid and envelope proteins that were recognized in the context of multiple different HLA II alleles. Although WND patients and asymptomatic subjects displayed differences with respect to the recognition of certain epitopes associated with specific HLA alleles, the overall epitope patterns between these groups were similar. Both in C and E proteins, immunodominant epitopes clustered in structurally conserved regions that have also been identified as frequent targets in other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. These data are consistent with an important influence of conserved conformational features in the structural proteins of flaviviruses that shape the specificities and immunodominance of CD4 T cell responses.</p>
