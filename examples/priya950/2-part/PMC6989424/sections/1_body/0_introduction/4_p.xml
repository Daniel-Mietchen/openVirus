<p>An analysis of CD4 T cell epitopes in the context of the atomic structures of viral protein antigens may therefore provide important clues about how the dominance of certain epitopes is controlled by structural features. Recent studies examining immunodominant epitopes in the context of three-dimensional protein structures have led to the identification of critical CD4 T cell epitopes in other flaviviruses, including Zika, yellow fever (YF) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Crystallographic and cryo-EM studies have shown that the E proteins of flaviviruses are structurally very similar, whereas their sequences differ by up to 60% among distantly related flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This combination of structural conservation and sequence divergence provides a perfectly suitable model for examining the role of protein structural features as opposed to sequence in the selection of peptides and the dominance of certain epitope responses.
