<p>West Nile (WN) virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused repeated epidemics in the Americas since its first appearance in 1999, with more than 48,000 documented human cases and ~2,300 deaths (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although most WN virus infections remain asymptomatic (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), about 20% of humans develop symptoms of WN fever, and about one in 150 develop acute neuroinvasive disease (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Despite significant disease burden, there is no specific treatment or vaccine against WN virus licensed for human use. Protective immunity to WN virus has been mainly attributed to neutralizing antibodies, which are essential for the clearance of infection and long-term immunity against disease (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). CD4 T cells also play critical roles in the defense against WN virus, both by promoting protective antibody responses and by direct killing of infected cells (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite this central role, the factors influencing the development of effective WN virus-specific CD4 T cell responses, specifically the sites in virus proteins giving rise to dominant CD4 T cell epitopes, remain unknown.
