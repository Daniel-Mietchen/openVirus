<p>IL-2 ELISPOT assays were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Briefly, plates (Merck-Millipore) were coated with 1 μg anti-IL-2 antibody (3445-3-1000, Mabtech). For blocking, RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% human serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Gibco), and 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma) was used. CD8-depleted PBMCs (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/ per well) were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for about 45 h with peptides (final peptide concentration 2 μg/ml), AIM-V medium (negative control) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma) (final concentration 0.5 μg/ ml, positive control). After washing, spots were developed with 0.05 μg biotin-conjugated anti-IL-2 antibody (3445-6-250, Mabtech), streptavidin-coupled alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 1:1000, 3310-10, Mabtech), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT; B5655, Sigma). The plates were analyzed using a Bio-Sys Bioreader 5000 Pro-S/BR177 and Bioreader software generation 10. Data were calculated as spot forming cells (SFCs) per 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD8-depleted PBMCs after subtraction of the spots from the negative control (mean spot number from three to four unstimulated wells). The response to a single peptide was defined positive if the corresponding master pool, matrix pool as well as single-peptide testing yielded &gt;20 SFCs per 10
 <sup>6</sup> CD8-depleted PBMCs (
