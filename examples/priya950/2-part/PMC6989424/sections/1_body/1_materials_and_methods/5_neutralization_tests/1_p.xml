<p>Neutralization tests (NTs) to confirm WN virus infection were performed with follow-up samples from all individuals, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Briefly, duplicates of serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were incubated with 30–60 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infective dose) of WN virus strain NY99 for 1 h at 37°C. Vero cells (ECACC) were added and incubation was continued for 4–6 days at 37°C. The presence of infectious (non-neutralized) virus was assessed by microscopic evaluation of cytopathic effects. Virus NT titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution required for hundred percent protection against virus-induced cytopathic effects. Virus NT titers ≥20 were considered positive. Zika virus-specific neutralizing antibodies were determined in Vero cells (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Duplicates of serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were incubated with 30–60 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> Zika virus (strain H/PF 2013) for 1 h at 37°C. Vero cells were added and incubation was continued for 3–4 days. Virus NT titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution required for hundred percent protection against virus-induced cytopathic effects. Virus NT titers ≥20 were considered positive (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). YF and TBE NTs were carried out in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, ATCC) (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Duplicates of serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were incubated with YF-17D virus or TBE virus strain Neudoerfl for 1 h at 37°C. BHK cells were added and incubation was continued for 3–4 days. YF NT titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution required for hundred percent protection against virus-induced cytopathic effects (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Virus NT titers ≥20 were considered positive. In the case of TBE, the presence of virus was measured in the supernatants using ELISA. Neutralization titers were defined as the reciprocal of the plasma dilution that gave a 90% reduction in the absorbance readout in the assay compared to the control without antibody (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Virus NT titers ≥10 were considered positive. Positive NT titers for YF or TBE or both were obtained in 0 (0%), 21 (72%), and 3 (10%) cases, respectively. Flavivirus-naïve control samples were negative in neutralization assays. Neutralization assays using infectious virus were performed under biosafety level BSL3.
