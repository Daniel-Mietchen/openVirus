<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from whole-blood samples using Ficoll-Paque Plus™ (GE Healthcare) and were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). PBMCs were thawed and depleted of CD8-positive cells using magnetic beads coupled with anti-CD8 antibody and LD columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany), as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The depleted PBMCs were incubated overnight in serum-free medium (AIM-V; Gibco) at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2.</sub> For use in ELISPOT assays, cells were resuspended at a final concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ ml in AIM-V. The purity and viability of CD8-depleted PBMCs in each sample was assessed using anti-CD8-APC, anti-CD3-PE, anti-CD4-PacificBlue™, and 7-aminoactinomycin D (BD Bioscience) and flow cytometry (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). After depletion, CD8-positive cells were &lt;1%. Plasma and serum samples were stored at −20°C.
