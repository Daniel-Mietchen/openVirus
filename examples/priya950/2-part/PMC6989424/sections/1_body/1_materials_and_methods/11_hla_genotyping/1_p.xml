<p>HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, and HLA-DPB1 alleles from all study participants were genotyped by sequencing of the whole gene. Genotyping of HLA-DRB3/4/5 allele genotyping was done from exon 2 to the 3′UTR by next generation sequencing as described previously (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Briefly, long-range PCR products were generated by allele-specific primers and libraries generated by enzymatic fragmentation of the amplicons. After ligation to barcoded adapters the libraries were subjected to an emulsion PCR and the product sequenced on an Ion Torrent sequencing device (IonTorrent PGM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Sequences were analyzed using HLATypeStream (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) and NGS GenDX (GenDX, Utrecht, NL) software. HLA genotypes were assigned on basis of the IMGT/HLA database. For HLA-DQ predictions, haplotype compositions of –DQA1 and –DQB1 were assigned, based on the strongest linkage between these alleles, according to the reference HLA haplotype frequency standards (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).
