<p>Experimentally identified WN virus epitopes were assigned to the crystallographic or cryo-EM structures of the WN virus sE protein monomer (PDB 2I69) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the Kunjin virus (KUNV) C protein (PDB 1SFK) (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), as well as the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus E dimers (PDB 3P54 and 5WSN) (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and the St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus E trimer (PDB 4FG0) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), all belonging to the same serocomplex, using PyMol (Schrödinger LLC, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://pymol.org/</ext-link>). For comparisons, all epitopes were derived from

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Crystallographic structures used for assignment of experimentally identified epitopes were KUN virus C (PDB 1SFK), Zika sE (5LBV) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), DEN-2 sE (PDB 1OAN) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and YF sE (PDB 6EPK) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For comparison of all mosquito-borne flavivirus protein sequences and epitopes of C and E, multiple sequence alignments were performed (GenBank: Zika virus

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). This analysis also included predicted MHC II-binding peptides derived from DEN virus C or E that were positive in at least two responders (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), as well as epitopes from the JE virus C and E proteins (
