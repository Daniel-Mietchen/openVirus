<p>Structural similarity of the identified epitope regions was assessed using crystallographic structures of the WN virus (PDB 2I69), YF virus (PDB 6EPK), Zika virus (PDB 5LBV), and DEN virus sE proteins (PDB 1OAN) lacking the stem-anchor region. For selected WN virus epitope regions E41, E149, E245, and E381, as well as for the corresponding regions in YF, Zika, and DEN viruses, structural superposition of WN virus sE domains I (E41, E149), II (E245), or III (E381), respectively onto those of YF, Zika and DEN viruses was performed using the PyMOL algorithms “align” and “super” (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of selected epitope regions was computed through the PyMOL “rms_cur” command (without further fitting).
