<p>To determine the epitope specificities of responses, we performed IL-2 ELISPOT assays using peptide matrix pools and single peptides covering the entire C and E proteins. As observed for other flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the prM peptides yielded only weak positive signals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and therefore single peptide analysis was not performed. On average, individual responses were directed against five CD4 T cell epitopes accounting for a median 148 spot forming cells (SFCs) (range, 31–414 SFCs). There were no significant differences in the breadth or magnitude of responses between WND patients (median, 6.0 epitopes; 205 SFCs, range: 88–414) and asymptomatic subjects (median, 3.5 epitopes, 94.5 SFCs, range: 31–412). The cumulative number of spots for each peptide, using the results from all subjects obtained with the single-peptide testing, is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. Individuals with asymptomatic infection and WND yielded similar epitope response patterns (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>). However, closer inspection of the data showed that few epitopes accounted for the majority of the response. These epitopes, recognized in two or more individuals, accounted for 50% of the total SFC responses and were defined as immunodominant. The immunodominant peptides clustered in two antigenic regions of C (C41 and C73) and in eight regions of E (E41, E125, E149, E205, E245, E325, E381, and E417) (
