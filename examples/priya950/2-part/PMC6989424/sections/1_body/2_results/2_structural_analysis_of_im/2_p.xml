<p>We next compared the experimentally identified WN virus epitopes with the epitopes previously determined for other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including YF, Zika, and DEN viruses. All of these epitopes were identified in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> ELISPOT testing of human CD4 T cells and overlapping peptides covering the entire protein sequences (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, immunodominant regions in C were uniformly located at positions in helices H2 and H4 (C41, C73). In E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), three of the dominant WN virus epitopes (E41, E245, and E381) mapped to sites harboring immunodominant epitopes in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses, except for E381, which was not identified in DEN virus infections. Structurally, these common epitope regions encompassed ß-sheets as well as loops that are about 20 amino acids long and are devoid of disulphide bridges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, we identified two dominant sites (E125 and E205) that were congruent between WN, Zika, and DEN viruses. These data together with all epitopes identified by 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> ELISPOT assays are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>. Two WN virus epitopes (E325 and E417) were not present in DEN, Zika, and YF viruses, but overlapped with those previously identified in Japanese encephalitis virus, a closely related flavivirus of the same serocomplex (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, one epitope, E149, which involves an extra α-helix in DI, was only found in WN virus (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>).
