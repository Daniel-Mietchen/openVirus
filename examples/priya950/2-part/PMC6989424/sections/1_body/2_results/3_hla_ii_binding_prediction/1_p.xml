<p>The immunogenicity of CD4 T cell epitopes is also determined by the affinity of a particular peptide to an individual's HLA repertoire. As a prerequisite for MHC II affinity prediction, HLA genotyping of class II alleles (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1) was performed for each of the 29 donors (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S2</xref>). First, HLA binding affinity was predicted for the entire set of experimentally tested WN virus C and E peptides (
 <italic>n</italic> = 150) using the NetMHCIIpan algorithm provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Approximately 1,400 peptide-MHC II pairs yielded IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of &lt; 500 nM, indicating likely binders (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> revealed that 97% of the peptides were predicted with several different HLA alleles (up to 30 different alleles/peptide), and only 3% were predicted exclusively for one or no allele. We therefore conclude that the majority of peptides derived from C and E proteins could theoretically be presented by a large number of different MHC molecules expressed in this study cohort. However, a considerable number of frequently predicted peptides did not elicit a dominant CD4 T cell response in ELISPOT assays. This was especially the case for peptides derived from the transmembrane anchors (aa 449-501), as well as for peptides from domains II (aa 261-295) and III (aa 349-375) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that HLA binding is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for T cell responses (
