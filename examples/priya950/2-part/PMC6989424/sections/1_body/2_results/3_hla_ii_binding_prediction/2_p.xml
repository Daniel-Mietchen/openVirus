<p>In addition to this population-based approach, we assessed specifically for each individual which of the HLA alleles had the best prediction value (best percentile rank) for the peptides detected in ELISPOT assays, using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) analysis tool “IEDB recommended” (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iedb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.iedb.org</ext-link>). In this analysis, 82% of all experimentally identified peptides had an IEDB percentile rank of ≤20 for the individual HLA II alleles. For the illustration of the results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, a chord diagram was used which presents all experimentally identified epitopes on the left side of the circle, connected to the HLA II alleles predicted with best percentile ranks on the right side of the circle. Notably, more than 50% of the immunodominant peptides were predicted to bind quite strongly, with percentile ranks &lt;1.5, and 90% with percentile ranks &lt;10 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S3</xref>). These data indicate that most of the immunodominant epitopes were predicted as strong binders.
