Alternatively, a parameter called the serial interval has been described and is defined as the elapsed time between the onset of the symptoms of the primary and the secondary cases. This interval is more consistently observable in settings where clinical manifestation leads to case detection, but the serial interval is not readily extracted from epidemiological data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Alternatively, some studies of arboviruses have assumed that the serial interval is the sum of estimates of the extrinsic incubation period of a virus (within the mosquito) and the intrinsic incubation periods of a virus (within the vertebrate host) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is appropriate, as it takes into account the properties of virus transmission both within the vector as well as the vertebrate and is the definition for serial interval we use herein. However, it is important to acknowledge that while the intrinsic incubation period for CHIKV has been estimated to be approximately 3 days, there are several estimates of the extrinsic incubation period, which depend on other extrinsic factors, most notably temperature, leading to a range of possible serial intervals [
