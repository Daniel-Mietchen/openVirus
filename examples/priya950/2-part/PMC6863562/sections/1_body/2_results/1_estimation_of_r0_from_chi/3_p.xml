<p>When we visualized the estimated 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> versus CHIKV incidence in each municipality, we found the relationship to be relatively dichotomous with an apparent break at approximately 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007878.g002">Fig 2</xref>). While the relationship between incidence and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is obvious, the stark separation shown by this relationship was surprising and further lead us to investigate alternate lower bounds of 2.5 and 3 (see below).
