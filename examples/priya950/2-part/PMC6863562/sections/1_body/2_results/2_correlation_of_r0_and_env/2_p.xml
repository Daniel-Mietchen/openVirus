<p>We determined that the magnitude and direction of the correlation coefficients of some variables changed according to the lower bound of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When the lower bound of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was greater than 2, the maximum temperature, total population, urban population, and incidence were significant. Number of cases and duration of outbreak was not significantly correlated with the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, indicating that the relationship between the shape and size of the epidemic and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is driven mostly by those outbreaks where 1≤
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>≤2. As the lower bound was further raised to 2.5 and 3, correlation with these variables was not statistically significant. The only exception was a statistically significant and negative correlation between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the minimum temperature when the lower bound was 3, indicating that the biological trend of higher temperatures leading to more transmission is still apparent, but not captured with maximum temperature solely.
