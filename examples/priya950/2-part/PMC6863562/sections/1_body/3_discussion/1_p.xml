<p>The White-Pagano methodology allows for estimation of both the serial interval and

 <sub>0</sub> ranged from 1.11 to over 9. This wide range indicates heterogeneity in transmission that, since Colombia was assumed to be a completely susceptible population, could have been related to other factors than the lack of herd immunity.
