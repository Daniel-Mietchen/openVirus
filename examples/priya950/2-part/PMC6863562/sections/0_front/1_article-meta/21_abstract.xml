 <p>Chikungunya virus emerged in Colombia in 2014 into a presumed fully susceptible population and rapidly spread in the country. Numerous municipalities were differently affected by this virus across the country. The main purpose of this work was understanding why those differences were produced and, in turn, what are the variables addressing such differences. For this purpose, we estimated for 85 municipalities the basic reproduction number (
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>), a crucial parameter to understand epidemics that is expressed as the number of secondary cases produced by a primary case. Such parameter was correlated with numerous variables resulting evident a crucial role of temperature in the increase of 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>. Interestingly, other variables like size of the urban area and cases showed to be negatively correlated with 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>. Results shows that high temperatures produce high 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>, but those municipalities that showed high 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> showed an explosive epidemic with faster increase of cases that ceased equally fast, so the duration of epidemic is short producing small amount of cases. In this way, more cases are expected with municipalities with lower values of 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>, which is suitably explained by the tortoise-hare model, where the less explosive outbreak results to be more advantageous for the virus.
