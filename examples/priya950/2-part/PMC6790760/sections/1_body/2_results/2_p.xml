<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the international dataset revealed two main paraphyletic VBRV lineages that circulated in Costa Rica between 2004 and 2017 (

 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density (HPD) = 3.54–6.34 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), which was similar to previous estimates [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lineage 1 (L1) was encountered between 2006 and 2017 and had a MRCA in 1980.8 (95% HPD = 1970.5–1989.33). However, L1 comprised four temporally structured clades, several of which shared an MRCA with South American viruses from Colombia, rather than the other Costa Rican viruses (

This analysis further supported a dispersal of an L1 virus from Costa Rica to El Salvador, consistent with the spread of South American viruses to more northern Central American countries via Costa Rica. Lineage 2 (L2) was detected between 2004 and 2014 and shared an MRCA with Mexican viruses in 1999.8 (95% HPD = 1995.3–2003). The phylogeographic analysis supported unidirectional viral dispersal from Mexico to Costa Rica, suggesting the southward invasion of a North American virus (
