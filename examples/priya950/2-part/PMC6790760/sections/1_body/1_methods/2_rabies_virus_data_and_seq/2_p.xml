<p>Over the time period of this study (2004–2017), 60 rabies outbreaks were reported in domestic animals from Costa Rica, involving 180 mortalities (median = 2 deaths per outbreak; range = 1–17; electronic supplementary material, figure S1). All animals were reported by their owners to have clinical signs consistent with rabies encephalitis, and brain samples were confirmed rabies positive by direct immunofluorescence by the National Veterinary Service Laboratory (LANASEVE). We sampled representative viruses collected from 39 cattle and 1 domestic dog from 38 outbreaks. Importantly, as cattle do not transmit rabies intra-specifically or back to bats, each record represents an independent spillover from the bat reservoir. The single rabies virus from a domestic dog (GenBank accession no.
