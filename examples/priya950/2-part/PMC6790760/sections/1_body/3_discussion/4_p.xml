<p>Locally sporadic viral presence also helps explain why bat culls have not reduced VBRV spillover [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Since culls are carried out haphazardly or in response to increasing frequencies of bat attacks on humans or livestock, they are unlikely to affect areas of active viral circulation or high-risk areas for VBRV invasion by chance. Therefore, culls mostly reduce VBRV-free populations rather than preventing endemically infected populations from reaching a critical epidemic threshold as would be required for culling to succeed [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Designing culls (or emerging alternatives including oral vaccines) to limit invasions and potentially trigger lineage extinctions might be more effective and less expensive than the current approach [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Given the importance of international viral dispersal demonstrated here, efforts in Central America might target narrow geographical pinch points, analogous to the combined use of natural landscape and vaccine barriers to block the spread of raccoon rabies in North America [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As less than 3% of vampire bats disperse and median dispersal distances are less than 10 km, such interventions might be carried out over relatively small widths [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Other migratory bat species might spread rabies over larger distances, but maintain epidemiologically independent viruses that would not compromise interventions targeting VBRV [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Increasing notifications to surveillance systems and data sharing across Latin America is a key prerequisite to design epidemiologically informed interventions.
