<p>Most knowledge of the transmission dynamics of VBRV is derived from large countries in North (i.e. Mexico) and South America (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Peru) that sustain high incidence of human and/or livestock rabies [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These studies have revealed that single bat colonies cannot maintain VBRV indefinitely, implying that bat dispersal among colonies enables long-term viral persistence [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, distinct underlying spatial processes, including travelling waves of infection into historically rabies-free areas and metapopulation dynamics in endemically infected areas, have been identified [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A key remaining knowledge gap for VBRV, and rabies virus more generally, is the spatial scale required to evade stochastic viral extinction. The Central American tropics comprise a relatively narrow land mass, which might predispose spatially dependent pathogens to extinction. If so, apparent endemic circulation in some countries might be driven by re-introductions from North and/or South America. Alternatively, if the geographical scale required for viral persistence is sufficiently small or if environmental conditions favour sustained viral circulation, VBRV might persist endemically. These scenarios imply different strategies and opportunities for prevention and control.
