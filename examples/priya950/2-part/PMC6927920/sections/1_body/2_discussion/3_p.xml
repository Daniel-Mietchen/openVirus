<p>Moreover, our results have also an important translational application. Since recombinant IAV expressing heterotypic (IBV, ICV, or IDV) NS1 proteins are highly attenuated, with limited replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to viruses expressing the homotypic IAV NS1 protein, these viruses could be used as safe, immunogenic and protective LAIVs for the prevention of viral infections. Compared to the previously described approaches, including the use of a NS1 deficient virus, LAIVs based on IAV expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins present the following advantages: (1) IAV expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins replicate more efficiently in culture cells than NS1 deficient viruses, representing an advantage for vaccine production; (2) IAV expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins would ensure that the viruses are attenuated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> but they conserve their ability to counteract, to some extent, the IFN response; and (3) therefore, they could induce innate immune responses that can act as a natural adjuvant to control viral replication and to enhance host adaptive immune response to provide better protection (
