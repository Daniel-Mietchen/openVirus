<p>Since the primary role of influenza NS1 protein is to inhibit IFN and host antiviral responses during viral infection (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Nogales et al., 2018b</xref>), we next explored the effect of expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins in the backbone of IAV PR8, on the ability of the virus to inhibit induction of IFN in infected cells using cell- and virus-based IFN bioassays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). MDCK cells constitutively expressing FFluc reporter gene under the control of the IFNβ promoter (MDCK IFNβ-GFP/IFNβ-FFluc) were mock-infected or infected (MOI = 3) with the recombinant PR8 viruses and, at 12 h p.i., we evaluated IFNβ promoter activation by FFluc expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, FFluc activities were greater in cells infected with PR8/ΔNS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, FFluc expression levels were comparable between the PR8/WT and the homotypic (PR8/ANS1) or heterotypic (PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1) NS1-expressing recombinant viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that they were able to similarly inhibit IFNβ induction. Importantly, we observed similar levels of infection in MDCK cells with the different recombinant viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also assessed the presence of IFN in tissue culture supernatants (TCSs) collected from the same virus-infected MDCK cells. To that end, fresh MDCK cells were treated with the UV-inactivated TCS from PR8 infected cells. At 24 h post-incubation, cells were infected (MOI = 3) with a recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing GFP (rNDV-GFP), a virus previously described to be sensitive to the antiviral state induced by the present of IFN in TCS (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2003</xref>). Then, 14 h p.i., GFP expression was evaluated using a fluorescent microplate reader (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). MDCK cells pre-treated with TCS from mock-infected cells were used as internal control. As expected, based on the levels of IFNβ promoter activation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), levels of rNDV-GFP replication were reduced in MDCK cells pre-treated with TCS of PR8 infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of rNDV-GFP was similar in MDCK cells treated with TCS from WT (PR8/WT), homotypic (PR8/ANS1) or heterotypic (PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1) infected cells. Moreover, inhibition of rNDV-GFP infection was more evident and significant in MDCK cells treated with TCS from PR8/ΔNS1 infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the NS1 protein from heterotypic IBV, ICV, and IDV have similar abilities to inhibit IFN responses as the homotypic IAV PR8 NS1 in infected MDCK cells.
