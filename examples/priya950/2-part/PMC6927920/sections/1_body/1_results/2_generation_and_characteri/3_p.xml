<p>Next, we evaluated the replication properties of the recombinant PR8 viruses in cell culture by performing multicycle growth kinetics in canine MDCK (MOI = 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) or human A549 (MOI = 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) cells at 33°C. All recombinant PR8 viruses reached high titers in MDCK cells, although PR8/WT and PR8/ANS1 showed statistically significant higher viral titers than PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ΔNS1 viruses at 24 and 48 h p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These similarities, or differences, were more noticeably in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). PR8/WT and PR8/ANS1 reached similar viral titers in A549 cells while PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ΔNS1 viruses grew at significant lower titers (10- to 1,000-fold decrease) than PR8/WT or PR8/ANS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, while the replication of PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1 viruses increased in a time dependent matter, PR8/ΔNS1 viral titers decreased over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), probably because PR8/ΔNS1 lacks NS1 and, therefore, the ability to inhibit IFN (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998</xref>). We also examined the phenotype of the different recombinant PR8 viruses in MDCK cells using plaque assays and immunostaining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, based on our multicycle growth kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), PR8/WT and PR8/ANS1 have similar plaque sizes that were larger than those of the recombinant PR8 viruses encoding heterotypic NS1 proteins, and more noticeable, than the virus lacking NS1 (PR8/ΔNS1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrates that viral fitness of recombinant PR8 viruses expressing heterotypic IBV, ICV and IDV NS1 proteins, and more noticeable the virus without NS1, was impaired compared to PR8/WT or PR8/ANS1 in cultured cells, an effect that was more evident in A549 cells.
