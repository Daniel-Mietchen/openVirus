<p>All the recombinant PR8/ANS1, PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1 viruses were successfully recovered, using plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques, and the identity of the rescued viruses was confirmed by immunofluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and Western blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) analysis at 14 h post-infection (p.i.) in MDCK-infected [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 2] cells, using specific antibodies against the HA epitope tag fused to NS1, and the viral NP protein. WT (PR8/WT) and NS1 deficient (PR8/Î”NS1) PR8 viruses were included as internal controls. Only cells infected with the recombinant PR8 viruses encoding the HA-tagged NS1 proteins were detected with the HA epitope tag antibody by either immunofluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) or Western blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). On the other hand, NP expression was observed in all infected but not in mock-infected cells (
