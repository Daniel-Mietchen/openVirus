<p>Given that we observed differences in the replication of recombinant PR8 viruses expressing different NS1 proteins in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), we next evaluated and compared the virulence of the different recombinant PR8 viruses in a mouse model of influenza viral infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Groups of C57BL/6 WT mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, or 10
 <sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFUs) of PR8/ANS1, PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ΔNS1 and animals were monitored during 2 weeks for body weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and mortality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Mice infected with PR8/ANS1 showed clear changes in mouse morbidity and mortality that were dose dependent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>, respectively). Importantly, and as previously described, approximately 50% of the mice infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU succumbed to PR8/ANS1 infection (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">DeDiego et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Nogales et al., 2016a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). As expected, PR8/ΔNS1 was highly attenuated, with no changes in body weight and all the animals surviving viral infection, even with the highest dose of 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>, respectively). Notably, PR8 viruses expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins (PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1) displayed similar levels of attenuation as PR8/ΔNS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>), suggesting that the NS1 protein from IBV, ICV, and IDV cannot functionally substitute the NS1 protein of IAV.
