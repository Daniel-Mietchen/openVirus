<p>To assess whether the observed attenuation correlated with virus replication in the lungs of infected mice, groups of C57BL/6 WT mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were infected i.n. with the same viral doses (10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, or 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU) of PR8/ANS1, PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ﾎ年S1 viruses; and viral titers were evaluated at days 2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and 4 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar to the morbidity and mortality data, animals infected with PR8/ANS1 virus showed high levels of viral replication [&gt;10
 <sup>6</sup> fluorescent forming units (FFU/ml)] at both days 2 and 4 p.i. for all different doses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Remarkably, virus replication was limited in PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1 and PR8/DNS1 infected mice, to levels comparable to PR8/ﾎ年S1 infected animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). No virus was recovered in any of the mice infected at lower MOI (10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU), and low virus titers were detected in mice infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of PR8/BNS1 and PR8/DNS1. Different viral titers were recovered from the lungs of mice infected with the highest dose (10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU) of PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ﾎ年S1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). In all the cases, virus loads with all the four viruses (PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, PR8/DNS1, and PR8/ﾎ年S1) were at least three to four orders of magnitude lower than those observed with PR8/ANS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, virus titers in the lungs correlated with the low morbidity and mortality observed in infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>, respectively) and with viral replication in cultured cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>).
