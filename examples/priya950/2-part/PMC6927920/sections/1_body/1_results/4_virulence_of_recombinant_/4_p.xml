<p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is critical for type I and type III IFN signaling and plays an important role in host defense responses against viral infections (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Garcia-Sastre, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Uccellini and Garcia-Sastre, 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation of STAT2 (and STAT1) leads to their dimerization and translocation to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors for the activation of multiple ISGs, which limit viral replication and induce an antiviral state in the same or neighbor cells (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blaszczyk et al., 2016</xref>). Given that type I and type III IFN signaling relies on STAT2 activation, absence of STAT2 allows a more targeted assessment of type I and type III IFN-mediated immune responses. Moreover, it has been previously shown that influenza-infected STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> B6 mice have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to WT B6 mice (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gopal et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the virulence of PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1 and PR8/DNS1 in C57BL/6 STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice and compared them to that of the parental PR8/WT and PR8/ANS1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). To that end, male C57BL/6 STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were infected i.n. with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of PR8/WT, PR8/ANS1, PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1 or mock-infected and changes in body weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) were monitored daily for 14 days. All mice infected with PR8/WT or PR8/ANS1 rapidly lost weight and succumbed to viral infection by day 5 after infection. Although PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, and PR8/DNS1 viruses were still attenuated as compared to PR8/WT or PR8/ANS1, the recombinant PR8 viruses expressing heterosubtypic NS1 proteins were able to induce morbidity and mortality in the STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A,B</xref>, respectively). To further characterize 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, female STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice were infected with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of the same recombinant viruses and viral lung replication was analyzed at days 2 and 4 p.i. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 for the heterotypic viruses and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 for PR8/WT at each time point) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). In agreement with the pathogenicity data, lower viral titers were detected in the lungs of STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice infected with PR8/BNS1, PR8/CNS1, or PR8/DNS1 as compared to mice infected with PR8/WT or PR8/ANS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that although recombinant PR8 viruses expressing IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins are able to counteract IFN responses in cultured cells, these heterotypic NS1 proteins cannot entirely complement the functions of IAV NS1 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> resulting in reduced viral fitness and replication and, therefore, virulence.
