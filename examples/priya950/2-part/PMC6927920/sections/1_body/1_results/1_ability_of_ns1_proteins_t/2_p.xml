<p>We next evaluated the ability of the different NS1 proteins to counteract IFN responses. To that end, human 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with individual plasmids expressing the HA-tagged NS1 proteins of IAV (PR8 and 1918), IBV, ICV, or IDV; together with a plasmid expressing Firefly Luciferase (FFluc) under the control of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter and a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) under a polymerase II dependent promoter (

At 20 h post-transfection, cells were either mock infected (âˆ’) or infected (+) with Sendai virus (SeV) for 24 h to induce ISRE promoter activation. FFluc expression was quantified and normalized to the levels of Rluc (

While a strong activation of the ISRE promoter was observed after SeV infection in the empty plasmid control, SeV-infected cells transfected with IAV, IBV, ICV, or IDV NS1-expressing plasmids showed reduced ISRE promoter activation with values similar to those observed in mock-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, PR8 IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV; but not 1918 IAV, NS1 proteins were detected by Western blot using an anti-HA epitope antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the NS1 proteins from IAV (PR8 and 1918), IBV, ICV, and IDV were all able to efficiently inhibit SeV-induced activation of the ISRE promoter.
