<p>To evaluate the effects of the different viral NS1 proteins on host protein synthesis, human 293T cells (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were transiently co-transfected, using LPF2000, with 1 μg/well of the indicated pCAGGS-HA COOH NS1 expression plasmids or an empty plasmid as control, together with 25 ng/well of pCAGGS plasmid expressing Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Capul and de la Torre, 2008</xref>). At 24 h post-transfection, Gluc activity was quantified from tissue culture supernatants using a Biolux Gaussia luciferase reagent (New England Bio-Labs) and a Lumicount luminometer (PacKard). The mean values and standard deviations (SD) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software.
