<p>All protocols involving C57BL/6 WT mice have been approved by the University of Rochester Committee of Animal Resources and complied with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals et al., 2011</xref>). C57BL/6 WT were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and maintained in the animal care facility at University of Rochester under specific pathogen-free conditions. Six-to-8-week-old C57BL/6 WT mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin; 240 mg/kg of body weight) and infected intranasally (i.n.) with the indicated viruses. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were examined daily for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality (survival). Mice showing a &gt; 25% loss of their initial body weight were considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized. Virus replication was assessed by evaluating viral titers in the lungs of infected mice at days 2 and 4 post-infection. To that end, C57BL/6 WT mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3/day) were euthanized by administration of a lethal dose of Avertin and bleeding, and lungs were surgically extracted and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS/BA/PS (
