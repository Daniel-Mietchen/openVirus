<p>Levels of IFNβ, chemokine (C–C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) induction were analyzed in mouse lungs at 2 and 4 days post-infection. To that end, mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were sacrificed as above, and their lungs were extracted and incubated in RNAlater (Ambion) at 4°C for 24 h prior to freezing at −80°C. Lungs were homogenized in lysis buffer by use of a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), and total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Reverse transcriptase reactions were conducted at 37°C for 2 h using a High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and a dT primer to amplify mRNAs. Quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) specific for the murine genes IFNβ (Mm00439552_s1), IFIT2 (Mm00492606_m1), and CCL2 (Mm00441242_m1).
