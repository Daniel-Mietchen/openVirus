<p>STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> C57BL/6 mice were originally provided by Dr. Christian Schindler. The latter STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice were then bred locally. Mice were housed in a barrier facility at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai under specific pathogen free conditions. All mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines. Six-to-8-week-old C57BL/6 STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 4% isoflurane and inoculated i.n. at the indicated amount of viruses. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 for WT or 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 for STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup>) were examined daily for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality as indicated above. To evaluate viral replication, C57BL/6 STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 for ABCD NS1-expressing recombinant viruses, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 for PR8/WT virus) were euthanized by inhalation of 2% CO
 <sub>2</sub> followed by cervical dislocation. The lungs were excised on day 2 or day 4 post-infection, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. Mice were distributed by sex because of limited availability. Male mice were used to evaluate morbidity and female mice were used to assess viral replication.
