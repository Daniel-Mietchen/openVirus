<p>Polymerase II expression plasmids containing the NS1 sequences from influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 (IBV), C/Taylor/1233/1947 (ICV), or D/Swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (IDV) fused to an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) were generated using standard molecular biology techniques. Briefly, the different NS1 ORFs were amplified by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides with the appropriate flanking restriction sites (
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Sma</italic>I) for cloning into pCAGGS-HA-COOH (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Mibayashi et al., 2007</xref>) using 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Sma</italic>I restriction sites. The pCAGGS plasmids encoding the NS1 genes of IAV PR8 and A/Brevig Mission/01/1918 H1N1 (1918) have been previously described (
