<p>To evaluate the ability of the different NS1 proteins to inhibit activation of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter upon SeV infection, human 293T cells (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were co-transfected with 1 μg of the different pCAGGS-HA NS1-expressing plasmids or empty plasmid as a control, together with 0.25 μg/well of a plasmid expressing FFluc under the control of an ISRE promoter (pISRE-FFluc) (

At 20 h post-transfection, cells were infected (MOI = 3) with SeV, Cantell strain (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>), to induce activation of the ISRE promoter, and 24 h post-infection, FFluc and Rluc activities were quantified from cell lysates using luciferase reporter buffers (Promega) and a Lumicount luminometer (PacKard). FFluc/Rluc activation was shown as fold-induction compared to mock-infected cells in the absence of NS1 protein (empty plasmid). The mean values and SD were calculated using Microsoft Excel software.
