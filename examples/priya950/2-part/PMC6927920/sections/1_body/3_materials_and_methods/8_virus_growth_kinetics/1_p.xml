<p>To assess virus multicycle growth rates, confluent monolayers MDCK or A549 cells (12-well plate format, 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were infected at a MOI of 0.001 or 0.01, respectively. After 1 h of virus adsorption at room temperature, cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, PSG, and TPCK-treated trypsin at 33°C. At the indicated times post-infection (24, 48, 72, and 96 h), tissue culture supernatants were collected and titrated on MDCK cells in 96-well plates by an immunofluorescence assay (fluorescent forming units [FFU/ml]) using an influenza virus anti-NP antibody (HB-65) as previously described (
