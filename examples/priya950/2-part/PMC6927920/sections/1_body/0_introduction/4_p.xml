<p>To evaluate the ability of IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins to functionally complement IAV NS1, we engineered recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) viruses expressing homotypic (IAV) or heterotypic (IBV, ICV, and IDV) NS1 proteins. To that end, we took advantage of our recently described NS split approach that allows the expression of NS1 independently of NEP from the same NS viral segment (

These results indicate that while IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins are capable of counteracting host IFN responses, other functions specific for IAV NS1 are not present in the heterotypic NS1 proteins, resulting in reduced replication and viral attenuation
