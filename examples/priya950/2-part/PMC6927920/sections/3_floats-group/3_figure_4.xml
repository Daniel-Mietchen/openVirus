  <p>IFNβ promoter activation and induction of an antiviral state by recombinant WT and modified PR8 viruses. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of the experimental approach. MDCK cells (2.5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, 24-well plate format, triplicates) expressing FFluc reporter gene under the control of the IFNβ promoter (MDCK IFNβ-GFP/-FFluc) were mock-infected or infected (MOI = 3) with the WT and modified PR8 viruses. At 12 h post-infection, IFNβ promoter activation was determined by assessing FFluc expression level. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Viral infections were evaluated by immunofluorescence using the antibody against influenza NP. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Tissue culture supernatants from the same mock- or PR8-infected MDCK cells were collected and, after UV inactivation, used to treat fresh MDCK cells in 96-well plates (5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/well, 96-well plate format, triplicates) for 24 h prior to infection (MOI = 3) with rNDV-GFP. GFP expression from rNDV-GFP-infected cells was evaluated at 14 h post-infection using a fluorescent microplate reader 
   <bold>(D)</bold>.
