  <p>Virulence and replication of recombinant PR8 viruses in WT mice: groups of 5-to-6-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were infected intranasally with the indicated doses (10
   <sup>3</sup>, 10
   <sup>4</sup>, 10
   <sup>5</sup>, or 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) of PR8 viruses expressing IAV (PR8/ANS1), IBV (PR8/BNS1), ICV (PR8/CNS1) and IDV (PR8/DNS1) or with the NS1 deficient PR8 virus (PR8/ΔNS1). Body weight loss 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and survival 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were evaluated daily for 2 weeks. Groups of mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) were sacrificed at days 2 and 4 post-infection and lungs were harvested, homogenized and used to quantify viral titers 
   <bold>(C)</bold> by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml). Symbols represent data from individual mice. Bars represent the means of lung viral titers. &amp; Infectious virus was detected only in 1 of 3 mice. Black dotted lines indicates the limit of detection (100 FFU/ml).
