<p>WNV remains a significant threat to humans in many parts of the world. Its potential to cause outbreaks in newly endemic areas, as exemplified in Europe 2018, is alarming. Its ability to acquire mutations which lead to increased virulence, paired with its flexibility in using various mosquito species as vectors and birds as amplifying hosts make epidemics extremely unpredictable. Global warming and the ever increasing traffic of humans, animals and goods are additional factors favoring the further spread of WNV. Consequently, a human vaccine would be essential to encounter this global threat. Technologies for WNV vaccines have been developed, they are protective and safe. Some issues have prevented the transformation of these candidate vaccines into marketable products until now. However, there are possible ways to address and overcome these obstacles: to increase cost-effectiveness, the vaccine candidates need to be optimized for low production costs and long lasting effectiveness upon a single dose vaccine regimen. To avoid potential interference of immune responses to different flaviviruses in areas of co-circulation, vaccine candidates should be lacking epitopes which lead to binding of cross-reactive antibodies. Finally, due to the difficulties in planning efficacy trials, licensing procedures need to be adapted, similar to vaccines against other (re-) emerging infections.</p>
