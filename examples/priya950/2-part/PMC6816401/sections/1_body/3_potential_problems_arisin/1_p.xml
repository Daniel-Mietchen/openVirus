<p>Flaviviruses are structurally very similar; hence, many antibodies elicited during an infection can bind to other flaviviruses as well. Especially the E-protein contains highly conserved parts, most prominently the fusion loop domain, which is recognized by most of the cross-reacting antibodies.

 </sup> This is a significant problem for the specificity of flavivirus serological tests.

 </sup> In addition, in the case of DENV, it can also have a direct impact on the course of an infection, as antibodies against one of the four DENV serotypes can enhance infection with another serotype. The phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is believed to arise from the binding of antibodies which are unable to neutralize the virus but lead to increased uptake into host cells, e.g. via Fc-receptor-mediated endocytosis into macrophages. This would lead to more severe symptoms during secondary, heterologous dengue infection.

 </sup> Although ADE has been demonstrated using cell-culture-based assays, its role in the pathogenesis of human dengue infections remains controversial.

 </sup> The emergence of ZIKV in DENV endemic areas has led to investigations to test potential ADE between both virus infections, which might be responsible for some of the severe symptoms of ZIKV infections, for example, fetal neurological malformations. ADE between DENV and ZIKV could be demonstrated in cell culture experiments and in animal models, and a large proportion of cross-reactive antibodies from secondary infections due to co-circulation map to the E-protein.
