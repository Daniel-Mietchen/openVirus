<p>Within the E-protein of WNV, many neutralizing antibodies target the domain DIII, which is structurally less conserved among flaviviruses. Using only the DIII domain of WNV has been shown to fully protect mice from lethal infection, and recent data suggest that this antigen does not induce ADE for DENV and ZIKV.

 </sup> Alternatively, a vaccine could predominantly induce protective T-cell responses and thereby avoid ADE. WNV vaccine approaches based on T-cell epitopes have been described, but protection in animal models reached 75%, so the combination with neutralizing antibody-inducing antigens still seems necessary.
