<p>This increase in endemic areas over the last decades has made WNV the arthropod-borne human pathogenic flavivirus with the largest distribution worldwide.

 </sup> WNV can be divided into five genetic lineages.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>
 </sup> Lineage 1 has caused major outbreaks in the 1990s, including the epidemic in the USA. In contrast, lineage 2 was traditionally associated with less pathogenicity. However, recently emerging variants of lineage 2 viruses have gained substantial epidemic potential and are responsible for many outbreaks in Europe and Africa.

 </sup> Several mutations have been identified which can be linked to increased virulence in both genetic lineages, illustrating the high capacity of this single-stranded RNA virus to mutate its genome.
