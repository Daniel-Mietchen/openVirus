<p>Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that a WNV vaccine could obtain market approval by using one of the alternative strategies instead of classical efficacy trials, however, this would require that the vaccine leads to clear clinical and also socioeconomic benefits. WNV can induce severe, even fatal disease. It has caused more than 1,500 deaths since 1999 in the USA alone and 181 deaths in Europe during 2018. Consequently, a WNV vaccine would save lives and would avoid the suffering of many people. However, economically it is debatable whether a vaccine would be beneficial to the health systems or whether the costs would be unacceptably high. Two published studies have addressed the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination in the USA, one in 2006,

 </sup> Both investigations conclude that a WNV vaccine is unlikely to save costs. As case numbers are relatively low, and the assumed costs per vaccine dose are high, the amount of money necessary to avoid a single case is consequently very high. Cost-effectiveness increases when only specific age groups are immunized as compared to universal vaccination.

 </sup> However, even with targeted immunization, it would still be markedly lower as compared, for example, to the herpes zoster vaccine, which also targets aged individuals.

 </sup> Obviously, an increase in case numbers and a vaccine which is cheap and ideally only needs a single dose could put this scenario upside down. In this context, it is relevant that almost all clinically tested vaccine candidates until now require more than one dose to achieve elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies in a significant proportion of study participants. Many also rely on sophisticated, but expensive, technologies. WNV is constantly expanding its endemic area, and case numbers, e.g. in Europe, have increased enormously in 2018. However, it is hard to predict whether this will lead to a significant change in outbreak characteristics which could influence the planning of vaccine efficacy trials.
