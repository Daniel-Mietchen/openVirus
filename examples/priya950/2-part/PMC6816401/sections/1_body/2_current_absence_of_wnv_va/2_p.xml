<p>In general, the reasons for the lack of a human vaccine may include scientific challenges (mainly in obtaining protective immunity), safety concerns, difficulties in clinical study design or economic considerations. As discussed above, it is possible to obtain protective immune responses to WNV by using a variety of different immunization technologies. Existing flavivirus vaccines also use different approaches: the YFV vaccine consists of an attenuated virus, whereas TBEV and JEV vaccines are made of inactivated pathogens. In addition, first clinical tests in humans have provided solid evidence for the capability of at least some of the candidates to elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses, which normally correlate well to protection against flaviviruses. Problems in obtaining protective immunity are therefore unlikely to be responsible for the poor outcome of clinical WNV vaccine development to date.</p>
