<p>WNV induced disease is most severe in the elderly; hence, the major target population for a vaccine has an aged immune system. This represents a challenge for vaccine developers with respect to immunogenicity and safety.

 </sup> Antigens which are highly immunogenic in a fully functional immune system might need higher or more doses during immunosenescence. In addition, an immune system with reduced T-cell function might be unable to restrict replication of a vector or a virus which is normally attenuated. Some of the pre-clinical developments address these issues by using aged animals.

 </sup> Likewise, clinical trials included groups with aged individuals. Both live virus vaccine candidates demonstrated high immunogenicity in individuals &gt;50 years of age, and similar findings were reported from a phase I trial using the DNA vaccine.
