<p>Since the (re-)emergence of WNV in the late 1990, substantial research has been invested in the development of vaccines for human and veterinary use. For horses, this was successful, and several equine vaccines have been licensed.

 </sup> For humans, no vaccine is yet available. To develop WNV vaccines, different technological platforms were employed, including those from the licensed vaccines for TBEV, JEV and YFV (attenuated strains and chemically inactivated viruses) in addition to novel and highly sophisticated technologies. These include recombinant proteins, virus-like particles, RNA-replicons, chimeric flaviviruses, viral vectors expressing WNV genes, DNA- and RNA vaccines. Several recent reviews have described these different approaches, so they will not be discussed herein further detail.

 </sup> WNV immunization studies used different experimental setups, such as viral strains, immunization schedules or animal models. But taken together, they have led to critically important general conclusions:
