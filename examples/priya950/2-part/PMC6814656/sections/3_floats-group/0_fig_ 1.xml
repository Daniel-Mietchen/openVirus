   <bold>A</bold> Pig 
   <italic>APN</italic> gene targeting strategy. Schematic of the pig 
   <italic>APN</italic> locus showing the location (indicated by arrowheads) and sequence (underlined) of two gRNAs targeting exons 2 and 3 individually. Red letters denote the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). 
   <bold>B</bold> Representative photo of APN KO cloned pig (1 month old). 
   <bold>C</bold> Western blot showing loss of APN expression in the intestines of KO pigs compared with the significant APN expression in WT pig. β-actin is used as the loading control. 
   <bold>D</bold> Quantitative PCR detection of PEDV RNA in fecal swabs. Fecal shedding of both groups is first observed at PID 2, present in all the pigs with peak titers more than 7 log
   <sub>10</sub> GE/μL in individual pigs at PIDs 3, 4, and 7, and absent in most pigs at PID 14. No significant difference in the fecal shedding was found between KO and WT group, excluding that at PID 4 (*
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, unpaired t test). 
   <bold>E</bold> Antibody response after PEDV challenge in the experimental groups. The two groups did not differ in the antibody titers. An S/P ratio higher or equal to 0.4 (broken line) was considered positive. Data in 
   <bold>D</bold> and 
   <bold>E</bold> are expressed with box and whiskers plot around median values.
