<p id="Par5">To analyze PEDV RNA titers in fecal samples, the fecal material on the swabs was squeezed out to the saline and subjected to viral RNA extraction. Viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (Takara). Thereafter, the viral copy numbers were assayed by quantitating the PEDV nucleocapsid (
 <italic>N</italic>) gene by using THUNDERBIRD
 <sup>®</sup> Probe qPCR Mix (TOYOBO), and the primers and probe were as follows: PED-N-Forward, 5′-GAATTCCCAAGGGCGAAAAT-3′, PED-N-Reverse, 5′-TTTTCGACAAATTCCGCATCT-3′, and PED-N-Probe, FAM-CGTAGCAGCTTGCTTCGGACCCA-BHQ1 (Miller

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>). Results showed that the fecal shedding of PEDV RNA could be detected starting from PID 2, and all the pigs shed virus at PIDs 3, 4, and 7. Although the median value of viral titers in feces of KO group was significantly lower than that of WT group at PID 4, the virus shedding levels were not different at other time points. Most animals were negative for fecal shedding at PID 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The PEDV infection levels were further evaluated by testing the PEDV-specific antibody (IgG) level in the serum with Swinecheck
 <sup>®</sup> PED indirect ELISA (Biovet) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Serum PEDV antibody was negative in all the inoculated pigs at and before PID 7. Positive antibody level was observed in 2/7 KO and 4/6 WT pigs at PID 14. An equally peak antibody titer was observed in individual pigs of both groups at PID 28. Most pigs were negative for antibody response at PID 35 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). Moreover, no inoculated pigs had detectable PEDV RNA in the serum over the infection period by quantitative PCR.
