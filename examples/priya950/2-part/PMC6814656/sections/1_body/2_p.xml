<p id="Par2">An alternative strategy for an effective viral infection control is through genetic modification of a viral receptor gene of the host animals, including gene knockout (KO) or gene replacement with an ortholog from nonpermissive species (Whitworth 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). The strategy has been validated by a proof-of-concept study in which pigs were conferred resistance against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection by modifying the specific viral receptor gene 
 <italic>CD163</italic> (Whitworth 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>). The putative receptor for PEDV infection was considered to be Aminopeptidase N (APN) (Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>). Previous reports showed that expression of pig APN in nonsusceptible cell lines rendered susceptibility to PEDV infection (Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>). However, the function of APN in PEDV infection remains controversial. Recent studies demonstrated that porcine APN overexpression in nonsusceptible cells failed to support PEDV infection (Shirato 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>), and the depletion or down-regulation of APN expression in PEDV-susceptible cells had no inhibitory effect on PEDV infection (Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>; Ji 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). These cell-based studies demonstrated that APN is not required for PEDV entry to cultured cells. However, discrepancies often exist between the cell level and whole body. The role of APN in PEDV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> still needs clarification.
