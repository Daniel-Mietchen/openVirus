<p id="Par4">PEDV challenge was performed according to a previous time-course study using 4-week-old feeder pigs (Niederwerder

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). A PEDV field isolate (CT, GenBank Accession No. MK539948) from South China was propagated on Vero cells and the 10th generation of PEDV stock (6.0 Log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) was used for PEDV challenging in pigs. A total of 9 APN KO and 6 WT male Large White pigs at 30 days old were orally infected with 6 mL PEDV solution. The clinical sign of each pig was observed daily following the challenge. Diarrhea was assessed by fecal consistency level, which was scored as follows: 0 = solid, 1 = pasty, 2 = semiliquid, and 3 = liquid. A score of 2 or 3 was considered diarrheic. Fecal swabs of each challenged pig were collected at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14 to detect the viral shedding. The blood was drawn at PIDs 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 to isolate serum for antibody and viremia detection. Following infection, only a short period of diarrhea (2–3 days) was observed from portions of both WT and KO pigs, and no significant difference in clinical signs was found between the WT and APN KO pigs (Supplementary Table S4). Two APN KO pigs manifested consistent diarrhea and evident body weight loss, and died at PIDs 3 and 7, respectively. The other pigs remained active and maintained good bodily condition after the diarrhea resolved.
