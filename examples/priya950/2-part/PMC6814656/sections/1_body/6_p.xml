However, only one APN null pig was used in the PEDV challenge test and the results indicated that the APN null pig remained infected by PEDV. Given that APN plays a putative role as a receptor in PEDV infection, a detailed study should be undertaken to compare the difference in infection levels between WT and KO pigs to assess any resistance to PEDV conferred by APN ablation. Our results demonstrated that APN KO and WT pigs had similar clinical signs, fecal shedding and serum antibody levels, thereby excluding its role in PEDV infection. Nonetheless, APN has been identified as a functional receptor for multiple other coronaviruses (Li
