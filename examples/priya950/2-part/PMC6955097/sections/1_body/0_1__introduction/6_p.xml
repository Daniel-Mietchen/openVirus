<p>In an effort to gain important insights into the origin, molecular ecology, and transmission dynamics of FFV in wild and domestic felids, we undertook the first extensive molecular survey and genetic analyses of FFV in wild felids, focusing on puma from two geographically distinct regions in Colorado, USA. As top predators, there is accumulating evidence that this species is at higher risk for pathogen spillover from prey (

We additionally undertook a comparative analysis to understand broader host–virus dynamics, analyzing FFV sequences from free-ranging feral domestic cats from Colorado and Australia, and free-roaming pumas from Florida and California. Our analysis supports frequent cross-species transmission of FFV during the last century along with puma-to-puma transmission, resulting in wide distribution and high prevalence of FFV in Puma across Colorado. As a result of these virus–host dynamics FFV sequences derived from puma living in Colorado, California, and endangered Florida panthers share high levels of similarity to FFV from domestic cats and do not form distinct species clades phylogenetically.
