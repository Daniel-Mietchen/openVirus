<p>Of all the FVs, the primate FVs have been the most extensively researched to date, with several genetically distinct species groups having been identified in both Old World and New World primates. Phylogenetic analysis supports virus–host coevolution history, with additional evidence of occasional cross-species transmission mostly within the simian system (

Based on the notion that FVs have co-evolved with their hosts, long-term molecular clock investigation indicates primate FVs have a slower nucleotide substitution rate than other RNA viruses and are the slowest evolving RNA viruses documented (
