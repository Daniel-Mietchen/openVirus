<p>Phylogenetic analysis of Env proteins indicates two distinct clades denoting the two SU Env genotypes (Clades A and B; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Both SU Env genotypes were isolated from domestic cats and pumas, and were found in the WS and FR of Colorado, and globally among domestic cats. This indicates both genotypes are adapted to both species and frequently co-circulate in populations, thereby suggesting a synergistic relationship. The dominant presence of both genotypes circulating among both host species indicates that despite the high level of amino acid variability in this SU region, these genotypes are well adapted to both host species. This observation parallels recent studies of two unique Env SFV subtypes in non-human primates (

 <xref rid="vez058-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleiholder et al. 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that variance in SU allows the virus to utilize multiple receptors in a genotype-specific manner, or perhaps they have different cell tropisms relevant for the biology of FFV. Receptor interference studies however support that all FVs, despite having a broad host range, may gain viral entry via the same cell surface receptor (

 <xref rid="vez058-B5" ref-type="bibr">Berg et al. 2003</xref>). Cellular expression of a FV Env has been shown to induce superinfection resistance, thereby acting as a barrier to infection by other FV’s (

 <xref rid="vez058-B5" ref-type="bibr">Berg et al. 2003</xref>). This would indicate that the two FFV genotypes also utilize the same receptor; however, additional studies of this interesting phenomenon are warranted to further explore this.
