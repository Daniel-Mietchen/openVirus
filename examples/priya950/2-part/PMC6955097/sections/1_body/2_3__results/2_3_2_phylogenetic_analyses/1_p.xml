<p>The genetic relationship of FFV in puma compared with domestic cats in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees highlights a single virus–dual host dynamic which is clearly demonstrated in all three phylogenies representing Pol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Fig. 2</xref>), Env (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and the full genome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). There is strong evidence for transmission of FFV between FR and WS locations, though some subclades indicate regionally specific viral populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Figs 2 and 3</xref>). Domestic cat FFV isolates from the USA, internationally sourced isolates, and puma FFV isolates from Florida and California are interspersed throughout the trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Figs 2 and 3</xref>). The Pol protein phylogeny documents that internationally sourced domestic cat sequences, although interspersed, sit basal to puma and domestic cat isolates from Colorado (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This pattern was not indicated for Env; however, two SU clades are evident in the Env protein phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F3">Fig. 3</xref>); isolates with these two highly divergent SU regions were found to circulate in both host species and across locations globally.
