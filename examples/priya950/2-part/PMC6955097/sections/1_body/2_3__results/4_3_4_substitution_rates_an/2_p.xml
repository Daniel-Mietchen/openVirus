<p>Further BEAST analyses on only the

 <italic>env</italic> resulted in a lack of temporal signal), was used to investigate historical geographic movements, and host species transmission patterns. Four trends of FFV transmission were well supported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F5">Fig. 5</xref>): 1, domestic cat—FR puma (BF = 6, posterior probability = 0.84); 2, domestic cat—California puma (BF = 16, posterior probability = 0.93); 3, domestic cat—WS puma (BF = 1,155, posterior probability = 0.99); and 4, puma—puma transmission between individuals from the FR and WS (BF = 46,263, posterior probability = 1.0). Further, analysis of host transmission using an asymmetrical model of discrete trait transition (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) shows two supported trends of FFV transmission: puma to domestic cat (BF = 20, posterior probability = 0.99) and domestic cat to puma (BF = 8,155, posterior probability = 1). Supported nodes indicate that FFV has likely been present in Colorado at least 70 years. Four major clades are present, one which consists primarily of domestic cats, two primarily puma and a fourth that includes both domestic cats and puma from three sites in the USA (
