<p>Recombination analyses of 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> gene sequences from domestic cats and puma showed high levels of recombination in both open reading frames (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). A total of twelve events in 
 <italic>pol</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and eleven in 
 <italic>env</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) were strongly supported. Recombination events with inferred parental FFVs originating from both species were identified in 9/12 (75%) events in 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 8/11 (∼72%) events in 
 <italic>env</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> S2). Recombination breakpoint hot and cold spots were identified in both genes, including one hotspot in the 5′ region of 
 <italic>pol</italic>, a hotspot as well as a cold spot in the 5′ region of 
 <italic>env</italic>, and a hotspot in the SU region of 
 <italic>env</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F4">Fig. 4C and D</xref>).
