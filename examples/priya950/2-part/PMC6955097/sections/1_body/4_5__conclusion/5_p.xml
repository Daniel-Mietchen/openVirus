<p>Given its high prevalence, and the unlikelihood that FFV would be transmitted from puma to domestic cats (since the domestic cats are unlikely to survive such an encounter), FFV provides an interesting and unique viral ‘fingerprint’ that can map puma movements and augment studies of individual and population movements in this wide-ranging and secretive apex predator (

Although FVs evolve slowly, we document FFV substitution rates that are more rapid than predicted by previous FV mutation rate estimates. This may be due to adaptation to a new host species and pervasive inter- and intra-species transmission, and provides an opportunity to better study transmission events within and between species. The information gained here elucidating the evolution and cross-species transmission dynamics of a highly prevalent but apathogenic virus can be further applied to model more virulent disease, such as that caused by feline leukemia virus, which is a major threat to the endangered Florida panther (
