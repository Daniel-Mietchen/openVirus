<p>Interestingly, although identified in domestic cats and puma, a homologous genotype of FFV is not known to infect bobcats or Canada Lynx (
 <italic>Lynx canadensis</italic>), both of which have overlapping geographic ranges with puma, and it has been shown that bobcats will predate on domestic cats (
 <xref rid="vez058-B21" ref-type="bibr">Clark 2010</xref>). This suggests that species-specific immunological or innate factors may limit FFV. FFV is present in the unique wild felid species which inhabits the island of Iriomote, Japan, an island that has been geographically isolated for 200,000 years (

More extensive molecular investigations into FFV infecting other wild felid species globally would shed further light on the evolutionary history of what is believed to be one of the oldest known exogenous vertebrate RNA virus families (
