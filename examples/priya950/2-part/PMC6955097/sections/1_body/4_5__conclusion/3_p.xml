 <xref rid="vez058-B46" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>), the phylogeny of FFV sequences displays little geographic structure. Interestingly, here we see domestic cat derived FFV sequences are interspersed throughout the phylogenetic trees, and are situated either basal to, or clustered within, clades comprised of both domestic cat and puma isolates from the USA. Further, internationally derived FFV domestic cat sequences from Europe or Australia are also sporadically located across the phylogenetic tree. This pattern is most easily explained by owners relocating with their pet cats and/or historical trade movements where cats were dispersed for the purpose of rodent control, both domestically and globally (

 <xref rid="vez058-B65" ref-type="bibr">Ottoni et al. 2017</xref>). Well-supported BF movements are congruent with a co-circulating history in these two host species, and strongly suggest that domestic cats may be an important factor for ‘seeding’ FFV into puma populations, followed by subsequent spread from puma to puma (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Genetic and historical records indicate the introduction of domestic cats to the New World occurred with early European settlers ∼1,600 (
 <xref rid="vez058-B51" ref-type="bibr">Lipinski et al. 2008</xref>). It is thought that settlers brought domestic cats to Colorado during the Pike’s Peak gold rush of 1,858, and were well-established in the state by the 1870s (
 <xref rid="vez058-B75" ref-type="bibr">Ross 2016</xref>). In the early to mid-1900s, puma abundance throughout Colorado declined to a few hundred individuals, primarily due to unrestricted hunting and predator control. From 1965 to present, human-caused mortality in pumas was restricted (
 <xref rid="vez058-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2010</xref>), and as a result the puma population in Colorado have grown from as low as a few hundred in 1965 to a few thousand adult and sub-adult pumas (

 <xref rid="vez058-B4" ref-type="bibr">Apker 2017</xref>). When puma numbers were low, interactions between pumas and domestic cats would consequently be limited. Increases in free-ranging puma populations, concurrent with increases in domestic cat ownership have likely influenced prevalence trends recorded here that are congruent with general indications of FFV phylogenetic analysis. The very high level of contemporary FFV infection/movement among pumas indicates rapid fixation in the population. A similar pattern has been seen for other pathogens, such as the ∼1980 canine parvovirus pandemic, illustrating that a very contagious pathogen that does not cause high morbidity can rapidly become endemic (
