<p>This study provides the first large-scale molecular analysis of FFV infection in a free-ranging wild felid, and presents an in-depth investigation of the viral dynamics and evolution within puma populations in comparison to domestic cats. We document a remarkably high number of puma infected with FFV (including sequences from California, Colorado, and Florida), approximating or exceeding seroprevalence rates in domestic cats (

 <xref rid="vez058-B68" ref-type="bibr">Phung et al. 2001</xref>). Interestingly, phylogeny indicates that FFV from domestic cats readily infects pumas suggesting limited innate or adaptive immune barriers exist to prohibit FFV cross-species transmission between these hosts. Further, the differing phylogenetic patterns between Pol and Env maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees indicate a complex and dynamic evolutionary history (
