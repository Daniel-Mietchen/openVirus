<p>A total of 169 Colorado puma samples (71 from the FR and 98 from the WS) were screened for FFV proviral DNA using methods outlined in 
 <xref rid="vez058-B48" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2017b</xref>) using a specific quantitative real-time (q)PCR screening protocol. The following protocol was used; 5 µl of iTaq™ Universal probe supermix (Bio-Rad, USA), 1 µl FFVgag F (10 µM) 5′-GGACGATCTCAACAAGGTCAACTAAA-3′, 1 µl FFVgag R (10 µM) 5′-TCCACGAGGAGGTTGCGA-3′, 0.2 µl FFVgag probe (10 µM), 5.8 µl sterile distilled water and 2 µl DNA (30–100 ng) template. DNA samples were run in triplicate alongside negative controls (DNA from known FFV negative domestic cats), positive controls (DNA from known experimentally infected FFV domestic cats), and plasmid dilution standards of 10
 <sup>6</sup>–10
 <sup>1</sup> copies in duplicates. Reactions were run on a CFX Connect real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) using the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 3 min followed by forty cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 40 s (
