<p>We evaluated the effects of sex (male/female) and age (young/adult) on FFV infection in pumas using Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), with location as a random effect, and sex, and age as fixed effects. Models tested whether a puma was qPCR negative or positive for FFV as a function of sex, age, and an interaction between sex and age. Using non-informative priors, models ran for 50,000 iterations, after a burn-in of 10,000 iterations and thinning of 10, yielding 4,000 values to derive parameter posterior means. Convergence was assessed visually by comparing the posterior distributions of multiple runs of each model. GLMM model weights and averaged coefficients were also calculated to examine the effect sizes of variables. All statistics were implemented in Program R (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) version 3.3.3, using the ‘MCMCglmm’ package for the GLMMs (
