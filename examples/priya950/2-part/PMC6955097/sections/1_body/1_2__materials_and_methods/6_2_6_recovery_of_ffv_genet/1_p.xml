<p>Proviral sequences were recovered from a total of eighty-seven samples from Colorado pumas which were qPCR FFV positive. From these full genomes were isolated from twenty-eight individuals, and the 
 <italic>pol</italic> and/or 
 <italic>env</italic> gene regions from the remaining fifty-eight (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Due to low DNA quantity, DNA degradation, or sample availability, these genetic regions (
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> gene) could not be recovered from the remaining qPCR positive pumas. Additionally, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> gene sequences were amplified from three puma samples from Florida which were previously identified as FFV positive either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or qPCR. Proviral sequences were recovered from nineteen domestic cat samples from Colorado and Australia. Six full genomes from Colorado domestic cats. FFV 
 <italic>pol</italic> was recovered from an additional eleven Colorado cats, and 
 <italic>env</italic> also was recovered from eight of these cats. FFV 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences from two domestic cats from Australia and three Florida panthers were also recovered and used in this analysis (
