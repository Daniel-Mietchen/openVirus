 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The Front Range (FR) is situated along the wildland–urban interface west of the city of Boulder, where animals were sampled as part of a study evaluating puma-human interactions. The Western Slope (WS) is a largely wildland/rural area on the Uncompahgre plateau near the towns of Montrose and Ridgway, where pumas were studied to evaluate impacts of hunting on population dynamics. Samples were collected 2007–13 in the FR and 2005–14 in the WS. Florida puma samples (whole blood) were collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in an ongoing study to survey health and population management efforts.
