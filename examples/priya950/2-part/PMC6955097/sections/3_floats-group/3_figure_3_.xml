  <p>Env protein maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicates FFV does not exhibit strong host or geographic structure. Clades A and B of FFV Env isolates are circulating in both host species and across locations broadly. Isolate names in bold font were sequenced in this study and font color indicates host species (light blue, domestic cat; dark blue, puma). Location information is marked by colored squares on the periphery of the tree (red, FR, Colorado; yellow, WS, Colorado; blue, Florida; purple, California; Brown, State unknown; dark green, Japan; light green, Australia). The two Env SU Clades A and B are highlighted.</p>
