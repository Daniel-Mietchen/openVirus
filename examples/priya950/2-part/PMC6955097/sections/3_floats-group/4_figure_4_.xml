  <p>Recombination is common in genomes of domestic cat and puma FFV. Recombination analyses of FFV of (A) pol and (B) env sequences. Gene region is displayed at the top of each analyses for reference and recombinant regions depicted for each event below Host species origin of recombinant is indicated by color of recombinant names (light blue, domestic cat; dark blue, puma) and host species origin of minor parental sequence, single—puma or domestic cat or both—puma and domestic cat, by shading of recombinant region (black, single; gray, both). Number of individuals with recombinant sequences is shown following host and region name (C) Breakpoint frequency plot highlights recombination breakpoint hotspot in the 5′ of pol. (D) Graphic highlights recombination breakpoint hotspots, in the 5′ and SU region, and coldspot in the 5′ region of env.</p>
