  <p>FFV from circulates in both domestic cats and puma. Domestic cat FFV Pol protein sequences are interspersed throughout the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, and cluster closely to FFV isolated from pumas. Isolate names in bold font were sequenced in this study and font color indicates host species, light blue domestic cat and dark blue puma. Location information is marked by colored squares on the periphery of the tree (red, FR, Colorado; yellow, WS, Colorado; blue, Florida; purple, California; brown, State unknown; dark green, Japan; light green, Australia) and demographic information on the branch tips (black, adult; gray, juvenile; white, unknown age and square, male; circle, female; triangle, unknown).</p>
