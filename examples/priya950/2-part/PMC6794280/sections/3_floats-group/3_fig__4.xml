Countries with the most EBOV infected individuals imported are represented in yellow with darker green, then blue, coloured countries having proportional fewer importations and dark blue showing zero importations and the EVD endemic area. Data come from 2500 simulations of EVD outbreaks under present data climate, land-use, demographic and transportation conditions</p>
