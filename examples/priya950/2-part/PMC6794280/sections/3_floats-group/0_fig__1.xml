 <caption>
  <p>System-dynamics model of zoonotic disease transmission. Letters 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold> indicate major system components, arrows showing links, and key sub-components in smaller font. Within the global physical environment (
   <bold>a</bold>), both the host niche (
   <bold>b</bold>) and infected host niche (
   <bold>c</bold>) are nested subsets, which all vary over a relatively slow time-scale. Endemic human populations are nested within the global human population (
   <bold>e</bold>), with human socio-economic factors (
   <bold>g</bold>) affecting all human populations. Spill-overs happen in the fast-moving spatial and temporal interface of these two nested systems (
   <bold>d</bold>), where both infected hosts, susceptible people and spill-over specific factors occur, resulting in infected human populations (
   <bold>f</bold>)
