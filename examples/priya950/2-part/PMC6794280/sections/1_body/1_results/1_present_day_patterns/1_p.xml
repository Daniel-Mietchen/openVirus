<p id="Par8">Our EMM simulation for present day EBOV-EVD risk correctly identified areas of observed outbreaks as high risk, such as Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and the 2013–2016 outbreak in West Africa, but also identified some areas where EVD has not been reported, including most countries in West and Central Africa, especially Nigeria and Ghana (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Our model outputs predict the observed pattern of outbreaks with high accuracy (AUC = 0.83 ± 0.012–95% confidence interval (CI) from 10,000 repetitions of 1000 random pseudo-absences), which is significantly higher than 10,000 randomised versions of the risk surface (AUC = 0.53 ± 0.028–95% CI), a pattern which held irrespective of how the endemic area was defined (Supplementary Fig.

Since the modelling exercise was run in 2018, our model has successfully predicted subsequent outbreaks (Equateur &amp; Kivu provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo) and indicate they occurred in areas at high risk of larger size (1500+ cases) outbreaks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Our predictions also replicate the pattern where outbreaks in the Gabon hotspot are likely to be smaller in terms of total case size, with those in the east and west having the potential for larger outbreak sizes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Our modelling approach, which focuses on establishing the fundamental conditions where EBOV could reasonably spill-over, without using case data, provides further support that the at-risk area for EBOV-EVD spill-overs to occur (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Central African Republic, Ruanda, Burundi, Kenya and Tanzania) is much larger than the area made up of just those countries that have reported disease outbreaks thus far. We note that our risk map also identified high-risk areas that are endemic for the other EVD strains, likely due to similar transmission pathways and reservoir host characteristics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). When comparing the mean number of spill-overs across Africa per year, present day simulations were higher (2.464 spill-overs per year 95% CI 2.361–2.567) than the mean historical number over the last 40 years: 0.75 (95% CI 0.695–0.905), reflecting the increase in human population in these regions during this time period. High risk of Ebola case importation outside Africa, using the current network of airline flights, was seen in China, Russia, India, the United States as well as many high-income European countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), a similar pattern to the importations seen during the 2014–2016 outbreak (United States, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom). (Fig.
