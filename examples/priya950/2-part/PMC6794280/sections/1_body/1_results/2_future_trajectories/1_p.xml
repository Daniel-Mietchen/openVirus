<p id="Par10">Our future EMM simulations suggest that, in most scenarios, given current projected patterns of global change, there will be a general, ongoing increase in Ebola incidence over time. For example, we estimate an annual increase in the maximum area impacted by the disease from 3.45 million km
 <sup>2</sup> to 3.8 million km
 <sup>2</sup> under the worst-case scenario by 2070, with increases in the maximum area seen under all future scenarios. The maximum area where just spill-overs could occur, however, increased by just 1% under the GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP1 (High Climate Mitigation + Sustainable Development: 2.01 million km
 <sup>2</sup>), when compared to present day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>: 1.99 million km
 <sup>2</sup>), but increased by 14.7% from present day under the MESSAGE-RCP8.5 SSP3 (Business as Usual Emissions + Regional Rivalry Development: 2.29 million km
 <sup>2</sup>) scenario. Conversely, the total area where epidemics could start decreased under the GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP1 by 47% (0.444 million km
 <sup>2</sup>), when compared to present day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>: 0.836 million km
 <sup>2</sup>), but again increases under AIM-RCP6.0 SSP2 (Low Climate Mitigation + Middle of the Road Development) this time by 20.5%, and then by 34% under the MESSAGE-RCP8.5 SSP3 scenario. Country-level patterns showed a trend of a general decrease in EVD risk for the better-case scenarios (e.g. High Climate Mitigation + Sustainable Development) towards an increase in risk, under the worst scenarios (e.g. Business as Usual Emissions + Regional Rivalry Development), with this pattern especially pronounced in West Africa (Fig.
