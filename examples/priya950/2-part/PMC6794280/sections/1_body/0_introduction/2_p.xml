<p id="Par4">Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first identified in 1976, and since then there have been ~23 recognized outbreaks

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, predominantly within central Africa. EVD is caused by any one of four pathogenic strains of Ebola virus: Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Ta√Ø Forest (TAFV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV). It presents as a non-specific febrile illness that can cause haemorrhagic fever, often with a high case fatality rate in diagnosed patients

 </sup>, however, while there is limited direct evidence, they are strong candidates to play a key role either as a reservoir or amplifying host

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. In areas with EVD, there are frequent direct and indirect human-bat interactions, e.g., via bush meat hunting and during fruit harvesting

 </sup>, presenting numerous opportunities for bat-to-human pathogen spill-overs to occur. Additionally, a third of known zoonotic spill-overs have been connected to contact with great apes and duikers, although there is no evidence that these species act as reservoir hosts

 </sup>. It is clear, however, that once spill-over occurs human social factors such as movement and healthcare responses greatly influence the cumulative outcome of an outbreak
