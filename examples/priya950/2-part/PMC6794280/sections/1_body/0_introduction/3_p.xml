<p id="Par5">Many attempts to understand Ebola outbreak dynamics have focused on mechanistic modelling approaches of human-to-human transmission post spill-over from animal hosts

 </sup>. One downside is that mechanistic models of zoonoses often do not incorporate spatially heterogeneous ecological and environmental information, such as the environmental differences leading to variation in host suitability

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. In this context, correlative, or pattern-based, models (e.g., MaxEnt, Boosted-Regression Trees) have been used to simultaneously capture the spatial risk of both zoonotic spill-over and subsequent human-to-human infection

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, but few studies have considered whole-system analyses for major epidemic zoonoses across the whole endemic disease area. Like other rare or poorly-sampled diseases, Ebola suffers from limited data availability, meaning approaches using pattern-finding, correlative analytical techniques to find robust models are at a disadvantage
