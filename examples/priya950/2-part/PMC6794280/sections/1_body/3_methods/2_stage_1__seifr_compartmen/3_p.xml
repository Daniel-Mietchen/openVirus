<p id="Par21">(b) Force of Infection, λ. The force of infection for human-to-human transmission 
 <italic>λ</italic> per time step 
 <italic>t</italic>, was estimated as the product of the effective contact rate 
 <italic>β</italic>, and the number of individuals that can transmit the disease in each relevant compartment (‘Infectious’ and ‘Funeral’) per grid cell (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We assumed that 
 <italic>β</italic> for the Infectious and Funeral compartments was equivalent, due to the simplicity of the movement model used as we would not be able to reasonably differentiate between the two compartments and maintain computational efficiency. Indeed, with the contact rates of moving individuals from the Infectious compartment being offset by aggregations of individuals at funerals it is not clear if there would be a large difference when approximated using a gas model. We estimated the effective contact rate 
 <italic>β</italic>, as the basic reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> divided by the product of the total number of individuals 
 <italic>N</italic>, and infectious duration 
 <italic>D</italic> (the sum of Infectious and Funeral compartment time, 11 days taken from
 <sup>

 </sup>). As a starting value for R
 <sub>0</sub> we used a value of 1.7
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup> and this was allowed to vary per simulation run using the same method as for the compartmental transmission parameters above. As per previous research
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, we incorporated spatial variance in contact rates among grid cells using a weighting factor 
 <italic>m</italic>, whereby the effective contact rate in grid cells with greater than expected contact rates was increased and decreased where fewer contacts were predicted (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We estimated 
 <italic>m</italic> by creating an ideal free gas model of human movement within each grid cell and approximated collision frequency per person per day, using the following: the total individuals in each grid cell (estimated from Gridded Population of the World v3
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup>, an individual interaction sphere of radius 0.5 m, and the per person, daily walking distances in metres 
 <italic>vΔt</italic>, where 
 <italic>v</italic> is walking velocity, and 
 <italic>Δt</italic> equals time period (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). To capture geographic variation in human movement patterns, each grid cell was assigned a value for per person daily walking distance, based on the empirical relationship between daily walking distances and per person per country Gross Domestic Product (measured as Purchasing Power Parity from
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). As the availability of mass transit as an alternative to walking tends to be centrally controlled, we assumed that grid cells in each country had the same value.
