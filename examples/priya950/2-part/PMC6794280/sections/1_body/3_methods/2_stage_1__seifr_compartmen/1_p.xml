To incorporate sensitivity around these transmission parameters, we allowed values to vary for each simulation run by sampling from a Gaussian distribution where the mean was their initial value and the standard deviation was fifth of the mean, to give a reasonable spread of values. For each time step 
 <italic>t</italic>, the number of individuals moving between all compartments was estimated by drawing randomly from a binomial distribution (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), parameterized using the respective compartmental transition rates. Transition rates for compartments were assumed to be the same in all grid cells except for the transition between Susceptible to Exposed. The per grid cell Susceptible to Exposed transition rates were determined by the force of zoonotic infection
