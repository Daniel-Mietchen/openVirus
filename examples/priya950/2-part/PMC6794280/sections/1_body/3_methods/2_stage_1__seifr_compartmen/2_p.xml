 <italic>t</italic>, was estimated as the product of the probability of host presence

 <italic>κ</italic> (Supplementary Equation

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>, we parameterized 
 <italic>H</italic> by calculating the spatial probability of the presence of the most likely EBOV reservoir host species based on available data (Old World fruit bat species 
 <italic>Epomophorus gambianus gambianus, Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) within each grid cell across the African continent using species distribution models (SDMs)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> and assuming constant pathogen prevalence. We also calculated the spatial probability of the presence of other species which are known to provide an alternative route of infection, but likely do not act as reservoirs (
 <italic>Gorilla spp</italic>., 
 <italic>Pan spp., and Cephalophus spp</italic>.)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. SDMs for each species were inferred using boosted regression trees (BRT) using distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup> and 11 present day bioclimatic and land use variables (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Data with coarse scale GBIF spatial coordinates (decimal degree coordinates with less than four decimal places) were filtered out of the analysis. To reduce spatial autocorrelation and duplicate records, any records that co-occurred in the same grid cell were removed. Lastly, GBIF records older than 1990 were discarded to ensure samples more closely matched the current landscapes. BRT tree complexity was set at 5 reflecting the suggested value and the learning rate was adjusted until &gt;1000 trees were selected
 <sup>

 </sup>. A total of 25 models were estimated for each species using four-fifths of the distribution data as a training dataset and one fifth as a testing dataset, chosen randomly for each model. Those with the highest predictive ability (high area under operating curve, AUC—all models AUC &gt; 0.9) were selected as the best model for each species (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The most important spatial variables determining distributions across the different reservoir host species were BIO7 Temperature Annual Range, BIO13 Precipitation of Wettest Month, BIO2 Mean Diurnal Temperature Range and Land Use-Land Cover (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The outputs from all putative reservoir (bat) species were combined into a single value representing the probability of any reservoir species being present and a similar approach was taken for the non-reservoir host species. First, we assume that complete mixing occurs within each grid cell and that if secondary host species are present in a cell they meet the presumed primary hosts. Then we calculate one minus the probability of each host presence, multiplied across all species, giving us the probability of there being no species present in any given cell. One minus this value gives the probability of at least one species being present. We assumed that bats were the default, fundamental component for transmission (i.e., acting as the ‘working’ reservoir) and, given complete mixing in each cell, apes and duikers were a secondary, less common route of human infection. Since roughly a third of index cases have been attributed to ape/duiker host spill-overs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, in cells with both groups we down-weighted the probability of the ape/duiker occurrence by two thirds and reservoir occurrence by one third when combining the two lots of layers together, though, we note, due to the similar habitat requirements a very high majority of the cells containing duikers and apes also had high probability for bats so the precise value here will have a limited impact. The final resulting probability was bounded by zero and one. Additionally, as EBOV presence in non-reservoir host species is impossible without the presence of reservoir hosts, cells with a reservoir host probability of zero were given a value of zero irrespective of the non-reservoir host score. For computational simplicity, we assume that all human individuals have equal chance of exposure to infected host species. The initial value used for spill-over rate 
 <italic>κ</italic>, per time step 
 <italic>t</italic>, was estimated from the number of historic outbreaks 
 <italic>O</italic> (defined here as distinct clusters of cases) taken from empirical EBOV outbreak data
