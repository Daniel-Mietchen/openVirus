<p id="Par18">Focusing on the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), we use a stochastic epidemiological compartmental model

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Within grid cells (0.0416°—5.6 km at equator) covering continental Africa, we used a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Funeral and Removed (SEIFR) EVD-EBOV disease compartmental model following

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>, adding this complexity was not feasible over large and poorly known geographical areas. Without knowing more about the spatial variation in health seeking behaviour, exactly which grid cells contain clinics, and the variation of healthcare resources in these clinics, adding in this compartment would not likely significantly improve our model’s ability to predict the progression of outbreaks. Furthermore, hospital interventions had the least impact controlling EVD outbreaks in a recent meta-analysis (24). Grid cell size was chosen as the highest resolution at which computation was feasible while being able to use a non-stochastic human movement model to approximate contacts per cell (see details below). All mapping and analyses were carried out in R v.3.2.2
