<p id="Par26">(c) Comparison of simulation runs. We reran the EMM simulations under 5 plausible combinations of 2070 future environmental and socio-economic scenarios of global change and greenhouse gas concentrations, matching greater greenhouse gas emissions to less progressive and less cooperative socio-economic scenarios as follows: GCAM-RCP4.5/SSP1 (High Climate Mitigation + Sustainable Development), GCAM-RCP4.5/SSP2 (High Climate Mitigation + Middle of the Road Development), AIM-RCP6.0/SSP2 (Low Climate Mitigation + Middle of the Road Development), AIM-RCP6.0/SSP3 (Low Climate Mitigation + Regional Rivalry Development), MESSAGE-RCP8.5/SSP3 (Business as Usual Emissions + Regional Rivalry Development)

 </sup>. For each of the six scenarios we aimed for 2500 runs of 365 days, each day measuring the number of spill-overs, the number of secondary cases associated with each spill-over, and the geographical areas affected. This allowed us to measure likelihood of spill-overs leading to small, medium and very large outbreaks, and also to determine the geographical areas with the highest risk of experiencing cases. We also noted the destination of any flights out of Africa that contained infected people.
