 </sup> for present day and multiplying each cell by the expected future proportional change over that time period predicted by three Shared Socio-economic Pathways: SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3. Specifically, these pathways represent: (i) SSP1 (Sustainable Development)—high regional cooperation, low population growth due high education and high GDP growth, (ii) SSP2 (Middle of the Road Development)—a ‘processes as usual’ scenario with ongoing levels of population growth and wealth, with medium estimates for both these by 2070, and (iii) SSP3 (Regional Rivalry Development)—regional antagonism, high population growth, unsustainable resource extraction and low economic growth. Future poverty estimates per country were similarly inferred using a spatially-disaggregated GDP layer

We note that as our travel probability is defined per person, increasing future populations will see a proportional increase in the amount of both road and air travel, though with unknown patterns of future trade and travel we kept the travel network the same shape.
