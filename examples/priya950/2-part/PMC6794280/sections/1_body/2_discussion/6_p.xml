<p id="Par17">Our approach demonstrates not only an important framework for understanding Ebola but also for other diseases, given our modelling framework is disease agnostic and flexible in terms of compartment model structure, transmission location and scale. Analysing diseases singly, and within just an epidemiological or socio-economic framework, cannot be an effective approach for policy making at a large geopolitical scale, particularly in regions with multi-disease burden and limited healthcare resources. Net disease risk patterns, when summed across a wide variety of zoonoses, will be an emergent property of the distribution of very different wildlife host species and their respective responses to increasing anthropogenic land-use conversion and climate change. Any lack of data in the short-term does not reduce the obvious importance of understanding future disease trends. Interdisciplinary methods, such as ours, establish a first heuristic step on a pathway towards building tools to devise future-proof intervention measures aimed at reducing overall future disease burden.</p>
