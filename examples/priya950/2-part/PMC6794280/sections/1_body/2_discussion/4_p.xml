<p id="Par15">To further improve our model, we would need to better understand the spatial variation in other key disease transmission parameters. For instance, bush-meat hunting is an important process by which human populations come into contact with large bats

 </sup> and the spatial variation in bush-meat extraction is likely a component of spillÂ over variation. Little is known, however, about bush-meat hunting outside a few specific studies, but there is potential to use spatial interpolation techniques to make reasonable predictions in unsampled areas. Our model does not incorporate this data or test its impact and, similarly due to lack of data resources, we do not use information about local differences in funeral practices. Hospital compartments are thought to be useful to understand quarantine and super-spreading events, but there is very limited data on the quality and geographic reach of small and temporary-response health clinics. Some other important behavioural trends are not captured in our model, such as the post-outbreak behavioural reactions of human populations e.g. mass migration away from affected regions, or, avoidance of clinics and treatment centres due to transmission fears. Recent findings regarding the persistence of Ebola virus in semen of convalescent men may also help explain the intermittent spatiotemporal patterns of infections in endemic areas

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. Future work incorporating such data, may further improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of risk estimates.
