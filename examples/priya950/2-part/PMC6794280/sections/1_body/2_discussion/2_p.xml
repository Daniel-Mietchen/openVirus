<p id="Par13">We identify Nigeria (but also Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda) as not only a key area for epidemics to be initiated, but also an area with potential for many small outbreaks, somewhat contradicting analyses based on current case data

 </sup>. Our finding could indicate that our underlying model has not correctly balanced the impact of healthcare infrastructure on disease spread, that there are regional behavioural barriers to infection, or that there are strong regional differences in effective contact rates between both humans and hosts. Ebola outbreaks are rare, but potentially high-impact events, and our experience of endemic health care systems being challenged by EVD cases is, as yet, limited to a handful of data points, meaning it is unclear what the true relationship is between health investment and EVD risk reduction. For Nigeria, therefore, though we may be underestimating the role of the health infrastructure

 </sup>, given just a single replication of Ebola importation it would be unwise to assume the same outcome every time, especially given the thousands of different potential transport routes for infected people into Nigeria. An extreme discontinuity in theÂ spatial distribution of Ebola virus seroprevalence or pathogenicity of competing strains in Nigeria, and surrounding countries, could explain the observed lower-risk pattern, but it would be prudent to prove this is the case using extensive bio-molecular surveys. Certainly, the seroprevalence of Ebola virus in wildlife species is a key missing dataset that could substantially aid future understanding of this disease. Until these additional factors are explicitly tested, we believe the high human density and known presence of putative wildlife hosts means that all the at-risk areas we present here should remain as candidate locations for outbreaks. As an illustrative example, we recover Guinea as being at high risk of large outbreaks but if our outputs were, for instance, validated against data prior to 2013 it would appear a false prediction.
