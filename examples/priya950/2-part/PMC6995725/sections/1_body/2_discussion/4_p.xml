<p>Diseases mainly suspected in our patients before identification of HPIV-1 via multiplex PCR testing were primary influenza virus pneumonia and COP, respectively. A previous study reported that viral pneumonia is frequently misdiagnosed as COP (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the differentiation of these diseases, sore throat is a more frequent symptom of viral pneumonia than of acute interstitial lung diseases including COP (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and our patients both had sore throats. However, typical symptoms in adult patients with HPIV infection include fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and a sore throat, which do not clinically distinguish it from other respiratory viruses (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Cunha et al. reported that the clinical presentation of HPIV pneumonia closely mimics H1N1 pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Chest CT findings in our patients included bronchial wall thickening, bilateral consolidations, and GGOs, which were compatible with typical CT findings of HPIV pneumonia, e.g., multifocal patchy consolidation with GGOs, and centrilobular nodules with bronchial wall thickening (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); however, these findings seem nonspecific for HPIV pneumonia. Pokharel et al. reported multinucleated giant cells with organizing pneumonia as findings suggestive of HPIV infection (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), but the sensitivity and specificity of the pathologic findings were not known and these findings were not present in our patients. Thus, it is important to include viral infections in the differential diagnosis and investigate respiratory specimens with viral PCR tests. HPIV causes epidemics during the spring season or a small secondary period of increased activity in the fall, and thus seasonality and local epidemiology may be clues suggestive of HPIV pneumonia.
