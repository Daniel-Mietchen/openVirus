<p>Most HPIV infections in adults cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, but the elderly or those with a compromised immune system are associated with progressive disease (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). HPIV is responsible for 1 to 15% of acute respiratory illnesses in adults. In other studies, 0.2 to 11.5% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia were found to have HPIV infection (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, HPIV is present in 7.6% of severe pneumonias, which indicates that HPIV is a frequent pathogen of both non-severe and severe pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, previous reports that investigated virus infections in patients with pneumonia used nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs to detect viruses, which raises the possibility of upper respiratory tract infection by HPIV. Furthermore, these studies include mixed viral and bacterial infections, and the clinical characteristics of the immunocompetent patients with primary HPIV pneumonia are not fully known. In our two cases, HPIV was detected in BAL fluid, which indicated the HPIV in our cases to be a pathogen of not the upper airways but the lower respiratory tract and of pneumonia. In addition, BAL fluid did not yield other significant pathogens, nor did specific antibody titers against other pathogens of pneumonia in paired sera increase, which support the diagnosis of primary HPIV infection in our patients.
