<p>A 66-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cough, sputum, and sore throat of 3 weeks duration in May. She initially visited a local physician who detected abnormal shadows on her chest X-ray and then referred her to our hospital. She had not received any antibiotics before presenting to our hospital. She had a history of gastric carcinoma when she was 61 years old and had undergone gastrectomy. Her cancer had not recurred. She was an ex-smoker with Brinkman index of 880, but she had never been exposed to dust. On admission, her vital signs included a body temperature of 36.4℃, respiratory rate of 22/min, systolic blood pressure of 116 mmHg, and heart rate of 65 beats per min. Chest auscultation showed bilateral coarse crackles. An arterial blood gas analysis under ambient air showed a pH of 7.48, PaCO
 <sub>2</sub> of 34.9 Torr, PaO
 <sub>2</sub> of 99.3 Torr, and HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> of 25.2 mmol/L. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 5,700/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (neutrophils, 59.9%; lymphocytes, 31.9%; eosinophils, 3.4%; basophils, 0.4%; and monocytes, 4.4%), hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, platelets of 24.6×10
 <sup>4</sup>/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, AST of 23 IU/L, LDH of 215 IU/L, creatinine of 0.53 mg/dL, CRP of 0.3 mg/dL, and KL-6 of 328 U/mL. Autoantibodies were negative, as was an anti-HIV antibody test. Rapid nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal diagnostic tests for influenza virus and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and urinary antigen tests for 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. were all negative. Chest X-ray showed bilateral consolidation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g003">Fig. 3a</xref>), and chest computed tomography showed non-segmental and subpleural consolidation bilaterally in the lower lobes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). No centrilobular pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy was detected. We performed bronchoscopy and BAL from the lateral segment of the right lower lobe. BAL fluid (70 of 150 mL recovered) showed 1.6×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (neutrophils, 3.3%; lymphocytes, 35.9%; macrophages, 54.5%; and eosinophils, 6.3%) but did not show any microorganisms by Gram staining or yield significant pathogens including 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>. Cytology of the BAL fluid also showed no significant findings. We could not obtain adequate specimens for evaluation via transbronchial lung biopsy. We initially suspected her of having cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and administered prednisolone 20 mg daily. Her chest shadows gradually improved, and she was discharged on HD 9. We analyzed the BAL fluid with multiplex PCR, which showed positive results only for HPIV-1. Specific antibody titers against 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic>, 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp., influenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus in paired sera did not increase, but antibodies against HPIV were not measured. We then gradually tapered the prednisolone and stopped it two months after hospital discharge. At four years since her treatment, she has not developed a relapse.
