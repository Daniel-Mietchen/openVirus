<p>A 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with appetite loss and fever in March. On the first day of illness, she initially developed appetite loss, and on the second day, she developed a fever of 37.7℃. On the fourth day, she developed dyspnea, sore throat, and cough, and on the ffth day, she presented to a local physician who found abnormal shadows on chest X-ray and referred her to our hospital. She had no noteworthy past history. She was a never-smoker and was never exposed to dust. On admission, her vital signs included a body temperature of 37.8℃, respiratory rate of 20/min, systolic blood pressure of 119 mmHg, and heart rate of 90 beats per min. Chest auscultation showed bilateral coarse crackles. An arterial blood gas analysis under O
 <sub>2</sub> of 4 L/min by nasal canula showed a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO
 <sub>2</sub>) of 31.6 Torr, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) of 70.9 Torr, and HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> of 25.3 mmol/L. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 8,100/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (neutrophils, 78.3%; lymphocytes, 10.7%; eosinophils, 2.4%; basophils, 0.4%; and monocytes, 8.2%), hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelets of 23.0×10
 <sup>4</sup>/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 56 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 253 IU/L, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 1.7 mg/dL, and procalcitonin of 0.090 ng/mL. Her Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) level was 1,096 U/mL. Autoantibodies were all negative, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was also negative. Rapid nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal diagnostic tests for influenza virus and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and urinary antigen tests for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. were all negative. Chest X-ray showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">Fig. 1b and c</xref>). Pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy were not found. We performed bronchoscopy and the BAL procedure from the internal segment of the right middle lobe. BAL fluid (85 of 150 mL recovered) showed 3.5×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (neutrophils, 1.6%; lymphocytes, 62.0%; macrophages, 32.0%; and eosinophils, 4.4%) but did not show any microorganisms by Gram staining or yield significant pathogens including 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> or 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. Cytology of the BAL fluid showed no significant findings. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed alveolitis, fibrin exudation, and intraluminal organization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Blood culture was negative. We suspected her of having influenza-associated pneumonia and started ampicillin/sulbactam and peramivir. Her chest shadows gradually improved, and her fever abated on hospital day (HD) 6. Oxygen by nasal canula was stopped on HD 10, and she was discharged on HD 16. Specific antibody titers against 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. psittaci</italic>, 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> spp., influenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus in paired sera did not increase, but antibodies against HPIV were not measured. We analyzed the BAL fluid with multiplex PCR, which showed positive results only for HPIV-1. Two years after discharge, she has not relapsed.
