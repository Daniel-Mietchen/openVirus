<p>Influenza A strains representative of previous epidemics (H1N1-pre and H3N2-pre) and those representative of emerging influenza strains collected during the interepidemic period before the 2018/2019 winter influenza season (H1N1-inter and H3N2-inter) were chosen based on genetic and antigenic data that are publicly available. These include the antigenic data published by the World Health Organisation [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the genetic information available at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The amino acid sequences were aligned using FAMSA [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The nucleotide sequences of A/HK/412489/2016, A/HK/439315/2018 and A/HK/417610/2018 have been deposited on the GISAID EpiFlu database under accession numbers EPI1331036-EPI1331038.
