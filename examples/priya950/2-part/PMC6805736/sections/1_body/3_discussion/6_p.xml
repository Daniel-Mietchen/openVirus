<p>Other groups have developed models to predict the predominant influenza virus subtype in the upcoming influenza season. These models are based on the evolution rate, or specific mutations in the HA [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The addition of serosurveillance data using emerging strains in the interepidemic period may strengthen these models.
