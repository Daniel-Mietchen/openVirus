<p>In summary, our results have demonstrated significant antigenic changes in the interepidemic emerging A(H1N1) virus, which was the virus subtype that predominated the 2018/2019 influenza season in Hong Kong. Our results support the use of human serum panels and MN assay in determining antigenic changes which are relevant to the human population, but further studies are required to assess whether this method is generalisable.</p>
