<p>Our result is in stark contrast with the results using post-infection ferret antisera. According to the World Health Organisation and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, there was no significant antigenic difference between old and circulating strains of A(H1N1) as determined by ferret antisera [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, there was a significant reduction in ferret serum neutralisation titer against the circulating A(H3N2) genetic clade 3C.2a1b when compared with that clade 3C.2a2 [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several reasons may account for the difference. First, our study uses human serum panel instead of ferret panel. Many studies have demonstrated that the results from human and ferret may be different. Second we use microneutralisation assay instead of HA inhibition assay. Traditionally, antigenic characteristics of influenza viruses are determined by haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) using post-infection ferret antisera [

 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and antigenic distance can be derived from the difference in HAI between strains [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, recent A(H3N2) strains poorly agglutinate red blood cells, and therefore HAI cannot be performed for these viruses [
