<p>Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics worldwide every year, putting a significant burden on the healthcare system. Assessing the population susceptibility to the upcoming epidemic influenza strain is one of the important components in preparing for influenza epidemics. In this study, we determined the population susceptibility by comparing the antibody titers against representative influenza virus strains that emerge during the interepidemic period with influenza virus strains representative of those in the previous epidemic. From a human serum panel from 445 patients encompassing all age groups from &lt;10 to ⩾80 years of age, 28.5% of individuals had ⩾four-fold lower MN titers against H1N1-inter compared with H1N1-pre, while only 4.9% had ⩾four-fold lower MN titers against H3N2-inter compared with H3N2-pre. For the influenza season 2018/19 winter influenza season in Hong Kong, A(H1N1) was the predominant subtype affecting Hong Kong, and the epidemic peak in the current season is much more severe than the A(H1N1) 2017/2018 winter or 2017 summer peak [
