<p>The MN titers for H1N1-inter were ⩾four-fold or ⩾eight-fold lower than those of H1N1-pre for 28.5% (127/445) and 10.3% (46/445) of individuals, respectively (

In comparison, the MN titers for the H3N2-inter were ⩾four-fold or ⩾eight-fold lower than those for H3N2-pre for only 4.9% (22/445) and 1.1% (5/445), respectively. Overall, the proportion of individuals with ⩾four-fold or ⩾eight-fold reduction in MN titers between the previous epidemic strains and the interepidemic emerging strains was significantly higher for A(H1N1) than that of A(H3N2) (

Subgroup analysis also showed that the proportion of individuals with ⩾four-fold reduction in MN titers between the previous epidemic strains and the interepidemic emerging strains of A(H1N1) was higher than that of A(H3N2) for all nine different age groups. The difference is most striking for the 30–39 year-old age group, in which 58% of individuals had ⩾four-fold reduction in H1N1 titer
