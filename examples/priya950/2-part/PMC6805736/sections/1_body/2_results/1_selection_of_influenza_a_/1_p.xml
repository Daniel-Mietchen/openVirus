<p>Before the 2018/2019 winter influenza season, the last A(H1N1) epidemic occurred in the 2015/2016 winter influenza season. S183P substitution in the HA, which was absent in A(H1N1) virus strains collected between 2015 and September 2017, was increasingly found among A(H1N1) strains collected in Hong Kong (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, for H1N1-pre, we have chosen a strain with HA 183S (A/HK/412489/2016). For H1N1-inter, we have chosen a strain with HA 183P (A/HK/439315/2018), which was isolated from an adult patient with severe disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No mutations in the HA gene were found during virus passage for both H1N1-pre and H1N1-inter.
