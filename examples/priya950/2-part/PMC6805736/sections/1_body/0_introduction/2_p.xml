<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics are caused by influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B virus. There are important epidemiological differences between these influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies have shown that the median ages of patients with influenza A(H1N1) (20 years) and influenza B (16 years) virus infection are younger than those with influenza A(H3N2) (30 years) virus infection [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For influenza B virus, patients infected by the Victoria lineage are younger than those infected with the Yamagata lineage (median age: 20 years 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 40 years) [

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. After the 2009 pandemic, the mortality rate was higher for A(H3N2) virus than A(H1N1) virus for older patients born before 1946, but was higher for A(H1N1) virus for younger patients born after 1947 [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Vaccine effectiveness is much lower for influenza A(H3N2) virus than influenza A(H1N1) or influenza B virus [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These differences in epidemiological characteristics and vaccine effectiveness have significant implication in healthcare resource and workforce planning for an influenza season.
