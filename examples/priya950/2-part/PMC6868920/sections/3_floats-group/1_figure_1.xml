  <title>Comparison of Flavivirus and Alphavirus genome. (A) The Flavivirus, similar to the Alphavirus genus, contain single stranded RNA of positive sense; however, this has a unique open reading frame (ORF). In the 5´ end, a type I cap is present and at the 3´ end, a polyadenylation tail is observed. A typical genome has a similar order of genes and some conserved non-structural proteins (NS). (B) The viruses belonging to the Alphavirus genus possess a genome consisting of a positive sense single stranded RNA with two ORFs at the 5´ end. These code for four non-structural protein (nsP1-4). Another ORF at the 3´ end, codes for five structural proteins namely, capsid protein (C), envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2), and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K).</title>
