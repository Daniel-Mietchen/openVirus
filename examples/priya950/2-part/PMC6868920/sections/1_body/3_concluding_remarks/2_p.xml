<p>The discovery and/or design of new medicines to treat some of the diseases caused by arbovirus are a great challenge, but also an urgent need. To date there is no specific treatment for infection caused by DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV and other human-related infections caused by arbovirus. The development of a vaccine is still ongoing, but that directed against DENV has not shown safety results. Despite the enormous difficulties for the development of new vaccines that can be effective against communicable diseases, in the present case of arboviral origin, this strategy continues being the most important alternative to prevent and counteract the negative impact on global public health of the above pathologies.</p>
