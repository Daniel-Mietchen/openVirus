<p>Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular structure and replication mechanisms of these arboviruses, there are still many gaps in what we know. Future investigations are necessary to elucidate many molecular aspects that can give us insights into the viral emergence mechanisms, cellular pathogenesis, and host-virus interactions. These would be helpful for the development of urgent control strategies and for improving their effectiveness. </p>
