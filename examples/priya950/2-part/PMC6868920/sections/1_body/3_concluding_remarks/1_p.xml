<p>Arbovirus, such as dengue, zika, and chikungunya viruses, are an important threat to global public health, especially in subtropical and tropical regions where these are maintained due to the peculiar environmental conditions which favor the development and proliferation of their main vectors, the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus. </italic>The vector control strategies have failed, mainly due to insecticides resistance (Suwanmanee and Luplertlop, 2017[
 <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]); in addition to this, there are factors such as the low coverage and efficiency of basic hygiene services in developing countries. This environment facilitates a favorable and permanent culture medium for the cyclical prevalence of these diseases that are still present in most Latin American countries (PAHO-CHA-IR, 2016[
