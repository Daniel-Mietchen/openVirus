<p>On the other hand, the existence of some promising natural products and their possible therapeutic targets of action were stated. Highlighting that for DENV and ZIKV the NS2B.NS3 protease coincides as a potential target, further Tigocherin A and Tigocherriolide A showed potential inhibitory activity for DENV, having as a possible target of action the NS5RdRp protein. Nevertheless, in the case of CHIKV still is not clear a possible action target, however, it is known that the first stage of the replication cycle is the most susceptible to the extracts tested (Khan et al., 2011[
