<p>Another important arbovirus family found in Latin America is 
 <italic>Togaviridae. </italic>The CHIKV belongs to this family, and the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus. Currently there are four genotypes of chikungunya reported: The East-Central-South Africa, West Africa, Asian, and Indian Ocean lineage; all of them were named based in their geographic distribution. The CHIKV has a close relation with more alphaviruses such as: The o´nyong'nyong Virus, Rio Ross Virus, Mayaro Virus, Barmah Forest Virus and the group of Sindbis Virus, all of them are known as causative agents of arthritis (Vu et al., 2017[

 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), arriving to the Americas in 2013 affecting more than one million people (Vu et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]). Regarding the clinical manifestations, most patients suffer a self-limited febrile syndrome with polyarthritis and rash; however, some patients have reported persistent arthralgia even for years. Alterations of the central nervous system such as convulsions, meningoencephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported. Myocarditis, liver failure in patients with antecedents of chronic liver disease, endocrine alterations, pancreatitis, and respiratory failure have also been reported, although less frequently (Simon et al., 2011[
