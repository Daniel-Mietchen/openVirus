<p>One of the first species described in the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> was the YFV; it was isolated for the first time in 1927 in Ghana. The estimated number of cases of YFV in Africa and Latin America are about 120,000 per year, with approximately 45,000 deaths/year. The clinical manifestations range from an asymptomatic disease (around 50 % of the cases) to a very severe form of the disease, with 20 % mortality rate (Litvoc et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Currently, its prevention has been achieved via the 17D vaccine, however it still remains a public health problem, due to the current outbreaks in endemic and non-endemic areas (Douam and Ploss, 2018[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), which raised interest in relation to the potential impact of YFV into non-endemic countries, where usually people do not get vaccinated.
