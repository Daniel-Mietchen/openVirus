<p>Both flaviviruses and alphaviruses enter cells through clathrin-coated vesicles or specific receptors on the cell membrane. However, in all the cases the membrane fusion process is triggered by the low pH of the endosome. E and E1 proteins, from 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> respectively, share several common characteristics and suffer, with small differences, the same changes to promote the membrane fusion between the virus and the target cell. The E and E1 suffer a significant conformational change that promote the DIII to move close the fusion loop, the DIII domain maintain the link of the fusion and the transmembrane domains. After the conformational change and reorganization of E and E1 protein, the DII domain is exposed and allows it to interact with the target membrane and promote the fusion.
