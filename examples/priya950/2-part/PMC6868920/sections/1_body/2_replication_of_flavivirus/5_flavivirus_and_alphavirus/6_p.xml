<p>Despite the fact the use of natural products to inhibit different viruses has proven to be feasible and with good results 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The knowledge of the biology of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Alphavirus </italic>have accelerated the discovery of selective targets to attack, with possibilities to inhibit their replication. In the case of ZIKV these proteins are well known as possible targets: NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 polymerase, NS5 methyltransferase, the envelope and the capsid. To DENV, the research has been focused on multifunctional enzymes NS3, NS5 and the capsid protein. In the case of CHIKV one of the most suitable targets is the cysteine protease domain nsP2. All these proteins were selected as target because of their important role in the respective viral cycle replication.
