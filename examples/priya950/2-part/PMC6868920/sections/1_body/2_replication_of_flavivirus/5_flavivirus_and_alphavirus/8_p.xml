<p>Pohjala et al. evaluated 356 (123 natural products and 233 clinical approved drugs) as inhibitors of CHIKV infection, using a stable replication cell line. Their results showed that under experimental conditions the flavonoids apigenin, chrysin, naringenin and silybin, were the most actives against CHIKV (Pohjala et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). The Harringtonine, a natural product obtained from 
 <italic>Cephalotaxus sp</italic>, shows a high antiproliferative activity against CHIKV, with EC
 <sub>50 </sub>of 0,24 ÂµM and a very low cytotoxicity. These results suggest a possible inhibition at early stages of viral replication; additionally this compound was able to inhibit the replication of Sindbis virus too, suggesting a possible inhibition of other alphaviruses (Kaur et al., 2013[
