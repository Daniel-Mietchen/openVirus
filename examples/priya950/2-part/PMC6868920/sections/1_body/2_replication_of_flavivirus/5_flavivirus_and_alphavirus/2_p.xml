<p>In the middle of this bleak panorama, several candidates for arbovirus vaccines have been proposed, however, these are only tested in animal models. For example, Weger-Lucarelli and colleagues (2014[
 <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]) describe the construction and characterization of a modified Ankara virus-based vaccine, and expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins, the authors demonstrated that the vaccine protected different type of mice against CHIKV infection (Weger-Lucarelli et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]). Prow and colleagues, described a single-vector construct-based vaccine, that expresses the prME protein of zika virus and the polyprotein conformed by C-E3-E2-6K-E1 proteins of chikungunya virus, having as a result that a single dose of the vaccine in different type of mice, can elicit neutralizing antibodies, therefore, it provides protection against both viruses (Prow et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]).
