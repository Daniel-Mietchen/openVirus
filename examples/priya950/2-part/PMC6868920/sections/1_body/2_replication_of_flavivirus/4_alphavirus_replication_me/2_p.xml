<p>Subsequently the genome is translated to generate the non-structural and structural proteins. The non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) and their precursors are necessary for the replication of the viral RNA. The five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, E1) and their precursors are necessary for viral encapsidation and budding. Viral replication occurs in the host cytoplasm in close connection with the Golgi apparatus (Thiberville et al., 2013[
