<p>After internalization of alphaviruses in endosomes, the reduction in pH level, due to the H
 <sup>+</sup> pump, leads to the conformational reorganization of viral heterodimer E1-E2, releasing E1 as a result. Thereby, the domain II is exposed and the viral particle fuses with the membrane of the host cell (Schuffenecker et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]). The E3 protein interacts with the E2 protein, stabilizing a region called the “acid-sensitive region”, indirectly facilitating the activation of E1 that is required for the membrane fusion (Sjöberg et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]). The endosome releases the nucleocapsid and the RNA genome; both coupled by interaction of the major RNA subunit 60S with the signal protein of the nucleocapsid. This mechanism is highly conserved among alphaviruses (Sjöberg et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]) (Figure 3
