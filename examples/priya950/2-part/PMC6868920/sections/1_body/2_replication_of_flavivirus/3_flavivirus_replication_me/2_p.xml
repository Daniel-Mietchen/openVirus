<p>The E and prM proteins are glycosylated and then the NS proteins trigger viral genome replication. Several modifications of viral RNA are observed during its replication, such as methylation, which protects the RNA from quick degradation and manages the transcription efficiency. This modification is necessary for the formation of the virions and it is detected in different flaviviruses (Yap et al., 2017[
