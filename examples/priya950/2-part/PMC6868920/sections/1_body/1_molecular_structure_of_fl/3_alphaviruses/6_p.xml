   <p>nsP1 have both guanine-7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities, thus is responsible for the addition of the 5´Cap to viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs, a step necessary to avoid the viral RNA degradation and for its subsequent translation. This protein is also involved in anchoring the replications complexes to the cellular membranes maybe through interaction with anionic phospholipids from the membrane (Abu Bakar and Ng, 2018[

   <p>The master regulator of the Alphavirus cycle, the nsP2, which consists of 798 aa. In the c-terminal region shows a papain-like cysteine protease, which is required to process P1234 polyprotein into mature non-structural proteins, act as a RNA triphosphatase involved in viral RNA capping reactions, as a nucleotide triphosphatase supply the RNA helicase activity. Mature nsP2, in its N-terminal region contains a helicase domain, catalyzes the cleavages between the nonstructural proteins, and an inactive RNA methyltransferase-like domain. The C-terminal subdomain is an 5-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent (SAM) RNA methyltransferase domain with no enzymatic function (Rana et al., 2017[
    <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; Mutso et al., 2018[
    <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). Virus with mutations in this nsP2 protein are unable to produce cytopathic effect (Shin et al., 2012[

   <p>nsP3, which consists of 530 aa, have three domains: the N-terminal macro domain, the central zinc-binding domain and the C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD). This protein is involved in the negative sense and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis and is a component of the viral RNA replicase complex and has been associated with the neurovirulence of some alphavirus. The N-terminal domain conserved among alphaviruses, which exhibits both ADP-ribose and RNA binding activities, and also dephosphorylate ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphate and have de-ADP-ribosylating activity. The central zinc-binding domain is also conserved among alphaviruses, it is involved in the RNA replication, however it is no yet cleared. The hypervariable domain shows variability even between closely related alphaviruses, being indispensable for alphavirus replication (Götte et al., 2018[
    <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Mutations in nsP3 have been associated with defects in the initiation of minus-strand synthesis or subgenomic RNA synthesis (Mutso et al., 2018[
    <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]), and the degradation of this protein seems to be involved in the upregulation of nsP4 levels (Götte et al., 2018[
    <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).

   <p>The highly conserved protein nsP4 has a homology greater than 50 % among alphaviruses. This protein consists of 611 aa, is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and terminal adenosine transferase, responsible for synthesis of different viral RNAs and adding (and repair) the poly (A) tails to positive strand RNAs, essential steps to the virus replication (Tomar et al., 2006[
    <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]; Mutso et al., 2018[
    <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]).
