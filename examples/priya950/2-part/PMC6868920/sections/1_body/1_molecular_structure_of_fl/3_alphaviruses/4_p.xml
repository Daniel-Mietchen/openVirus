<p>In turn, capsid protein has two domains: The N-terminal RNA binding domain and the C-terminal protease domain. The N-terminal region is indispensable for binding to RNA genome, C protein multimerization and its subsequent nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation. About the nuclear translocation is known that induces host cell transcriptional blockade in encephalitic alphaviruses, however it is not clear in arthritogenic alphaviruses yet (Taylor et al., 2017[
