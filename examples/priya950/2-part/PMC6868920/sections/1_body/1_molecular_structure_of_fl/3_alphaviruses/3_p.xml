<p>Besides, the protein 6K acts as a leader peptide for E1 and facilitates particle morphogenesis, and are involved in the formation of viroporins that play a role in the release of virus progeny, the intracellular trafficking of glycoprotein and the permeability of the membrane. The transframe protein, generated by ribosomal frame shifting, shares N-terminus with 6K, which is also considered as a putative ion channel that may enhance particle release. E1 in CHIKV is a 436 aa type II fusion protein, through fusion of viral envelope and endosomal cellular membrane (Jose et al., 2009[
