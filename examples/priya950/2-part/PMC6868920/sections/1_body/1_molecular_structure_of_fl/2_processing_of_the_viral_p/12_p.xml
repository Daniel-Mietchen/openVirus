<p>NS3 is an enzyme that shows approximately 65 % sequence identity between DENV, ZIKV, and YFV (Brand et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), therefore is interesting for the development of control strategies. The NS3 protein is the second largest protein after NS5, and is composed by two regions: the N-terminal region that contains a serine protease domain and a chymotrypsin protease domain. The C-terminal region that contains both a nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) and a RNA helicase domain. Serine protease is involved in the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein in three single proteins, as mentioned above, and thus plays a central role in the viral replication cycle. The chymotrypsin protease cleaves the viral precursor polyprotein to release each individual NS protein and the NTPase/dependent RNA helicase, which are involved in the replication of the genome and synthesis of viral RNA (Natarajan, 2010[
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). Likewise, DENV-NS2B is required as a cofactor for NS3 protease activity, for example, it has been described that in DENV is responsible for the cleavage between NS2A/2B, NS2B3, NS3/4A and NS4B/5 (Chen et al., 2017[
