<p>On the other hand, in the dengue virus, NS1 anchors the replication complex to the host endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and interacts directly with NS4B, As a result, it plays an important role in the viral replication process. Furthermore, YFV and DENV are associated with hemorrhagic fever, this may be due to the increased vascular permeability. However it can be mediated by the NS1 protein, because it has been shown that its binding to heparin sulfate of the endothelial glycocalyx layer may alter the capillary permeability (Puerta-Guardo et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). This is also relevant in the severe forms of dengue since anti-NS1 antibodies join to the surface of the endothelial cells and platelets producing cell damage (Chen et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Besides, ZIKV NS1, from Asian lineage strains, can be involved in the developmental complications such as microcephaly in fetuses and also severe neurological manifestations in adults. However, currently it is not clear how the virus can penetrate the hematoencephalic barrier (Wang et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]; Xia et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]). However, an alternative protein, the NS1', has been reported in ZIKV (specifically Asian lineage) and other neuroinvasive
