<p>The NS1 function is to activate the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inhibit the complement system in order to interact with the NS4 protein. The activation of the TLRs is important as it leads to the activation of transcription factors and the production of cytokines as a part of the innate immune response. The main receptor for 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is TLR3, which in turn can modulate the activation of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells as well as triggers the IFN mRNA transcription, thus inducing the innate antiviral responses (Alayli and Scholle, 2016[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Chen et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Spontaneous mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution in ZIKV NS1 protein increased its infectivity in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, which most likely had promoted its transmission in the recent epidemic (Liu et al., 2017[
