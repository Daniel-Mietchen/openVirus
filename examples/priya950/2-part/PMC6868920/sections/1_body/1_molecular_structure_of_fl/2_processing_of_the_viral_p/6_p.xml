<p>About the non-structural proteins, they change in functions and structure between different Flaviviruses. For example, NS1 is a highly conserved protein that is encoded exclusively by the members of genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and is considered as the major antigenic marker during infection. This non-structural protein is a dimeric protein with molecular weight between 46-55 kDa depending on the degree of glycosylation, which is important for the efficiency of the viral secretion, replication, and virulence. Thus, deletion of NS1 glycosylation sites of DENV and YFV, significantly reduce their viral replication. NS1 can exist as a monomer, dimer (protein connected to the mNS1 membrane) and also as a hexamer (secreted protein, sNS1) (Rastogi et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; Chen et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). A recent study shows that the overall structure of NS1 is similar among YFV, ZIKV, DENV, and WNV (Wang et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]). NS1 of ZIKV has a diversity of electrostatic surface features in the host-virus interaction context as well as unique dimeric assembly (Song et al., 2016[
