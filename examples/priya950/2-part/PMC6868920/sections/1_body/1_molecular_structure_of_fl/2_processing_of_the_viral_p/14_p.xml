<p>Finally, NS5, a 104 kDa protein is encoded by the C terminus of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genome. It is highly conserved among the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, with a homology of about 68 % between DENV, ZIKV and YFV (Potisopon et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; Brand et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). NS5 is composed of two domains: the methyltransferase domain, indispensable for the formation of the CAP structure of the viral genome, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, which is necessary for the RNA genome replication process. The NS5 protein of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> can inhibit the IFN signals during the infections caused by DENV, YFV, ZIKV, and HCV, in order to evade innate immunity; this is achieved through the interaction with STAT2 protein or by modulating RNA splicing within the host cell (Murray et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). DENV infected cells show localization of NS5 protein mainly in the nucleus; this may be related to the modulation of the cytokine gene expression (El Sahili and Lescar, 2017[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). The NS3 protein initially cleaves the NS5 in HCV, producing the NS5A and NS5B mature proteins. NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involved in the viral replication, with a terminal nucleotide transferase activity using uridine triphosphate as a substrate. Because the NS5 is a highly conserved protein among
 <italic> Flavivirus</italic>, and its important role during the viral replication and evasion of the host immune system, has led to the proposal of the NS5 as a target for the development of antivirals against 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infections (El Sahili and Lescar, 2017[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; Shi and Gao, 2017[
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]).
