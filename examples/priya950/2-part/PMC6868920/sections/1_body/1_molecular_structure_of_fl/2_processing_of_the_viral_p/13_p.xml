<p>DENV NS4 protein is cleaved by the NS3 host signal protease and peptidase, producing mature NS4A and NS4B proteins. This process is necessary for the inhibition of the IFN signaling pathway, as well as for the viral replication process (Zou et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]; Chen et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). NS4A is a small integral membrane protein and it contains four transmembrane segments that act as a scaffold for the replication complex. It has been proposed that NS4A leads to membrane modifications and plays an important role in the formation of structures derived from the host's membrane. The N-terminal region of NS4A interacts specifically with curved membrane regions. It is an essential component of the viral replication cycle because it interacts directly with the vimentin protein of the cytoskeleton, an event that is necessary for the correct localization of the replication complex in the perinuclear region (Teo and Chu, 2014[

NS4B is formed by three C-terminal trans-membrane segments and is involved in blocking the signaling transduction of the IFN-α/β, as well as modulating the function of NS3 helicase. In YFV and WNV, NS4B and STAT1 show cytoplasmic localization, and can inhibit the 'Interferon Stimulated Response Element' activation mediated by IFNβ (Nemésio et al., 2012[

 <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]). Even though the NS4B protein is highly conserved among the DENV serotypes, mutations in the NS4B of YFV can modulate its neuro-invasion capacity, as well as its neuro-virulence (Zmurko et al., 2015[
