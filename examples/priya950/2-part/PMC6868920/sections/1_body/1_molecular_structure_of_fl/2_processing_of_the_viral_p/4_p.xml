<p>A difference in the amino acid sequence of the EDIII region has been reported in the DEN4 sylvatic and human strains, which may be related to their jump from a sylvatic host to a human one (Volk et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]). Therefore, this region among 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> shows considerable variation.
