<p>EDI forms the central domain of the envelope protein, which establishes the protein direction and its glycosylation sites. The glycosylation domains of EDI are associated with the viral production, pH sensitivity and neuroinvasiveness in most flaviviruses. Interestingly, ZIKV has a single glycosylation site (N154) in the EDI with a longer loop (residues 145-160) compared to other flaviviruses (Kostyuchenko et al., 2013[

The structure of the Domain III of YFV differs from the structure of other mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, specifically in the surface exposed BC loop, since it is one amino acid shorter, than even other mosquito-borne and non-vector borne viruses. This change can modify neutralization sites and receptor interactions, and therefore, the viral pathogenesis (Volk et al., 2009[
