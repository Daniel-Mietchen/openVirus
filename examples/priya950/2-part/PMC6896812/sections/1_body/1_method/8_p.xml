<p>Regarding the behavioral, practical and knowledge aspects of HIV transmission and counseling about sexual prevention of HIV by the health team, the following behavioral variables were adopted: type of sexual partnership (casual, fixed or casual and fixed); sexual partnership number; alcohol use before sexual intercourse (yes or no); alcohol use during sexual intercourse (yes or no); period of couple formation (before or after the knowledge of HIV infection); HIV serological diagnosis of sexual partnership (seropositive, seronegative or unknown). Belief in sexual transmission of HIV was assessed by the following question: Do you believe that if your viral load is low, you decrease the risk of HIV transmission? (yes / no / donâ€™t know), complemented by the questions: did you reveal the diagnosis for the current sexual partnership (yes or no)?; talk to your partner about condom use (yes or no) and male condom use (always, sometimes and never)? </p>
