<p>To demonstrate the efficiency of enrichment of the VIRRION array and the reduction of host nucleic acid during the enrichment, we targeted the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), an essential housekeeping gene that is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. We used H5N2 spiked-in samples and extracted total RNA from the VIRRION after capture. We then characterized the enrichment by measuring the ratio of the copy number of host 18S rRNA to the virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H5N2 by RT-qPCR (
