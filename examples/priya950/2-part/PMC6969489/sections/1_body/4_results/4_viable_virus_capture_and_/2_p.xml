<p>To test for in situ optical identification of the virus particles captured within the nanotube array via SERS, we developed an algorithm using a spectral database of 3 different viruses: strains from 2 AIV subtypes (H5N2 and H7N2) and reovirus. We first collected multiple Raman spectra after VIRRION capture of these viruses to build a simple database. Surface enhancement of the Raman scattering happens at a so-called “hot spot,” i.e., the 1-nm region between 2 adjacent gold nanoparticles. Thus, when viruses are trapped between the Au/CNxCNT arrays, the only Raman signal from the virus in the vicinity of the hot spot is enhanced. We recorded Raman signals and averaged over 100 spectra for each strain to generate a reliable average fingerprint for each virus. Each virus strain has a distinct fingerprint that was still distinguishable at concentrations as low as ∼10
