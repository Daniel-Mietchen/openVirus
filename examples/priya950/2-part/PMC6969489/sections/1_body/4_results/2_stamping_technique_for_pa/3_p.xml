<p>To optically detect the captured viruses using a label-free approach, we functionalized the CNxCNTs with Au nanoparticles to enable SERS (

 </xref>). Raman spectroscopy is an optical spectroscopic technique that is commonly used to identify the chemical structure of substances by providing their structural/vibrational fingerprints. However, the efficiency of the Raman scattering signal is usually very weak—approximately 1 out of 10
 <sup>6</sup> phonons is absorbed or emitted through Raman (inelastic) scattering. This weak efficiency dramatically limits the signal intensity of Raman spectra, thus constraining its application. However, studies have shown that Au nanoparticles enhance localized plasmon resonance, which can further enhance the signal of Raman scattering up to ∼10
 <sup>8</sup>. Interestingly, this Raman signal enhancement enables the detection down to a single-molecule level (approximately picomolar) (
