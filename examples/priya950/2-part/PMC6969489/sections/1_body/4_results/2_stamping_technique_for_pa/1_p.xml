<p>In our previous study, we applied an expensive and time-consuming microlithography-based technique to selectively grow aligned CNxCNT arrays on silicon substrates (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this report, we expanded on this method by developing a stamping technique to easily pattern catalytic Fe particles, which are responsible for growing aligned CNxCNTs with herringbone configurations exhibiting a gradient of ITDs that match the sizes of different viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Without using any lithography and metal deposition, we utilize a 3D printing technique to fabricate a reusable mold that patterns liquid-based Fe precursor on a substrate in several minutes with a submillimeter resolution. More importantly, our measurement showed that this stamping technique increases the range of the ITDs from 25 to 325 nm, to 22 to 720 nm. This expanded range covers a large diversity of virus particle sizes, thus making possible size-based and label-free capture of different viruses without the need for prior information about the virus strain. Specifically, we used a commercial 3D printer to prepare polymer micromolds with herringbone micropatterns that were used to deposit different concentration solutions of Fe precursors onto Si/SiO
 <sub>2</sub> substrates and to grow aligned CNxCNTs with tuned ITDs (

 <sub>3</sub>•9H
 <sub>2</sub>O, on micromolds with herringbone patterns. Then, Fe-based precursors were transferred on a Si/SiO
 <sub>2</sub> substrate by stamping the side of the micromolds covered with precursors. During spin-coating and stamping, the concentration and location of the precursor were controlled and defined. As a result, herringbone-shaped precursor was applied and patterned on a substrate. The stamped precursor arrays were then used as catalytic substrates to grow arrays of aligned CNxCNTs using CVD in the presence of benzylamine (

The height of the aligned CNxCNTs reached ∼70 µm after growing for 40 min. Structural characterization of the grown nanotubes revealed compartmentalized bamboo-like tubular structures containing N-dopants, as observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy (
