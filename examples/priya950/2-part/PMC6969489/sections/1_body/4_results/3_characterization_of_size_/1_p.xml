<p>After growing the CNxCNT arrays and fabricating microfluidic devices, we characterized the size-based capture by using different sizes of fluorescently labeled silica particles (

To capture and separate each subgroup of silica particles in the mixture, we assembled a microdevice with 3 zones of aligned CNxCNT arrays having 400-, 140-, and 25-nm ITDs to match their sizes. The efficiency of the size-based capture was calculated under different flow rates by measuring the fluorescent intensities of the flow through and normalizing by the initial intensities. After capture, strong fluorescent signals of individual subgroups of silica particles were detected in the CNxCNT array zones. The ITDs matched the silica bead sizes (

When the flow rate ranged between 250 and 500 µL/min, the capture efficiency reached 31.8 ± 3.3%, 35.3 ± 4.7%, and 34.3 ± 4.5%, respectively, for silica particles of 400, 140, or 25 nm in diameter (

 <sup>3</sup> µL/min, the capture efficiencies could still reach ∼22%. To confirm that the size-based capture is facilitated by the presence of CNxCNT arrays, we assembled a microdevice without CNxCNT arrays as a control experiment. After passing the same mixture of the particles through the control arrays, very few particles (∼4%) were captured (
