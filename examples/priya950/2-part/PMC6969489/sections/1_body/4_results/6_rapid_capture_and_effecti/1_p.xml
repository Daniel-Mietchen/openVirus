<p>Acute respiratory infections are the third most common cause of death worldwide and responsible for 4 million deaths each year, which is 7% of all deaths annually (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Most clinical or field samples have very low virus titers, and sequencing of total RNA usually results in a majority (&gt;80% of the sequence reads) of host sequences, such as rRNA (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). When developing methods for enrichment, the challenge is to minimize bias and to process clinically relevant sample volumes (

We validated the VIRRION in human respiratory infection diagnostics by rapidly capturing and identifying different viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs from patients who had been diagnosed with rhinovirus, influenza A virus, or human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV 3). The diagnosis was confirmed by TEM and PCR (

Without any sample preparation, we loaded 3 mL of the transport media in which the swabs were stored into separate VIRRIONs through a syringe and gently pushed manually. After capture, virus-like particles were observed by SEM on CNxCNT arrays (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5

 </xref>) demonstrated that the Raman spectra could clearly differentiate between the virus strains when converting the data into a low-dimensional (2D) scale. Next, we applied the previously developed machine learning strategy to classify the results of the Raman spectroscopy. The accuracy for identification of the specific viruses was ∼93% using the logistic regression algorithm (
