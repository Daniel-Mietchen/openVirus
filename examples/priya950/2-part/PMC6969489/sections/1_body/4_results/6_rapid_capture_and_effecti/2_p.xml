<p>After label-free capture and detection, we processed the isolated nucleic acid for NGS and determined that after VIRRION capture, the influenza A and HPIV 3 viruses were significantly enriched (

The percentage of the influenza A genome increased from 33% before enrichment to 48% and 57% following the first and second enrichment steps, respectively. The percentage of the HPIV 3 genome increased from 22% before enrichment to 81% and 77% after the first and second enrichment steps. The average genome coverage increased from 8.8× to 15.9× for influenza, and 363× to 2,040× for HPIV 3. We were also able to assemble large portions of each viral genome. No influenza A contigs greater than 500 bp were identified following assembly in the unenriched sample. However, 4 contigs matching the influenza A genome were found in both enrichment steps with an average of 590 bp. They are 681-bp matches to PB1 (MH540988.1), 622-bp matches to PB1 (MH845979.1), 570-bp matches to NA (LC409054.1), and 553-bp matches to PB2 (MH540997.1). The entire genome was assembled in each of the HPIV 3 samples. The results of coverage and variant analyses were summarized in

 </ext-link>. The NGS results supported that VIRRION can enrich different viruses directly from patient swab samples. Unfortunately, no rhinovirus-related reads were detected by NGS after enrichment. We suspect that this is because the virus titer is extremely low even after VIRRION enrichment, as determined from PCR results (
