<p>In summary, our newly developed VIRRION provides a multifunctional and portable microplatform for rapid virus capture and sensitive in situ identification by SERS. Currently, we are expanding the Raman database by collecting more spectra from different types of viruses. An expanded database would allow better characterization of unknown viruses. The captured viruses are viable and enriched, thus providing effective sample preparation for existing standard methods for virus analysis, including cell culture for virus isolation, immunostaining, and NGS. We also successfully captured and detected different human respiratory viruses from clinical samples using this platform. Two of its strengths are that it can perform enrichment in just a few minutes and achieve a sensitivity comparable to that of RT-qPCR with 70âˆ¼90% accuracy. This platform provides a way to overcome the technical barrier in virus surveillance and discovery, and its many salient features would also help in virus prediction and outbreak preparedness.</p>
