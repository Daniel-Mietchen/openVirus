 <sub>2</sub>O (Sigma-Aldrich; #254223-10G) using a mixture (1:1) of DI water and toluene (Sigma-Aldrich; #244511-100 ML). To perform stamping, a PDMS-coated mold was placed on a silicon substrate covered with a thin film of liquid iron precursors for 30 s. Then, the PDMS stamp was transferred and applied on a fused silica substrate for 10 min in order to ensure iron precursors were transferred and dried.
