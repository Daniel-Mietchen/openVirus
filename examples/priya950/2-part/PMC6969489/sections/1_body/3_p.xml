<p>We have previously shown that viruses can be captured between aligned carbon nanotubes, without the use of specific labels, when their sizes match the intertubular distance (ITD) (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In our previous iteration, we assembled a simple filtration device to perform size-based capture of individual types of viruses. In addition, the processing speed of the virus samples was low at approximately 1 mL per h, and not suitable for clinical samples due to clogging from tissue or cell debris. In this report, we present a complete and high-throughput sample preparation platform, named VIRRION (virus capture with rapid Raman spectroscopy detection and identification), for rapid multivirus enrichment and label-free detection directly from clinical samples. VIRRION consists of a handheld microdevice, designed to simultaneously capture different viruses by size while preserving their structural integrity and viability, and to perform real-time nondestructive identification using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled to a machine learning algorithm and database. We demonstrate that VIRRION can be used to successfully capture, enrich, and optically identify unknown and highly mutated strains from clinical samples without minimal sample manipulation. More importantly, this nondestructive approach allows follow-up analyses using more conventional methods for virus characterization, including virus isolation, immunostaining, and sequencing.
