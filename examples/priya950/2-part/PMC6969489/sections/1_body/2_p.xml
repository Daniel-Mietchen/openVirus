<p>Existing technologies, such as immune-based (

 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) [e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and PCR (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)], provide relatively sensitive detection for the identification of viruses but require prior knowledge of the strains. Deep sequencing techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), are powerful tools in virus surveillance. NGS can detect mutations in virus genomes and capture information on genetic diversity within the virus population if sequence coverage is sufficient. One current challenge is the low virus titer in most samples, leading to sequence reads that are dominated by host genetic material rather than by viral pathogens. Extant enrichment methods, including virus culture and genome amplification, often introduce artificial variants or bias in the sequence reads. In addition, these processing steps also involve incorporating different benchtop equipment, reagents, and technical expertise during operation. Thus, rapid enrichment and fast virus detection in remote field conditions remain a critical technical hurdle for outbreak preparedness (
