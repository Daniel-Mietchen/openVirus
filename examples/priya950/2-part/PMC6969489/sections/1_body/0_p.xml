<p content-type="flushleft">Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), more than archaea and bacteria combined. They also represent the largest and most genetically diverse reservoir of nucleic acid that can infect all forms of life (

 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Viruses can evolve rapidly and cause new epidemics, such as the zoonotic H5N1 pandemic (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Zika (

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Studies covering the period of the last century have shown that globalization and industrialization played a vital role in the emergence and dissemination of viral diseases (

According to the World Health Organization, early detection can halt virus spread by enabling the rapid deployment of proper countermeasures (

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Methods for outbreak detection have benefitted from new genomic tools. However, effective virus surveillance and discovery remain challenging (
