  <p>Design and working principle of VIRRION for effective virus capture and identification. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Photograph and SEM images of aligned CNTs exhibiting herringbone patterns decorated with gold nanoparticles. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Picture showing assembled VIRRION device, processing a blood sample. (
   <italic>C</italic>) Illustration of (
   <italic>i</italic>) size-based capture and (
   <italic>ii</italic>) in situ Raman spectroscopy for label-free optical virus identification. Images of electron microscopy showing captured avian influenza virus H5N2 by CNxCNT arrays. (
   <italic>D</italic>) On-chip virus analysis and enrichment for NGS, (
   <italic>i</italic>) on-chip immunostaining for captured H5N2, (
   <italic>ii</italic>) on-chip viral propagation through cell culture, and (
   <italic>iii</italic>) genomic sequencing and analysis of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV 3). Track 1: scale of the base pair position; track 2: variant analysis by mapping to strain #MF973163; color code: deletion (black), transition (A–G, fluorescent green; G–A, dark green; C–T, dark red; T–C, light red), transversion (A–C, brown; C–A, purple; A–T, dark blue; T–A, fluorescent blue; G–T, dark orange; T–G, violet; C–G, yellow; G–C, light violet); track 3: coverage; track 4: regions of open reading frames (ORFs).
