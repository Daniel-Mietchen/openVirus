<p id="Par47">Reforms in the WHO health emergency programme post the 2013–2016 West Africa Ebola are beginning to bear results. For example, the time taken to control outbreaks in the WHO African Region, has reduced from an average of 418 days (well over a year) in 2016 to 51 days (under two months) in 2018. Further, epidemics are being detected and responded to faster [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To date, forty-six countries in the WHO African region have had their IHR capacities assessed through joint external evaluation (JEE) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is the highest number of JEEs among the WHO regions. Importantly, 30 of the countries that have conducted a JEE have subsequently developed their national action plans for health security (NAPHS) to address the identified gaps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nigeria and Uganda are two practical examples of countries showing the benefits of investing in building IHR capacities. Both countries have been able to detect and respond much faster to outbreaks. In Uganda, improvements in public health surveillance have been shown to substantially improve the response time for Viral Haemorrhagic Disease epidemics, thus reducing the scale and length of epidemics [

In 2016, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established and has been instrumental in improving coordination of public health emergency preparedness and response. This was demonstrated during the 2017 Monkey pox outbreak. Previously, Monkey pox surveillance was hindered by inadequate actionable data as Monkey pox was not a notifiable disease. A more sensitive surveillance system led to the detection of the index case in 2017 after 39 years of the last recorded case [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The response of the NCDC in creating awareness and providing tools for surveillance led to the detection of more suspected monkey pox cases in 21 states. In addition, increased coordination and partnerships from the Federal Government, the States and other collaborating partners, led to its containment, largely credited to strengthened surveillance and laboratory diagnosis support.
