  <p>Influenza‐specific T‐ and B‐cell recall responses increased by A‐eIIV after H3N2‐1968 challenge. Vaccinated mice were challenged i.n. with 20LD
   <sub>50</sub> of H3N2‐1968 virus at 6 months (long‐term memory) post‐vaccination, and at day 7 post‐infection, lungs and BALF were collected. Long‐term memory H3N2‐1968 challenge weight loss
