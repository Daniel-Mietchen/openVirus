  <p>Lung elevated cytokine production and secretory‐specific IgA, along with high serum H3‐stem antibodies in A‐eIIV mice after challenge. Mice were challenged with 20LD
   <sub>50</sub> H3N2‐1968 virus 21 days or 6 months post‐vaccination, and inflammatory responses were sampled at day 7 post‐infection. Inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations in individual lung homogenates (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4) by CBA were normalised to fold change from PBS response
