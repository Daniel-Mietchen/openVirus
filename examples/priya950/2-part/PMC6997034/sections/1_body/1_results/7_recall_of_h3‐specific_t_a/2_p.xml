<p>Challenge of mice with H3N2‐1968 virus at 6 months after vaccination induced a significant weight loss in unvaccinated mice, whilst all vaccinated mice were still protected with no lethality and no differences between weight loss between S‐IIV and eIIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Therefore, our definition of protection is based on lung viral loads and damage to the lung by total protein concentration. Importantly, A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV exhibited earlier viral clearance in the lungs by day 7 than S‐IIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Meanwhile, S‐IIV‐mediated protection had waned and viral loads were comparable to unvaccinated PBS mice (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b); however, there was a trend for less damage to the lung (by total protein concentration) for S‐IIV mice compared with the PBS groups (
