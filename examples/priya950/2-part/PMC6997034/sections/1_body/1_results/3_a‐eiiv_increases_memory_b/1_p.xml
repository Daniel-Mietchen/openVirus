<p>We next investigated the effects of eIIV on the generation of isotype‐switched memory B‐cell responses (B220
 <sup>+</sup> CD95/Fas
 <sup>low</sup> IgD
 <sup>−</sup> IgG/IgM
 <sup>+</sup>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), which are important for long‐term antibody production. Shortly after vaccination (day 7), there was no significant increase in total IgM
 <sup>+</sup> or IgG
 <sup>+</sup> B memory cells in the vaccination site draining inguinal lymph node (iLN) for S‐IIV compared with unvaccinated PBS mock‐treated mice (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and c). Meanwhile, there was a significant induction of both IgG
 <sup>+</sup> and IgM
 <sup>+</sup> memory B cells in by A‐eIIV compared with S‐IIV at day 7, which was maintained at 21 days post‐vaccination.
