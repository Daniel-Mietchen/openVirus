<p>To asses post‐vaccination waning, the kinetics of antibody responses at 2, 4 and 6 months were assessed longitudinally (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d–f). All vaccines induced stable long‐term H3‐specific IgG until 6 months post‐vaccination; however, A‐eIIV was consistently superior for increased magnitude and avidity of cross‐reactive H3N2‐1968 HA (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e) and H3‐stem responses (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f).
