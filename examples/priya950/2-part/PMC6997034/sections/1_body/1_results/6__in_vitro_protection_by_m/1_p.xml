<p>Because of the presence of HA stem antibodies and cross‐reactivity against H3N2‐1968, we assessed further cross‐reactivity against an avian influenza virus, H7N7, another group 2 influenza virus. Firstly, A‐eIIV elicited significantly increased H7‐HA‐specific IgG response compared with S‐IIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), which correlated with the group 2 HA stem responses (Figure

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.6246). An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> serum protection assay by FACS (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c) showed that the increased A‐eIIV cross‐reactive antibody responses also lead to a significant reduction of H7N7‐infected cells relative to naïve mouse serum, whilst S‐IIV had no 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> serum protection against H7N7 and was comparable to naïve mouse serum (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). In the same 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> protection FACS assay, the human antibody responses after S‐IIV and A‐eIIV vaccination showed equivalent serum protection against homologous H3N2‐2013 virus; however, A‐eIIV responses significantly reduced cells infected with heterologous viruses, H3N2‐1968 and H7N7, reflecting the high level of antibody cross‐reactivity induced by A‐eIIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e and f).
