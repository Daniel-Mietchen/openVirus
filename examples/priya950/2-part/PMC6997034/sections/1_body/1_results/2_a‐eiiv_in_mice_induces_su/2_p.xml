<p>Cross‐reactive antibodies for an antigenically older H3N2 virus (H3‐1968), conserved proteins (NP) and functionally conserved targets (H3‐stem and H1‐stem) were also assessed (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h and Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>b). Again, only A‐eIIV compared with S‐IIV had significantly elevated IgG for H3N2‐1968 HA, H3‐stem (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h) and H1‐stem (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>b). Cross‐reactive NP‐specific IgG responses were comparable for S‐IIV, A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h). As the recombinant HA protein vaccine, R‐eIIV, also does not contain NP, no substantial NP‐specific IgG responses were detected. Cross‐reactive H3N2‐1968 HA IgG responses by A‐eIIV were predominantly high‐avidity and significantly increased in magnitude (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>i), whilst both high‐ and low‐avidity H3‐stem‐specific IgG were increased for A‐eIIV (
