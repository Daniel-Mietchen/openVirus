<p>We assessed anti‐HA IgG titres (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and avidity (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) against a representative vaccine strain H3N2‐2013. Antibody responses were equivalent between all vaccine groups at days 7 and 30, but importantly, A‐eIIV and R‐eIIV H3N2‐2013 HA IgG responses were elevated to long‐term memory 1 year after vaccination compared with S‐IIV. The A‐eIIV vaccine also elicited a significant selective increase in high‐avidity H3N2‐2013 HA IgG at day 7, which was maintained 1 year after vaccination (ns, day 7 versus day 365; Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). A‐eIIV also elicited an increase in HA stem‐specific antibodies at day 7 from both H3‐stem (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015), which were unchanged at 1 year later (ns, day 7 versus day 365; Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d), and H1‐stem (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>a). Furthermore, H‐eIIV also mounted a short‐lived H1‐stem response at day 7 post‐vaccination (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>a). Therefore, A‐eIIV induced the most superior quality IgG responses in terms of long‐term memory, high‐avidity H3‐IgG and H3‐stem‐specific responses.
