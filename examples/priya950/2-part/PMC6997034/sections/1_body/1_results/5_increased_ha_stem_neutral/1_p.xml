<p>The A‐eIIV vaccine in mice and humans elicited significantly higher magnitude of antibodies binding to the H3‐stem (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, h, and i) and H1‐stem (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>b). We determined whether these antibodies were also neutralising using a chimeric H9/1N3 virus that contains a H9 HA head domain (A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/99) and a H1‐stem domain (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) for H1‐stem‐mediated neutralisation.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> The day 7 VNA titres against cH9/1N3 by A‐eIIV were significantly increased compared with S‐IIV response (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a); therefore, HA stem binding antibodies stimulated by A‐eIIV are also neutralising.
