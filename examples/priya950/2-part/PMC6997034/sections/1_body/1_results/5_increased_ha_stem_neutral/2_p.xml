<p>A H3N2‐1968 HA yeast surface display (YSD) library in combination with mouse serum from day 7 post‐vaccination was used to confirm and map the presence of cross‐reactive anti‐H3N2‐1968 HA antibodies from the 2017/2018 vaccination. Assay controls showed specific binding by H3N2‐1968 HA convalescent serum (0.82% HA‐YSD
 <sup>+</sup>) and minimal background from PBS‐vaccinated mice (0.05% HA‐YSD
 <sup>+</sup>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). However, we did not detect enough HA‐YSD binding in the serum from S‐IIV, H‐eIIV or R‐eIIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) for further HA‐YSD mapping, whilst A‐eIIV serum had a reliable population for HA‐YSD mapping (1.4% HA‐YSD
 <sup>+</sup>; Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>bc). HA‐YSD sequence analysis showed similar H3N2‐1968 HA binding of the A‐eIIV serum compared with the H3N2‐1968‐positive serum (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), without an enrichment of HA stem antibodies despite cH9/1N3 neutralisation and H3‐stem binding.
