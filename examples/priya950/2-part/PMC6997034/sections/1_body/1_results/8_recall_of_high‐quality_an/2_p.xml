<p>As antibody quality is a consequence of AID activity, the properties of immune sera at influenza challenge time points were further assessed. The H3N2‐1968 VNA titre at day 7 post‐infection was comparable between unvaccinated PBS mice and S‐IIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b), suggesting no recall of existing vaccine antibodies by heterologous H3N2‐1968 challenge; however, A‐eIIV had significantly increased early VNA responses during infection. Our FACS‐based 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> serum protection assay also showed an early increased day 7 neutralisation response for A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c), whilst other vaccine groups only developed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralisation activity later by day 21 post‐challenge when virus is well cleared. Importantly, the local mucosal IgA H3N2‐1968 HA response from the BAL of the lung of A‐eIIV mice showed significant early recall of vaccine antibody responses, with a significant H3N2‐1968 HA IgA response at the site of infection at short‐term post‐vaccination challenge, which was not observed in other vaccination groups, and a trend for increased IgA responses at long‐term challenge compared with S‐IIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Challenge at both short‐ and long‐term post‐vaccination time points showed A‐eIIV had significantly increased IgG titres and avidity of cross‐reactive antibody responses against H3N2‐1968 HA (Figure

 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>g), H3‐stem (Figure

 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>h) compared with S‐IIV.
