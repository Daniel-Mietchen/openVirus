<p>A‐eIIV increased the avidity and magnitude of cross‐reactive antibody responses, which was accompanied by increased Tfh and GC cellular responses in the iLN, suggesting an early and enhanced somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) response. Therefore, we assessed the transcription levels of 
 <italic>Aicda</italic> for activation‐induced cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme, which is responsible for the B‐cell receptor maturation through the SHM process in the light zone of LN.
