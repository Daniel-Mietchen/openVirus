<p>Available eIIVs include vaccines that have a higher antigen content than S‐IIV, such as recombinant FluBlok (recombinant HA protein, three times of HA content) or FluZone high dose (subunit vaccine, four times of HA content), or contain adjuvants, such as FluAd (MF59). The adjuvanted eIIV (A‐eIIV), FluAd, contains MF59, an oil‐in‐water emulsion acting as both adjuvant and carrier for the antigens, previously increasing the breadth, diversity and avidity of HA antibodies.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> A recombinant HA‐only high‐dose IIV (R‐eIIV), FluBlok, has a reported higher vaccine efficacy than S‐IIV.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> However, focusing the FluBlok response to a single HA protein target, whilst a critical protein for viral entry, may diminish the breadth of vaccine‐mediated protection, neglect NA‐mediated protection and affect CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T‐cell‐mediated help directed at internal proteins.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> The high‐dose inactivated IIV (H‐eIIV), FluZone, induces significantly higher antibody responses and provides better protection against laboratory‐confirmed influenza than S‐IIV among the elderly.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> H‐eIIV has also shown improved immunogenicity by HAI measures in HIV‐immunocompromised patients, despite their low overall CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T‐cell counts. This indicates that increasing the antigenic dose may result in a correspondingly increased immune response,
