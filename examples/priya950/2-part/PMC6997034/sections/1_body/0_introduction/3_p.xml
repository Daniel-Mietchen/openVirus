<p>Structural and post‐translational modifications of the HA as a result of vaccine production methods, antigen dose and the inclusion of adjuvants may impact serological and cellular immunity.

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Initial results of HAI and T‐cell responses from our ongoing trial have shown R‐eIIV elicits higher titre microneutralisation antibody titres against influenza A (H3N2) and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T‐cell boosting, followed by H‐eIIV, then A‐eIIV.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Parallel comparison of eIIVs through experimental immunogenicity studies may help elucidate their mechanism of action, as large‐scale efficacy studies are rare for already‐licensed vaccines. In this study, we extended serological results from our ongoing randomised trial of eIIVs in older adults to a vaccination‐challenge mouse model to assess eIIV‐mediated protection.
