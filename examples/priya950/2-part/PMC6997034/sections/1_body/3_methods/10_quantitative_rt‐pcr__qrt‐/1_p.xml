<p>Quantitative RT‐PCR was performed for the murine 
 <italic>Aicda</italic> (AID), 
 <italic>Bcl6, Pax5, IRF4</italic> and 
 <italic>C‐Myc</italic> genes on B cells isolated from mouse iLNs using magnetic B‐cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and a reverse transcription using oligo‐dT primers with PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TAKARA, Kusatsu, Japan) was performed. The cDNA was then used in the qPCR (Fast SYBR Green, ABI, St. Louis, MO, USA) with gene‐specific primers (Supplementary table 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>), then run and analysed in the LightCycler 480 (Roche). To quantify the gene expression, relative qRT‐PCR was performed by normalising the data to the GAPDH gene expression.
