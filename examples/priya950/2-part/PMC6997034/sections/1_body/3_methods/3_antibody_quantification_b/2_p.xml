<p>The H1‐stem (A/California/07/2009) and H3‐stem (A/Aichi/2/1968) proteins (from Raghavan Varadarajan, Indian Institute of Science) were made as previously described.

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> Recombinant HA, NP proteins (at 80 ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and HA stem protein (at 800 ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were coated on 96‐well flat‐bottom immunosorbent plates (Nunc Immuno MaxiSorp, Roskilde, Denmark), in 100 μL coating buffer (PBS with 53% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and 42% NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. An additional plate coated with a non‐specific protein (blocking buffer, PBS with 5% FBS) was used to measure the background binding of each individual mouse serum and used as a background subtraction from protein‐specific responses. Following FBS blocking and thorough washing, diluted serum samples (starting at 1:100) were bound for 2 h, further washed and then detected by an anti‐mouse or anti‐human Ig secondary antibody labelled with HRP specific for selected antibody classes or subclasses as indicated (IgG, or anti‐mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgA or IgM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
