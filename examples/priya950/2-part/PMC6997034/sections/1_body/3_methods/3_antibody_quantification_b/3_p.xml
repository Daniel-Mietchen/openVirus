<p>High‐avidity antibodies were measured by an incubation 15 min with 8 
 <sc>m</sc> urea, after serum binding to remove low‐avidity antibodies, and then, the remaining IgG response represents high‐avidity antibodies.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> TMB/peroxide was used as substrate, and the reaction was stopped by addition of sulphuric acid (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and optical density (O.D.) absorbance was read at 450 nm. A standard range was performed for all ELISAs as an interexperimental control, using pooled recovered post‐infection mouse serum for H1N1‐2009, H3N2‐1968 or H7N7 viruses, and enabling the expression of results in arbitrary units (A.U.) relative to either H1, H3 or H7 proteins in A.U. Finally, to allow a quantitative comparison of the diverse IgG subclasses, the levels of the IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b in these positive control serums were measured in ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup> with total IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b ELISA kits (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA). IgA quantification in the BAL fluid (BALF) was normalised per protein concentration as measured by BCA assay.
