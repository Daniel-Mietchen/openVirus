<p>Vaccinated mice were challenged 21 days or 6 months after the booster dose, and anaesthetised mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose (20LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of either H1N1‐2009 (A/California/07/2009, 1.375 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu 25 μL
 <sup>−1</sup>) or H3N2‐1968 (A/Hong Kong/1/1968 MAC20, 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu 25 μL
 <sup>−1</sup>), and culled at day 7 or 21 after challenge (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) virus was used for ‘homologous’ challenge representing the A/Michigan/45/2015 H1N1 vaccine component (HA amino acid conservation of 97%). Alternatively, to assess the breadth of vaccine‐mediated protection from eIIV versus S‐IIV, mice were challenged with a ‘drifted’ H3N2 strain, from 46 years earlier of the vaccine strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014) with A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK/68) for ‘heterologous’ challenge (HA amino acid conservation of 85.3%).
