<p>To assess eIIV immunogenicity and vaccine‐mediated protection, female 6‐week‐old BALB/c mice were vaccinated twice 21 days apart via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with either the S‐IIV, eIIV or PBS (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), with a third of a human dose in 100 μL (Table 
 <xref rid="cti21107-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mice were vaccinated with the Northern Hemisphere 2017/2018 containing A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09‐like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)‐like virus and B/Brisbane/60/2008‐like virus (Victoria lineage). S‐IIV and R‐eIIV were quadrivalent and contained a second influenza B virus, B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage). For assessment of vaccination responses, mice were culled at day 7 or 21 after the second booster vaccination dose.
