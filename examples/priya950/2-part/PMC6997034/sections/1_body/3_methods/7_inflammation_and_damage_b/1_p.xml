<p>Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were harvested in total 3 mL MEM, and cells were pelted for immunological staining and supernatant for measuring total protein and cytokine concentrations. Total protein was measured on BAL fluids with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a twofold standard range using BSA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical densities were read on a plate reader at 562 nm. For the measurement of cytokines in the BAL, a custom 12‐cytokine LegendPlex (Biolegend) panel included the following: IFN‐γ, IL‐6, TNF‐α, IL‐9, IL‐2, IL‐21, IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4. Standard wells were run in duplicates from individual lung homogenate supernatants (
