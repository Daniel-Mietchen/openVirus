<p>Our randomised clinical trial was designed to assess immunogenicity, not vaccine efficacy against clinical outcomes. Therefore, we assessed S‐IIV versus three different eIIVs in parallel in mice followed by challenge with a lethal heterologous influenza strain, enabling access to infected tissues and immune sites that are constrained in human studies. In addition, the naïve mouse status enables direct comparison of direct vaccine immunogenicity without interference of prior immunity. Whilst IgG subclass function, age, exposure history, vaccine dosage and duration of responses may differ between mice and humans, the mouse model is an important but limited resource to benchmark vaccine responses.</p>
