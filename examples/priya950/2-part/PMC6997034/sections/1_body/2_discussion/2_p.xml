<p>Results from our randomised trial of eIIVs in older adults showed that A‐eIIV increased the long‐term avidity of H3‐2013‐specific HA IgG early after vaccination in conjunction with an increased IgG response towards H1‐stem and H3‐stem and, to a lesser extent, H‐eIIV also increased H1‐stem IgG responses. The HA stem of the HA protein harbours functionally conserved neutralising epitopes, which may enable broader protection against different influenza strains,
