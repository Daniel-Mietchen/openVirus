<p>Our study focused on H3N2 responses stimulated by eIIV because of the recent lower vaccine efficacy against this virus subtype.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Some limitations of our study include the use of mismatched antigens to characterise vaccine immune responses. Because of the lack of commercial full‐length HA proteins for the H3N2‐2014 virus (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014), we used the H3N2‐2013 HA protein from a recent virus (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013), which has over 98% amino acid similarity and high level of cross‐reactivity. Furthermore, H3N2‐2016 HA probes from B‐cell staining at long‐term challenge were from a different H3N2 strain again, H3‐2016 (A/Singapore/INFIMH‐16‐0019/2016) – as these are precious non‐commercial trimeric‐HA fluorescent probes, we used that which was available to us. Challenge of mice with a more closely related H3N2 virus may have yielded different results, but the use of H3N2‐1968 virus is warranted to illustrate vaccine mismatch and heterologous protection. Despite a number of antigenic differences between the H3N2 vaccine and antigens within our immunological characterisation, A‐eIIV showed continued superiority. Another limitation is the use of young mice (6 weeks old) and older adults (&gt; 65 years) for the randomised clinical trial. The use of the mouse model was to study vaccine immunogenicity and protective potential directly rather than effect of age on vaccine usage and immunosenescence.
