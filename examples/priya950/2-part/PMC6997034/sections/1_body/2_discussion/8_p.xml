<p>Whilst A‐eIIV stimulated the strongest cross‐reactive responses, H‐eIIV also had some promising results. H‐eIIV displayed interesting protective features in the challenge experiments with a reduction of the lung damage and all inflammatory cytokines, particularly the chemokine responses, CCL2 (MCP‐1) and CCL4 (MIP‐1β), thus potentially reducing the local recruitment of inflammatory cells and deleterious inflammation, along with efficient viral clearance. H‐eIIV had an equivalent protective effect to A‐eIIV for reduction of the viral loads after long‐term challenge, which illustrates sustained vaccine memory responses. Also, H‐eIIV compared with S‐IIV elicited significant day 21 post‐vaccination antibody responses against the NA, NP proteins and H3‐2013 virus by VNA in mice and H1‐stem in humans.</p>
