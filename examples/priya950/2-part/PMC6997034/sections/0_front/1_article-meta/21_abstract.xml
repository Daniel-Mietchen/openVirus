 <p>In this randomised clinical trial, we showed that enhanced influenza vaccines boost antibody quality in older adults, and showed a particular advantage of adjuvanted vaccines for long‐term high‐avidity and haemagglutinin‐stalk antibodies. This action translated to an increased protection by the same adjuvanted vaccines in mice for reduced viral loads and inflammation as a result of early and enhanced B‐cell recruitment and activation for antibody production.
