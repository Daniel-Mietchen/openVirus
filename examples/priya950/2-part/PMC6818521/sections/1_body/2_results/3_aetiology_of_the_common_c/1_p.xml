<p>The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 30 of 42 patients, in 15 of 20 (75%) athletes and in 15 of 22 (68%) staff members. Nine different respiratory viruses were identified. Coronaviruses (229E, NL63 and OC43) were the most commonly detected viruses (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Two participants had two viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A and coronavirus OC43; and coronavirus 229E and coronavirus NL63). One athlete suffered from two different coronavirus (OC43 and 229E) infections 20 days apart. The recorded PCR threshold values mostly indicated low viral loads (
