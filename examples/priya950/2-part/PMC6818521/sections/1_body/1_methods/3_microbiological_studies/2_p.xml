<p>For laboratory testing, stored specimens were suspended into 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. Nucleic acids were extracted from 500 µL aliquots of the suspended specimens with the MagNA Pure 96 System using a MagNA Pure 96 DNA Viral NA LV 2.0 kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the Pathogen Universal 500 3.1 protocol and an elution volume of 50 µL. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at −70°C between analyses. Allplex Respiratory Panels 1–4 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and the CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 1–4 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 µL of each specimen per panel. The AllPlex Respiratory Panel also detected the following bacteria: 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, non-typeable 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. A laboratory-designed triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed as described earlier, with the exception that NxtScript DNA Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and Mic PCR instrument (Bio Molecular Systems, Upper Coomera, QLD, Queensland, Australia) were used for the PCR step.
