<p>This prospective observational study was carried out during the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea between 26 January and 28 February 2018. During the Games, the temperature and humidity measured by Team Finland varied between −17°C and +8°C and between 12% and 77%, respectively. Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (

Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. The team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days (with a range of 10–32 days). They lived in groups of 5–6 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats.
