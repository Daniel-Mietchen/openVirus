<p>We discuss three main findings from this prospective observational study. First, 45% of the elite athletes and 32% of the staff members suffered from the symptoms of the common cold during the median stay of 3 weeks at the Winter Olympic Games. Second, POCT multiplex PCR diagnostics rapidly detected influenza A and B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Third, the probable aetiology of the common cold could be detected in 75% of the athletes and 68% of the staff members. Coronaviruses were the most common causative agents. Unexpectedly, clusters of seven respiratory viruses were found within the team.</p>
