<p>Two previous studies by the IOC reported 2% and 4% incidences of respiratory infections in elite athletes during the Vancouver 2010 and the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, respectively.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Our observation (45%) contrasts those observations. The IOCâ€™s reporting system may not be reliable because it is based on voluntary reporting by team physicians, who may not be properly informed within the team. At the onset of the Games, in our study, the team physician informed all team members about the monitoring of the common cold. She stayed in the same building as the team which allowed for daily encounters with the majority of team members. Even one symptom or mild symptoms were reported.
