<p id="Par16">The results show that our model is able to reproduce both typical types of scenarios of the Zika epidemic. Depending on the parameter values characteristic of the given country, the simulations show that after one or more years, the number of susceptibles drops to a level where no further outbreak is possible, regardless of the annual periodicity of the number of mosquitoes caused by periodically changing weather conditions. The amount of newborns is not sufficient to provide a level of susceptibles which is enough to start a new outbreak.</p>
