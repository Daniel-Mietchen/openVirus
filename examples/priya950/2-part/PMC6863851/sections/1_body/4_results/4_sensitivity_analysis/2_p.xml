 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the comparison of the resulting PRCC values obtained for the parameters. The results suggest that the most important factors in Zika transmission are the birth rate of mosquitoes and the transmission rate from mosquitoes to humans. Although spread through sexual contacts has a smaller effect on the number of Zika cases, it is shown to be an important factor in the transmission of Zika virus. Considering this and the results presented in the previous subsections, our study suggests that the practice of safe sex among those who have possibly contracted the disease, can significantly reduce the number of Zika cases. However, the most important ways to reduce transmission are mosquito control and protection against mosquito bites.
