<p id="Par26">The Zika fever outbreak in South America, started in 2015, has been one of the most alarming epidemics in recent years due to its connection with microcephaly. Apart from vectorial transmission, the disease has been proved to be spread sexually, which is a previously unexperienced phenomenon among mosquito-borne diseases. Several mathematical models have been created to include the novel features of the disease, though, the majority of these did not consider the changes of mosquito populations due to periodicity of weather circumstances. In this paper, we have established a compartmental model to study the transmission of Zika virus disease including spread through sexual contacts, asymptomatic carriers and the periodicity of weather. Up to our knowledge, our model is the first compartmental model for Zika fever transmission which, besides considering both mosquito-borne and sexual transmission, the role of asymptomatic carriers and the prolonged period of sexual transmissibility, also takes into account the seasonality of weather. We fitted the model to the number of Zika cases in two countries where the Zika epidemic had a different outcome: Suriname, where there was only one peak of the epidemic and Costa Rica where two major peaks occurred in two subsequent years to show that the annual change of weather can be responsible for a recurrence of the epidemic after the autumn/winter season, though, depending on the circumstances characteristic for the given country, it is also possible that, even with the return of the rainy season, the depletion of the susceptible class might prevent a second outbreak.</p>
