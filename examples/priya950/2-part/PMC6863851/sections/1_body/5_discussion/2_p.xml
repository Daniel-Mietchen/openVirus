<p id="Par27">Using the fittings obtained, we studied the effects of sexual transmission, a novel phenomenon not experienced before in mosquito-borne diseases. We gave an estimate for the difference in the number of cases in men and women, possibly due to the asymmetric sexual transmission rates supporting earlier statements give e.g. in
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. This is especially important because of the severe side-effects in newborns of women infected during their pregnancy. Our results suggests that a 39–65% surplus in Zika cases in women in comparison with men, which can be attributed to the asymmetric transmission rates. These values are smaller than the ones given in
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>, however, as also suggested in those studies, this might also be attributed to the fact that women suspected to have Zika are more likely to visit their doctors. Further, we estimated the increase in the number of cases due to sexual transmission. We found that sexual transmission could be responsible for about 32–54% of the Zika infections. Our findings are in accordance with similar earlier estimates given in
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. These results of us suggest that the practice of safe sex among those who have possibly been infected can significantly reduce the number of Zika cases.
