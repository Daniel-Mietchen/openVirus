In 2008, a scientist contracted Zika fever in Senegal and after returning to the US, he infected his wife. This is the first documented case of sexual transmission of a disease transmitted by insects

The first cases in South America were discovered in Brazil in the spring of 2015, and several other countries from the region confirmed Zika cases at the end of 2015 and early 2016 (for the incidence of Zika fever in Central and South American countries affected by the epidemic 2015–2017, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The rapid spread of Zika in Brazil can be attributed to the completely susceptible population, high population density, tropical climate and inadequate control of

 </sup>. In October 2015, Brazil reported an increase in the number of microcephaly cases among newborns. In November, Zika virus genome was detected in the blood and tissues of a baby born with microcephaly in Brazil. In January 2016, intrauterine transmission of Zika virus was detected for the first time in two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly. An increased number of cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome was also reported from other countries of South America.
