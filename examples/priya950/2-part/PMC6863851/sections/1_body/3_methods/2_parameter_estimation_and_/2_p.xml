<p id="Par12">Using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients analysis (PRCC
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>), we performed sensitivity analysis, to determine which of the parameters in our model have the most important effect on the transmission dynamics. As a response function for these simulations, we chose the cumulative number of new symptomatically infected cases. The sensitivity analysis based on the PRCC ranks the effect of the parameters on the response function (or outcome), while varying the parameters in their given ranges (parameters with higher positive (negative) PRCC values are positively (negatively) correlated with the response function).
