<p id="Par9">As described in the Introduction, the Zika epidemic had different outcome in the countries of South America. Earlier mathematical models, though able to provide a good fit for the one-peak case, were unable to reproduce the situation with two peaks

 </sup>. The reason for this is that these models did not consider the annual change of weather conditions and the consequent annual fluctuation of the size of mosquito populations. This motivated us to establish a new compartmental model for Zika virus transmission which also considers the periodicity of weather. Furthermore, to assure that our model properly describes the real world situation, we also considered both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of the disease, and the two sexes were differentiated to make the model applicable for evaluation of the role of sexual transmission of Zika as well. As the number of sexual transmissions from women to men is reported to be very small compared to transmission in the other direction, in this model we only consider sexual transmission from men to women
