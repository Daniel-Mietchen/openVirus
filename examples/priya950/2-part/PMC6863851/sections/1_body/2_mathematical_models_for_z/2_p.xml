<p id="Par8">The majority of models so far did not consider the seasonality of the spread of the disease, induced by the seasonality of mosquito population size. In the present work, we establish a compartmental model for Zika transmission, considering the important features of the disease included in earlier models such as mosquito-borne and sexual transmission, asymptomatically infected people contributing to the spread of the disease, a prolonged infectivity through sexual transmission, and we also incorporate the effect of the seasonality of weather by introducing time-dependent (periodic) parameters. The resulting model is able to reproduce the different outcomes of the epidemic in various countries affected by Zika, and enables us to obtain a better understanding of the role of different parameters.</p>
