 </sup> introduced a compartmental model of Zika spread considering vector-borne and sexual transmission proposing an SEIR-type model for the human population and an SEI-chain for vectors. They separated asymptomatically infected humans from those who had symptoms, but males and females were not differentiated. The authors used historical data to approximate the parameters of the system. Baca-Carrasco

 </sup> proposed compartmental models considering vector-borne and sexual transmission (with the two sexes differentiated) and migration as well, showing that sexual transmission influences the magnitude of the outbreaks. Suparit

 </sup> studied the spread of Zika fever in Bahia, Brazil considering two vector control strategies: reducing mosquito biting rates and mosquito population size. The model also includes the influences of seasonal change on the ZIKV transmission dynamics via time-varying mosquito biting rate, however, it does not take into account human-to-human transmission. There are also papers which consider the importance of weather and climate changes in the models, see e.g. Caminade
