  <p>Luciferase activity. The MDCK cells were co-transfected with a reporter vector containing the target site of cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 (designated as pmirGLO_KPNA6) and a silencing vector encoding for scramble, cfa-miR-197, cfa-miR-215, siLuc2 (designated as pSilencer). (
   <bold>A</bold>) To determine whether the 3′-UTR position at 361–367 of the KPNA6 transcript was a target of cfa-miR-197. (
   <bold>B</bold>) To determine whether the 3′-UTR position at 4399–4405 of the KPNA6 transcript was a target of cfa-miR-197. (
   <bold>C</bold>) To determine whether the 3′-UTR position at 1169–1176 of the KPNA6 transcript was a target of cfa-miR-215. (
   <bold>D</bold>) To determine whether the 3′-UTR position at 2789–2790 of the KPNA6 transcript was a target of cfa-miR-215 (
