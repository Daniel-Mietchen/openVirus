   <bold>A</bold>) Validation of cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 at 24 hpi by RT-qPCR. Although both cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 were upregulated upon influenza B virus infection, the expressions of both microRNAs found in the MDCK cells infected with Yamagata lineage were significantly higher than those found in Victoria lineage infection (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 is designated as **; 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001 is designated as ***). RNU6-2 was used as an internal control and mock-infected cells were used as a calibrator sample. (
