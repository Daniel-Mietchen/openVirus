  <p>The miRNA expression profiles in each lineage of influenza B virus infection. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with mock, Victoria, or Yamagata lineage at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.01, and collected at 6, 12, 24 hpi. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Forty-six microRNAs were dysregulated in the cells infected with Victoria lineage. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Eighteen microRNAs were in the cells infected with Yamagata lineage. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Venn–Euler diagram shows unique and overlapped microRNA expressions in Victoria and Yamagata lineages.
