<p>The isolation of viruses is an essential process needed to further study influenza viruses, e.g., molecular characterization, in vitro and in vivo investigations. Nowadays, African green monkey kidney (VERO) cell line as well as Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line is utilized as permissive cells for influenza viruses [

It has been shown that microRNAs control gene expression post-transcriptionally by either translation inhibition or mRNA degradation [
