<p>To analyze microRNA profile, MiSeq reporter software version 2.4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the primary analysis of sequencing data. In addition to the exclusion of low-quality reads (Q-score &lt; 30), adaptor sequences were trimmed by the software. The passing filtered reads (Q-score â‰¥ 30) were aligned with canine genomic DNA (CanFam 3.1), mature and precursor canine microRNAs and contaminant RNAs. The sequencing reads matching to canine genomic DNA and contaminant RNA were discarded, whereas the reads matching to the microRNA database were considered as microRNAs. The microRNAs were identified and counted based on the number of reads matching to the miRBase [
