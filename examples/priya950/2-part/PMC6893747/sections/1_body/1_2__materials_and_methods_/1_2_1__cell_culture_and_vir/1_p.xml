<p>MDCK cells were seeded at 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Logan, UT, USA) in 24-well plates under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C for overnight. When the cells reached approximately 80% confluences, the media were removed. The cells were infected with mock influenza B virus Victoria lineage (B/Thailand/CU-B5522/2011), or Yamagata lineage (B/Massachusetts/2/2012) at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. After incubation with each viral suspension in overlay medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)) for 1 h, the viral suspensions were removed. The cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and cultured with fresh infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (
