<p>Following the targets of candidate microRNAs predicted by miRDB [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the list of genes was classified according to biological processes by using PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) classification system version 14.1 [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To predict the target sites, three web-based programs including TargetScan version 7.2 [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], miRDB [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and RNAhybrid [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were used on the basis of hybridization patterns between the microRNAs and their target mRNAs. Therefore, the criteria for the selection of microRNA targets based on effective hybridization patterns and minimum free energy (MFE) for base pairing less than âˆ’17.5 kcal/mol.
