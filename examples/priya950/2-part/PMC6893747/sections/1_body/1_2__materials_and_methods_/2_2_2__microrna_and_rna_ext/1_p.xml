<p>Cellular microRNAs were collected at 6, 12, and 24 h post infection (hpi). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and then dissociated with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). To isolate microRNA from the cell pellets, microRNA purification kit (Geneaid, New Taipei City, Taiwan) was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The concentration of microRNAs was quantified using Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Singapore) with a Qubit
 <sup>™</sup> microRNA assay kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). In addition, total RNAs were extracted using GenUP
 <sup>™</sup> total RNA kit (Biotechrabbit, Berlin, Germany), and then quantified by NanoPhotometer
 <sup>®</sup> (Implen, Munich, Germany).
