<p>For 3′-UTR reporter assay, MDCK cells were seeded at 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in media without antibiotic-antimycotic into 96 well-plates and incubated for 24 h. For transfection into each well, pmirGLO and pSlilencer were diluted with Opti-MEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and then co-transfected into the MDCK cells by using Turbofect (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), following the manufacturer’s instruction. The transfected cells were incubated under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C for 48 h, and then harvested. The dual luciferase assay was conducted using Dual-Luciferase
 <sup>®</sup> Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were washed with 100 µL of PBS and then added with 20 µL of Passive Lysis Buffer. The suspensions were then transferred into a Nunc
 <sup>™</sup> F96 white plate (Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). After that, 100 µL of luciferase assay reagent II (LARII) was added into each well. The emission of firefly luciferase activity at 560 nm was measured by Varioskan Flash Multimode (Thermo Scientific, USA) Before measuring 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity at 480 nm, 100 µL of Stop and Glow reagent was added in order to stop firefly luciferase. The assay was done in triplicates. The relative luciferase activity was calculated using signal intensities of firefly luciferase divided by 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase from a reporter vector.
