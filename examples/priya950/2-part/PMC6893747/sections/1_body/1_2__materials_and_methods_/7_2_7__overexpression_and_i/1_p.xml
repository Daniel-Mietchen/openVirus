<p>MDCK cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well overnight. For overexpression, the transfection of pSilencer_miR-197, pSilencer_miR-215, or pSilencer_Scramble was performed with Turbofect (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), according to the manufacturers’ recommendation. On the other hand, miR-197 inhibitor (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and negative control inhibitor (Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colorado, USA) were used for microRNA inhibition. The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine
 <sup>®</sup> 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), following the manufacturers’ protocol. After transfected, the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
