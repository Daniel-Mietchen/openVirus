<p>Recently, it has been evident that cellular microRNAs could influence viral replication and pathogenesis through virus-induced alterations in the host transcriptome. For instance, several microRNAs impair the production of interferons during hepatitis C virus infection [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, apoptosis is regulated by some microRNAs response to West Nile virus [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More specifically, hsa-miR-146a inhibits the expression of TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), affecting interferon production against enterovirus 71 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], dengue virus [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, our result demonstrated that cfa-miR-146b were upregulated during infection of influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). According to the microRNA database miRBase, the seed region of cfa-miR-146b is similar to that of hsa-miR-146a. Nevertheless, the function of cfa-miR-146b in the immune response to influenza B virus might be further explored.
