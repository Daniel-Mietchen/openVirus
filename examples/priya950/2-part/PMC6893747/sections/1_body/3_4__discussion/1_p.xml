<p>Nowadays MDCK cells are known to be permissive to influenza virus infection and replication. As a result of that, MDCK cells are widely used for identification and diagnosis of influenza viruses from clinical specimens. In addition, this permissive cell line could be utilized to produce influenza vaccines. Moreover, in vitro study is a cost-effective and accessible infection model for investigating hostâ€“pathogen interactions. Recently, a great deal of evidence has suggested that microRNAs play crucial roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, thus leading to controlling various biological processes within a cell. In this study, microRNA profile of permissive MDCK cells upon infection of seasonal influenza B viruses was investigated.</p>
