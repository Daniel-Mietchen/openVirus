<p>On the other hand, microRNAs’ profile upon seasonal influenza B virus infection has been little studied. Our result demonstrated that upregulation of cfa-miR-183 and downregulation of cfa-miR-486 were expressed in influenza B (Victoria lineage) virus-infected MDCK cells. This finding is consistent with the previous report of human lung epithelial cells infected with the same virus lineage [

Furthermore, this study showed that the expression of cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 was increased when the cells were infected with either Victoria or Yamagata lineage. Previously, microRNA-197 and microRNA-215 were induced by virus infections, influencing gene expressions in their host organisms. Hsa-miR-197 was downregulated by enterovirus 71 (EV71) to maintain ras-related nuclear protein (RAN), leading to nuclear transport of viral proteins [

The proapoptotic activity of lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD) was inhibited due to overexpressed microRNA-197 in lung adenocarcinoma cells [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, it might be feasible that both microRNAs are involved in influenza virus-mediated apoptosis.
