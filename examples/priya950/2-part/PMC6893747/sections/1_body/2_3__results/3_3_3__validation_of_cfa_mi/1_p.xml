<p>According to previous studies [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], two out of five microRNAs including cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 are involved in virus infections. Therefore, these two microRNAs were selected for further validation. To confirm the results obtained from high-throughput data, the expression of both microRNAs was confirmed by using RT-qPCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The results showed that both microRNAs were upregulated upon infection of either Victoria or Yamagata lineage, which were consistent with the profiles obtained from Next-Generation Sequencing. However, the cells infected with Yamagata lineage significantly expressed higher levels of cfa-miR-197 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005) and cfa-miR-215 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0018) than those infected with Victoria lineage. Meanwhile, the supernatants were collected at 6, 12, and 24 hpi in order to determine viral titer during influenza B virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The result showed that the replications of Yamagata lineage were 5.95-fold and 1.75-fold greater than that of Victoria lineage at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively.
