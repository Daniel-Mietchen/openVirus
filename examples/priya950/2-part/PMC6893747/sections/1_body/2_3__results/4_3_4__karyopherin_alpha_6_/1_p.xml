<p>In order to predict the target genes which might be controlled by cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215, three free-accessible computational programs including miRDB, TargetScan, and RNAhybrid were utilized in this study. Interestingly, the result demonstrated that KPNA6 could be targeted by cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215. In addition, the binding sites and the hybridization patterns between the 3â€²-UTR of the KPNA6 mRNA and the seed regions of both microRNAs are shown in
