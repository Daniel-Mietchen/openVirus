<p>The analysis of microRNAsâ€™ response to influenza B virus infection showed that five microRNAs were commonly upregulated in the Victoria and Yamagata lineage-infected cells. The target genes of these microRNAs were predicted by miRDB database, and then classified using PANTHER. This study demonstrated that the categorization of the predicted target genes was based on biological processes such as biological adhesion (GO:0022610), biological phase (GO:0044848), biological regulation (GO:0065007), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), cellular component organization or biogenesis (GO:0071840), cellular process (GO:0009987), developmental process (GO:0032502), immune system process (GO:0002378), localization (GO:0051179), metabolic process (GO:0008152), multicellular organismal process (GO:0032501), pigmentation (GO:0043473), reproduction (GO:0000003), response to stimulus (GO:0050896), rhythmic process (GO:0048511), and signaling (GO:0023052). The number and the percentage of the target genes were summarized in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00986-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. This finding showed that the major biological processes which were targeted by these five common microRNAs included cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, and localization.
