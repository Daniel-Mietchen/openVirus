Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">There is still limited information on the diversity of viruses co-circulating in humans and animals. Here, we report data obtained from a large field collection of enteric samples taken from humans, pigs, rodents and other mammal hosts in Vietnam between 2012 and 2016. Each of 2100 stool or rectal swab samples was subjected to virally-enriched agnostic metagenomic sequencing; the short read sequence data are accessible from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). We link the sequence data to metadata on host type and demography and geographic location, distinguishing hospital patients, members of a cohort identified as a high risk of zoonotic infections (e.g. abattoir workers, rat traders) and animals. These data are suitable for further studies of virus diversity and virus discovery in humans and animals from Vietnam and to identify viruses found in multiple hosts that are potentially zoonotic.</p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <p id="Par2"> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Taba"> </div></p><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Measurement(s)</td> <td>viral metagenome</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Technology Type(s)</td> <td>DNA Sequencing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Factor Type(s)</td> <td>related animal</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sample Characteristic - Organism</td> <td>Homo sapiens • Rodentia • Chiroptera • Simiiformes • Sus • Carnivora • Capra hircus</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sample Characteristic - Environment</td> <td>fecal environment</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sample Characteristic - Location</td> <td>Viet Nam</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p id="Par3">Machine-accessible metadata file describing the reported data: 10.6084/m9.figshare.9889709</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background &amp;amp; Summary</div> <p id="Par5">Viruses of zoonotic origin are a significant public health concern worldwide having given rise to a number of high profile health emergencies in recent years, including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, H5N1 influenza A and ebolavirus<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. However, detailed information on the epidemiology and evolution of viruses co-circulating in human and animal populations in the absence of significant outbreaks or epidemics is generally lacking. To help overcome this deficiency, the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS (VIZIONS) project ran between 2011 and 2016 with the overall aim of improving understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of zoonotic virus infections (particularly emerging infections) in Vietnam in south-east Asia.</p> <p id="Par6">VIZIONS was a Wellcome Trust-funded collaboration between the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the Sanger Institute and the University of Edinburgh in the UK, and Metabiota Inc. in the US, working closely with seven Vietnam hospitals, Hanoi Medical University, and Vietnam regional medical centres and sub-departments for animal health<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par7">VIZIONS supported studies in hospitals, communities and animal populations throughout Vietnam covering mainly enteric, respiratory, CNS infections and jaundice and generating data on clinical symptoms and outcomes, diagnostics, epidemiology and risk factors, virus identification, and virus genome sequences<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a>,<a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. The data reported here comprise metagenomic sequence data and linked metadata for 2100 enteric samples from humans and animals and come from two major components of the VIZIONS project, one hospital-based and one community-based.</p> <p id="Par8">The first component was a large hospital-based surveillance study: a retrospective case series of hospitalised patients presenting with enteric disease believed to result from an infection<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. The main aims of the study were to obtain high resolution data on all viruses present in these patients; to identify viruses of possible zoonotic origin causing severe disease (resulting in hospitalisation); and to estimate the disease burden due to viruses of zoonotic origin. This component contributed two additional sub-studies: a small study of only patients who tested positive for rotavirus A infection using a PCR test; and another small study of patients with undiagnosed enteric disease at four hospital sites.</p> <p id="Par9">The second component was a high-risk sentinel cohort: a prospective longitudinal cohort of people who have frequent occupational contact with animals and are thus perceived to be at high risk of developing zoonotic infections<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. This component contributed two sub-studies: the high-risk sentinel cohort itself; and a parallel study of non-human mammals with which the human subjects were in close contact. The main aims of the study were to characterise the diversity of viruses circulating in high-risk human populations and in the animals with which they were in contact (including those that were asymptomatic or caused only mild illness that would not be picked up in a hospital-based study), estimate the incidence of virus infections in the human cohort, and identify possible instances of cross-species transmission. Subjects were selected based on high levels of exposure to animals (mainly on farms, in wet markets or slaughterhouses) and were sampled routinely at regular intervals over a three-year period and during episodes of diarrhoea.</p> <p id="Par10">A metagenomic sequencing protocol using random primers and a reverse transcription step was used to identify viruses in faecal samples and rectal swabs from these studies. This method was considered to be less biased towards common pathogens and to yield more information than a battery of diagnostic PCRs targeting specific, known pathogens. Metagenomic sequence data would allow in-depth characterisation of virus diversity in the study populations. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis would provide insights into the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the identified viruses, including their spatial and temporal spread through human and animal populations and the inference of any zoonotic transmission events.</p> <p id="Par11">The great majority of the data reported here were obtained from Dong Thap, a province in the south of Vietnam that is regarded as a potential hot-spot for the emergence of novel zoonotic viruses. Dong Thap province is in the Mekong Delta region (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Due to its mostly flat terrain, the Mekong Delta is one of the most important agricultural centres in Vietnam, and it has high human and livestock population densities. Dong Thap has an area of 3,379 km<sup>2</sup> and is inhabited by just under 1.7 million people, approximately 4.7 million ducks, chickens and other poultry, 233,000 pigs, and 26,000 cattle and buffalo<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. Additionally, there is a vibrant rat trade, with many tonnes of live rats sold for human consumption each year<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. In addition, a small number of samples are included from other sites in Vietnam (see below). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p>Map indicating approximate geographical locations of subjects and sampling points within Dong Thap province. Inset shows position of Dong Thap province within Vietnam.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par12">Overall, sequence data and metadata are available for 2100 samples collected in Vietnam between November 2012 and May 2016. The numbers of samples from each of the five sub-studies are shown in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab1"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> </div></p><p>Origin of samples: overview.</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Study population</th> <th>Province(s)</th> <th>No. samples</th> <th>Sampling dates</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Hospital patients – enteric disease study</td> <td>Dong Thap</td> <td>602</td> <td>Nov 2012–May 2015</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hospital patients – rotavirus study</td> <td>Dong Thap</td> <td>49</td> <td>Mar 2014–May 2016</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hospital patients – DUO study</td> <td>Dak Lak, Dong Thap, Khanh Hoa, Thua Thien Hue</td> <td>56</td> <td>Nov 2012–Jun 2014</td> </tr> <tr> <td>High-risk cohort</td> <td>Dong Thap</td> <td>551</td> <td>Mar 2013–May 2016</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Non-human animals</td> <td>Dong Thap</td> <td>842</td> <td>Mar 2013–Feb 2015</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p id="Par13">1258 samples were obtained from human subjects (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). 707 samples were collected from patients admitted to hospital with symptoms of enteric disease. The great majority of these (95%) were from Dong Thap General Hospital (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). 551 samples were obtained from a high-risk sentinel cohort in Dong Thap province, most of whom were sampled on multiple occasions. These subjects are divided into four risk categories (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). 842 samples were obtained from a variety of non-human animals in Dong Thap province in parallel with sampling the high-risk cohort (Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Information on host species, sampling date, location and other attributes (see below) is available for all samples. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span></a></div>   <p>Age and gender distribution of participants in the high-risk and hospital based study.

Study design and recruitment</div> <p id="Par30">This study took place in Dong Thap Province between March 2013 and May 2016. The study design, methods and baseline characteristics of the cohort are described in detail elsewhere<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. Four categories of subjects with residential or occupational exposure to animals were recruited into the cohort: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par31">Animal farmers and their relatives, representing people with typical residential exposures to a variety of livestock species. This included keepers of both domestic and exotic animals, but excluded keepers of cold blooded animals. Poultry, pig and cattle farmers were originally selected at random from the animal farm census. Exotic animal farmers were actively sought as a group of special interest with the aim of maximising diversity of animals sampled. Up to four family members, including children, were enrolled from 61 farms.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par32">Pig and poultry slaughterers, representing people with more intense occupational exposures (particularly to blood). These were recruited from the three major abattoirs and slaughter points in Dong Thap Province.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par33">Animal health workers, representing people with intense occupational exposures to sick animals. These were recruited through the Dong Thap Sub-Department of Animal Health and District Veterinary Stations.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par34">Rat traders and sellers from three marketplaces.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria</div> <p id="Par35">Potential participants were included in the cohort study if they were long-term members of one of the above four risk groups; gave informed consent to sampling at regular intervals for three years; and resided within 40 km of Dong Thap General Hospital for clinical presentation in the event of illness.</p> </div> <div class="datacollection" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data collection</div> <p id="Par36">Included individuals were followed up for three years. Cohort members were requested to provide a rectal swab at enrolment, yearly thereafter, and when they reported an episode of enteric illness. In the third year of the study, stool samples were collected instead of rectal swabs, as it had become apparent that human rectal swabs generally did not have sufficient concentrations of viral nucleic acid for reliable metagenomic sequencing. Detailed demographic, socio-economic and behavioural data relating to food preparation and consumption were collected from each participant; these data are not reported here. A total of 551 samples were sent for metagenomic sequencing. These comprised: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par37">rectal swabs taken during baseline data collection (March–October 2013);</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par38">rectal swabs from episodes of enteric illness (April–September 2013);</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par39">faecal samples from the final data collection period (March–May 2016).</p> </li> </ul> <p /> </div> </div> <div class="non-humananimalstudy" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Non-human animal study</div> <p id="Par40">The high-risk cohort study also included the sampling of associated mammals and birds. This part of the study is described in detail elsewhere<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. A subset of 842 these samples was selected for metagenomic sequencing. This subset comprised all available rodent and bat samples, and a representative selection from other mammals (Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Bat and monkey species were not recorded during sampling, therefore this was predicted by querying the raw reads from bat and monkey samples against mitochondrial DNA databases containing Chiroptera (NCBI:txid9397, February 2017) and Simiiformes (excluding <i>Homo sapiens</i>) (NCBI:txid314293, June 2018) sequences respectively. This was performed using Blastn (e value &amp;lt; 1e-50) and selecting the species with the highest frequency of hits.</p> </div> <div class="viralmetagenomicsequencing" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Viral metagenomic sequencing</div> <p id="Par41">A total of 2100 samples obtained from the 5 sub-studies were sent for metagenomic sequencing at the Sanger Institute, UK. Samples were stored at −80 °C after collection and maintained at this temperature until sample processing (up to a maximum of 12 months). Samples were processed according to a modified Virus Discovery by cDNA Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA) method<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a>–<a href="#CR15">15</a></sup>. This method enriches samples for viral genetic material, which is otherwise difficult to sequence as it is naturally present at much lower concentrations than host and bacterial nucleic acid. It then converts genetic material from both DNA and RNA viruses to dsDNA to allow for metagenomic library preparation, using a process that is sequence-independent and reduces contamination by host ribosomal RNA.</p> <p id="Par42">Detailed procedures were as follows. Samples were suspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and 110 µl were used for nucleic acid extractions. First, viral nucleic acid was enriched for by the removal of cellular debris, mitochondria and bacteria with a centrifugation step (10 minutes at 10,000 × g), and subsequent digestion of any residual DNA with DNase (20 units TURBO DNase, Ambion) - viral nucleic acid was presumed to be protected from this treatment by encapsidation within virions. Protected viral nucleic acid was then extracted using the Boom extraction method<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a></sup>. Viral RNA was converted to a cDNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and a mixture of hexamer primers, designed to avoid binding to ribosomal RNA<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a></sup>. Subsequently, cDNA and viral ssDNA were subjected to second strand synthesis with 5 units Klenow fragment (3′-5′ exonuclease defective, New England Biolabs), and the resulting dsDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.</p> <div class="librarypreparationandsequencing" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Library preparation and sequencing</div> <p id="Par43">Isolated viral dsDNA was used to prepare metagenomic sequence libraries for deep sequencing, as previously described<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>. Library preparation followed standard Illumina protocols, with up to 96 samples being prepared at a time for multiplex sequencing. Nucleic acids were sheared to 400–500 nucleotides (nt) in length. Distinct 8 nt indexing barcodes were added to each sample’s nucleic acid before pooling. Each pool was sequenced divided over two lanes. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq. 2500 machines, yielding up to several million 250 nt paired-end reads per sample. Adapters were trimmed off with Biobambam2<sup><a href="#CR18">18</a></sup>. For ethical reasons, human-derived sequences were identified by aligning reads to the GRCh38 reference genome (without Epstein-Barr virus) with BWA-backtrack<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>, and then removed. The resulting sequence data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in two batches, the first by Wellcome Sanger Institute as study PRJEB6505<sup><a href="#CR20">20</a></sup> and the second by the University of Edinburgh as study PRJEB26687<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a></sup>.

Ethics</div> <p id="Par44">Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects. All sampling and testing procedures were carried out in accordance with guidelines that had previously been reviewed and approved by the relevant institutional ethics committees for human and veterinary medicine. This includes the Ethics Board of Dong Thap Hospital and the review board of sub-Department of Animal Health (for work carried out in Dong Thap); the Ethics Board Hospital of Tropical Diseases and the review board of the sub-Department of Animal Health (for work carried out in Dong Thap province) and the Hanoi Medical University and the review board of the sub-Department of Animal Health in Ha Noi (for work carried out in Ha Noi).
