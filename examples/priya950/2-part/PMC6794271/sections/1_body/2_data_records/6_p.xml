 <bold>Column D (Subject ID)</bold> â€“ Identifier for each individual study subject (hospital patient, cohort member or animal). Study subjects may have had multiple samples taken, hence this identifier is not unique to a sample. It consists of a study code (04VZ for the hospital study, 05VZ for the cohort study), a location code (10 for Dong Thap hospital, or 75-nn for cohort study sites), and an individual identifier.
