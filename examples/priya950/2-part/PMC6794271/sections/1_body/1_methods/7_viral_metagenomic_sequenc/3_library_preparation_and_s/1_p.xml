<p id="Par43">Isolated viral dsDNA was used to prepare metagenomic sequence libraries for deep sequencing, as previously described

 </sup>. Library preparation followed standard Illumina protocols, with up to 96 samples being prepared at a time for multiplex sequencing. Nucleic acids were sheared to 400–500 nucleotides (nt) in length. Distinct 8 nt indexing barcodes were added to each sample’s nucleic acid before pooling. Each pool was sequenced divided over two lanes. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq. 2500 machines, yielding up to several million 250 nt paired-end reads per sample. Adapters were trimmed off with Biobambam2

 </sup> and the second by the University of Edinburgh as study PRJEB26687
