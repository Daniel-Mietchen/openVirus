 </sup>). Between March 2014 and May 2016, 49 such patients were purposefully sampled in order to provide rotavirus positive samples as a partial validation of the metagenomic sequencing. These patients were additional to the routine sample collection from enteric disease patients described above. In all other respects these samples were treated in an identical manner to those from the enteric disease study.
