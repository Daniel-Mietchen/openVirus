<p id="Par29">Between November 2012 and June 2014, stool samples from 56 hospital patients with an enteric disease of unknown origin (DUO) were sent for metagenomic sequencing. The samples were collected from Dak Lak Provincial Hospital (23), Khanh Hoa Provincial Hospital (8), Hue Provincial Hospital (8) and Dong Thap General Hospital (19). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as for the main enteric disease study, with the additional criterion that no pathogen was identified by diagnostic screening at the hospital. In all other respects these samples were treated in an identical manner to those from the enteric disease study at Dong Thap General Hospital.</p>
