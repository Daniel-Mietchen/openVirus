 </sup>. A subset of 842 these samples was selected for metagenomic sequencing. This subset comprised all available rodent and bat samples, and a representative selection from other mammals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Bat and monkey species were not recorded during sampling, therefore this was predicted by querying the raw reads from bat and monkey samples against mitochondrial DNA databases containing Chiroptera (NCBI:txid9397, February 2017) and Simiiformes (excluding 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) (NCBI:txid314293, June 2018) sequences respectively. This was performed using Blastn (e value &lt; 1e-50) and selecting the species with the highest frequency of hits.
