 </sup>. Four categories of subjects with residential or occupational exposure to animals were recruited into the cohort:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par31">Animal farmers and their relatives, representing people with typical residential exposures to a variety of livestock species. This included keepers of both domestic and exotic animals, but excluded keepers of cold blooded animals. Poultry, pig and cattle farmers were originally selected at random from the animal farm census. Exotic animal farmers were actively sought as a group of special interest with the aim of maximising diversity of animals sampled. Up to four family members, including children, were enrolled from 61 farms.</p>

   <p id="Par32">Pig and poultry slaughterers, representing people with more intense occupational exposures (particularly to blood). These were recruited from the three major abattoirs and slaughter points in Dong Thap Province.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par33">Animal health workers, representing people with intense occupational exposures to sick animals. These were recruited through the Dong Thap Sub-Department of Animal Health and District Veterinary Stations.</p>
