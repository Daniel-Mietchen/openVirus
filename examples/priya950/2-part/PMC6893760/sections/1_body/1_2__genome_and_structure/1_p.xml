<p>The PeV-A virion is approximately 30 nm in diameter and is composed of a RNA genome shielded by an outer protein capsid lacking a lipid envelope [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The single-stranded positive-sense (+ss) genome is 7300 nucleotide (nt) long, contains a single open reading frame, and is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The 700 nt 5′UTR forms primary and secondary RNA structures that are crucial for replication and is attached to a viral protein called VPg [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) within the 5′UTR facilitates a direct cap-independent translation of a single large polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and seven non-structural proteins (2A–C and 3A–D) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The 300 nt 3′UTR terminates with a polyadenylated tail [
