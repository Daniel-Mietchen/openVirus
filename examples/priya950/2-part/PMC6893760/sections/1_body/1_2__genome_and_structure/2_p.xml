<p>All picornavirus capsids adopt an icosahedral structure (see

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The three capsid proteins assemble into a protomer and five protomers together form a pentamer [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A total of 12 pentamers result in the final icosahedron defined by three axes of symmetry: (i) Two-fold axes along the edges of two protomers, (ii) three-fold axes along the protomer triangular faces, and (iii) five-fold axes along the pentamer vertices [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the atomic structures of PeV-A have revealed several features uncommon among other picornaviruses. The PeV-A capsid surface is relatively flat and misses the classic hydrophobic VP1 pocket (a target for small molecule capsid inhibitors blocking virus uncoating) as is seen in EVs [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The PeV-A VP0 capsid protein is not cleaved into VP2 and VP4 in the mature virion [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, RNA packaging signals appear to guide the PeV-A capsid assembly [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, procapsids (empty particles devoid of the RNA genome), as seen in many other picornaviruses, are not observed for PeV-A [
