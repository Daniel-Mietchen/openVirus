<p>Another reason for exacerbated disease in neonates upon PeV-A3 infection might be related to humoral immunity. We and others have shown the titers of PeV-A3 nAbs are below the expected levels of protection in adults over 30 years [

 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. This is further supported by the lack of neutralization of PeV-A3 in a small serosurvey of adults from Wisconsin, USA [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. This is different from PeV-A1 where the nAb levels are maintained in adults. No cross protection from PeV-A1 antibodies is expected for PeV-A3 and it has been shown that hyperimmune serum raised in rabbits against PeV-A1 did not cross-neutralize PeV-A3 [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, low nAb titers in women of childbearing age may lead to inadequate maternal antibody protection contributing to PeV-A3 outbreaks in infants. Hence, we speculate that the severe PeV-A3 presentation in young infants is due to both insufficient (adaptive) and excessive (innate) host immune responses.
