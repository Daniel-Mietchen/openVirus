<p>Neonatal sepsis, also known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is the most common severe clinical manifestation of PeV-A3 and points towards immunopathology during the PeV-A3 infection of neonates. Neonatal sepsis is associated with the increased vascular permeability and reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Viremia and increased BBB permeability resulting from neonatal sepsis during PeV-A3 infection may allow passive virus leakage into the CNS [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Thus, detection of PeV-A3 RNA in the CSF samples of severely ill infants may not be a sign of active virus replication in the CNS but rather a consequence of a systemic inflammatory response. This is supported by several studies reporting that PeV-A3 positive CSF samples often do not show increase in white blood cell count [

However, as a counter to this, our group has shown that PeV-A3 is capable of infecting neuronal cell lines and PeV-A3 isolates replicated human neuroblastoma cell lines more efficiently than PeV-A1, suggesting a neural tropism of PeV-A3 [
