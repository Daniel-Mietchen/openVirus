<p>Due to the lack of suitable model systems, the current understanding of PeV-A pathogenesis is very limited. Thus, the primary replication site and initial cell tropism as well as target organs (secondary infection sites) are unknown. PeV-A infection is presumed to occur via fecal-oral and respiratory routes based on similarities to infection routes of EVs and PeV-A detection in stool and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples [
