<p>Clinical manifestations following PeV-A infection range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe disease. While a definitive association with symptomatology has not been established for many of the PeV-A genotypes, the causal relationship of PeV-A3 infections with a number of clinical conditions is evident [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. PeV-A1 is associated with acute gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and rash in children between 6 months to 5 years [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition to these rather mild symptoms, PeV-A3 often causes severe disease in infants under the age of 3 months [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several outbreaks of neonatal sepsis-like illness due to PeV-A3 infection have also been recorded, most recently in Australia [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Central nervous system (CNS) syndromes such as acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis, and encephalitis have been reported for PeV-A1 and A3 [

 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. However, CNS complications are more commonly associated with PeV-A3 infection and in some instances, long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae have been reported [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. It must be noted that these long-term neurological complications are rare and further studies are needed to formally assess long-term outcomes [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Epidemics of myalgia and a case of myocarditis in PeV-A3 infected adults have been reported but overall, PeV-A detection in adults is rare [
