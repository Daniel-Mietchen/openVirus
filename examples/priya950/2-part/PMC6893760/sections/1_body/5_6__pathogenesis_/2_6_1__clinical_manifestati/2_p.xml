<p>PeV-As can be detected in feces, NP swabs, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most PeV-A epidemiological studies are performed using feces samples from children younger than 5 years of age, presenting with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Furthermore, some published reports focus on children with respiratory or neurological symptoms with NP, CSF, and serum samples [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Diagnostic detection of PeV-A is performed by RT-qPCR targeting the untranslated region (UTR) of the 5â€² end which is conserved among all PeV-A genotypes [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The PeV-A genotype is determined by the partial or complete sequencing of the VP-1 encoding region but genotyping is not routinely performed [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. PeV-A1-A6 can be detected by virus culture, but PeV-A3 needs different cell lines than the other PeVs and compared to molecular detection, this method is less sensitive [
