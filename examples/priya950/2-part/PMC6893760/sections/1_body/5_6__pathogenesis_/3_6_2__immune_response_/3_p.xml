<p>With respect to the antibody responses, although the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in an immunodeficient adolescent with a chronic PeV-A1 infection did not reduce the PeV-A1 viral load [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], IVIG administration was associated with the full recovery of a PeV-A1 infection in a child presenting with severe dilated cardiomyopathy [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. nAbs targeting the RGD motif cross neutralize other PeV-A genotypes (PeV-A2 and PeV-A4 to A6) that contain this motif [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Other immunodominant epitopes include the N-terminal region of the PeV-A1 VP0 capsid encoding region and VP0/VP3 loops on the capsid surface [
