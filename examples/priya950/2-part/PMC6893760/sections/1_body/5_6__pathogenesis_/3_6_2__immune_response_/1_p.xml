<p>Once the virus enters the body, the host immune responses are engaged to actively counter the viral infection. Unfortunately, the information on host immune responses against PeV-A is scarce. In general, the host innate and adaptive immune response appear to efficiently control the PeV-A spread as infections are largely self-resolving. Pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, form key host defense mechanisms against intracellular pathogens [

This recognition subsequently activates the NF-κβ signaling pathway and ultimately leads to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon β (IFN-β), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). It has been shown that PeV-A1 infection induces the type 1 interferon response by phosphorylation of the upstream IFN regulatory factor 3 [

We investigated the genotypic differences in the innate immune response between PeV-A1 and PeV-A3 using an adult HAE model system. We observed that PeV-A3 induced a significantly stronger activation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory signaling [
