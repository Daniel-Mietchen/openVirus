<p>Human parechoviruses, now officially known as 
 <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> (PeV-A), are common childhood pathogens with a potential for severe clinical manifestations in infants [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Yet, the current understanding of PeV-A pathogenesis and epidemiology is remarkably limited. While PeV-A shares some similarities to enteroviruses (EVs), research on the biological and clinical aspects of PeV-A infection highlights differences between the genera. Within the PeV-A species, one of the most intriguing open questions is the genotype-specific disease association, i.e., why is severe illness almost exclusively caused by PeV-A3 and not by other genotypes? This review aims to look into this enigma and discuss what is currently known about the prevalence of PeV-A and pathogenesis.
