<p>In conclusion, PeV-A are common childhood pathogens with a potential for severe clinical disease in infants. While current knowledge is limited, it presents a unique opportunity for picornavirologists to explore a clinically relevant pathogen. We anticipate that identification of a receptor and use of organotypic models will drive the PeV-A research field forward in the coming years. </p>
