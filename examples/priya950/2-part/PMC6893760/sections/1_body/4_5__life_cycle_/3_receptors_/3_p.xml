<p>The presence of a RGD sequence does not exclude the involvement of other entry receptors and ITG independent infection has been described in RGD motif containing viruses such as CV-A9 [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. We showed that heparin sulfate (HS) is involved in PeV-A1 infection in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. However, we could not confirm the role of HS in the HAE model [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In this model, we also observed that both PeV-A1 (with RGD in VP1) and PeV-A3 (RGD-less) preferentially infect basal cells from the basolateral surface (see

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Either, these closely related viruses are utilizing separate receptors to gain entry into the same cell type or perhaps they share a yet unidentified receptor. If it is the latter, then one interesting possibility is beta-2-microglobulin (β2M), a component of the antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex I (MHC 1) [

 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Initially, β2M was shown not to be involved in the PeV-A1 infection of A549 and RD cell lines [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, recent reports show β2M blocking significantly reduced PeV-A1 infection in the SW480 cell line and co-localization of β2M and PeV-A1 was observed in the A549 cell line [
