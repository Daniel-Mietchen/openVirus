<p>As a side note, β2M binding draws interesting parallels to echoviruses, under which the PeV-A was initially classified. Some echoviruses such as echovirus 1 use α2β1 ITG as a primary receptor but this ITG is not a receptor for other echoviruses [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. FcRn has a binding partner in β2M and loss of β2M expression renders cells resistant to echovirus infection. Perhaps, through β2M, PeV-A share more than clinical similarities to echoviruses.
