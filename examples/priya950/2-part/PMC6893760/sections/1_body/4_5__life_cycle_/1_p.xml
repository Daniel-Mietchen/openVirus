<p>The PeV-A life cycle after entry is assumed to be similar to other picornaviruses (for review see [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]) but experimental evidence is lacking. Briefly, once the virus binds to the host cell surface receptor, endocytosis is initiated. This is followed by uncoating and RNA genome release into the cytoplasm. Then the viral RNA is translated by the host ribosomes into the polyprotein precursor. Subsequently, an extensive remodeling of the intracellular membranes is induced. This results in the formation of either single- or bilayer lipid vesicles termed replication organelles, where replication occurs [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The new RNA can serve as a template for further rounds of replications or be translated in a cap-independent manner into a single large polyprotein. This polyprotein is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins. Unlike many other picornaviruses, the PeV-A VP0 capsid protein is not cleaved into VP2 and VP4, in the mature virion [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another unique feature for PeV-A is that the non-structural 2A protein does not possess proteolytic activity and induce host translation shut-off [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. At the end of the replication cycle, the RNA is encapsidated by the structural proteins to form new infectious particles. The final stage of the PeV-A life cycle is the release from the host cell.
