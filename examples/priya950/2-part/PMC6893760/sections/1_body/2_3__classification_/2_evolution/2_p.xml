<p>The location of recombination breakpoints seems to correlate to the genetic diversity in the PeV-A genome, both the nt and amino acid variability are higher in the structural region than in the non-structural region [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This illustrates antigenic pressure on the structural region, while purifying selection is dominant in the non-structural region. Recombination might play an important role in establishing this as it would allow for mutations in the structural regions, while detrimental mutations in the non-structural region can be bypassed by adopting a non-structural genome segment from another PeV-A strain.
