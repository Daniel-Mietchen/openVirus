<p>The PeV-A lineage diverged from its most recent common ancestor around the year 1600 CE, while individual types might have diverged as recently as 150 years ago [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As with other picornaviruses, the RNA polymerase of PeV-A lacks proofreading activity and PeV-As have a high mutation rate of approximately 2.5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to this high mutation rate, recombination plays an important part of PeV-A evolution. Recombination has been shown to occur frequently between PeV-A1, A4, A5, and A6, with breakpoints mainly located at both ends of the structural VP1 region, and at the VP2/VP3 junction region [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Recombinant strains with a breakpoint located within the VP1 region are rare [
