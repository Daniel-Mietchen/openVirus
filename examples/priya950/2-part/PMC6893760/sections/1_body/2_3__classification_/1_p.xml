 <italic>Parechovirus</italic> is a genus within the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, comprising of small non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The genus is comprised of four species, 
 <italic>Parechovirus A</italic>, 
 <italic>Parechovirus B</italic> (formerly named Ljungan virus), 
 <italic>Parechovirus C</italic> (Sebokele virus), and 
 <italic>Parechovirus D</italic> (ferret parechovirus) [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PeV-A was first isolated as two unidentified viruses in 1956 in the USA from children with diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They were initially classified as EVs, echovirus 22 and 23, based on their similarity in cytopathogenic effect (CPE), their clinical presentation, and non-pathogenicity in mice and monkeys [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In 1999, echovirus 22 and 23 were reclassified as PeV-A1 and PeV-A2, respectively, due to differences in genomic structures, encoded proteins, and other biological properties [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 2004, genotype PeV-A3 was discovered in Japan followed by the discovery of PeV-A4 in the Netherlands in 2006 [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since then the number of PeV-A types increased rapidly with the development of more state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Currently, there are 19 PeV-A types known with PeV-A1 divided into clusters 1A and 1B (
