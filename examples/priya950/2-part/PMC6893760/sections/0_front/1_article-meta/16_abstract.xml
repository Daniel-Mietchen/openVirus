  <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> is a species in the 
  <italic>Parechovirus</italic> genus within the 
  <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family that can cause severe disease in children. Relatively little is known on 
  <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> epidemiology and pathogenesis. This review aims to explore the 
  <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> literature and highlight the differences between 
  <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> genotypes from a pathogenesis standpoint. In particular, the curious case of Parechovirus-A3 and the genotype-specific disease association will be discussed. Finally, a brief outlook on 
  <italic>Parechovirus A</italic> research is provided.
