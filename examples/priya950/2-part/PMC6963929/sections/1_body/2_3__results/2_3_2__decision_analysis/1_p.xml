<p>The high likelihood of infection coupled with the potential production losses attributed to FMD suggest vaccination would address public health concerns. The rapid spread of FMD within dense populations that graze on communal lands makes infection inevitable amongst non-vaccinated animals. Yet, using a vaccine of insufficient potency to prevent or stop the circulating FMD type incurs the additional vaccination cost on top of the lost animal productivity from infection with little to no benefits. Unlike in traditional vaccination games whereby free riding obfuscates vaccination uptake rates, uncertainty towards the protective efficacy of the FMD vaccine reduces incentive to vaccinate in endemic parts of East Africa.</p>
