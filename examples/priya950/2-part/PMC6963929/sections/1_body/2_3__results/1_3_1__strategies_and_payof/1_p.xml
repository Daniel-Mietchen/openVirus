<p>In a traditional vaccination game, non-vaccination represents the Nash equilibrium (
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00181-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To portray this decision in a simplified, one-shot game, we assume that ‘free riders’ who do not vaccinate benefit from herd immunity. If the individual vaccinates, then the individual receives protection from the disease, but pays the cost of the vaccine while the community either chooses to also vaccinate (and thus sustain the same conditions) (−3, −3), or free ride on the protective immunity from the vaccinators (−5, 0). The ‘cooperators’ who vaccinate receive a lower payoff. If neither player vaccinates, then both face the risk of infection, but do not suffer the costs of vaccination (−1, −1). In this game, non-vaccination aligns with individual self-interested behavior, especially when adverse vaccine beliefs accompany the decision [
