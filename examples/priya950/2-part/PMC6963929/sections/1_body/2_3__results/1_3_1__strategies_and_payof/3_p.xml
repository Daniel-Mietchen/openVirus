 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Individuals pay for a vaccine with no assurance of the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection. In reality, the individuals have information on the efficacy of past FMD vaccines and control policies, which resulted in limited to no protection against clinical symptoms. If an individual livestock-owning household decides to vaccinate, the individual incurs the cost of the vaccine, the related costs from treating an infected animal, and suffers animal productivity losses, regardless of others’ decisions (−15). If an individual does not vaccinate, then the individual only sustains the costs and losses from the infection (−5). There is no gain to free riding on the vaccination of others. Without the assurance that the vaccine offers a sufficient likelihood of disease protection, the dominate strategy for both players is to not vaccinate (−5, −5).
