<p>For infectious livestock diseases with significant individual costs in commercial agriculture, vaccination is often the dominant individual strategy (
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00181-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We assume that a vaccine offers a known probability of protection and the cost of vaccination is less than the costs and losses from an infected herd. If an individual livestock-owning household does not vaccinate the herd, given the payoff structure in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00181-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> that corresponds to the incentive structure for vaccinating in commercial settings, the individual will not free ride on the immunity provided by others that vaccinate (−10, −5). If no one vaccinates, the increased likelihood of infection offers the worst payoff for both players (−10, −10). Vaccinating with effective livestock vaccines at market price represents the secure strategy (−5, −5). Regardless of others, vaccinating households incur a small vaccination cost but forego the immediate production losses and longer-term disease implications, including mortality and morbidity risks. Here we have assumed no free riding, for comparison purposes, which could be incorporated, but would not necessarily alter the main points of this paper.
