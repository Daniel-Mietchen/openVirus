<p>For vaccination, assessing the disease in context is the first step in deciding whether vaccination is necessary. In some instances, vaccination may not improve individual health outcomes. Addressing individual preferences and adversities towards vaccines incorrectly targets the source of low uptake. Livestock-dependent populations in East Africa already vaccinate for the cattle diseases East Coast Fever and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia when vaccines become available [

For regions with multiple FMD types circulating, identifying patterns in FMD spread posits an additional approach to reducing the challenge of enhancing FMD vaccine efficacy, primarily by predicting vaccine demand instead of necessitating a polyvalent vaccine to address all serotypes [
