<p>The strategies presented here represent a simplified version of the vaccination game for complex diseases with ineffective or non-existent vaccines. The information is particularly relevant given current global challenges to create FMD vaccines specific to East Africa [
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The framework developed through the game theoretical model encourages those individuals seeking to define the demand for FMD vaccines to consider the costs of a low-quality vaccine and lack of quality assurance. Extending our theoretical analysis to a dynamic setting with repeated interactions and improved vaccine quality would provide an initial understanding on the stability of vaccination uptake if vaccination rates increased [

However, first understanding how to improve the efficacy of livestock vaccines in the field and identifying additional critical decision points to ensuring the optimal provision of health technologies will help increase the effectiveness of livestock inputs while enhancing returns to household wellbeing. Once FMD vaccines for East Africa ensure households may receive some protection from FMD, we can then perform cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate the impact across the diverse livestock systems, similar to studies evaluating current FMD vaccination practices elsewhere [
