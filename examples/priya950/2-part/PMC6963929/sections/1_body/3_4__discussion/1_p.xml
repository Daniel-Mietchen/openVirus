<p>A simple game theory model demonstrates how the presence of multiple FMD serotypes and sub-types coupled with the absence of a potent vaccine can make vaccination the least appealing disease control option. This is in contrast to other livestock vaccination programs with one vaccine or even vaccination for seasonal influenza where the vaccine may offer some protection [

In East Africa, without the assurance of a certain level of protective efficacy from vaccinating for FMD, vaccination presents an added lost cost on top of the inevitable costs of therapeutic, post-exposure treatments and the associated loss in animal productivity from infection. In effect, without a vaccine matched to the circulating serotype, vaccination is an extraneous expense without any assured benefits. Households in East Africa then reflect rational decision-making when choosing not to vaccinate whereby empirical evidence collected in 2016 and from 2012â€“2015 found less than five percent of households vaccinated for FMD [
