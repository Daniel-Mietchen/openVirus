<p>Improved information about the disease offers an opportunity to reduce the barriers to vaccination. Often, when low vaccination uptake is believed to occur from lack of understanding on the benefits of vaccination, educating local populations on vaccine technology and information campaigns to promote disease control are the preferred interventions [

From a theoretical perspective, if low uptake reflects self-interested motives and free riding tendencies, then combating these coordination failures through financial incentives may reduce asymmetries that deter public health objectives for elimination [

However, since households currently demonstrate rational behavior by not vaccinating, the challenge to FMD vaccination rests in increasing the likelihood of the vaccine preventing or stopping infection. Similar to influenza vaccination efforts that compile information early to predict the upcoming seasonâ€™s vaccination needs [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the diversity of FMD serotypes and sub-types along with the limited use of polyvalent vaccines in East Africa requires sufficient warning to vaccinate. Unlike other approaches to vaccination uptake, encouraging the use of early detection through diagnostic testing or other surveillance measures provides timely information to reduce uncertainty surrounding disease status and potential control options [
