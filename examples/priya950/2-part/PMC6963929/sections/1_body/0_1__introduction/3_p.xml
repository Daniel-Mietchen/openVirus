<p>Understanding how the characteristics of a disease and uncertainty of vaccine efficacy influence the individualâ€™s decision to employ disease control measures is important for devising effective control interventions. To this end, we evaluate the decision to vaccinate for FMD in the context of East Africa, where households face persistent disease threat but present with low-vaccination rates. We incorporate these conditions into a traditional vaccination game model by changing the payoff structure to reflect the FMD vaccination scenario. Our theoretical results substantiate empirical findings that attribute vaccination concerns to the quality of the vaccine [
