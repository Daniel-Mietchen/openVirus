  <p>Binding of MMAb 10G12 to loops 1 and 2 (LP12) of hexon. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified antigens. A 5 μg sample of reduced Fiber and LP12 of HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 was separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Western blotting analysis of binding between 10G12 and various antigens. A 7.5 μg sample of reduced Fiber and LP12 of HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 was separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane. Primary antibody 10G12 (1 mg/mL) was diluted 1:1,000, and secondary antibody HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG was diluted 1:5,000. Signals were detected using Western HPR Substrate Peroxide solution. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> ELISA analysis of binding between 10G12 and various antigens. Data were obtained from three separate experiments, and results are presented as means ± SD (**
