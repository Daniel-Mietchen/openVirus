  <p>Identification of mouse monoclonal antibodies (MMAbs) against HAdV-7. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Screening of scFv-displaying phage by ELISA. After three round of panning, 11 positive clones were identified that recognized HAdV-7. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ELISA analysis of binding between MMAb 10G12 and various antigens. The synthetic polypeptide antigen of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and influenza A virus H3N2 (A/swine/Colorado/1/77) served as negative controls. HAdV-55 was tested for potential cross-reactivity. Results are presented as means ± SD from three independent experiments (***

   <italic>t</italic>-tests). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Affinity curve of the ELISA results for binding between HAdV-7 and serially diluted MMAb 10G12. ELISA assays were performed with 200 ng of inactivated HAdV-7 per well. MMAb 10G12 was serially diluted from an initial concentration of 80 μg/mL.
