<p>To examine whether MMAb 10G12 was specific for HAdV-7, inactivated HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 were used as antigens, and inactivated influenza virus H3N2 (A/swine/Colorado/1/77) (Karasin et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and a synthetic polypeptide antigen of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (ETQVQRRQHTDVSFILDRFVKVTPKDQINALDLMQTPAHTEPGSRVTNVRGDLQVLAQKAARTLPPGSRHKQKIVAPVKQLL) served as negative controls. The MMAb antibody 10G12 was used at a concentration of 7.5 μg/mL. To examine the affinity of MMAb 10G12 for HAdV-7, inactivated HAdV-7 was used as antigen, and the MMAb 10G12 antibody was 2-fold serially diluted from an initial concentration of 80 μg/mL to 19.07 pg/mL. To identify which epitope MMAb 10G12 binds, fiber, and the hexon LP12 from HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 were used as antigens, and MMAb 10G12 antibody employed at 7.5 μg/mL.
