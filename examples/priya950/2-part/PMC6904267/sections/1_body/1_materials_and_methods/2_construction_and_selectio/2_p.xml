<p>Purified HAdV-7 (300 ng, 100 μl) in PBS was incubated in a microtiter plate well overnight at 4°C, then blocked with 3% BSA in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) for 2 h at 37°C. A 100 μl sample of phage library at 1.9 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu) per ml was added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C after a washing step. After washing, wells with TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), bound phage was eluted with 120 μl 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 15 μl 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). After eluting, phage was amplified by infecting
