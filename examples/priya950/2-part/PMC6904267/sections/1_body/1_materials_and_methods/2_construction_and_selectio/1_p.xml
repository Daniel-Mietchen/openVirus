<p>Preparation and characterization of the scFv-phage display library was subsequently performed. Female BALB/c mice at 6–8 weeks old were immunized with inactivated HAdV-7. Pre-immune sera were collected from mouse tails and used as negative controls. A 100 μg sample of inactivated HAdV-7 emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma, USA) was intraperitoneally injected, followed by four boosters of the same dose at 2-week intervals. Spleens were harvested 3 days after the final booster, and total RNA was isolated from spleen cells and was reverse transcribed into cDNA (K1621, Thermo Scientific, USA). Primers for reverse-transcription were PmCGR (TGCATTTGAACTCCTTGCC) and PmCKR (CCATCAATCTTCCACTTGAC). Full-length variable light (V
 <sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy (V
 <sub>H</sub>) chain genes were amplified by overlay-extended PCR and the scFv fragment was cloned into phage display vector pADSCFV-S. Competent 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> HST08 Blue cells were transformed with the ligation mixture by electroporation. Transformed cells were titrated on agar plates to determine the library size, and colony PCR was performed on a selection of colonies to determine the presence of DNA inserts in the vector. Harvested cells samples harboring the final scFv antibody gene library were combined, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C.
