<p>Viral DNA was extracted from A549 cells infected with HAdV-7 or HAdV-55 using DNAVzol (Vigorous, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. Genes encoding the hexon LP12 fragment and fiber were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pTIG-TRX vector. Primers used for PCR are listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (7LP12, LP12 of HAdV-7; 55LP12, LP12 of HAdV-55; 7Fiber, Fiber of HAdV-7; 55Fiber, Fiber of HAdV-55). The pTIG-TRX-LP12 plasmid was transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells (TransGen, Beijing, China) for expression of His-tagged fusion protein. Transformed cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin at 37°C, and recombinant expression was induced with 0.6 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) when the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.4–0.6. After reducing the temperature from 37°C to 16°C, cells were cultured for a further 16 h. Bacteria were lysed by ultrasonic treatment, and recombinant protein was purified by Ni-agarose resin.
