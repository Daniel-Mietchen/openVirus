<p>For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> adenovirus neutralization experiments, 100 μl of A549 cells (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were seeded in each well of 96-well plates incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Purified 10G12 was serially diluted 2-fold from 25 to 0.1 μg/ml in DMEM, and 50 μl aliquots of each dilution were mixed with 50 μl HAdV-7 or HAdV-55 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. Anti-DENV1 (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and anti-EGFR (CN102993305B) antibodies served as negative controls. Antibody-virus mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, transferred to 96-well plates containing 85–95% confluent A549 cell monolayers, and cultured in DMEM without Phenol Red or serum for 72 h. Infected cells were observed under a microscope and the number of holes in cells with lesions was counted.
