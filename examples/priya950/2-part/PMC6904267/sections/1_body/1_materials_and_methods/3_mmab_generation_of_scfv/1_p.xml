<p>PCR was performed to amplify the full-length variable light (V
 <sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy (V
 <sub>H</sub>) chain genes of positively selected phages. PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases 
 <italic>Sal</italic> I and 
 <italic>Age</italic> I, then cloned separately into pMABG1 and pMABKa vectors containing a mouse immunoglobulin constant gene. Recombinant antibodies were obtained as IgG1 molecules, regardless of their original isotype. FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected with equal quantities of plasmids encoding heavy and light chains using a FectoPRO transfection kit (116-001, Polyplus-Transfection, French) for antibody expression. At 4 days after transfection, antibody-containing supernatants were harvested, and antibodies were purified using HiTrap MabSelect Xtra (28-4082-60, GE Healthcare, USA).
