<p>HEK293F and A549 cells (ATCC, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Excell, China). FreeStyle™ 293-F cells (Invitrogen, USA) were cultured in FreeStyle
 <sup>TM</sup> 293 Expression Medium (12338; Gibco, USA). Cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The HAdV-7 GZ6965 strain (human/CHN/GZ6965/2001) used herein was obtained as described previously (Qiu et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and maintained in our laboratory. The HAdV-55 strain was isolated from a patient and kindly provided by Prof. Hongbin Song (Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China). HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 were propagated in HEK293-F cells grown in DMEM containing 2% FBS. When 75–95% of cells exhibited typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) consistent with HAdV infection, the cell suspension was frozen at −80°C and thawed three times, centrifuged at 4,000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was inactivated and purified using standard CsCl gradient centrifugation (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The obtained virus particles were aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
