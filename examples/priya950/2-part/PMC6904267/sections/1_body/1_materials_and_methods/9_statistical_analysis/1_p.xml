<p>All experiments were repeated at least three times, except for the stability assay. Data are presented as means Â± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. An affinity graph was plotted, and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software, too. The significance of differences in protective effects compared with controls was evaluated using two-tailed Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
