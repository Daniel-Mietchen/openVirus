<p>Purified antigens were quantified using a NanoDrop One
 <sup>c</sup> instrument (Thermo, USA). A 7.5 Î¼g sample of reduced protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Primary antibody 10G12 (1 mg/mL) was diluted 1:1,000, and secondary antibody HRP-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (ZSGB-BIO) was diluted 1:5,000. Signals were detected using Western HPR Substrate Peroxide solution (Millipore).
