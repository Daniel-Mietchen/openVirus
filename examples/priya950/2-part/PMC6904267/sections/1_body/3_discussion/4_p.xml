<p>In this study, we expressed and purified the recombinant LP12 hexon region. ELISA assay plates were coated with 200 ng of inactivated HAdV-7 or LP12 per well, and the affinity for MMAb remained the same (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This indicates that LP12 is present in the main neutralization epitopes of HAdV-7. Previous studies confirmed that hexon protein, the most abundant capsid protein, is the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) recognizing HAdV-3, -5, -7, -14, and -55 (Sumida et al.,

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Feng et al.,
