<p>Despite more than 85 genotypes have been identified for HAdVs, few neutralizing antibodies have been reported. Tian et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>) reported that the recombinant trimeric HAdV-11 fiber knob region is responsible for cross-neutralizing antibody responses against HAdV-11, -7, -14p1, and -55 in mice. Three neutralizing MAbs, 6A7, 3F11, and 3D8, were obtained via mouse hybridoma fusion, of which 3F11 and 3D8 cross-neutralized HAdV-11,-7, and -55, but not HAdV-14p1 (Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). Feng et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) previously demonstrated that a fiber-specific antibody in sera contributed to cross-neutralizing activity against HAdV-14 and HAdV-55. However, HAdV-55 is a recombinant chimera of HAdV-11 and -14 that contains the fiber gene from HAdV-14. Our current study shows that 10G12 does not neutralize HAdV-55, and has poor cross-reactivity, probably through interaction with non-neutralizing epitopes.
