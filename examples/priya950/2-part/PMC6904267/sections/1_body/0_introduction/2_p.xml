<p>Immune reconstitution plays a critical role in controlling AdV infection, and serotype-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) correlate with clearance of AdV (Heemskerk et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Echavarr√≠a, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The adenovirus capsid is formed from three major proteins (hexon, penton base, and fiber) and four minor proteins (IIIa, VI, VIII, and IX). Hexon, the most abundant capsid protein, recruits cytoplasmic dynein, a crucial component for transporting viral capsids along microtubules (Scherer and Vallee, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Hexon is also an important antigen for neutralizing antibodies against HAdV-3, -5, -7, -14, and -55 (Sumida et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Su et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Type-specific neutralization epitopes on hexon proteins of many adenoviruses are primarily located in seven hypervariable regions (Rux et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Pichla-Gollon et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bradley et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Qiu et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). Hexon stimulates type-specific neutralizing Abs (NAbs), whereas fiber induces Abs with cross-neutralizing activity against HAdV-14 and HAdV-55 (Feng et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, to date, only a few neutralization epitopes on the HAdV fiber knob region have been identified.
