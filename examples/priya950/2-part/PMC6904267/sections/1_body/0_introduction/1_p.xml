<p>Human adenoviruses (HAdVs), non-enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses spanning &gt; 85 genotypes, are classified into seven species (A–G) (Yoshitomi et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). HAdV infection is characterized by a broad spectrum of disease symptoms in humans, including sore throat, pneumonia, fever, and acute otitis media, with most cases involving gastrointestinal symptoms that vary with infection genotype (Arnold et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kunz and Ottolini, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Symptoms are generally mild and self-limiting in immune-competent adults, but outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases (ARDs), such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), can occur in newborns, school students, and military recruits (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). B1 type adenoviruses HAdV-3, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 are responsible for most epidemics in North America, Asia, and Europe (Choi et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; James et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Selvaraju et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tang et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gopalkrishna et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To date, no vaccines for the general population available for HAdVs, and only vaccines against HAdV types 4 and 7 have been developed for the USA military (Russell et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kajon et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Additionally, no antiviral drugs or efficient antiviral therapies have been approved for treating HAdVs (Echavarría, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).
