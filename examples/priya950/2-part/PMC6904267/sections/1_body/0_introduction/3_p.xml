<p>In the present study, scFv 10G12 was screened from an scFv-phage antibody immune library and subcloned to generate an MMAb. We identified MMAb 10G12 as a potent antibody that effectively targets HAdV-7 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at low concentrations by binding to hexon loop1 and loop2 (LP12). MMAb 10G12 displayed good stability in serum and phosphate buffer (PB) at different pH values.
