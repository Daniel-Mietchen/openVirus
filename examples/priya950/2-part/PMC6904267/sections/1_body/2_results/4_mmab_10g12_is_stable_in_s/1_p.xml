<p>To test MMAb stability in serum, purified 10G12 was diluted in FBS to 25 μg/ml and incubated in 37°C for 3, 7, and 10 days. ELISA assays were then performed to detect whether samples still efficiently recognized HAdV-7. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, compared with day 0, the binding activity of samples diluted in FBS after 3, 7, and 10 days decreased by a statistically significant amount. However, even after 10 days of incubation at 37°C, the binding activity was only decreased 20%. Additionally, from day 3 to 10, the binding activity did not decrease with increasing incubation duration. Differences between fetal bovine serum and the mouse monoclonal antibody may explain this decrease in binding activity. The results indicate that MMAb 10G12 was relatively stable in serum.
