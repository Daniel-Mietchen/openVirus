<p>To examine the neutralization potential of MMAb 10G12, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> adenovirus neutralization experiments were performed using A549 cells. Purified 10G12 was serially diluted 2-fold from 25 to 0.1 μg/ml in DMEM, and 50 μl aliquots of each dilution were mixed with 50 μl HAdV-7 or HAdV-55 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. The antibody-virus mixtures were transferred to A549 cells, and every dilution included eight replicates. After 72 h, infected cells were observed under the microscope, and wells containing surviving cells were counted. Two antibodies (anti-DENV and anti-EGFR) served as negative controls. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 50 μl aliquots of 10G12 with 0.4 μg/ml could neutralize 100% of 50 μl HAdV-7 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, and all cells at this dilution had no lesions. Even 50 μl aliquots of 10G12 with 0.2 μg/ml could neutralize 50% of 50 μl HAdV-7 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, but cells at this dilution had partial lesions. Furthermore, even 10G12 at 25 μg/ml was unable to neutralize HAdV-55 with 100TCID
 <sub>50.</sub> These findings indicate that MMAb 10G12 exhibited strong neutralization activity against HAdV-7 and poor cross-reactivity with HAdV-55.
