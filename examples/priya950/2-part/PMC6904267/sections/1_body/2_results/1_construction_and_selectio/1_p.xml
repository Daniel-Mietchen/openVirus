<p>Female BALB/c mice at 6–8 weeks old were immunized with inactivated HAdV-7, and spleens were harvested for RNA extraction after four booster injections. Genes encoding V
 <sub>L</sub> and V
 <sub>H</sub> chains were amplified by PCR, and DNA fragments of the expected size (350 bp) were obtained. Overlay-extended PCR was performed to generate scFv DNA fragments of ~750 bp, which were then cloned into the phage vector pADSCFV-S. The final scFv antibody gene library consisted of 1.9 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> independent clones, with 80% correctness.
