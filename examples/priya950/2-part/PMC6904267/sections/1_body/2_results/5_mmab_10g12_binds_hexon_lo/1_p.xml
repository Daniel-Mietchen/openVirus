<p>Hexon is an important antigen of neutralizing antibodies, and fiber also has a few neutralization epitopes. To determine to which epitope MMAb 10G12 binds, fragments comprising loop1 and loop2 (LP12) of hexon and fiber from HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pTIG-TRX. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the results of western blotting showed that MMAb 10G12 bound LP12 of HAdV-7 but not HAdV-55 or fiber (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). When using reduced protein samples for SDS-PAGE, 10G12 should bind the linear epitopes of 7LP12. Thus, ELISA assay plates were coated with LP12 or fiber from HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 at 200 ng per well, and the affinity for MMAb 10G12 was measured. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, MMAb 10G12 bound LP12 of HAdV-7 but not fiber, consistent with the results of western blotting in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>. However, the ELISA result showed that 10G12 bound LP12 of HAdV-55 with weaker affinity than HAdV-7. Combined with the western blotting results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, this indicates that 10G12 might bind some spatial epitopes of 55LP12. However, 10G12 did not neutralize HAdV-55 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that these might be non-neutralizing spatial epitopes. In summary, MMAb 10G12 clearly bound the hexon LP12 region.
