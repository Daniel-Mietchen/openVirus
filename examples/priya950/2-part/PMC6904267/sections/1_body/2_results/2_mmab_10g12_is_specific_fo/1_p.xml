<p>To examine whether MMAb 10G12 is specific for HAdV-7, an ELISA assay was performed. Since positive clones bound to various unrelated viruses in the previous selection of the scFv-phage antibody library, two unrelated antigens (influenza virus H3N2 and the synthetic polypeptide antigen of FMDV) were included as negative controls. Additionally, since there are more than 85 HAdV genotypes, HAdV-55 was tested for potential cross-reactivity with MMAb 10G12. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, MMAb 10G12 bound to inactivated HAdV-7, but not to inactivated influenza virus H3N2, the synthetic polypeptide antigen of FMDV, or HAdV-55. Furthermore, ELISA assay was performed to test the affinity of MMAb 10G12 for HAdV-7. Based on the absorbance at 492 nm, and affinity graph was plotted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (

 <sub>50</sub> values indicated that the affinity between MMAb and HAdV-7 was 0.14 nM.
