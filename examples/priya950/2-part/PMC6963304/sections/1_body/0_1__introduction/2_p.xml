<p>Highly pathogenic PRV variants emerged in several pig farms in China in late 2011 [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In previous reports, we analyzed all known PRV full-length genomes and all available gB, gC, gD, and gE gene sequences. We found that PRV could be divided into clade 1 and 2 based on the gC gene. The current vaccine strain Bartha-K61 clustered with clade 1. However, the most recent PRV variants clustered with clade 2. We previously reported that variant PRV forms and recombination in China could be the source of continued epidemics [

 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. So far, the most effective method of prevention and control of pseudorabies is vaccination. The emergence of PRV variant strains brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccines were not completely effective against it [

 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The fact that PRV can persist in the host for a long time after infection makes its prevention and control challenging [
