<p>Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer. After concentration, equal amounts of protein (20 ug) were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to the nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. The NC membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS added 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with specified primary antibodies overnight. After being washed with PBST for five times, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies (DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG or DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG) and subjected to LI-COOdyssey infrared image scanner.
