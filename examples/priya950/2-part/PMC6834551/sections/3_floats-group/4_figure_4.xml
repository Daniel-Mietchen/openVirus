  <p>C57BL/6 mice were infected with CHIKV by three different routes, and their footpad swelling and tissue viral distributions are compared. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1,000 PFU CHIKV SL15649 intramuscularly in the right calf (i.m. R calf), subcutaneously in the skin of the right calf (s.c. right calf), or in the right leg footpad (f.p.). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Footpad swelling measurements were taken at 0, 3, and 5 dpi using calipers. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Serum from CHIKV-infected mice was isolated at 3 dpi, and viremia was measured by limiting dilution plaque assay on confluent monolayers of Vero cells. 
   <bold>(Câ€“F)</bold> At 5 dpi, mice were sacrificed and whole tissues were dissected and homogenized in 1 ml cell culture media. Infectious viral levels in the ankle and calf muscle tissue homogenate were measured by limiting dilution plaque assay on confluent monolayers of Vero cells (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5).
