  <p>CHKVf5 vaccines did not protect mice against a footpad CHIKV challenge. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mice were administered MCMV-CHKVf5, MCMV WT, or PBS i.p. for 8 weeks and then analyzed by ELISpot for the presence of T cell responses or challenged. Separate groups of mice were vaccinated with AdV-CHKVf5 or AdV-Control for 2 weeks. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Splenocytes from two mice per group were collected and IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed by stimulating the splenocytes with CHIKV peptides incorporated in the CHKVf5 fusion gene. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> IFNγ ELISpot assay performed using splenocytes from mice vaccinated with the indicated vaccine and challenged with CHIKV SL15649 in the footpad (“#” indicates too numerous to count; “nd” indicates not done). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Footpad thickness was measured using calipers from 3 to 16 dpi. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> At 3 dpi, mice were bled and their serum was titered by limiting dilution plaque assay on confluent monolayers of Vero cells. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> At 3 dpi, viral RNA extracted from ipsilateral and contralateral ankles and ipsilateral quadriceps was quantified by qRT-PCR. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> At 4 wpi, viral RNA was extracted from ipsilateral and contralateral ankles and viral RNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR.
