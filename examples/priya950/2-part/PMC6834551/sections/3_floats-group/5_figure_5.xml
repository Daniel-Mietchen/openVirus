  <p>CHKVf5-vaccinated mice do not develop neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV, but their splenocytes produce IFNγ in response to CHIKV peptide stimulation. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mice were vaccinated with the indicated vaccine, challenged with CHIKV i.m., and harvested at 5 dpi. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Prior to CHIKV challenge, IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed on vaccinated mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 2), and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> sera from each of the mice were tested for neutralization potential via PRNT assays (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9). PRNT assay positive controls included convalescent mouse sera from a previously CHIKV infected mouse (shown in purple) as well as a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (4N12; shown in green). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Infectious virus levels detected in the ipsilateral ankle and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> ipsilateral calf. Statistics were reported on log-transformed data using Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test (*
