  <p>AdV-260 and AdV-451 vaccination reduces inflammatory cytokine production, protects mice from CHIKV-induced footpad swelling, and increases survival in

   <sup>−/−</sup> mice. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mice were vaccinated and boosted with AdV-260, AdV-451, or AdV-Control (i.m.) followed by 1,000 PFU CHIKV challenge in the right footpad. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Footpad swelling was measured for 13 days after CHIKV footpad challenge. Statistics were performed using Dunnett's multiple comparison test (*

   <bold>(C)</bold> Virus was measured in the ipsilateral footpad by qRT-PCR at 8 and 14 dpi. Statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed data using Dunnett's multiple comparison test. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Ipsilateral ankle cytokine and chemokines were measured at 4 dpi using a 26-plex mouse cytokine and chemokine kit. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison post-test (*

   <sup>−/−</sup> mice were vaccinated and boosted with either AdV-Control or both AdV-260 and AdV-451. Mice were challenged with 1,000 PFU CHIKV in the footpad.
