<p>CHIKV SL15649 and CHIKV 181/25 was generated from the infectious clones. Briefly, the infectious clone was digested with NotI, and DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral mRNA was generated with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher), and the mRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Roughly 3 μg RNA was transfected into Vero cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). CHIKV virus stocks were passaged once C6/36 cells for 72 h, and viral stocks were prepared by ultracentrifugation over a 15% sucrose cushion (SW 32 Ti Rotor, 1 h 10 min, 76,755 × g). The virus pellets were resuspended in PBS and aliquots were stored at −80°C. For CHIKV limiting dilution plaque assays, 10-fold serial dilutions of virus stocks or tissue homogenates were plated on Vero cells. The cells were placed on a rocker in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h, and DMEM containing 0.3% high viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (Sigma) and 0.3% low viscosity CMC (Sigma) was added to the cells. After 2 days, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Fisher), stained with 0.5% methylene blue (Fisher), and dried. Plaques were enumerated under a light microscope.
