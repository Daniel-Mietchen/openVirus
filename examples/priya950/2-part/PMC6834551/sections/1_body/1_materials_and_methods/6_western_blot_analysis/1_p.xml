<p>NIH/3T3 cells were left uninfected or infected with MCMV CHKVf5 or AdV CHKVf5. Cells were lysed in 1 × Cell Lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluride (PMSF) (Fisher), scraped, and incubated on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged (4°C, 10 min, 16,000 × g), and supernatants were transferred to a new tube containing Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled 10 min and loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Thermo/Fisher). Samples were transferred onto Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes (Fisher). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and membranes were probed with anti-HA antibody (Roche, clone 3F10) at 1:1,000 dilution followed by rabbit anti-Rat HRP-conjugated secondary antibody or anti-GAPDH-HRP (Cell Signaling) for a loading control. Blots were washed with TBST, and the membrane was incubated with chemiluminescent substrate to visualize the bands. The membrane was exposed with X-ray film.</p>
