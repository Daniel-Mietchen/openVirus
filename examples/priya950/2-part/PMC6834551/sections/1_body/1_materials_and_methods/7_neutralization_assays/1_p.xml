<p>Blood samples were collected and left at room temperature for 30 min to allow for clotting. Blood was centrifuged (5 min, 3,000 × g) and sera was transferred to a new tube. Sera was heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Following heat-inactivation, sera was serially diluted in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and PSG. Roughly 100 plaque forming units of CHIKV 181/25 were added to serum dilutions, and the complexes were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Following incubation, complexes were added to Vero cells and placed on a rocker for 2 h at 37°C. CMC-containing media was added to the cells, and cells were placed in a 37°C incubator for 2 days prior to fixing and staining.</p>
