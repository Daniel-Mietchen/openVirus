<p>ELISpot assays were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Briefly, a single cell splenocyte suspension was prepared by pushing whole spleen through a 70 μm cell strainer and rinsing with 15 ml RMPI complete media (10% FBS, PSG). Cells were pelleted (10 min at 650 × g), and red blood cells were lysed with 1 × Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Bioleged) for 3 min. Splenocytes were replenished with 10 ml RMPI complete and pelleted as before. Cells were resuspended into 5 ml RPMI complete, counted, and samples were normalized to cell count. Splenocytes were added to prewashed Mouse IFNγ ELISpot plates (MabTech) with 1 μl peptide (10 μg/well), 1 μl DMSO, or 1 μl of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/Ionomycin stock as a positive control. Splenocytes were incubated on ELISpot plates for 24–48 h. Plates were washed and incubated with anti-mouse IFNγ biotin antibody for 2 h and streptavidin-ALP antibody for 1 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spots were visualized using BCIP/NPT-plus substrate, and plates were rinsed with water and dried prior to counting with an AID ELISPot plate reader.
