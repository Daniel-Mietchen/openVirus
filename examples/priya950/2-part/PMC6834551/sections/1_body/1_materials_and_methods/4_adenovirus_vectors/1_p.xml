<p>Replication-defective human Ad5 adenoviruses (del E1, E3) were generated using the AdMax HiIQ system (Microbix). Genes of interest were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pDC316(io) and co-transfected with pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre plasmid into 293 IQ cells to reconstitute virus as previously described (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Transfections were performed using the PureFection kit (System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and adenovirus plaques were observed after 10–14 days in cell culture. Viruses were passaged four times in 293 IQ cells prior to ultracentrifugation. Constructs were screened by PCR and sequenced to confirm the presence of the insert. Adenovirus titers were calculated using limiting dilution assays on 293 IQs in 96-well plates.
