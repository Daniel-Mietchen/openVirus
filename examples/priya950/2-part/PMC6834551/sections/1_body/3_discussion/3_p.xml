<p>T cell responses directed against CHIKV have been reported in humans during both the acute and chronic phases of infection. During the acute phase, there is a mobilization and amplification of activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, followed by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Following the acute phase, patients who recovered from CHIKV and patients with chronic CHIKV-induced arthritis both had roughly equal frequencies of CHIKV-specific IFNÎ³-producing T cells (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). There is also evidence that T cells can enter CHIKV infected joint tissues in humans. In a synovial biopsy of a patient with chronic CHIKV-induced arthritis, activated (HLA-DR
 <sup>+</sup>) CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were identified as a major cellular infiltrate, but oddly, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were rarely found (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). CHIKV RNA and antigen have been detected in joint synovial biopsies and muscle tissue (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which is suggestive of viral persistence in the joints and muscle. Though it is not known whether T cells protect against CHIKV in humans, our data would suggest that the presence of effective antiviral CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells may promote viral clearance in the muscle tissue and control joint inflammation.
