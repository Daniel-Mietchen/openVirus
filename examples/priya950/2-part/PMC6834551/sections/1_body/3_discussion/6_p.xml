<p>Neutralizing antibodies are an important correlate of protection for CHIKV, and it would be essential for a prophylactic CHIKV vaccine to induce neutralizing antibody responses to protect from CHIKV acquisition. The data presented here show that a CD8-directed T cell component in a prophylactic vaccine would be beneficial. This type of vaccine could also be used to prophylactically boost existing immunity and/or skew the responses toward additional epitopes for increased protection against CHIKV acquisition. This approach could be effective for eliminating CHIKV-induced myalgia and joint swelling in infected patients. Therefore, future studies will examine the effects of therapeutic T cell vaccines against CHIKV persistence and disease.</p>
