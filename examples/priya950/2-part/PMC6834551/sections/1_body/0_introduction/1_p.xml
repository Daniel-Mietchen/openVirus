<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes fever, rash, and debilitating joint and muscle pain in humans. Though the fever and rash resolve, joint and muscle pain can be long lasting. According to some studies, up to 75% of CHIKV-infected patients experience chronic arthritic and muscle pain for months to years following resolution of the acute disease (

The protective role for anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibodies has been well-established in both mouse and non-human primate models (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Potent neutralizing antibodies can provide sterilizing immunity if administered prophylactically or if derived through vaccination. However, after the first few days of infection, neutralizing antibodies may have limited efficacy to clear virus from infected tissues (
