<p>In the current study, we utilized murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and adenovirus (AdV) vaccine vectors as tools to investigate the role for antiviral CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells during CHIKV infection. We profiled T cell epitopes recognized in CHIKV mice using a complete CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) overlapping peptide library. Based upon the results from this screen, we generated a CHIKV fusion gene called CHIKVf5 that encodes several peptides that elicited T cell IFNÎ³ responses. The fusion gene was recombined into MCMV and AdV vaccine vectors to elicit CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in mice. After vaccination, we observed earlier joint inflammation in mice challenged in the footpad. However, mice challenged intramuscularly had significant reduction of viral loads in leg muscle tissue. T cell depletion experiments demonstrated that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were essential for protection in the muscle tissue. Mice vaccinated with CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes showed decreased CHIKV-induced joint swelling after footpad challenge. This study describes a protective role for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in CHIKV infection and disease.
