<p>Antiviral CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to be important for reducing viral loads and disease for other alphavirus infections. Depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in Ross River virus (RRV) infected mice at 7 and 12 dpi increased levels of RRV RNA in the quadriceps at 14 dpi (

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice with RRV results in increased levels of RRV RNA in the quadriceps at 14 and 21 dpi, but equal levels of virus is detected in the ankle, compared to wild type mice. T cells have also been implicated in protection against Sindbis virus (SINV) infiltration into the CNS (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells may protect against Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) -induced encephalitis in mice (
