<p>CHIKV vaccine candidates under development elicit both humoral and cellular responses to CHIKV antigens. CHIKV vaccines currently being pursued in clinical trials cover a wide range of platforms including virus-like particle (VLP), live-attenuated, viral-vectored, and mRNA-based vaccines (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies are the key to protection against CHIKV, but the direct contribution of vaccine-induced T cells in protection against CHIKV is rarely characterized. Two preclinical vaccines, the live-attenuated CHIKV/IRES vaccine and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccine, assessed the impact of vaccine-induced T cells (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Both vaccines elicited humoral and cellular responses against CHIKV antigens. However, in the context of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, the roll of cellular immunity appears minimal. In fact, T cell depletion of CHIKV/IRES-vaccinated A129 mice or adoptive transfer of immune CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells did not protect A129 mice from CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, a modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) vaccine vector that expresses E3/E2 was shown to require CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells for protection since CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion increased susceptibility to CHIKV challenge (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). While low levels of E2 neutralizing antibodies were identified following vaccination that may have contributed to the protection seen in A129 mice, a role for direct cellular immunity or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was not shown.
