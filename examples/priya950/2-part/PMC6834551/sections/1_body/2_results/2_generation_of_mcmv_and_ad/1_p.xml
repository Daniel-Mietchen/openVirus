<p>A fusion polypeptide (CHKVf5) was constructed containing two peptides that elicited strong IFNγ responses (peptide 47 and 451) with a small region of nsP4 (aa 167–475) that was predicted 
 <italic>in silico</italic> to contain several H2-Db restricted T cell epitopes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We identified a dominant epitope in peptide 256 in this region of nsP4. Peptide 416 (E1), a peptide that consistently failed to induce IFNγ response by ELISPOT in splenocytes from CHIKV-infected mice, was included as a control peptide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The CHIKVf5 fusion protein also contained an in-frame C′ terminal HA tag for detection. The fusion construct was generated by overlapping PCR and cloned into shuttle plasmids that allowed recombineering into a MCMV Smith strain bacterial artificial chromosome and recombination into an E1A/E3 deleted AdV genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). MCMV and AdV were reconstituted, and the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Western blotting for the HA tag in lysates from mouse fibroblasts infected with each of the vaccine vectors confirmed the presence of the fusion protein expression for both constructs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). CHKVf5 was the expected size in AdV CHKVf5-infected cells (about 42 kDa). In the case of MCMV-CHKVf5, CHKVf5 is expressed as an in-frame C-terminal fusion onto IE2, and the IE2-CHKVf5 protein was detected at about 85 kDa.
