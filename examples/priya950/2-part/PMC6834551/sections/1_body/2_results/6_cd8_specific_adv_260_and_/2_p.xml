<p>We next tested efficacy of disease protection for the AdV-260 and AdV-451 vaccines using the f.p. CHIKV challenge model as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>. Footpad swelling at both of the biphasic peaks occurring at day 4 and 8 post infection was significantly reduced in mice vaccinated and boosted with AdV-260 or AdV-451 compared to mice receiving the control AdV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), despite having no statistically significant effect on CHIKV viral RNA loads in the ipsilateral ankles at 8 and 14 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Due to this response, we hypothesized that pre-existing antiviral CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells may be associated with differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the CHIKV-infected ankles. We therefore performed a multiplex cytokine assay using ipsilateral ankle homogenates harvested at 4 dpi from mice vaccinated with AdV control, AdV 260, and AdV 451. From this we observed significantly higher levels of Eotaxin in challenged AdV Control mice relative to Adv 260, Adv 451, and naïve animals that are unchallenged and unvaccinated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Levels of MIP-1α, M-CSF, MIP2, MCP-1, and RANTES were also elevated in AdV control relative to naïve but not AdV 260 or AdV 451 groups. Interestingly, IL-12p70 was significantly increased in the AdV 260 and AdV 451 groups compared to AdV Control, suggesting a positive role for IL-12p70 in controlling the CHIKV-induced inflammation after vaccination.
