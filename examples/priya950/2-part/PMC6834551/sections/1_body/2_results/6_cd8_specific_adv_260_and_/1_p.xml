<p>Since CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were essential for the protective effects of the CHKVf5 vaccine, we generated adenoviruses individually expressing the CD8-specific CHIKV peptides 260 and 451. CHIKV-specific T cell responses in mice vaccinated with AdV-Control, AdV-260, or AdV-451, demonstrated appropriate IFNÎ³ responses against peptides 260 and 451 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A,B</xref>). An additional cohort of these vaccinated mice were challenged with CHIKV i.m. AdV 260 vaccination alone resulted in significantly reduced virus in the ipsilateral calf, but AdV-451 vaccination, while trending lower than controls, was not statistically significantly different than mice vaccinated with a control AdV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Mice vaccinated with both AdV-260 and AdV-451 had a highly significant decrease in infectious virus compared to controls. The vaccinated and challenged mice also showed vaccine-specific T cell responses after 260 and 451 peptide stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Therefore, the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells elicited after vaccination with adenovirus-delivered peptides 260 and 451 are protective against i.m. CHIKV challenge.
