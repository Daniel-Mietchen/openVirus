<p>To evaluate vaccine immunogenicity, mice were vaccinated once with either MCMV CHKVf5, wild type MCMV lacking the CHKVf5 insert, or PBS by intraperitoneal injection (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10/group). Separate groups of 10 mice per group were vaccinated i.m. in the left quadriceps muscle with AdV-CHKVf5 or AdV-control. The vaccine groupings and schedule are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. MCMV vectored vaccines elicit robust CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses by 6–8 weeks post vaccination (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Adenovirus vaccine-induced CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses peak between 10 and 14 days post vaccination (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). At 8 weeks post MCMV vaccination or 2 weeks post AdV vaccination, splenocytes were isolated from two mice per group for IFNγ ELISpot assays. Splenocytes were incubated with peptides encoded by CHKVf5 (peptides 47, 256, 260, 416, and 451), the immunodominant peptides for the MCMV proteins M45 and IE3, or stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Splenocytes from animals receiving MCMV CHKVf5 and AdV CHKVf5 developed IFNγ responses to stimulation with nsP4 peptide 260 and E1 peptide 451. Splenocytes from mice receiving AdV-CHKVf5 also developed moderate IFNγ responses to stimulation with nsp4 peptide 255. All MCMV-vaccinated mice, but not those receiving AdV, responded to MCMV-specific peptides M45 and IE3.
