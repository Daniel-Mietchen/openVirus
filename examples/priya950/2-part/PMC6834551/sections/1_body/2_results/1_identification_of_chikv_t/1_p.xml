<p>Few dominant CHIKV T cell epitopes have been experimentally described in C57BL/6 mice (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). To identify T cell epitopes recognized during CHIKV infection of C57BL/6 mice, we screened T cell responses by IFNγ ELISpot using a CHIKV 18mer peptide library with 10 amino acid overlap. For this assay, splenocytes were isolated and pooled from three mice infected with CHIKV for 7 or 14 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and cultured on 96-well ELISpot plates for 2 days in the presence of peptides, negative control peptides, or PMA/ionomycin (positive control). Plates were washed and stained for IFNγ. The stained wells were scanned and spots were enumerated. We identified several CHIKV peptides that elicited an IFNγ response that mapped to nsP1, E2, and E1. In addition, we observed a wider breadth of T cell IFNγ responses at 7 dpi (26 peptides recognized) that became more refined at 14 dpi (15 peptides). The screen was repeated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), validating the peptides eliciting the strongest responses as peptides 47, 256, 350, 439, and 451. Peptides 451 (CAVHSMTNAVTIREAEIE) and 350 (DNFNVYKATRPYLAHCPD) were previously shown to elicit T cell responses, providing further validation of our assay (
