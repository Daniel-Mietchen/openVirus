<p>As expected, similar viral levels were detected in the ankles for all groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref> demonstrate that CHIKV neutralizing antibodies were not present in the vaccinated mice prior to CHIKV challenge. In addition, splenocytes from the various groups were analyzed by peptide ELISpot assay, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>. These data show that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells eliminated IFNÎ³ responses for peptide 255, but responses for peptides 260 and 451 were only blocked by depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. These data indicate that maximum muscle tissue protective immunity elicited by the CHKVf5 vaccine is mediated by both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that act in concert to reduce viral loads in the muscle tissue.
