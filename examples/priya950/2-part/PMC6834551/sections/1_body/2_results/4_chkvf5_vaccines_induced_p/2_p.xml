<p>Since the i.m. infection group had consistent viral titers in the ipsilateral calf and ankle, we chose to vaccinate mice with CHKVf5 vaccines and challenge i.m. Mice were vaccinated with MCMV and AdV CHKVf5 or control vaccines as described above. A second group of mice received a primary vaccination with MCMV-CHKVf5 or the MCMV control vaccine, and at 8 weeks post prime these animals were boosted with AdV CHKVf5 or AdV control vaccine, respectively (

While splenocytes from AdV-CHKVf5 vaccinated mice produced higher levels of IFNγ expressing T cells in response to CHIKV peptide stimulation compared to the MCMV vaccine platform, T cell response levels were highest for the prime boost approach (

Since two of the peptides included in the CHIKVf5 are derived from E1, we measured neutralizing antibody levels in the serum from mice vaccinated by the different regimens using standard plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) assays. Sera from uninfected, unvaccinated animals was used as a negative control, and immune sera as well as a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (4N12) were used as positive controls for PRNT assays (
