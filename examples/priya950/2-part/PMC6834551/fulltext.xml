Current CHIKV vaccines under development rely on the generation of neutralizing antibodies for protection; however, the role of T cells in controlling CHIKV infection and disease is still unclear. Using an overlapping peptide library, we identified the CHIKV-specific T cell receptor epitopes recognized in C57BL/6 infected mice at 7 and 14 days post-infection. A fusion protein containing peptides 451, 416, a small region of nsP4, peptide 47, and an HA tag (CHKVf5) was expressed using adenovirus and cytomegalovirus-vectored vaccines. Mice vaccinated with CHKVf5 elicited robust T cell responses to higher levels than normally observed following CHIKV infection, but the vaccine vectors did not elicit neutralizing antibodies. CHKVf5-vaccinated mice had significantly reduced infectious viral load when challenged by intramuscular CHIKV injection. Depletion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vaccinated mice rendered them fully susceptible to intramuscular CHIKV challenge. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone reduced vaccine efficacy, albeit to a lesser extent, but depletion of only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not reverse the protective phenotype. These data demonstrated a protective role for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in CHIKV infection. However, CHKVf5-vaccinated mice that were challenged by footpad inoculation demonstrated equal viral loads and increased footpad swelling at 3 dpi, which we attributed to the presence of CD4 T cell receptor epitopes present in the vaccine. Indeed, vaccination of mice with vectors expressing only CHIKV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes followed by CHIKV challenge in the footpad prevented footpad swelling and reduced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines associated with disease, indicating that CHIKV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells prevent CHIKV disease. These results also indicate that a T cell-biased prophylactic vaccination approach is effective against CHIKV challenge and reduces CHIKV-induced disease in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Foundation for the National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000009</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="9576"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes fever, rash, and debilitating joint and muscle pain in humans. Though the fever and rash resolve, joint and muscle pain can be long lasting. According to some studies, up to 75% of CHIKV-infected patients experience chronic arthritic and muscle pain for months to years following resolution of the acute disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The consequences of chronic joint pain are significant, with patients reporting limited mobility, depression, and decreased quality of life (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). CHIKV can rapidly spread and cause disease in millions of people in a short period of time, as illustrated by recent epidemics in the Indian Ocean region (2004&#x02013;2011) and the Americas (2013&#x02013;2015) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since no FDA-approved vaccines or antivirals exist for CHIKV, research into prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are highly warranted. The protective role for anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibodies has been well-established in both mouse and non-human primate models (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Potent neutralizing antibodies can provide sterilizing immunity if administered prophylactically or if derived through vaccination. However, after the first few days of infection, neutralizing antibodies may have limited efficacy to clear virus from infected tissues (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), suggesting other immune components, such as T cells, could be involved in viral clearance of persistent joint-localized CHIKV.</p><p>CHIKV vaccine candidates under development elicit both humoral and cellular responses to CHIKV antigens. CHIKV vaccines currently being pursued in clinical trials cover a wide range of platforms including virus-like particle (VLP), live-attenuated, viral-vectored, and mRNA-based vaccines (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies are the key to protection against CHIKV, but the direct contribution of vaccine-induced T cells in protection against CHIKV is rarely characterized. Two preclinical vaccines, the live-attenuated CHIKV/IRES vaccine and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccine, assessed the impact of vaccine-induced T cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Both vaccines elicited humoral and cellular responses against CHIKV antigens. However, in the context of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, the roll of cellular immunity appears minimal. In fact, T cell depletion of CHIKV/IRES-vaccinated A129 mice or adoptive transfer of immune CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not protect A129 mice from CHIKV (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, a modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) vaccine vector that expresses E3/E2 was shown to require CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for protection since CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion increased susceptibility to CHIKV challenge (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). While low levels of E2 neutralizing antibodies were identified following vaccination that may have contributed to the protection seen in A129 mice, a role for direct cellular immunity or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not shown.</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been implicated as a major contributor to joint inflammation during CHIKV infection of mice. Footpad injection of C57BL/6 mice with CHIKV results in edema, arthritis, and tenosynovitis in the ankle joint, as well as necrosis in the musculoskeletal tissues (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Infiltrating cells in the ankle include CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have reduced inflammation of the footpad after infection, but viral levels in the blood and ankle are similar to control mice (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Adoptive transfer of CHIKV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into TCR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also resulted in increased footpad swelling and joint vascular leakage compared to controls after CHIKV infection, while viral load in the blood remained the same as controls (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, therapeutic administration of mice with CTLA4-Ig after CHIKV infection inhibited T cell recruitment to the ankle and decreased footpad swelling (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In contrast to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fails to reduce footpad swelling (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This data supports a pathogenic role for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but the role for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells remains unclear. Some evidence suggest T cells promote viral clearance during CHIKV infection. Mice lacking B and T cells (Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) develop more severe persistent infections characterized by chronic viremia and persistence of infectious virus in a number of tissues (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies into Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice fails to clear CHIKV in tissues of persistently infected animals (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In addition, mice lacking mature B cells (&#x003bc;MT mice) vaccinated with an inactivated CHIKV vaccine have decreased levels of virus in the serum compared to control-vaccinated mice after CHIKV challenge, although the vaccinated mice also had increased footpad swelling (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This suggests that vaccine-elicited T cells can provide limited protection, but this was not directly tested. Combined, these data are suggestive of a role of cellular immunity in protection against CHIKV infection.</p><p>Antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to be important for reducing viral loads and disease for other alphavirus infections. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in Ross River virus (RRV) infected mice at 7 and 12 dpi increased levels of RRV RNA in the quadriceps at 14 dpi (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Similarly, infection of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with RRV results in increased levels of RRV RNA in the quadriceps at 14 and 21 dpi, but equal levels of virus is detected in the ankle, compared to wild type mice. T cells have also been implicated in protection against Sindbis virus (SINV) infiltration into the CNS (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may protect against Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) -induced encephalitis in mice (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we utilized murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and adenovirus (AdV) vaccine vectors as tools to investigate the role for antiviral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during CHIKV infection. We profiled T cell epitopes recognized in CHIKV mice using a complete CHIKV (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) overlapping peptide library. Based upon the results from this screen, we generated a CHIKV fusion gene called CHIKVf5 that encodes several peptides that elicited T cell IFN&#x003b3; responses. The fusion gene was recombined into MCMV and AdV vaccine vectors to elicit CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in mice. After vaccination, we observed earlier joint inflammation in mice challenged in the footpad. However, mice challenged intramuscularly had significant reduction of viral loads in leg muscle tissue. T cell depletion experiments demonstrated that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were essential for protection in the muscle tissue. Mice vaccinated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes showed decreased CHIKV-induced joint swelling after footpad challenge. This study describes a protective role for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in CHIKV infection and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Vero cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3), and 293-IQ cells [HEK293 cells expressing the lac repressor (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)] were propagated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 or 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Penicillin-Streptomycin-L-Glutamine (PSG). <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cells (C6/36s) were propagated at 28&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and PSG.</p></sec><sec><title>Viruses</title><p>CHIKV SL15649 and CHIKV 181/25 was generated from the infectious clones. Briefly, the infectious clone was digested with NotI, and DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral mRNA was generated with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher), and the mRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Roughly 3 &#x003bc;g RNA was transfected into Vero cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). CHIKV virus stocks were passaged once C6/36 cells for 72 h, and viral stocks were prepared by ultracentrifugation over a 15% sucrose cushion (SW 32 Ti Rotor, 1 h 10 min, 76,755 &#x000d7; g). The virus pellets were resuspended in PBS and aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. For CHIKV limiting dilution plaque assays, 10-fold serial dilutions of virus stocks or tissue homogenates were plated on Vero cells. The cells were placed on a rocker in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h, and DMEM containing 0.3% high viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (Sigma) and 0.3% low viscosity CMC (Sigma) was added to the cells. After 2 days, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Fisher), stained with 0.5% methylene blue (Fisher), and dried. Plaques were enumerated under a light microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>MCMV Vectors</title><p>The Smith strain MCMV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) pSMfr3 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) was utilized for generating infectious MCMV vaccines. The gene of interest was inserted in-frame onto the C-terminus of the MCMV <italic>IE2</italic> gene so that the insertion is co-expressed with IE2 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Generation of the MCMV constructs was performed via a two-step galactokinase/kanamycin (GalK/Kan) cassette insertion and replacement (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The GalK/Kan cassette was generated by PCR with primers that overlapped <italic>ie2</italic> by 50 bp. The PCR product was electroporated into electrocompetent SW105 cells containing pSMfr3, and bacteria were selected on Kan-containing agarose plates. The fusion gene CHKVf5 was generated by overlapping PCR. A PCR product containing 50 bp homology with <italic>ie2</italic> was generated (F primer: GGTTCTTTCTCTTGACCAGAGACCTGGTGACCGTCAGGAAGAAGATTCAGTGTGCGGTGCATTCGATGAC, R primer: AACCTCTTTATTTATTGATTAAAAACCATGACATACCTCGTGTCCTCTCAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACATC) and electroporated into SW105 cells containing the IE2-GalK/Kan MCMV BAC. Resulting bacteria were selected on 2-deoxy-galactose (DOG) minimal plates, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Virus was reconstituted by electroporation into NIH/3T3 cells, and passaged five times to eliminate the BAC cassette prior to ultracentrifugation. Constructs were screened by PCR and sequenced to confirm the presence of the insert. MCMVs were titered by plaque assays on NIH/3T3s. Dilutions of virus was plated on NIH/3T3s, and cells were placed in an incubator on a rocker. At 2 hpi, a CMC overlay was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for 5&#x02013;7 days, until plaques were formed, prior to fixing and staining with methylene blue.</p></sec><sec><title>Adenovirus Vectors</title><p>Replication-defective human Ad5 adenoviruses (del E1, E3) were generated using the AdMax HiIQ system (Microbix). Genes of interest were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pDC316(io) and co-transfected with pBHGlox&#x00394;E1,3Cre plasmid into 293 IQ cells to reconstitute virus as previously described (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Transfections were performed using the PureFection kit (System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and adenovirus plaques were observed after 10&#x02013;14 days in cell culture. Viruses were passaged four times in 293 IQ cells prior to ultracentrifugation. Constructs were screened by PCR and sequenced to confirm the presence of the insert. Adenovirus titers were calculated using limiting dilution assays on 293 IQs in 96-well plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse Experiments</title><p>All mouse experiments were performed at OHSU in ABSL3 laboratories in compliance with OHSU IACUC protocols. The small lab animal unit at OHSU is accredited by the Association for the Accreditation and Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) International. Animals were housed in ventilated racks and monitored daily by veterinary staff. C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated as indicated with MCMV delivered intraperitoneally (10<sup>6</sup> PFU, i.p.), and/or AdV injected intramuscularly in the thigh (10<sup>8</sup> PFU, i.m.). Mice were challenged with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU CHIKV in a 20 &#x003bc;l volume in the footpad (f.p.), or they were challenged (i.m.) with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU in a 20 &#x003bc;l volume in the calf muscle. Footpad measurements were taken with calipers. For T cell depletion experiments, mice were administered T cell depleting antibodies diluted in PBS in a 100 &#x003bc;l volume (i.p.). Vaccinated groups were injected with 300 &#x003bc;g anti-CD4 (GK1.5, BioXCell), 300 &#x003bc;g anti-CD8 (2.43, BioXCell), 300 &#x003bc;g Rat IgG2b Isotype Control (LTF-2, BioXCell), or a combination of 300 &#x003bc;g anti-CD4 and 300 &#x003bc;g anti-CD8. T cell depletions were confirmed by flow cytometry. To confirm T cell depletions, splenocytes were stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19. Fluorescent markers were detected on an LSRII instrument (BD Pharminogen) and data was analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar).</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blot Analysis</title><p>NIH/3T3 cells were left uninfected or infected with MCMV CHKVf5 or AdV CHKVf5.

Splenocytes were replenished with 10 ml RMPI complete and pelleted as before. Cells were resuspended into 5 ml RPMI complete, counted, and samples were normalized to cell count. Splenocytes were added to prewashed Mouse IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot plates (MabTech) with 1 &#x003bc;l peptide (10 &#x003bc;g/well), 1 &#x003bc;l DMSO, or 1 &#x003bc;l of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/Ionomycin stock as a positive control. Splenocytes were incubated on ELISpot plates for 24&#x02013;48 h. Plates were washed and incubated with anti-mouse IFN&#x003b3; biotin antibody for 2 h and streptavidin-ALP antibody for 1 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spots were visualized using BCIP/NPT-plus substrate, and plates were rinsed with water and dried prior to counting with an AID ELISPot plate reader.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse Cytokine Multiplex Assay</title><p>A Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel multiplex assay (Millipore Sigma) was used to quantify the protein levels for 26 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in ankle tissues from vaccinated and control mice at 8 days post footpad challenge with CHIKV. Entire ankle samples were homogenized in PBS with 2 mm beads (Propper Manufacturing Co., Inc.) using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Precellys Bertin Technologies). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 &#x000d7; g for 2 min, and the supernatants were transferred to a new 1.7 ml tube. For the assay, washed antibody-conjugated polystyrene magnetic beads were incubated with a seven-point standard curve or 25 &#x003bc;l of ankle tissue homogenate plus 25 &#x003bc;l of blocking buffer. Samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 h, washed and then labeled with biotinylated detector antibody for 1 h. Following washing with blocking buffer, the beads were incubated with Phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min and then washed. Cytokines were quantified using a Luminex 200&#x02122; Detection system (Luminex), and the data was analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of CHIKV T Cell Epitopes in C57BL/6 Mice</title><p>Few dominant CHIKV T cell epitopes have been experimentally described in C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). To identify T cell epitopes recognized during CHIKV infection of C57BL/6 mice, we screened T cell responses by IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot using a CHIKV 18mer peptide library with 10 amino acid overlap. For this assay, splenocytes were isolated and pooled from three mice infected with CHIKV for 7 or 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and cultured on 96-well ELISpot plates for 2 days in the presence of peptides, negative control peptides, or PMA/ionomycin (positive control). Plates were washed and stained for IFN&#x003b3;. The stained wells were scanned and spots were enumerated. We identified several CHIKV peptides that elicited an IFN&#x003b3; response that mapped to nsP1, E2, and E1. In addition, we observed a wider breadth of T cell IFN&#x003b3; responses at 7 dpi (26 peptides recognized) that became more refined at 14 dpi (15 peptides).

These groups were not significantly different from each other suggesting that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alone do not play a major role in CHIKVf5-mediated protection. However, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells increased levels of infectious CHIKV present in the calf, which was enhanced in mice depleted for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding indicates that while CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are required for vaccine-mediated protection against CHIKV i.m. challenge, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells cooperate to mediate protection in the calf muscle.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Combined CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion reverses the protective effect of the CHKVf5 vaccine. <bold>(A)</bold> Mice vaccinated with MCMV-CHKVf5 and boosted with AdV-CHKVf5, or control vectors were treated with 300 &#x003bc;g rat isotype control, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, or anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 depleting antibodies at 2 days prior to challenge.

Due to this response, we hypothesized that pre-existing antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may be associated with differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the CHIKV-infected ankles. We therefore performed a multiplex cytokine assay using ipsilateral ankle homogenates harvested at 4 dpi from mice vaccinated with AdV control, AdV 260, and AdV 451.

In the current study, we mapped the T cell responses to CHIKV in C57BL/6 mice using an overlapping CHIKV peptide library in order to identify potential CHIKV targets for development of a T cell vaccine. During this T cell profiling experiment, we identified 26 unique peptide sequences that elicited significant IFN&#x003b3; responses in splenocytes obtained from CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice. Based upon this information, we constructed a fusion polyprotein that contained the amino acid sequence for a number of these positive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> restricted peptides. This CHKVf5 fusion gene was inserted into two different T cell promoting vaccine platforms including MCMV and AdV. Vaccinated mice developed robust T cell responses directed against the transgene construct that were amplified following challenge with CHIKV. Vaccination prior to footpad inoculation resulted in a dramatic increase in footpad swelling at 3 dpi. We attribute this to preformed anti-CHIKV CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. While the CHKVf5 vaccine did not protect against high ankle viral loads following challenge, it did significantly reduce viral loads in the calf muscle when i.m. challenged with CHIKV.</p><p>Two crucial findings indicate that the CHKVf5 vaccine elicits protection through T cells. First, depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at 2 days before challenge from vaccinated mice negated the protective efficacy of the vaccine against i.m. challenge by restoring viral loads to levels observed in vaccine controls and non-vaccinated mice. It appears that both T cell subtypes contribute to immune efficacy since depletion of either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to fully restore CHIKV tissue load to control levels. However, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells significantly reduced the ability of mice to control virus indicating a dominant role for these cells. We presume that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help is required for full efficacy but these cells specifically enhance CHIKV inflammatory joint disease. Second, the CHKVf5 vaccine does not contain any known CHIKV neutralizing domains. As such, we did not detect neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV in any of the vaccinated mice, and the generation of antibody responses against CHIKV following challenge developed with normal kinetics and amplitude when compared to controls indicating that there was no amnestic-type response. Together, these data demonstrate that the CHKVf5 vaccine constructs elicit robust T cell responses that protected against CHIKV in muscle tissues. Finally, we showed that vaccination with adenoviruses containing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes did not decrease joint tissue viral loads after footpad challenge, but it reduced footpad swelling and inflammation following CHIKV challenge. In addition, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell vaccine provided enhanced survival for <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>T cell responses directed against CHIKV have been reported in humans during both the acute and chronic phases of infection. During the acute phase, there is a mobilization and amplification of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, followed by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Following the acute phase, patients who recovered from CHIKV and patients with chronic CHIKV-induced arthritis both had roughly equal frequencies of CHIKV-specific IFN&#x003b3;-producing T cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). There is also evidence that T cells can enter CHIKV infected joint tissues in humans. In a synovial biopsy of a patient with chronic CHIKV-induced arthritis, activated (HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified as a major cellular infiltrate, but oddly, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were rarely found (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). CHIKV RNA and antigen have been detected in joint synovial biopsies and muscle tissue (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which is suggestive of viral persistence in the joints and muscle. Though it is not known whether T cells protect against CHIKV in humans, our data would suggest that the presence of effective antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may promote viral clearance in the muscle tissue and control joint inflammation.</p><p>We showed that vaccinated animals had a significant reduction of CHIKV titers in the calf muscle. The tissue-specific protection is reminiscent of the study with RRV, where protection by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed in the muscle tissue during RRV infection (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), but CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to reduce viral loads in the ankle tissues. Similarly, we found that CHKVf5-elicited T cells and peptide 260 and 451-elicited T cells were unable to significantly reduce viral burden in the ankles. Similar tissue-type targeting occurs following SINV infection, where T cells are important for viral clearance in the brain and spinal cord (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were important for protection mediated by a live-attenuated vaccine for VEEV (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Together these studies demonstrate the importance of T cells in alphavirus clearance from infected tissues.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that T cell responses elicited by CHIKVf5 were more frequent and directed against different epitopes when compared to those observed following CHIKV infection. For example, splenocytes from CHIKV infected mice had high frequencies of IFN&#x003b3; responses to peptides 47-48, 256, 350, 439, and 451. While T cell responses against peptides 350 and 439 were robust, the CHKVf5 did not contain these because it was designed prior to us determining whether these were CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> specific. Future T cell vaccine constructs would most likely add these epitopes as they may impact protection. Since peptides 47, 256, and 451 were included in the CHKVf5 fusion gene, we expected that vaccinated mice would primarily induce responses to those epitopes. However, peptide 260 and 451 elicited the highest frequency of IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells in splenocytes from CHKVf5 vaccinated mice indicating that vaccine-induced responses were skewed toward infection-associated, non-dominant epitopes. Thus, one could argue that the protection elicited by the CHKVf5 vaccine may be due to this skewing of the immune response and higher frequencies of responding T cells. Similarly, while both MCMV- and AdV-CHKVf5 vaccines elicited strong T cell responses, the breadth of the responses was vaccine vector-dependent. The AdV-CHKVf5 vaccine directed responses against peptides 47, 255, 256, 260, and 451, while MCMV-CHKVf5 mainly directed T cells against 260 and 451. Prime-boost with both vectors increased the frequency and breadth of responses. Adenovirus vectors elicit potent effector and central memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) whereas MCMV vectors, in general, elicit long-lasting effector memory T cells to vaccine antigens fused to the C-terminus of the IE2 gene (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Together, the MCMV prime/AdV boost may offer advantages in induction of a diverse T cell memory response to CHIKV epitopes resulting in a more protective phenotype.</p><p>Neutralizing antibodies are an important correlate of protection for CHIKV, and it would be essential for a prophylactic CHIKV vaccine to induce neutralizing antibody responses to protect from CHIKV acquisition. The data presented here show that a CD8-directed T cell component in a prophylactic vaccine would be beneficial. This type of vaccine could also be used to prophylactically boost existing immunity and/or skew the responses toward additional epitopes for increased protection against CHIKV acquisition. This approach could be effective for eliminating CHIKV-induced myalgia and joint swelling in infected patients. Therefore, future studies will examine the effects of therapeutic T cell vaccines against CHIKV persistence and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>This manuscript contains previously unpublished data and materials that are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RB, NH, TA, ID, CK, JP, MD, PS, IM, and DS performed the experiments.
