<p id="Par26">Uganda is a country with environmental conditions conducive to the spread of arboviruses and entomology studies have reported the presence of transmission-competent mosquito vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The global spread of vectors and importation of new viruses or strains of viruses by infected travelers, would potentially increase rates of endemic transmission. In the case of dengue virus, this means increasing the frequency of multiple circulating strains and thus increased severe dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is illustrated by the recent global spread of CHIKV and ZIKV to previously non-endemic countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Case report 1 had the potential to introduce an Asian strain of CHIKV to a region that recently reported the spread of the East/Central/South Africa (ECSA) genotype.
