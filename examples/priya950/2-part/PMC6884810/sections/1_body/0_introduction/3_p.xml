<p id="Par16">Chikungunya is normally associated with acute diffuse polyarthralgia with recovery usually within weeks. The virus is antigenically and genetically most closely related to onyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and to a lesser extent, Mayaro and Ross River viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A number of CHIKV outbreaks have been reported in Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia, and may have spread and caused epidemics in the Caribbean and in the United States, and more recently in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CHIKV outbreaks can involve large numbers of human cases and rapid dissemination of the virus. In the Réunion Island, in an epidemic from April 2005 to June 2006, approximately 270,000 cases were reported, representing nearly 40% of the population. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the principal vector; however, in recent epidemics in Réunion Island and southern India, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been co-implicated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving nonhuman primates, but in Asia the human-mosquito cycle predominates, possibly including mechanical transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies in Uganda, have reported presence of DENV and CHIKV competent transmission vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Dengue and chikungunya while endemic in Uganda, are increasingly being detected in travelers, and due to their relatively low natural prevalence in Uganda may be undiagnosed if correct travel histories are not obtained [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. With increased importation, this can in the case of dengue lead to multiple circulating strains (hyperendemicity) thus increasing the risk of secondary infections and severe dengue.
