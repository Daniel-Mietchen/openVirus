 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), genus 
 <italic>alphavirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, are transmitted to humans via bite from the 
 <italic>Aedes (Ae.) aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquito. Dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya are typically characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, with dengue being more likely to cause severe disease including hemorrhagic complications. Globally, the incidence of DF has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cohort studies of travelers have found high rates of seroprevalence with a lower incidence of clinical infection, suggesting many cases are asymptomatic or mild and therefore not reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because the incubation period of DENV is 4 to 7 days (range 3 to 14) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], symptom appearance in travelers more than 14 days post-travel will unlikely be travel-associated dengue virus infection.
