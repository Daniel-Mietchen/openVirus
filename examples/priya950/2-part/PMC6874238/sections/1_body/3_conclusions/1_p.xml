<p>We documented a case of influenza infection caused by pH1N1 virus in a captive giant panda in Hong Kong. The viral load was &gt;6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL during the first 2 days of the illness and decreased to an undetectable level on day 5. The decrease in viral load was coupled with development of antibody response. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the pH1N1 virus from the giant panda differed from the influenza virus circulating in Hong Kong at that time by only 2–24 bases. In 2014, pH1N1 infection was reported in giant pandas at the Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan (
