<p>Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that the influenza virus we isolated from the giant panda (A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018) was closely related to other pH1N1 viruses circulating among humans in 2018, sharing 99.3%–99.9% nucleotide identities (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences showed that A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018 was most closely related to the human pH1N1 strain A/Hong Kong/2272/2018, which was circulating in Hong Kong at the time at which the giant panda acquired the infection (

There were only 2 bases difference between the HA genes and 4 bases difference between the NA genes of A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018 and A/Hong Kong/2272/2018, but 60 bases difference between the HA genes and 45 bases difference between the NA genes of A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018 and A/giant panda/01/Ya’an/2009, a pH1N1 virus previously isolated in giant panda in China (

Detailed annotation of the genome sequence of the giant panda isolate revealed features essential for transmission and replication of pH1N1 in other mammalian species. For example, A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018 also possessed glutamine at position 226 (H3 numbering) in HA and alanine at position 271 in polymerase protein 2 (
