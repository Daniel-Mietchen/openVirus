<p>On November 14, 2018, the 13-year-old male panda of the breeding pair was lethargic and had low appetite. Examination showed yellowish-brown mucoid nasal discharge, tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths/min), and abdominal breathing. On day 2, his condition worsened, and he showed little appetite, persistent nasal discharge, and cough. Attempts at rectal temperature measurement and blood collection were unsuccessful in the first 2 days. We initiated treatment with ciprofloxacin, carprofen, bromhexine, and Î²-glucan and fogged his living quarters twice daily with F10 antiseptic solution (1:250 dilution) containing benzalkonium chloride and polyhexanide. Clinical surveillance performed on staff members of the park at the time when the giant panda was ill revealed that none of the animal caretakers had influenza-like illness around that time. Additional measures included placing rat traps to test resident rodents for influenza and increased biosecurity to limit contact between the breeding pair and between the staff and giant pandas at both panda facilities.</p>
