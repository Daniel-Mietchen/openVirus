<p>We tested the duplex multigenic assay combining the Gibb and Huang assays onto the GeneXpert RT-qPCR open cartridge. Tests were performed with the EBOV synthetic RNA using serial dilutions ranging from 16.8 to 1.7 copies/reaction. Eight replicates were done for each dilution. All RT-qPCR assays were carried onto a GeneXpert
 <sup>®</sup> GX-IV (Cepheid, USA). Each reaction contained a total volume of 85 µL (12.47 μL of primers and probes, 39.73 μL of RE buffer, 28.5 μL of RNA to which was added 4.47 μL of MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, and a lyophilized enzyme bead provided by Cepheid. The 85 µL were introduced into chamber #11 of the open cartridge. The qRT-PCR assay consisted of a 15-min reverse transcription at 42 °C, a 2-min activation at 95 °C, then 45 cycles consisting of 96 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 35 s.
