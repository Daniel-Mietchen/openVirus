<p>Primers and probes sequences of the custom-made assays were analyzed in silico against a multiple sequence alignment, including &gt;235 complete sequences corresponding to strains having caused EVD epidemics from the first DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) strain in 1976 to the strains having caused the West African outbreak from 2014 to 2015. Alignments were performed with MEGA 6.0 and MUSCLE softwares [

Sequences of primers and probes of the selected assays were also aligned against the multiple sequence alignment to study the presence of mismatches that may hamper the detection of certain strains. Using the same approach, primers and probes were matched against the most recent strains of EBOV listed in the
