<p>A custom-made synthetic RNA control was designed to include genome regions corresponding to the assays developed for the three assays included in the study (Gibb et al., Huang et al., and Panning et al.) [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The transcript was produced by using the MEGAshortscript™ T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion™) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Plasmid DNA was removed with the DNase, and the RNA transcript was purified by using Monarch
 <sup>®</sup> PCR &amp; DNA Cleanup Kit (New England Biolabs, Evry, France)). The RNA concentration was measured by using a Thermo Scientific™ NanoDrop™, and the copy number, 5 × 10
 <sup>12</sup> copies/µL, was calculated by using the molecular weight of the RNA. The RNA transcript was serially diluted 100-fold, and each diluted standard was stored at −80 °C until used.
