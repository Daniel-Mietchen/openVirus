<p>The recent Western African EBOV outbreak has emphasized the need for reliable diagnostic tools amenable directly in the field. This is of conspicuous medical and public health importance since false-negative results are likely to leave contagious patients without containment measures, and because false-positive results will result in placing non-infected patients in premises together with highly contagious Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients. Hence, molecular diagnosis has demonstrated their capacity to be deployed and implemented in mobile laboratories where their high sensitivity and specificity combined with the potential to provide results within few hours are pivotal for sorting suspect patients attending the health centers. They remain, to date, the first-intention diagnostic techniques, but they still require development to be used by routine technical staff locally and merit to be not only sensitive and specific but prepared for easy read-out and for the possible occurrence of mutant strains during an on-going outbreak [
