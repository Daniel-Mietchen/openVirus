<p>Here, we combined two assays that were targeting different regions of the genome (
 <italic>NP</italic> and 
 <italic>GP</italic> genes) and which provided the most interesting in silico results. This study demonstrates that developing a Duo assay from two previously validated assays is easy and rapid. Within this context, the resulting Duo assay proved more sensitive than the two parental assay, independently. We also showed that this Duo assay is amenable to be used onto the GeneXpert Flex cartridge, on which very promising results were obtained as a proof of principle that must be considered seriously in emergency situations when molecular diagnosis must be brought at the patient bedside.
