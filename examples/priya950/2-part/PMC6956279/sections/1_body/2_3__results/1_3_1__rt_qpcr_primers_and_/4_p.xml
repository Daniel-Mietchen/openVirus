<p>In the Panning et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assay, the FiloA2.4 forward primer showed a 100% identity with ZEBOV and the Mekambo sequence. The combination of the two probes allowed the genetic diversity to be covered; hence, they were not modified. Due to mismatches observed at positions 21 and 27 in the sequence of the Filo B reverse primer, we designed a Filo B-prime reverse primer (CATGTCAGTGATTATTATAAYCCACCRCAT) to be included in the final mix, which incorporated Y and R wobbles at position 21 and 27, respectively.
