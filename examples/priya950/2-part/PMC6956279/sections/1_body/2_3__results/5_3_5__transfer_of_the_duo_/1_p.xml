<p>All replicates performed with the Flex-03 open cartridge on the GeneXpert were positive at 16.8 and 12.6 RNA copies/reaction (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) corresponding respectively to 1 and 0.75 copies/µL (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The LoD
 <sub>95</sub> was less than 0.75 copies/µL on eight independent runs. When compared with the LoD
 <sub>95</sub> obtained using the Duo Gibb + Huang as aforementioned, the results are in the same order of magnitude (0.75 vs. 0.382).
