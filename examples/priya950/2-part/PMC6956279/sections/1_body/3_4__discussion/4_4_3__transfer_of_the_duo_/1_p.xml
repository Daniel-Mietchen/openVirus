<p>Interestingly, Cepheid has developed a closed cartridge for the detection of the Ebola virus (Xpert
 <sup>®</sup> Ebola) by targeting the 
 <italic>NP</italic> and the 
 <italic>GP</italic> genes from whole blood. The rationale for using two target genes was to lower the risk of false-positive results for new variants. Depending on the material used for evaluation (EBOV RNA, inactivated EBOV, or infectious EBOV), the LoD ranged from 73 to 232 copies/mL (95% CI: 51–302 copies/mL). The assay correctly identified five different EBOV strains, Yambuku-Mayinga, Makona-C07, Yambuku-Ecran, Gabon-Ilembe, and Kikwit-956210, and correctly excluded all non-EBOV isolates tested [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Subsequently, the Xpert
 <sup>®</sup> Ebola assay was used in the comparative study versus TaqMan RT-qPCR assays [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) and in field studies [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our aim in this study was not to challenge the Xpert
 <sup>®</sup> Ebola with the Duo Gibb + Huang assay but to evaluate how complex it would be to transfer a test that was operational in a classic real-time TaqMan platform onto a Flex open cartridge provided with the Noro Bead EZR enzyme beads. The advantage of the GeneXpert system is that it integrates all the steps required to perform sample-processing and real-time PCR, including internal control, into a single plastic cartridge. The cartridge is used in a single automated test unit. The LoD 95 was less than 0.75 copies/µL, the limit of detection was comparable to that obtained, 0.4 copies/µL, with a “classic” thermocycler. We are perfectly aware that additional and more detailed testing is necessary before the Flex-cartridge might be used for the detection of EBOV in the field; however, the first results are promising and support further development and evaluation. The combination of the Duo Gibb + Huang primers and probes together with the Flex cartridge and the Noro Bead EZR should be considered as an important piece in the arsenal of diagnostics prepared for mitigating epidemic situations caused by re-emerging pathogens, in particular, those for which the diagnostic capacities are scarce and for which field usage is important in the quality of the response plan. Although our study has clear limitations, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a transfer has been explored.
