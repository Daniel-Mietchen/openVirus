<p>All but the Panning et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assay, demonstrated their capability to detect 1 RNA copy/ÂµL; this is the reason why the Panning et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assay was not retained for further experiments. To investigate further the sensitivity and limit of detection of these assays, a synthetic RNA control was designed. Since sequence data were not publicly available for the Altona RealStar assay, the latter was also not retained for subsequent studies, which were ultimately centered on the Duo Gibb + Huang assay and on the two parental assays.
