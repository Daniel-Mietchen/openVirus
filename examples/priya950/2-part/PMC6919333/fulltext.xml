We compare and contrast the clinical presentation, radiological, and virological features of two rare cases in immunocompetent adults admitted to an intensive care unit in a large, teaching hospital in North West England. We then provide a concise, comprehensive literature review.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The first case was a 35-year old female asthmatic who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonitis during peak influenza season, and recovered after a prolonged hospital stay. The second case was a 73-year old male who presented with diarrhoea, vomiting, and general malaise outside of influenza season, developed respiratory compromise, and died. Adenovirus type 7 was identified in bronchoalveolar lavages and plasma samples of both patients, each of whom received cidofovir. No other infectious aetiology was identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Clinical and radiological features of severe lower respiratory tract adenoviral infection are similar to other infectious causes of pneumonia and ARDS, including severe influenza. This can create diagnostic uncertainty, especially during influenza season. Positive adenovirus polymerase chain reaction results can support a diagnosis of severe lower respiratory tract adenovirus infection in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome and no other identified aetiology, with higher viral loads being associated with worse prognosis. Although treatment is predominantly supportive, early use of cidofovir may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These rare cases highlight that severe lower respiratory tract adenoviral infection should be considered in the differential diagnoses of immunocompetent patients presenting with pneumonia and ARDS.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Severe lower respiratory tract adenovirus infection requiring critical care admission is rare in immunocompetent adults.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Evidence concerning diagnosis and management of immunocompetent adults with adenovirus severe lower respiratory tract infection (sLRTI) is limited.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">We present rare cases of severe lower respiratory tract adenovirus infection in immunocompetent adults, on a critical care unit.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Immunocompetent patients with adenovirus sLRTI may present with pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Clinical features of sLRTI are difficult to distinguish clinically and radiologically from other causes of pneumonitis, including severe influenza.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Severe lower respiratory tract infection</kwd><kwd>Pneumonia</kwd><kwd>Pneumonitis</kwd><kwd>Acute respiratory distress</kwd><kwd>Adenovirus</kwd><kwd>Critical care</kwd><kwd>Intensive care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Background</title><p id="p0030">Severe lower respiratory tract infection (sLRTI) due to adenovirus is well described in immunocompromised hosts. Adenovirus sLRTI is rare in immunocompetent hosts, especially adults, and evidence regarding symptoms, diagnosis and management in such instances remains limited. Here, we describe two cases of severe adenovirus in immunocompetent adults admitted to an intensive care unit in a large, teaching hospital in North West England.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Case 1</title><p id="p0035">In January 2018, a 35-year-old homeless female commercial sex worker presented with a 4-day history of pharyngitis, myalgia, cough productive of green sputum, and dyspnoea. She was asthmatic but took no regular medications and denied related hospital admissions. Other medical history included obesity, schizophrenia, personality disorder, depression and self-harm. She was a smoker, did not take alcohol or drugs and had no fixed abode.</p><p id="p0040">Initial evaluation revealed widespread bilateral rhonchi and severe respiratory distress. A diagnosis of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation precipitated by LRTI was made. Antimicrobial treatment commenced included oseltamivir (due to presentation during peak of influenza season and risk factors for viral pneumonitis including chronic lung disease and obesity), benzylpenicillin and clarithromycin. Respiratory distress was treated with oxygen therapy, nebulised bronchodilators, intravenous steroids and magnesium. Investigations showed lymphopenia with raised inflammatory markers but normal liver and kidney function. Arterial blood gas showed type 1 respiratory failure. Chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation. Blood-borne virus (BBV) screen, including HIV, was negative.</p><p id="p0045">She deteriorated over 48&#x0202f;h with increasing drowsiness and respiratory distress. Chest radiograph showed increasing bilateral consolidation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and antibiotics were broadened to piperacillin/tazobactam. On day 3, she was transferred to the High Dependency Unit (HDU, Level-2 Care) for respiratory support. Aminophylline and salbutamol infusions and CPAP were instigated but she deteriorated and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU, Level-3 Care) for intubation and ventilation.</p><p id="p0050">Following intubation, bronchoscopy with diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Despite paralysis and airway pressure release ventilation for respiratory recruitment, the patient continued to desaturate and developed type 2 respiratory failure. In an attempt to improve ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide was commenced and the patient turned into the prone position. On day 8, BAL returned a strongly positive adenovirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and twice weekly cidofovir (with a loading dose one week after the initial dose) was commenced. Renal replacement therapy was started on day 12 for renal failure and fluid removal. By day 20, the patient had improved enough to allow tracheostomy to facilitate respiratory weaning and cessation of sedation. On day 52, the patient no longer required ventilation and, by day 65, she was stepped down to ward-level care.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical features, investigations, treatment and outcome of two cases of adenovirus sLRTI.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0015">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Case</th><th>Comorbidities</th><th>Presentation</th><th>Initial blood results</th><th>Radiological findings</th><th>Virology results</th><th>Adenovirus treatment given &#x00026; AEs</th><th>Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Case 1:<break/>35&#x0202f;year old female</td><td>Asthmatic, obese, mental illness</td><td>4&#x0202f;day history of URTI and LRTI symptoms<break/><break/>Presented in peak influenza season</td><td>Lymphopenia, mildly raised CRP<break/><break/>No initial renal dysfunction<xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>CXR: bilateral consolidation, worsening during admission (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)</td><td>Throat swab: adenovirus PCR positive<break/><break/>BAL: adenovirus PCR positive at 5.8&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup>&#x0202f;gEq/ml<break/><break/>EDTA plasma: adenovirus PCR positive at 9.5&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>6</sup>&#x0202f;gEq/ml<xref rid="tf0010" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref><break/><break/>Adenovirus species B type 7 by genomic sequencing</td><td>Cidofovir &#x02013; renal impairment requiring RRT<break/><break/>Consideration for ECMO but not initiated due to improvement</td><td>Decannulated on day 52 and stepped down to ward level care on day 65</td></tr><tr><td>Case 2:<break/>73&#x0202f;year old male</td><td>Hypertension, nephrolithiasis</td><td>3&#x0202f;day history of generalised and gastrointestinal symptoms<break/><break/>Presented outside of influenza season</td><td>Lymphopenia, mildly raised CRP<break/><break/>No initial renal dysfunction<xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>CT chest: left-sided pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)</td><td>Throat swab: adenovirus PCR positive<break/><break/>BAL: adenovirus PCR positive at 7.5&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>9</sup>&#x0202f;gEq/ml<break/><break/>EDTA plasma: adenovirus PCR positive at 2.0&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>6</sup>&#x0202f;gEq/ml<xref rid="tf0010" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref><break/><break/>Adenovirus species B type 7 by genomic sequencing</td><td>Cidofovir &#x02013; renal impairment requiring RRT<break/><break/>IVIG also given<break/><break/>Consideration for ECMO but not initiated due to futility.</td><td>Died on day 12 due to multi-organ failure</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><bold>Abbreviations</bold>: BBV&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;blood borne viruses; LRTI&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;lower respiratory tract infection; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CRP&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;C-reactive protein; CXR&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;chest radiograph; CT&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;computed tomography; BAL&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;bronchoalveolar lavage; RRT&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;renal replacement therapy; ECMO&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation; gEq/ml&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;genome equivalents/millilitre, IVIG&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;intravenous immunoglobulin; HDU&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;high dependency unit (Level 2 Care), URTI&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;upper respiratory tract infection.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0005"><label>a</label><p id="np0005">Other initial blood tests including haemoglobin, platelets, clotting profile, liver function tests, and bone profile were normal.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0010"><label>b</label><p id="np0010">Full infection screen included blood cultures, legionella/pneumococcal urinary antigens, urine bacterial culture, blood-borne virus (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C), serum EDTA plasma: EBV PCR (positive in Case 1 at 728 copies gEq/ml and positive Case 2 at 908 copies gEq/ml, log 3), CMV PCR negative in Cases 1 and 2, upper respiratory tract bacterial culture and extended viral PCR panel, sputum microscopy and bacterial culture and extended viral PCR panel (including from BAL samples), faecal bacterial culture and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> screening, and resistant organism swabs including VRE and CPE (Case 2 was VRE positive).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Case 2</title><p id="p0055">In April 2018, a 73-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of diarrhoea, vomiting, malaise, myalgia and lethargy without respiratory symptoms.

It has been postulated that military recruits are at increased risk of adenovirus infection due to crowding and also the physical and psychological stress associated with their training.<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In addition, it has been suggested that obesity may be associated with adenovirus disease in immunocompetent individuals although the exact mechanism behind this remains unclear.<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Therefore, adenovirus type 7 may have been the cause of the severity of illness seen in our patients but equally it could have related to obesity, chronic lung disease, smoking, and social risk factors including unstable housing as external stressors (Case 1) and advanced age and comorbidities coupled with extensive physical exertion shortly prior to admission during an extended hike (Case 2).</p><p id="p0095">Randomised-controlled trial evidence for antiviral treatments in adenovirus infection is lacking<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> with the mainstay of care being supportive, including ECMO and renal replacement where necessary.<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Cidofovir has been shown to reduce adenoviral loads in a case series of 7 patients (all of whom survived) but its use, as in our patients, is limited by nephrotoxicity.<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Brincidofovir, a lipid ester of cidofovir, is an emerging alternative adenovirus therapy that does not cause nephrotoxicity and is currently undergoing randomised controlled evaluation.<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> There is no evidence for IVIG in adenovirus infections but it was given to Case 2 due to biologically-plausible benefit of providing antibodies directed against the virus.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0100">Severe lower respiratory tract infection with adenovirus, especially type 7, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Clinical and radiological features are similar to other infective causes of LRTI, pneumonia and ARDS (including severe influenza) but, as in Case 2 and similar to recent influenza epidemics, presenting symptoms can be non-specific. Positive adenovirus PCR can support a diagnosis in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome and no other identified aetiology, and higher viral loads are associated with worse prognosis. Although treatment is predominantly supportive, early use of cidofovir may improve outcomes. These two rare cases highlight that adenovirus sLRTI should be considered in the differential diagnoses of immunocompetent adults presenting with sLRTI, pneumonia, and/or ARDS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group
