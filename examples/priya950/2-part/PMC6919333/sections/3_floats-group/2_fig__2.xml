  <p>Evolutionary relationship of Human Adenovirus type B7 (HAdV-B7) partial hexon gene sequences including sequences obtained from two cases of adenovirus sLRTI.</p>
  <p>Legend: The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Tamura 3-parameter model in MEGA7 and is mid-point rooted.
   <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16.</xref>, 
   <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17.</xref> Bootstrap values (&gt;Â 50%) are shown for key nodes. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Scale bar indicates estimated number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Sequences are identified by GenBank accession number, geographic location, year of sample collection, and virus genome type identified. Sequences obtained from cases described in this study are highlighted: Human Adenovirus (HAdV) strains Human\England\05.1\2018\B7 (MN199306) and Human\England\21.1\2018\B7 (MN199307).
