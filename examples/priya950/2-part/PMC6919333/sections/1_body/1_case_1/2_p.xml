<p id="p0040">Initial evaluation revealed widespread bilateral rhonchi and severe respiratory distress. A diagnosis of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation precipitated by LRTI was made. Antimicrobial treatment commenced included oseltamivir (due to presentation during peak of influenza season and risk factors for viral pneumonitis including chronic lung disease and obesity), benzylpenicillin and clarithromycin. Respiratory distress was treated with oxygen therapy, nebulised bronchodilators, intravenous steroids and magnesium. Investigations showed lymphopenia with raised inflammatory markers but normal liver and kidney function. Arterial blood gas showed type 1 respiratory failure. Chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy consolidation. Blood-borne virus (BBV) screen, including HIV, was negative.</p>
