<p id="p0050">Following intubation, bronchoscopy with diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Despite paralysis and airway pressure release ventilation for respiratory recruitment, the patient continued to desaturate and developed type 2 respiratory failure.

On day 52, the patient no longer required ventilation and, by day 65, she was stepped down to ward-level care.
