<p id="p0080">Laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infection can be challenging. The clinical utility of viral cultures for identification of adenovirus is limited by time to positivity (≤ 7 days) and antigen testing has low sensitivity and specificity.

 </xref> Therefore, adenovirus identification is best achieved using PCR. However, a positive PCR result does not equate to aetiology and must be evaluated in the clinical context.

 </xref> Both of our patients had high adenoviral loads and viraemia, which, in the context of confirmed adenoviral sLRTI in immunocompetent children and adults, are associated with worse prognosis and higher mortality.

 </xref> Our patients' viraemia could also suggest disseminated adenoviral disease but no relevant samples (e.g. tissue biopsy) were taken to confirm this.
