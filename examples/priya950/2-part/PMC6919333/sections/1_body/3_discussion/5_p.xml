<p id="p0090">Both of our patients had adenovirus type 7, which was not associated with any known, local outbreaks, but has been implicated in outbreaks in the literature: adenovirus types 3 and 7 were isolated from 541/800 previously-healthy individuals with acute respiratory illness in a military barracks

 </xref> one third had adenovirus type 7, which was also associated with higher morbidity than non-type 7. Partial hexon gene sequences (hypervariable region) from the two cases described here showed 99.7% similarity to each other. Sequence from Case 2 clustered together with recent HAdV-B7d sequences from China and the Oregon LRTI patients. Sequence from Case 1 did not form part of this cluster (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Although sequencing of the hexon hypervariable region is strongly correlated with virus serotype, as these were only partial hexon gene sequences, whole genome sequencing would be required to provide full genomic detail, to determine whether recombination had occurred and definitively define the genotype. It has been postulated that military recruits are at increased risk of adenovirus infection due to crowding and also the physical and psychological stress associated with their training.

 </xref> Therefore, adenovirus type 7 may have been the cause of the severity of illness seen in our patients but equally it could have related to obesity, chronic lung disease, smoking, and social risk factors including unstable housing as external stressors (Case 1) and advanced age and comorbidities coupled with extensive physical exertion shortly prior to admission during an extended hike (Case 2).
