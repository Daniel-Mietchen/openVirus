<p id="p0085">To identify adenovirus type in our cases, two PCR assays targeting different regions of the adenovirus genome were used to amplify PCR products from BAL samples, two regions of the adenovirus hexon gene were sequenced using Sanger dideoxy sequencing methods, and these were then compared using BLAST for similarity to known adenovirus sequences in national databases.

Sequences were aligned using ClustalW embedded in BioEdit (V 7.0.5.3.), and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Tamura 3-parameter model in MEGA7 (
