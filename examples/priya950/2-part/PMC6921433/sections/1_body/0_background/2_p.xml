<p id="Par9">At first blush, HCTs seem ideal to prepare for future infectious diseases epidemics. Consider that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was recently created in order to “finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious disease epidemics” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For epidemics that loom on the horizon, developing vaccines without being able to test them on populations who are naturally exposed to a disease is difficult. Because HCTs involve isolating strains of a disease and deliberately infecting participants with the disease in a controlled environment, they make it possible to study interventions for infectious diseases in advance of outbreaks.
