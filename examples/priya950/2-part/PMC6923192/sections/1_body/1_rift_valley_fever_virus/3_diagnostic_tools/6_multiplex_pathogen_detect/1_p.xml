<p>Rather than focus on specific detection of RVFV, there are several multiplex assays that incorporate RVFV into the testing panel. Fajfr et al. developed multiplex assays targeting hemorrhagic filoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses including RVFV, using previously-published primers (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). These assays are optimized for several types of real-time PCR instruments, including a portable “Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device (R.A.P.I.D.)” (Idaho Technology, Inc.). Liu et al. developed a real-time PCR-based TaqMan array card (TAC) that can screen up to eight samples within 3 h for up to 26 agents simultaneously (

 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes were successfully detected by the platform (
