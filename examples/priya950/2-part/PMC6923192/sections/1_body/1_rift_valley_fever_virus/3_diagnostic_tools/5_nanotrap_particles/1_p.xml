<p>One innovative new approach to sample preparation, which also addresses sensitivity issues that might arise during surveillance, is the use of nanotrap particles to improve the detection of RVFV in low-titer samples by ~100-fold (

Inactivation of RVFV by detergents or heat treatments did not affect the efficacy of virus binding to nanotrap particles, demonstrating that field samples can be safely inactivated and processed with nanotrap enrichment method to maximize sensitivity and maintain safety precautions (
