<p>The USDA APHIS has published “The Foreign Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Plan (FAD PReP)—Disease Response Strategy: Rift Valley Fever” (2013) (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This document is intended to provide responders with the critical information necessary to mount an effective response effort against RVF in domestic livestock in the US (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This document recommends approaches to disease control and eradication in the event of an introduction, including the roles and responsibilities of US government agencies (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These control and eradication strategies are based on four epidemiological principles: “1. Prevent contact between RVFV and susceptible animals (i.e., quarantine and movement control), 2. Stop the production of RVFV by infected or exposed animals, 3. Stop the production of RVFV by insect vectors (i.e., vector surveillance and control), and 4. Increase the disease resistance of susceptible animals to RVFV (i.e., vaccination)” (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Vector surveillance is only considered in the context of an outbreak and rapid response situation in these guidelines, and not as a potential strategy for early detection. Because of the diverse infrastructure for how vector surveillance and control is managed, these decisions would be left to the agency responsible for conducting vector surveillance activities at the county or municipal government level (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). While these guidelines take some important first steps in providing a framework for priority activities by responsible parties, additional planning is needed to determine mechanisms for inter-agency collaboration during surveillance and response efforts, and identify capacity gaps for implementation of this strategic plan on the ground in an emergency situation. Further, no plan is outlined for conducting pre-introduction surveillance activities, either active or passive, as is detailed in the USAID plan (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These gaps should be addressed for diseases, such as RVFV which are considered serious risks for introduction.
