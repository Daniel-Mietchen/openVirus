<p>The rapid deployment of available vaccines may aid considerably in curtailing virus circulation. RVF vaccines currently being deployed under emergency circumstances in Africa include the formalin-inactivated attenuated Smithburn strain. The Smithburn strain vaccine is “recommended for use in pregnant animals and in RVF-free countries experiencing outbreaks” (

If the decision to vaccinate is made, the vaccine must meet the standards in the “OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines.” The final decision to vaccinate will be made by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection service (APHIS) VS Deputy Administrator (US Chief Veterinary Officer) (
