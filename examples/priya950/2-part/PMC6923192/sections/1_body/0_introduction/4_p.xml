<p>African swine fever virus has demonstrated its ability to cross national borders and establish in diverse geographical areas around the globe (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A unique risk for introduction of ASFV is that this DNA virus is exceptionally stable in the environment, and remains viable in animal products. This property opens a potential route of entry not available to RVFV and JEV. If ASFV invades the US, competent vertebrate amplifying hosts as well as transmission-competent soft ticks are known to be present, although many questions remain (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). California, Texas, and Florida were among the states with the highest predicted risk for ASFV introduction through imported swine or swine products (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Further, these states plus much of the southwestern US were predicted to have increased risk for ASFV establishment should this virus be introduced. Additionally, operational procedures that characterize small-scale and organic pig producers throughout the southern US made these enterprises particularly vulnerable to ASFV circulation given the potential exposure to feral swine or
