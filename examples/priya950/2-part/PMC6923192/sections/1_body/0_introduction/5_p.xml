<p>Preventing establishment of any or all of these viral pathogens would require biosecurity and health infrastructure to have a broad focus able to evaluate the risk of introduction and establishment of these disease agents. For example, monitoring passengers with febrile illness entering via airplane from RVFV-endemic countries, inspecting aircraft entering the US from JEV and RVFV-endemic countries for mosquitoes, testing swine products for ASFV, educating agricultural, wildlife, and veterinary professionals to recognize signs and symptoms of infection with any of these agents, conducting surveillance on a diversity of wildlife species spanning birds, deer, and feral swine, and being prepared to mitigate local vector-borne transmission through mosquito and tick vector control. As an example of extreme caution, the 2019 World Pork Expo to be held in June in Des Moines, Iowa was canceled by the National Pork Producers Council due to the concern for the risk of ASFV infected products or fomites being introduced from infected countries (

Executing the scope and complexity of these activities effectively with limited resources will make identification and early response to any of these agents particularly challenging. Diagnostic labs in the US testing samples from animals or arthropod vectors do not routinely test for these three agents specifically. Still, an extensive national network of veterinary diagnostic laboratories, and valuable knowledge, guidelines, and diagnostic tools exist for each of these viral pathogens to help prepare for such events. The following sections compile information on the current status of surveillance practices and diagnostic tools in use for RVFV, JEV, and ASFV.
