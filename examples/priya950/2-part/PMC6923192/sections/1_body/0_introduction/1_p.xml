<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), are three vector-borne veterinary pathogens with the potential to invade the United States (US). All of these viruses are notifiable animal diseases (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) is also included on the “World Health Organization (WHO) Blueprint of priority pathogens” (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). While these viruses would all have devastating health and economic impacts, the ecological context and potential transmission dynamics of each are quite different and would require unique preparedness and mitigation efforts. All of these agents are capable of vector-borne as well as direct transmission (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). JEV and RVFV are also zoonotic and capable of causing disease in humans, and the potential vector, domestic, and wild animal species involved in enzootic and spillover transmission are variable. Routes of potential entry into the US span importation of infected vectors (all three agents), viremic travelers (RVFV), infected animal products (ASFV), or contaminated fomites (ASFV), hence requiring very different preparedness efforts. This complexity in disease ecology and introduction potential presents a challenge to our health infrastructure to prepare for one or multiple such events.
