<p>Japanese encephalitis virus strains have a history of invasion and establishment among new areas in Asia. Molecular epidemiological evidence suggests that JEV strains are introduced from continental south-east Asia to Japan regularly (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Introductions of JEV within Asia and between Asia and Australia are believed to be through either infected windblown mosquitoes or birds, where the virus then circulates enzootically among native birds and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Considering seven possible pathways of JEV entry into the US, entry of infected adult mosquitoes through air travel was the most likely scenario, however, the risk of establishment of JEV in the US following this type of introduction was variable (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Several parameters complicated the establishment in the US, including a relatively short host viremia, unpredictable contact rates between hosts and vectors, particularly near airports, virus strain and genotype differences, and the cross-protection of JEV with other flaviviruses endemic to the US (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). North American 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes have been shown to be competent for infection with JEV under experimental conditions (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The predictable and stochastic factors influencing an introduction are complex, which makes risk assessment efforts challenging.
