<p>African swine fever virus (ASFV) (
 <italic>Asfaviridae: Asfavirus</italic>), is transmitted among wild vertebrate reservoir species by soft ticks in the genus 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic>. Infection of wild and domestic suids with this virus is associated with high mortality, and hemorrhagic fever, however infections in African suid species are asymptomatic (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Until the 1980s ASF remained confined to Africa, with the exception of Sardinia. In 2007 ASF was reported from the country of Georgia (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). From Georgia, ASFV expanded its range throughout the Caucasus and the Russian Federation, and was reported from the European Union (EU) in 2014. Incursions of ASFV into Caribbean and Brazil were met with aggressive and costly responses that successfully eradicated the virus (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). ASFV strains belonging to the vp72 genotype II currently circulate endemically among wild boar populations in Eastern Europe and cause epidemics in domestic pig and wild boar populations, while genotype I circulates in Sardinia. From this history, many lessons have been learned from curtailing ASFV circulation in resource-poor endemic areas in Africa, as well as combatting outbreak activity in areas of recent introduction throughout Europe.
