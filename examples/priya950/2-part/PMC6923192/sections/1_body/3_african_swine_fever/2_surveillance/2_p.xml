<p>Passive surveillance of deceased wild boar and symptomatic animals could serve as first indicators of ASFV activity in new area of introduction (

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Sensitivity and specificity of these kits on dried blood swabs well-exceeded 90%. These studies demonstrate that molecular and serological diagnostics are easily applied to a passive surveillance strategy targeting carcasses, and a practical approach for early detection of ASFV circulation.
