<p>Mur et al. tested oral fluids as a non-invasive alternative to serum for ASF diagnosis (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Oral fluid samples were collected by allowing experimentally-infected pigs to chew on ropes, and collecting fluid from the ropes. Paired samples of oral secretions and serum were tested for antibody against ASFV by both ELISA and the immunoperoxidase test (IPT). ASFV antibodies were detected in oral secretions for the 65-days duration of the experiment by both methods, introducing the possibility of saliva-based surveillance and diagnostics for ASF.
