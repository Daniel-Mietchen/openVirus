<p>Because ASF is only one porcine pathogen of veterinary significance, some diagnostic efforts have included ASF in multiplex assays targeting multiple agents. Grau et al. developed a multiplex real-time PCR (mRT-qPCR) for concurrent detection of ASFV, classical swine fever virus, and foot and mouth disease virus, and evaluated use of this assay on swine oral secretions (
