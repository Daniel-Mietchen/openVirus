<p>Recommended PCR assays for ASFV have become standard diagnostic tool in reference laboratories (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). A side-by-side proficiency test of the UPL-PCR (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>), and the recommended OIE conventional (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>) and real-time PCR assays (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>) assays revealed almost perfect agreement between these methods, however the UPL-PCR had greater diagnostic sensitivity for early detection of the disease. Due to some potential primer mis-matches between the primers in the OIE PCR assay (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). Luo et al. designed novel conventional PCR primers to address these sensitivity issues observed with the OIE assay for detection of European strains of ASFV (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). This updated PCR assay demonstrated improved diagnostic sensitivity than the two OIE over comparable PCR assays (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>) when detecting diverse virus strains (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). Wozniakowski et al. recently developed a polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR). This sensitive new test does not cross-react with other porcine pathogens, and has been validated on multiple sample types derived from ASFV-infected wild boars and pigs (
