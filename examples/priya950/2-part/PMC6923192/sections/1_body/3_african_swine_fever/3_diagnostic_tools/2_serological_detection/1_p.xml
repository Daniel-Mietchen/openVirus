<p>Currently, there is no approved vaccine for ASFV. Therefore, all antibody detections in field samples are indicative of natural exposure to virus circulation. Though caution must be taken in endemic epidemiological situations zero antibody positivity has been observed PCR ASF positive animal (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Average animal positivity for ASFV by PCR in Southwestern Kenya was 28%, despite these animals being asymptomatic and sero-negative by ELISA (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Such results demand for parallel confirmatory test to rule out infection or exposure, e.g., combination of molecular tools and serology. Gallardo et al. compared three commercial ELISAs with varying antigenic targets, the OIE-ELISA test, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT) (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). While the ELISA-based tests were rapid, high-throughput, and could be automated, sensitivity was generally poor compared to that of the Universal Probe Library (UPL-PCR) molecular test (see below) (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). The IPT was advantageous in detection of ASF antibodies earlier during the course of infection when titers were low (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). More recently, an indirect ELISA can be used to detect ASFV antibodies in either serum or oral secretions, and has been validated on field samples (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Serological assays optimized for use on both oral and serum samples will be useful in endemic areas where virulence is low (
