<p>Surveillance for JEV in the US would comprise passive and active surveillance of mosquito vectors, wildlife hosts, and domestic animals as well as people. Considering the genotype diversity of JEV, phylogenetic models have been developed to study JEV host changes and patterns of dispersal for different JEV genotypes using data collected through active and passive surveillance programs. Through this study, the authors concluded that active surveillance of mosquitoes was important in characterizing the circulating strain diversity of JEV, epidemiology, and transmission patterns, which informed virus spatial and evolutionary patterns (

Yoshikawa et al. studied the serological and molecular epidemiology of JEV on an island of Japan, by conducting active surveillance of pigs as well as mosquitoes. Pigs were sampled at slaughterhouses and pig farms, and mosquito collections were coordinated near pig farms. The resulting data demonstrate seasonality of virus-positive mosquitoes and seroconversions and virus isolation from pigs over a 7-years period (

This study presents the type of information that is useful in identifying not only spatial foci of transmission, but also seasonal patterns, which will direct evidence-based surveillance and control programs and help conserve resources. Vector surveillance would play a key role in monitoring JEV circulation after a virus introduction.
