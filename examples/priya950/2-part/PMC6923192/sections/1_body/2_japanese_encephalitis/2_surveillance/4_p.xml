<p>The practice of using of sentinel animals to detect active transmission through seroconversion is widespread in arbovirus surveillance programs. Cohorts of sentinel pigs in addition to mosquito collections have been used to determine the rate of JEV transmission to pigs in Cambodia (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). While virus infection rates in mosquitoes were low, intense transmission was detected in pigs through the seroconversion of almost all of the pigs over the course of the study. This finding may be attributed to the potential for transmission of JEV directly between pigs through oral-nasal secretions (
