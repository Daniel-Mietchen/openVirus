<p>Globally, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is one of the most prevalent encephalitic arboviruses, mainly found in eastern and southern regions of Asia (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Japanese encephalitis virus is primarily recognized as a human pathogen, but affects animal health as well. This virus is transmitted enzootically among mosquitoes (i.e., 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>), swine and wading birds, which serve as amplification hosts (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Infection of horses with JEV has also been documented (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). People are exposed to JEV through the bite of an infectious mosquito but are considered dead-end hosts, as there is no human-to-human transmission. Japanese encephalitis virus is comprised of five genotypes (GIâ€“GV) which are classified according to the phylogeny of the envelope (E) gene (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), with emergence and circulation of different genotypes alerting public health professionals throughout areas of endemicity. Commercial vaccines are available for humans (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and pigs and horses (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), however veterinary vaccines for JEV are relatively less available than human vaccines (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
