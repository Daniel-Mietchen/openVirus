<p>Antibody detection (IgM and IgG) by capture ELISA is the recognized standard for JE diagnosis (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). However, an important consideration for JE serological diagnosis is the extraordinary cross-reactivity among flaviviruses due to shared viral epitopes (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). This cross-reactivity challenges the ability of diagnosticians to verify the identity of the infecting flavivirus, particularly in endemic areas where multiple flaviviruses are co-circulating. Diagnostic approaches to overcome these challenges with flavivirus serology include the use of specific IgM ELISAs during the early stages of infection, and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). While PRNT may provide serological differentiation among closely-related and/or co-circulating flaviviruses, the technique is labor-intensive and involves working with live virus, which may not be feasible for many laboratories.
