<p>JEV viral RNA can be detected from viremic vertebrate samples and mosquitoes by many different available assays spanning traditional single-plex RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>), to more complex multiplex assays to screen samples for multiple arboviruses simultaneously (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). The multiplex assay developed by Wang et al. targets; “WNV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, Western equine encephalomyelitis virus, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, Highlands J virus and JEV” (
