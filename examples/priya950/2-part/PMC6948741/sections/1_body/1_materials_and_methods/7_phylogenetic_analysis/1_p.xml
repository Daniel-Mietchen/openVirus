<p>Nucleotide sequences recovered from this study were first subtyped using Chikungunya TypingTool (

 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. New sequences were aligned to complete or almost complete reference CHIKV genome sequences (&gt;10,000 bp), retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (

Reference strains were included based on the following criteria: 1) published in peer-reviewed journals; 2) no uncertainty regarding lineage assignment of each sequence; 3) non-recombinant classification using RDP4 recombination detection software. Alignment was performed using MAFFT online program [

 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was reconstructed from the concatenated dataset (n = 225) using IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with 4 gamma categories (HKY+4G) which was inferred in jModelTest as the best fitting model [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Statistical robustness of tree topology was inspected using 100 bootstrap replicates [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; bootstrap value &gt;90% was considered statistically significant. From the ML generated using the concatenated dataset we selected all ECSA taxa from Brazil (ECSA-BR dataset) (n = 36) samples in different states Alagoas n = 25; Bahia n = 5; Paraiba n = 2; Pernambuco n = 1; Rio de Janeiro n = 2; Sergipe n = 1.
