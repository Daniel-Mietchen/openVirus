<p>Regarding SNPs found in our analysis, previous studies have reported the occurrence of CHIKV mutations that modified its adaption to mosquito vectors such E1-A226V mutation, that increase IOL strain replication rate in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We performed protein alignments to investigate the presence of the A226V (E1 protein) on the novel sequences generate in our study but we did not observe it. Also, the non-synonymous SNPs found here are not related to any known CHIKV mutations that increase the virus replication and/or infectivity in vector or mammalian hosts. However, several non-synonymous mutations, both fixed and minor variant, were found in non-structural proteins which may have an effect on viral evasion from the mammal immunological system as reported by others [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These findings reinforce the need of further studies and continuous genomic surveillance to track viral adaptations and to identify main sources of transmission for improved public health actions, especially regarding vector control once the increase of mosquito-borne diseases is associated to the occurrence of their competent vectors in conjunction with adequate climate conditions [
