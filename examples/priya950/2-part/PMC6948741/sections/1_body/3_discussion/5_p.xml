<p>All 27 patients sampled in this study exhibited compatible symptoms for CHIKV infection. Taken together, these findings corroborate to other studies that demonstrate that 70% of CHIKV infection cases are symptomatic, since the virus rate of attack is high [

The difference of positive results between ELISA and RT-qPCR techniques is justified by the lack of time from the onset of symptoms and collection date performed, since the viremic peak–that would be detected by RT-qPCR–occurs in first days of infection [
