  <p>MAFFT alignment of the Ross River virus data set revealed a 12-amino-acid insertion within the hypervariable region of the nsP3 gene, which was unique and characteristic of G3 and G4 isolates. Two isolates, DC36025 and RRV_TT, had a 5-amino-acid and 12-amino-acid deletion within this insertion region, respectively. No G1 or G2 isolates in our study contained this 36-nucleotide insertion.</p>
