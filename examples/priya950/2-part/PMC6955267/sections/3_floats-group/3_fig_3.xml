 <caption>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) of 106 dated Ross River virus whole-genome sequences, estimated under an uncorrelated log normal (UCLN) molecular clock, assuming a GTR + G + I nucleotide substitution model. Clades are colored for the geographical origin of the taxa. Posterior probability values of &gt;0.70 are shown above branches. Nodes defining major genetic groups are named A to H and are referenced in the lower table. Calendar years are shown on the 
   <italic>x</italic> axis. The table presents the divergence time (time to most recent common ancestor [tMRCA]) of distinct nodes (A to H) and the nucleotide substitution rates, with statistical error reported as the 95% highest probability density (95% HPD).
