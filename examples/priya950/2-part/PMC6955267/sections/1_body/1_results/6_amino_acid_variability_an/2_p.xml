<p>Most amino acid transitions in our data set were observed within the C-terminal region of the nsP3 gene, otherwise known as the hypervariable domain (HVD) due to the high variability in nucleotide sequence and length, even between strains of the same alphavirus species (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The HVD has been observed in alphaviruses such as Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and CHIKV to be able to withstand large nucleotide insertions and deletions, with minimal impact on viral replication efficiency (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). While this domain is largely nonconserved among the alphaviruses, the HVD contains several conserved elements, such as the proline-rich (P*P*PR) domains and duplicated FGDF-like motifs that are conserved among all Old World alphaviruses and which interact with host proteins to influence viral replication (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Four repeat P*P*PR motifs have been observed within the RRV nsP3 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
