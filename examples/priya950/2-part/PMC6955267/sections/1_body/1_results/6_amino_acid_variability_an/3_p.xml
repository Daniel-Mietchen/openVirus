<p>Nucleotide deletions of various lengths (3 nucleotides [nt] to 135 nt, 1 to 45 amino acids [aa]), within the HVD were observed for 24 isolates belonging to G2 to G4 in our data set (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, most observed nucleotide deletions, with the exception of those occurring in two isolates, K3011 and DC5692, resulted in the loss or partial loss of either the second or third RRV HVD P*P*PR motif. While the supposedly well-conserved proline motifs of the HVD were removed in several isolates studied, all RRV isolates in our study maintained both conserved FGDF-like motifs.
