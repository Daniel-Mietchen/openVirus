<p>An arginine residue (CGA) in place of an opal termination stop codon (UGA) at the C terminus of the nsP3 gene was observed in isolate K3011 (G2), isolated from a pool of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes pseudonormanensis</named-content> mosquitoes sampled in the Pilbara town of Nullagine in 1990. Such opal stop codon-to-arginine transitions have been observed in several strains of other alphaviruses, including Oâ€™nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and CHIKV, and this is the first documented observation of such a transition in RRV. Introduction of an arginine codon into a CHIKV isolate significantly reduced joint morbidities in infected mice compared to that in mice infected with the wild type (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Virus replication did not appear to be affected. ONNV isolates that contained the opal stop codon all demonstrated the opal-to-arginine residue change by the fifth passage on Vero cells, suggesting that variants of ONNV containing both residues exist as a quasispecies and have different abilities to replicate in different hosts (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the present study, an opal stop codon-to-cysteine (TGT) transition was observed in the nsP3 gene of P42213 (G3), an isolate from the Cook Islands sampled at the conclusion of the PICTs epidemic in 1980. Such a transition has been described in an isolate of Sindbis virus (SINV; S.A.AR86) and was associated with neurovirulence in mice, in comparison with a similar avirulent SINV strain, Girdwood, which retained the opal codon (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).
