<p>Another notable observation was that of a 12-amino-acid insertion (STVLHADTVSLD) within nsP3, upstream of those deletion events noted above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This insertion was observed in all G3 and G4 viruses and not in the other genotypes. The earliest isolate in this data set that contained this insertion was G3 isolate F9073, collected in Fiji in 1979 at the beginning of the PICTs epidemic. Nucleotide deletions were observed within this apparently fixed insertion region, in isolates DC36025 and RRV_TT (accession

The 15-nt deletion within DC36025 resulted in the loss of the V-L-H-A-D portion of the insertion sequence. The 36-nt deletion observed within RRV_TT occurred from the second nucleotide within the insertion region, resulting in the complete loss of the 12-aa sequence, and was the only isolate of G3 or G4 in our data set to lack this insertion. The events leading to the fixation of this 12-aa element are yet to be resolved.
