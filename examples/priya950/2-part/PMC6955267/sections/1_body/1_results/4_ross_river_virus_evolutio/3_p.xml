<p>In contrast to previous investigations of RRV selection pressure, five individual codon sites were found to have significant evidence of positive selection pressure by at least two methods utilized in the analysis (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), within the nonstructural (nsP1, two sites; nsP3, one site) and structural (E1, one site; E3, one site) polyproteins (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Notably, the site under apparent positive selection pressure within nsP3 was found to be within the N terminus of the hypervariable domain (HVD). The I248T substitution within the nsP1 gene was the most highly represented site under positive selection, was observed in 40 individual isolates from all four genotypes, and was supported as a site under positive selection in all four selection analysis methods implemented.
