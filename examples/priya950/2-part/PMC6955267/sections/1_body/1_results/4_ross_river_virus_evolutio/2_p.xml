<p>Selection pressure analysis revealed that the entire RRV genome is under purifying selection, with many sites under significant negative selection pressure within each ORF (between 106 and 830 individual sites). This is consistent with the widely supported “trade-off” hypothesis for mosquito-borne alphaviruses, that is, that the alternation of replication between two distinct host systems (vertebrate and invertebrate) limits the evolution of arboviruses, as enhanced fitness in one host may be detrimental to replication in the alternate host (
