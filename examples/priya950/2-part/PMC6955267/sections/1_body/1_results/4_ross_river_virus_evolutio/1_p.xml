<p>The mean nucleotide substitution rate (substitutions/site/year) estimated using the whole-genome data set of RRV under a relaxed UCLN molecular clock was 3.21 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year (95% HPD, 2.64 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 3.77 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) (

These estimates are consistent with previous estimations of alphavirus substitution rates based on whole-genome sequences and the observations of this study (see below) that RRV, while being a low-fidelity RNA virus, evolves under a high degree of negative selection pressure given that it must replicate in two very distinct host systems, the mosquito and the mammalian host (
