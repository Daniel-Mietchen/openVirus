<p>The Bayesian skyline analysis showed substantial changes in RRV relative genetic diversity, with peaks in diversity during the early 1980s and during 2000 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The lower levels of genetic diversity observed during the remaining periods were similar to those estimated using the E2 genes previously, although these estimates were lower than those estimated for other globally prevalent arboviruses such as dengue virus and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Considerable increases in virus effective population size was detected during early to mid-1980s, coinciding with the PICTs epidemic, and during late 1990/early 2000, likely signifying the rapid expansion of G4 during this time.
