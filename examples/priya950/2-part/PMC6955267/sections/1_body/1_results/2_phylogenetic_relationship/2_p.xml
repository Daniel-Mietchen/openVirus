<p>G2 viruses (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) formed two distinct and well-supported sublineages, separated spatially and temporally within WA. G2 viruses sampled 1977–1984 were collected in the Kimberley region of northern WA (sublineage G2A), whereas isolates sampled subsequent to this period, between 1987 and 1995, were composed exclusively of samples collected from southern and central WA (sublineage G2B). Three human-derived Western Australian RRV isolates, collected 1989–1992, clustered with the southern G2B sublineage. It may appear as though the G2A lineage in the north was the source of the G2B lineage in the south, based on their sampling dates. However, it must be noted that virus sampling in the north predates sampling in the south of WA, and there are no data to indicate what viruses were in circulation in the south prior to 1987. Interestingly, the northern G2A lineage demonstrated greater genetic diversity than the southern G2B lineage.
