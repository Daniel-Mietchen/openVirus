<p>Genomic analysis revealed the expansion of genetic diversity among the emergent G4 viruses since the early 1990s, with two major sublineages characterized thus far. The majority of G4 isolates (51 of 58 isolates, 1994–2014) belonged to a distinct sublineage (G4A) which included several recent human-derived isolates from QLD. The second major sublineage (G4B) contains several mosquito-derived isolates from north and central WA (1994–2010) as well as two human-derived isolates sampled in QLD in 2004 (QML1) and 2016 (MIDI13). Interestingly, the earliest isolates of both distinct sublineages were isolated from mosquitoes collected on the same day and location in 1994 at Whim Creek in the Pilbara region. The mechanism by which G4 seemingly became the dominant lineage of RRV in circulation is yet to be elucidated.</p>
