<p>The detection of multiple isolates from the G2 and G3 genotypes within Western Australia, which were previously classified as the Eastern and Western Australian lineages, respectively, calls into question the supposedly strong nationwide geographical structure of RRV genetic groups. Further evidence of this lack of strong nationwide geographical structure is evident when a maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed with our whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data set and published partial E2 gene sequences (see Fig. S1). Notably, G3, previously designated the Eastern lineage, contained isolates sampled from QLD, WA, Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, all within a 5-year period (1983â€“1988).</p>
