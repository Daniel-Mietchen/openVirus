<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the complete RRV coding sequence data set revealed the historical circulation of two of the three previously described RRV genotypes (G2 and G3) within WA as well as a newly classified fourth genotype (G4) that was most closely related to G3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). No isolates belonging to G1, which contains the RRV prototype, T48, were detected within WA during our study period. Nonparametric bootstrapping showed strong support (100% of 1,000 bootstrap replicates) for each of the four genotypes. The majority of isolates sampled in this data set (58 of 106) and all isolates collected in WA since 1996 belonged to the G4 genotype, indicating that it is the contemporary and dominant genotype in circulation in Western Australia. Recently sampled isolates from QLD (2016–2018) were also classified as G4, indicating that this group may also be in current circulation in the east of Australia. Prior to the first detection of G4 viruses in WA in 1994, G2 viruses were the predominant group in this data set (1977–1995, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) detected throughout Western Australia. A small number of G3 isolates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were detected during the 1980s, but this represented a large proportion (6/13 [46%]) of the isolates sampled within WA during that period.
