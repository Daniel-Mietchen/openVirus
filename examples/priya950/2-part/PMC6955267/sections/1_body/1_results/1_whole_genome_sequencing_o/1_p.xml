<p>The complete coding genomes of 94 RRV isolates were successfully sequenced in this study (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). For all isolates sequenced, only partial 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences were resolved. Seventy-seven mosquito-derived isolates were selected to represent a wide spatial and temporal range (1977–2014) within Western Australia (

Four human-derived RRV isolates, each sampled in the south of Western Australia (1989–1992), were included as well as 13 clinical isolates collected from residents of Fiji, American Samoa, and the Cook Islands during the PICTs RRV disease epidemic (1979–1980). In addition, all publicly available RRV genomes were downloaded and included in all analyses with the exception of NB5092 (New South Wales, 1969, accession number

Our final data set consisted of the complete coding regions of 106 RRV genomes sampled over a 59-year time period from 1959 to 2018.
