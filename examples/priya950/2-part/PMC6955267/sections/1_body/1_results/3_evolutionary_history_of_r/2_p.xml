<p>Our estimate of the overall tMRCA was somewhat older than estimated previously in an analysis based on a partial E2 gene (&lt;250 bp) data set with 62 dated taxa (mean, 1949; 95% HPD, 1925â€“1959), indicating that we have characterized a greater diversity of RRV using near-whole-genome sequences and a larger data set (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It should be noted that the partial E2 data set lacked a strong temporal signal as demonstrated by root-to-tip regression analysis (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.429); thus, estimates of tMRCA and nucleotide substitution rates derived from this data set may not be reliable.
