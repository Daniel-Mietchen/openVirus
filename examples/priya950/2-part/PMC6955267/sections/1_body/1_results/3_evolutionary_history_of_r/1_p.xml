<p>To infer the time scale of emergence of RRV genotypes, we estimated the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and evolutionary rates of each defined genetic group based on a maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) under an uncorrelated log normal (UCLN) relaxed molecular clock (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The tMRCA of the root of the RRV phylogeny was estimated as 1923 (95% highest probable density [HPD], January 1899 to February 1945), or approximately 94 years ago. The mean divergence times of each RRV genotype occurred over the past 50 years, each separated by approximately 10 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Incidentally, the divergence time of the G3 and G4 groups in approximately 1967 (95% HPD, 1960.6 to 1974.2) coincided with the tMRCA of G2 (mean, 1967.3; 95% HPD, 1961.5 to 1972.8).
