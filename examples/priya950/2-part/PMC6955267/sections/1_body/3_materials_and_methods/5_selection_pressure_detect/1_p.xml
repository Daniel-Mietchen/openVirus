<p>Selection pressures acting along the codon regions were determined with the maximum likelihood alignment of the 106 taxa data set to identify sites under negative (purifying) or positive (diversifying) selection pressure. The two separate ORFs were analyzed independently to exclude the junction noncoding region. Four methods of selection detection were employed using HyPhy through the DataMonkey webserver (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datamonkey.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>), specifically, fixed-effect likelihood (FEL) (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Codon sites under negative or positive selection were confirmed by at least two methods with a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 for FEL and MEME, a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.1 for SLAC, and a posterior probability of over 90% in FUBAR.
