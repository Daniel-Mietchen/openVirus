<p>Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed using RAxML v8.2 (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) with a general time reversible nucleotide substitution model with gamma rate heterogeneity and proportion of invariable sites (GTR + Ð“
 <sub>4</sub> + I). Branch support was estimated using 1,000 maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates. ML trees were visualized and edited within FigTree v1.4 (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) in order to characterize distinct genetic groupings of RRV.
