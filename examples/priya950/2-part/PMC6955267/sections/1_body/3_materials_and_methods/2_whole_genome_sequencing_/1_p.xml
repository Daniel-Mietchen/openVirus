<p>The TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (96 reactions; Illumina) was used to generate library preparations, as per the manufacturersâ€™ instructions, modified to exclude the poly(A)-containing mRNA purification steps. RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexanucleotide primers (Illumina). Resulting libraries were validated using the Agilent 1000 DNA kit (Integrated Sciences). Validated libraries were then normalized and pooled, including a Phi-X control v3 (Illumina) to a final concentration of 12.5 pM. The final denatured pool was loaded onto a MiSeq reagent kit v2, 300 cycles (Illumina), before sequencing on a MiSeq. Reads were demultiplexed and assessed for quality using FastQC v0.11 (
