<p>Regarded as both a vector and vertebrate host generalist, RRV transmission is maintained in a sylvatic cycle between diverse mosquito vector species and vertebrate amplifying hosts (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Based on serological surveys and infection studies, macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) are considered to be the most significant vertebrate hosts of RRV in Australia (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Humans are often incidental dead-end hosts in this enzootic cycle, with a typical infection resulting in low-magnitude short-lasting viremia that is insufficient for ongoing transmission (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The PICTs outbreak highlights the potential for spatial expansion and large epidemics of RRV in naive human populations where a competent vector is present (
