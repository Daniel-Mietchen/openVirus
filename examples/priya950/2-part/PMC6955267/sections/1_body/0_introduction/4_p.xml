<p>Western Australia (WA) is the largest Australian state, making up a total land mass of 2.5 million km
 <sup>2</sup>, an area considerably larger than most countries. The northern and western coasts of WA meet the Indian Ocean, while the southern coast is bounded by the Southern Ocean. Despite being geographically vast, only approximately 10% of the Australian population live in WA and &gt;80% of Western Australians reside in the southwest corner, where the state’s capital, Perth, is located (

To date, there has yet to be a genome-scale phylogenetic study conducted on RRV in Australia, with only 13 unique whole-genome sequences published and available on NCBI as of July 2019, which includes a single isolate from Western Australia (DC5692, accession number
