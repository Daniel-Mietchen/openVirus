<p>To infer the spatiotemporal evolution of RRV in Australia and to better define its evolutionary dynamics and genetic diversity, we conducted a genome-scale phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of mosquito- and human-derived RRV isolates from a range of Western Australian locations between 1977 and 2014. Sequences were analyzed with publicly available whole-genomes previously deposited in GenBank. Whole-genome analysis will provide more robust and comprehensive estimates of Ross River virus evolutionary rates and assessment of evolutionary history and relationships between distinct isolates.</p>
