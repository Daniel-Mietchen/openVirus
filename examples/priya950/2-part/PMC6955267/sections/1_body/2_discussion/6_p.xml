<p>All viruses within G3 and G4 contained a unique and characteristic 12-amino-acid insertion within the nsP3 region. It has been suggested that this insertion, first observed in G3 isolates derived from the Pacific Islands epidemic, conferred a fitness advantage to RRV that resulted in increased case reporting in Australia and replacement of the G1 and G2 lineages (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Increased RRV case burden is more likely the result of RRV becoming a notifiable disease in Australia around the time of resolution of the Pacific Islands epidemic. Furthermore, in the present study, we show that G2 viruses circulated in Australia until at least 1995, 15 years following the first detection of G3. Our temporal analysis suggests that the G3/G4 group, and likely the characteristic 12-amino-acid insertion, emerged in approximately 1968 (95% HPD, 1961–1974), 11 years prior to the PICTs epidemic, and so it is unlikely that the insertion itself bears any importance in epidemic fitness. The significance of this apparently fixed 36-nucleotide insertion in terms of RRV fitness and virulence will be explored further.
