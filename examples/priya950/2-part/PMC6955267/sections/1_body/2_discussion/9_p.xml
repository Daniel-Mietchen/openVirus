<p>Our RRV data set was estimated to have diverged from an ancestral strain roughly 94â€‰years ago. Timescales have been estimated for other alphaviruses, including SINV (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), CHIKV (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Making meaningful comparisons of these timescales is currently difficult given the various evolutionary models and data sets utilized in these analyses. It would be informative to compare the timescales of these viruses in the future, when equivalent data sets can be obtained with further whole-genome sequencing studies.
