<p>Among the most significant findings was the identification of a long-term pattern of RRV evolution, whereby RRV genotypes emerge periodically, roughly, every decade. Emergent lineages were observed to demonstrate extensive geographical movement in a relatively short time frame. Sweeps in genotype dominance were observed in our investigation, whereby previously dominating genotypes were replaced by newly emergent variants. Within Western Australia, for example, G2 appeared to have been the dominant lineage in circulation between 1977 and 1995. G4 viruses were first detected in WA in 1994 and appeared to quickly become the dominating lineage throughout the state, with no G2 or G3 isolates detected in WA, or Australia as a whole, since 1995. The potential biological and ecological drivers of these apparent sweeps of genotype dominance within Western Australia are yet to be elucidated.</p>
