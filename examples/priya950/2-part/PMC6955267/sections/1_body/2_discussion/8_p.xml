<p>In comparison to the phylogeny and evolutionary rates inferred from analysis of the partial E2 (250â€‰bp) gene sequence (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), a greater diversity of RRV was resolved. The partial E2 phylogeny constructed using the isolates sequenced for this study was found to be insufficient to discriminate between the G3 and G4 genotypes, with poor bootstrapping support for most clade-defining nodes. The nucleotide substitution rates and divergence times of lineage-defining nodes estimated with our WGS data set were slower and older than the estimates of the previous partial E2 phylogeny. These previous estimates were inconsistent with estimates derived from other studies of alphavirus evolutionary rates (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
