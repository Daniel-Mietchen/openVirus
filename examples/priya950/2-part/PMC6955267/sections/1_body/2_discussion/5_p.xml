<p>The previous classification of RRV genetic groups into geographically distinct lineages, that is, the North-Eastern (G1), Western (G2), and Eastern (G3) Australian lineages, is not supported by the findings of this study, and we propose that this nomenclature is no longer valid. The Eastern lineage was composed of isolates sampled Australia wide. The contemporary G4 lineage was also found to be geographically dispersed, with isolates sampled in the west and east of Australia. While isolates grouping with the Western lineage were only detected in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, it cannot be said definitively that this genotype is exclusive to the west, as sequence data derived from the eastern states is limited in comparison to our western data set. No isolates of the North-Eastern lineage were sampled in WA during our study period, possibly as our sampling within Western Australia was limited during the time G1 was likely in higher circulation. It is plausible that lineages of RRV were once more geographically structured and only became dispersed with the more recently emergent G3 and G4 genotypes with the advent of increased travel or due to an undefined fitness advantage that supported greater dispersal. A likely possibility is that G1 and G2 were erroneously regarded as geographically distinct due to the lack of representative sampling from a broad range of locations through time in earlier studies.</p>
