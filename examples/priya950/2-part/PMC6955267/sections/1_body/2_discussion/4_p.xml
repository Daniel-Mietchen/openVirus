<p>Western Australian viruses analyzed in this study were sampled during routine mosquito-based surveillance conducted by the WA Department of Health and the University of Western Australia. The surveillance program was initiated in the southwest region, where the majority of the WA population resides, in 1987, and the earliest samples from the south in our data set date to this time. Prior to this, study isolates derived from northern WA regions in 1977â€“1986 were collected as part of an independent research project (

Mosquito-based surveillance activities in the central, remote, and arid regions of WA are only usually conducted opportunistically in response to extreme weather events and are not conducted as frequently as in the more populous regions of the south with larger at-risk populations. Central WA isolates are more limited for this reason. The number of available virus isolates greatly increased from the mid-1990s onwards, when the Western Australian mosquito trapping program had become well established. For these reasons, the densities of samples collected per year and per location within Western Australia were not uniform. All attempts were made to maximize the spatiotemporal range of isolates through the selection of samples to represent this wide range, where possible.
