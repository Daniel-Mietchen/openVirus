<p>Further whole-genome sequencing of isolates sampled from throughout Australia, covering a wide temporal and spatial range, may provide greater certainty to our evolutionary and selection pressure analysis and, in particular, our estimates of divergence times of distinct genetic groups. Continued surveillance and sequencing of RRV isolates, from a wide spatiotemporal range, should be undertaken to monitor the ongoing evolution of RRV into the future.</p>
