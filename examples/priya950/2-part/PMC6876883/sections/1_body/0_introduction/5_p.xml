<p>Previous studies forecasting the next seasonal influenza were based on the previous influenza patterns using time-series prediction models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model or a simple humidity-forced susceptible–infectious–recovered–susceptible mathematical model [

Each year, the geographical location, rates of increase and decrease, duration, and size of each outbreak vary considerably [
