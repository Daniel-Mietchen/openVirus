<p>To identify countries with seasonal patterns and influenza outbreaks that are similar to but precede those of the United States, we used FluNet surveillance data to investigate crossâ€“correlation between the U.S. and other countries, in terms of time-series of the ILI, total influenza (Total INF), influenza A (INF A), and influenza B (INF B) viruses. Our hypothesis was that similar seasonal patterns of influenza outbreaks between two countries over the years are associated with influenza activity in the following year. Knowing about such an association may help clinicians to predict the pattern of influenza incidence in the next season. The prediction model allows to estimate peak timing, peak intensity, and type-specific influenza activities for next season at 40
 <sup>th</sup> week.
