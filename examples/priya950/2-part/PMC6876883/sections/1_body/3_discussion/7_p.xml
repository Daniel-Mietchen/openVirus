<p>To our best knowledge, this is the first study to use influenza surveillance in Australia and Chile for predicting influenza cases after 26 weeks in the U.S. However, our study has several limitations. For the ILI study, we could not use ILI data in other countries, instead had to use data for Total INF, because collecting ILI data separately for the 164 countries was difficult. There were not enough data on other potential covariates to show relationships between influenza outbreaks in Australia, Chile, and the U.S., such as the standard of the medical facilities, economic level, and medical records of the influenza virus. Furthermore, we included only data from laboratory-confirmed cases, which may underestimate the true incidence of influenza in the population [
