<p>Kandula et al. analyzed whether forecasts targeted to predict influenza by type and subtype during 2003â€“2015 in the U.S. were more or less accurate than forecasts targeted to predict Total INF using four compartmental models [

 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our prediction models for type-specific influenza is valuable as well as those for ILI, which could provide an important, richer picture of influenza activity.
