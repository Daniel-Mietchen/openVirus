 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220423.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, showing the INF A and INF B in the U.S. and Australia, shows that the values for Australia were shifted forward 22 weeks from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010 to the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2018. Interestingly, the waveforms for the U.S. and Australia are similar in peak timing and amplitude. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220423.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, showing the INF A in the U.S. and Chile, shows that the values for Chile was shifted forward 28 weeks, the waveforms also similar. Therefore, influenza surveillance data in Australia and Chile could be valuable for predicting an influenza outbreak after 26 weeks in the U.S.
