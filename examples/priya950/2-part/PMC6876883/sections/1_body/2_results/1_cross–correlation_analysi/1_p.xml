 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the maximum correlation coefficient and time lag between the seasonal influenza outbreaks in the U.S. and the input variables. The correlation coefficients were calculated by cross-correlation between ILI in the U.S. and the number of positive influenza viruses worldwide. In 
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Australia had the highest correlation coefficient of 0.896 (p = 1.24 ⅹ 10
 <sup>−140</sup>) with a -22 week time lag for the INF A. The -22 week time lag meant that the country’s seasonal influenza outbreak 22 weeks earlier was highly correlated with the seasonal influenza outbreak in the U.S.
