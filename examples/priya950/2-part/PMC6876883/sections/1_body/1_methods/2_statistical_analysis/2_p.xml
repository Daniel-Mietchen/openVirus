<p>Linear regression analysis (LR) was used to evaluate the relationship between influenza surveillances in the U.S. after 26 weeks and those in selected countries, and GT and temperature from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010 to the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2018. LR 1 used influenza data from the U.S. after 26 weeks as dependent variable and previous seasonal data from the U.S. as independent variable. LR 2 used influenza activities from selected countries, and LR 3 used GT with the keyword “influenza A virus” in selected countries. LR 4 used temperature in the U.S. The input variables in LR 5 were those of LR models with the adjusted
