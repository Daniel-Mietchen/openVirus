<p>Influenza surveillance data were collected from the FluNet database of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network (URL:

 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These data are uploaded to the FluNet database every week by the countries in the network [
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The FluNet database contains the following variables, reported by 164 countries: influenza transmission zone, number of specimens, number of INF A and INF B detected by subtype, and number of influenza-positive viruses. We collected the surveillance data of the 164 countries from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010 to the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2018. We set the starting point for our research data in 2010, because influenza season during 2009 was an atypical season, with the introduction of a novel pandemic strain (INF A H1N1 pdm09) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Missing data were replaced by a zero because some countries conducted surveillance only during weeks with high influenza activity. Total INF, INF A, and INF B were defined as the number of influenza subtypes detected among processed specimens.
