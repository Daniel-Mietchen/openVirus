<p>In order to forecast ILI, Total INF, INF A, and INF B of next season (after 26 weeks) in the U.S., we developed prediction models using an artificial neural network (ANN), LR, and ARIMA including exogenous variables (ARIMAX). ANN is an artificial intelligence technology inspired by the architecture of biological neurons, such as that in the human brain [

It passes through several layers composed of multiple transformations, and last passes through the output layer as an output signal [

 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We implemented ANN using the python library Keras (version 2.2.0) with TensorFlow (version 1.8.0) backend. The scikitâ€“learn library (

In this study, we used a three-layer ANN network with a 10% dropout rate for the first layer for the overfitting problem. The models were optimized using the Adam optimizer with a loss function of mean squared error. Neuron activation functions were rectified linear units for the second layer. We selected 100 epochs and one batch size for the ANN model.
