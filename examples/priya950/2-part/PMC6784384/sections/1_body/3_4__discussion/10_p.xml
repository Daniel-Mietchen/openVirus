<p>Clinical presentation of VEEV IAB-induced disease in humans by both aerosol and percutaneous exposure routes has been well characterized [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Unlike mice and NHPs, an increased severity of encephalitis was not observed with aerosol-acquired VEE in humans. Nevertheless, a greater disease severity in mice and NHPs does not preclude their use as animal models, if the models are stricter than human disease.
