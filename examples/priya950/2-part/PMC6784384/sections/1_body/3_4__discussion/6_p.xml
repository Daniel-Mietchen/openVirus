<p>Based on the experience with cDNA-cloned stocks and the identified risks in generating virus stocks using wild-type or plaque-cloned viruses, the cDNA-cloned methodology was chosen as the path forward to propose to the FDA for the generation of virus stocks and challenge material. The cDNA-cloned methodology would provide a more controllable path with use of a clear consensus sequence (verified by sequencing of the original population), avoid multiple major variants, and result in an unlimited supply of the virus without additional passages. The use of cDNA clones hypothetically has the potential to result in a reduction in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity as compared to the wild-type parenteral stock. And though reduction in SNP diversity has been associated with high viral fidelity variants that are also attenuated, animal studies indicate that clone-derived VEEV stocks are as virulent if not more virulent than their originating parent (uncloned) stock [
