<p>Unlike the experience of the Filovirus group, the use of the cDNA-cloned methodology to generate VEEV stocks was supported in the literature. VEEV cDNA clones derived from wild-type VEEV IC SH3 and VEEV ID ZPC728 strains exhibited in vitro and in vivo characteristics indistinguishable from their parent viruses and demonstrated similar replication kinetics as their parent virus in Vero76 and L929 cell lines [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SC VEEV challenge (1000 pfu) of adult National Institute of Health (NIH) Swiss mice with the cDNA-cloned strains resulted in comparable serum viral titers and time to death as their respective parent virus, and in high viremia titers within 24 h that were nearly identical to their parent strain. Disease from all four strains was manifested by decreased activity and hunching by day 3 to 4 post-infection; followed by onset of anorexia, lethargy, and hind limb paralysis by day 4 to 7 that progressed to stupor and coma; and then death due to encephalitis on day 7 or 8. A VEEV ID ZPC738 cDNA clone was also developed and demonstrated to be phenotypically indistinguishable from its enzootic parent strain [

 <sub>50</sub> as its parent wild-type TrD strain in aerosol-challenge studies in 4-week-old female CD-1 mice, as did a recently produced VEEV IAB V3000 cDNA clone (using similar methodology) without the I239N mutation [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The original V3000 cDNA clone resulted in a similar lethal illness in mice and nonlethal febrile illness with viremia in NHPs as reported with wild-type VEEV TrD and was also used to evaluate the mechanism of neuroinvasion in mice and to assess vaccine efficacy in NHPs [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Lastly, initial comparison of the virulence of a newly developed cDNA clone of VEEV TrD GenBank reference sequence L01442.2 to wild-type VEEV TrD (passage history in guinea pigs once, chick embryos 13 times, and duck embryo cells once) showed similar lethality in mice following aerosol challenge, with 100% mortality after challenge with 7 pfu of cDNA-cloned VEEV TrD or 28 pfu of wild-type VEEV TrD [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Only the 4-pfu aerosol challenge dose with wild-type VEEV TrD resulted in survival of some mice (estimated LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.6 pfu).
