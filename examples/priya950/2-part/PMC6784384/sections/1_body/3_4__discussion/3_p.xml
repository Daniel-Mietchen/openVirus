<p>However, down-selection to the VEE IC INH-9813 strain was based mainly on the strain being a human isolate with a limited passage history. While aerosol-acquired VEEV IC infection in humans has not been documented, the similarity of VEEV IAB and IC mosquito-borne disease supports the likely similarity to aerosol-acquired VEEV IAB disease and use of aerosol-acquired VEEV IAB human disease for comparison to the VEEV IC animal model. Initial VEEV INH-9813 aerosol and SC challenge studies in mice and NHPs demonstrated a similar morbidity and mortality as observed with the TrD strain. Based on the available data, the FDA concurred that the animal study data supported proceeding with the evaluation of both the TrD and INH-9813 strains in BALB/c mouse and cynomolgus macaque animal models. </p>
