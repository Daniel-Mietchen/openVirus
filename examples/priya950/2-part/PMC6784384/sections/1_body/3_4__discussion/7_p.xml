<p>Subsequent communication with the FDA resulted in their concurrence on the usage of the cDNA-cloned methodology to generate viral stocks, provided the virulence of the cDNA-cloned VEEV stocks was comparable or noninferior to the uncloned (wild-type) VEEV stocks as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00807-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00807-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Comparison of ID
 <sub>50</sub> and targeted pathology (e.g., brain) of the cDNA clone to the wild-type VEEV strain in NHPs would be considered if the cDNA clone characteristics were similar to the wild-type VEEV isolate. After the generation of sufficient data, the overall characterization plan would be reviewed and modified to a more efficient approach as assays are refined and the master and working viral stocks are characterized.
