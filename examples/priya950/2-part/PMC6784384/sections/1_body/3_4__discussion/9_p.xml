<p>Vaccine cross-protection from VEEV IAB strain-derived vaccines is supported by serological testing and/or animal challenge studies that demonstrated immunogenic responses and/or cross-protection against other VEEV IAB strains, other subtype I varieties, and/or former VEE complex subtype II and IIIA viruses. The VEEV TC-83 investigational vaccine, a live, attenuated vaccine derived from the VEEV IAB TrD strain, resulted in long-term (9 years) persistence of plaque reduction neutralization antibodies in humans against VEEV IC strain V-198 but not against enzootic VEE IE [

However, a more immunogenic, live-attenuated V3526 vaccine candidate (also derived from VEEV TrD strain), protected NHPs against VEEV IE (68U201) aerosol challenge even though it failed to elicit measurable neutralizing antibodies to VEEV IE in six of eight NHPs [

A virus-like replicon particle (VRP) VEEV vaccine candidate demonstrated long-term (12 months) cross-protection in mice (100% survival) against aerosol challenge to VEEV IAB, VEEV IE, and Mucambo virus (former VEEV subtype IIIA), that was associated with a strong VEEV-specific IgG-specific ELISA response but a minimal neutralizing antibody response [

VRP vaccination in all NHPs was associated with a measurable neutralizing antibody response to VEE IAB (TrD), VEEV IC (p676 strain), VEEV ID (3880 strain), and VEEV IE (68U201 strain). Lastly, cross-protection against IE and former VEEV subtypes was demonstrated with a humanized monoclonal antibody (Hu1A3B-7) derived from bone marrow donors immunized with TC-83, that protected mice against aerosol challenge to VEEV TrD, VEEV IE, Mucambo virus (former VEE complex subtype IIIA), and Everglades virus (former VEE complex subtype II) [
