<p>The VEEV strains selected for the aerosol-challenge animal model should “ideally” be isolates from human cases that have a low passage history in animals and cell cultures. However, the DOD requirement for a vaccine to protect against VEEV strains likely to be involved in a bioterrorism event justified the selection of a VEEV IAB TrD strain, even though a donkey brain isolate with multiple passages, as the TrD strain was the only VEEV strain weaponized. Even after multiple cell culture passages, the TrD strain still demonstrates virulence in animal models and exposed laboratory workers [
