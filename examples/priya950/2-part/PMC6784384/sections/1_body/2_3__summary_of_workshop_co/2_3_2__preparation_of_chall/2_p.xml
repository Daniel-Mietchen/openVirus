<p>A strategy was developed during the workshop to manufacture virus stocks derived from a cDNA clone of the selected VEEV strain, and to then compare the clone-derived virus to the wild-type VEEV isolate in regards to plaque size, in vitro replication kinetics in cell culture, and in vivo virulence (mouse LD
 <sub>50</sub>) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00807-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The prepared virus stocks (master and working virus banks) would be prepared in ATCC Vero E6 cells and subjected to deep sequence analysis to characterize the virus population and consensus sequences and purity of the preparations. The use of cDNA clones would depend on the characteristics and virulence of the rescued virus being similar to the wild-type VEEV strain. If the cDNA clone characteristics were noted to be similar to the wild-type VEEV strain, a comparison of ID
 <sub>50</sub> and targeted pathology (e.g., brain) of the cDNA clone to the wild-type VEEV isolate in NHPs would be considered.
