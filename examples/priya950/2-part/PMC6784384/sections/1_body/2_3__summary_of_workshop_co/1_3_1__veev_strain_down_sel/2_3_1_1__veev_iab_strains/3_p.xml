<p>The VEEV IAB TrD strain was originally isolated from brain tissue of an infected donkey in 1943 during the Trinidad outbreak [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As the Trinidad outbreak involved mainly equids, no TrD isolates from humans were available. Manifestation of disease in the 377 officially reported equid cases was most commonly a febrile illness accompanied by loss of appetite and depression, followed by neurological symptoms (e.g., somnolence, incoordination, muscle twitching/spasticity), and death (83% mortality reported but milder cases in rural areas may have been missed). Although not a human isolate, VEEV IAB TrD was extensively studied and weaponized in the U.S. and former Soviet Union weapons programs, and thereby was deemed a likely strain to be involved in a bioterrorism event. The VEEV TrD strain was also commonly used in animal studies to examine pathogenesis and to assess efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics [

However, most of the available VEEV TrD stocks had multiple passages in animal and culture cell lines since its early isolation in 1943 because adaptation of the virus in cell culture was often required to achieve the high viral titers needed for aerosol challenge of larger animal models [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In spite of the extensive passage history, several laboratories have demonstrated the continued virulence of these IAB VEEV stocks in animals and in humans, including infection in eight laboratory workers with the VEEV IAB Venezuela 1938 strain that had 52 passages in suckling mice [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Most TrD strains in the USAMRIID repository had a passage history of guinea pig—one, chick embroyo—14, suckling mouse brain—one, and an additional one or two passages in BHK cells (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, one VEEV TrD stock had a lower passage history (guinea pig—one, chick embryo—13, duck embryo cells—one) and no passage history in BHK cells [

Lastly, the consensus sequence of a VEEV TrD stock (L01442.2) was available in the GenBank database and had a documented passage history of once in guinea pigs, six times in Vero cells, and once in BHK cells. This TrD stock was propagated by the CDC using the same original 1943 VEEV TrD donkey brain isolate as the USAMRIID stocks [
