<p>Based on the selection criteria, isolates from two VEEV IAB strains were identified, VEEV Trinidad (TrD) and 69Z1 strains (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Other strains of VEEV IAB (e.g., human VEEV IAB E123 69 and E541 73 strains isolated in Venezuela in 1969 and 1973, respectively) were not considered as the viral stocks and primary sequences were not readily available. The VEEV 69Z1 human isolate from the 1969 Guatemala outbreak that was available at USAMRIID was unacceptable due to its poorly documented passage history [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, a VEEV 69Z1 isolate available at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) had a known and acceptable passage history, consisting of only two passages in suckling mice and one passage on Vero cells.
