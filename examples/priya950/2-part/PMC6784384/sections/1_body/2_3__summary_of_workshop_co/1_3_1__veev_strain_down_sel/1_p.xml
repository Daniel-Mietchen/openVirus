<p>A total of 12 epizootic and 13 enzootic isolates were identified (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Down-selection to epidemic VEEV IAB and IC strains was based on the DOD objective to obtain FDA approval for a vaccine that protects against at least two VEEV varieties likely to be used in a bioterrorism event. These two epizootic varieties have been responsible for most epidemics and human cases, in contrast to endemic varieties (ID and IE) that are also associated with human infection but have not produced wide-spread epidemics [
