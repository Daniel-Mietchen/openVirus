<p>The VEEV IC INH-9813 and INH-6803 strains from the more extensive 1995 VEE outbreak were selected for further evaluation. The evaluation included preparation and characterization of a master stock (passage 2) and working stock (passage 3) for each strain in American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586). Deep sequence analysis demonstrated that the sequence of each isolate was consistent with a VEEV IC strain. The virus stocks were determined to be pure of contaminating agents, and endotoxin levels were &lt;0.23 EU/mL. The replication kinetic experiments of each strain were essentially equivalent and were comparable to the VEEV TrD strain. Based on the slightly higher titers in the prepared master and working virus stocks, the VEEV INH-9813 strain was ultimately selected.</p>
