<p>Animal model development with wild-type and cDNA clone versions of the VEE IC INH-9813 strain is still in the early stages [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Aerosol challenge of BALB/c mice with the VEE IC INH-9813 strain (10 mice/group) resulted in lethal disease at low challenge doses, with 100% lethality at 2150 pfu, 80% lethality at 195 pfu, and 20% lethality at 16-pfu challenge doses (

 <sup>8</sup> pfu) with VEE IC INH-9813 resulted in nonlethal disease in all 11 NHPs, with a febrile illness observed even at the lowest 30-pfu challenge dose (one NHP only) (
