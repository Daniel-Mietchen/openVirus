<p>Aerosol and IN VEEV challenge were associated with increased histopathological findings and viral burden in the upper respiratory tract, nasal mucosa, and CNS compared to parenteral challenge. Aerosol and IN challenge resulted in necrotizing rhinitis, massive infection of the olfactory epithelium, and bilateral infection of the olfactory nerves, bulbs and tracts, with CNS infection noted between 16 and 48 h post-challenge. Viral levels were observed to be three times higher in the olfactory bulb than the brain at 16 to 24 h post-aerosol challenge but were similar to viral levels in the brain at 60 h, supporting virus entry into the brain via the olfactory system. Aerosol challenge also resulted in detectable virus in the lungs within 12 h post-challenge, with subsequent viremia and viral spread to lymphoid tissues [
