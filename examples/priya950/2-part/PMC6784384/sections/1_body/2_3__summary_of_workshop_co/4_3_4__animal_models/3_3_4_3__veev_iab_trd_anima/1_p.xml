<p>The pathogenesis and virulence of the VEEV TrD strain and the V3000 cDNA clone-derived virus from the TrD strain were studied in mice, hamsters, and NHPs [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The passage history of VEEV TrD virus stocks for the majority of animal studies conducted at USAMRIID was recorded as guinea pig—one, chick embryo—14, suckling mouse brain—one, and BHK—one or two. A summary of the host susceptibility and the clinical and pathological responses to the TrD strain is provided in

Of note, aerosol and IN challenge of mice with wild-type VEEV TrD and V3000 cDNA-cloned strains resulted in nasal mucosal necrosis, necrotizing rhinitis, an increase in viral burden in the upper respiratory tract, and an earlier and more severe CNS infection compared to percutaneous challenge [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. NHP studies also noted an earlier onset and more severe CNS infection with aerosol and IN challenge compared to parenteral challenge routes.
