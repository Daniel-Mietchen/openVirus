<p>Rhesus (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) and cynomolgus (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) macaques in the literature have been assessed to be nonlethal models of VEEV infection with VEEV varieties IAB, IC, and IE. NHPs generally had onset of fever, viremia, and lymphopenia within 1 to 3 days following VEEV aerosol or parenteral challenge [

 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. While some NHPs exhibited signs of encephalitis a few days later, nearly all NHPs (similar to humans) survived infection. Also, similar to disease in humans, fever, viremia, and lymphopenia were identified as markers of infection. CNS histopathology of infected NHPs noted multifocal perivascular cuffs composed mainly of lymphocytes, gliosis, satellitosis, neuronal death, and a few microhemorrhages.
