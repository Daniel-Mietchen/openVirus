<p>Aerosol-acquired VEE due to subtype IC has not been reported in humans, and CNS histopathology in humans is limited mainly to mosquito-borne VEEV IC cases (strain unknown) (

Based on the similar clinical presentation of mosquito-borne disease from VEEV IAB and IC strains, the symptomatology of aerosol-acquired disease and CNS histopathology are also likely to be similar between the two VEEV epidemic varieties [
