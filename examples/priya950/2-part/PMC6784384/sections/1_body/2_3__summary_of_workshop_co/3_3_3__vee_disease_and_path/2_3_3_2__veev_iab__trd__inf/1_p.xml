<p>While the VEEV TrD outbreak (1943â€“44) mainly affected equids, two deaths in humans were attributed to a VEEV TrD strain, diagnosed by either viral isolation or cross-immunity testing in brain tissue. In addition, three laboratory technicians and three entomology workers developed nonlethal VEE infection due to occupational exposure [

Subsequent to the Trinidad outbreak, VEEV infection in humans from the TrD strain has been reported in laboratory workers after exposure to contaminated needles or infectious aerosols, and also after VEEV vaccination due to incomplete inactivation of the initial formalin-inactivated VEEV (TrD strain) vaccine administered during the U.S. BW Program [
