<p>Rusnak et al. also compared the aerosol-acquired VEEV cohort from the U.S. BW Program (VEEV IAB strain TrD) to the initial 14 aerosol-acquired VEE cases reported in laboratory workers (mainly VEEV IAB Venezuela 1938 strain), to the 24 aerosol-acquired VEE cases in Russia (subtype unknown) from a single-source laboratory exposure, and to mosquito-borne VEEV IC and ID cohorts [

Regardless of the exposure route or VEEV subtype, infection in adults generally presented with a self-limited febrile illness that uncommonly resulted in severe encephalitis (e.g., seizures, coma, cranial nerve abnormalities, or paralysis) at exposure doses encountered from laboratory accidents, early VEEV vaccine candidates, and mosquito bites. While aerosol-acquired VEE in humans from VEEV IC strains has not been reported, the similar clinical presentation of percutaneous-acquired VEE due to VEEV IC and VEEV IAB strains supports aerosol-acquired VEE from VEEV IAB and IC strains to also have a similar clinical presentation.
