<p>The VEEV IC INH-9813 strain was isolated from human serum during the 1995 outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia that resulted in 75,000 to 100,000 human cases [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The clinical presentation most commonly manifested as a febrile illness of 3 to 4 days duration, presenting with an acute onset of fever, chills, severe headache, myalgia, prostration, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhea. The case-fatality rate during the 1995 outbreak was estimated to be 0.7% based on random surveys of residents in the Manaure municipality of La Guajira state, Colombia, with a conservative estimate of 300 VEE-associated deaths in La Guajira state alone during the outbreak. Neurological manifestations of encephalitis included disorientation, drowsiness, mental depression, and seizures. Thirteen VEEV human isolates from this epidemic characterized antigenically and/or genetically were determined to be closely related to VEEV IC isolates from the 1962â€“1964 Venezuela outbreak and a 1983 mosquito Panaquire isolate from north central Venezuela [
