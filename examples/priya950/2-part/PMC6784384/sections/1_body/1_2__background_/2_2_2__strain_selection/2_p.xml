<p>Initial strain selection criteria had to consider the DOD vaccine requirement for vaccine protection against VEEV in an aerosolized bioterrorism event. Further down-selection considered the FDA’s guidance for strain selection under the Animal Rule (FDA 2015), which recommended the use of 1) strains isolated from lethal human cases (or associated with human disease/outbreaks), 2) strains with a known and low passage history in animals and cell culture, and 3) strains that mirrored the expected disease state in humans. Strain selection also considered criteria used by the Filovirus Animal Non-clinical Group (FANG) to select virus strains for the filovirus challenge stocks under the Animal Rule—to select isolates with no animal passage (if available) and limited cell passage (

Logistical issues considered included selection of strains that were available and accessible to laboratories licensed to work with select agents and strains that could be replicated to produce sufficient challenge material for animal models.
