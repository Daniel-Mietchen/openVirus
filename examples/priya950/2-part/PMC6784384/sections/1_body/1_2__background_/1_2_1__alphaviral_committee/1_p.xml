<p>Based on the recommendation of the FDA Office of Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Coordination Staff in 2012, a committee was organized by the JVAP alphavirus vaccine program to select VEEV strain(s) for animal model development under the Animal Rule, and to obtain concurrence on the strain selection by the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) before developing the master and working viral stocks. The committee was comprised of representatives from JVAP, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and involved consultation with multiple VEEV experts and institutes with virus repositories. An “Alphavirus Workshop” was then organized and hosted by the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) at Fort Detrick, Maryland, on 15 December 2014 to present and discuss the activities of the alphavirus committee members and to address outstanding issues on the generation of VEEV challenge materials.</p>
