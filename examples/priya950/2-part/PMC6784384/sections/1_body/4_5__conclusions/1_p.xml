<p>Systematic approaches were developed for virus strain selection and selection of the optimal methodology for the propagation of viral stocks and challenge material for the animal models, as required for VEEV vaccine approval under the FDA Animal Rule. The VEEV IAB TrD and IC INH-9813 strains were selected for vaccine development challenge strains in the BALB/c mouse and cynomolgus macaque animal models. The selection of cDNA-clone methodology to generate virus stocks and challenge material was based on the use of a stable consensus sequence being a more controlled path, providing an increased likelihood of uniformity of lots and an unlimited virus supply without additional passages. These methodologies may serve as a template for strain selection for other vaccine programs using the Animal Rule. </p>
