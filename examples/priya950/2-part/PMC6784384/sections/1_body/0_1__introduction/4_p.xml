<p>Selection criteria for VEEV isolates in the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) were reviewed, as well as the strategy in selecting the optimal methodology for the propagation of viral stocks to result in the consistency of the production of VEEV challenge material and reproducibility of animal challenge studies. The criteria for strain selection and strategy for the propagation of viral stocks may serve as a template for other viral vaccine products being developed under the Animal Rule. Lastly, current information and literature on VEEV aerosol challenge studies in animals with the selected strains was reviewed in regards to disease progression and pathophysiology in the animal models and the relevance of the selected strains and animal models to disease in humans. </p>
