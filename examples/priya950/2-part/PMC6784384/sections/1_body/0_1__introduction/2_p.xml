<p>VEE virus (VEEV) has been designated a Category B biothreat agent as aerosol exposure to as few as 10 to 100 infectious particles results in symptomatic disease in nearly all humans. Aerosol-acquired VEE does not occur naturally. Thereby, as human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, licensure in the U.S. of a vaccine to protect against aerosol VEEV exposure must use the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule. The Animal Rule, as set forth in 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 601.90â€“95, requires demonstration of vaccine protection in an animal model that is predictive of the response expected in humans. Vaccine efficacy demonstrated in animal models and the immune response to the vaccine observed in humans will be used to predict the likely clinical benefit in humans. </p>
