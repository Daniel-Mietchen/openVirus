<p>We next estimated the epidemic origins of the main HIV-1 subtypes in the DRC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our results consistently place the common ancestor of subtype C in Mbuji-Mayi (LPP = 0.79, SD = 0.03;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s001">S1 Table</xref>), from where this lineage was introduced around the 1960s to the more southerly city of Lubumbashi in the province of Katanga, a region that borders Zambia where subtype C predominates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast, we estimate that the common ancestor of HIV-1 subtypes D, G, F1, and of sub-subtype A1 originated in Kinshasa (LPP = 0.91, SD = 0.01; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Interestingly, our data indicate that the rare subtypes H and J originated in the less-connected coastal city of Matadi (LPP = 0.95, SD = 0.03 and LPP = 0.97, SD = 0.02 respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that subtype C first emerged in or around Mbuji-Mayi, before reaching and becoming established in Lubumbashi. This is consistent with Kinshasa and Lubumbashi being well-connected cities in the DRC with respect to historical railway infrastructure and volume of passengers [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and with recent reports that reveal complex mosaic forms related to subtype C in the mining region [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, we find that subtypes A1, D and sub-subtype F1 emerged in Kinshasa, while the least common subtypes J and H seem to have most likely emerged in the poorly connected city of Matadi in western DRC.
