<p>To estimate the velocity of spatial spread of the different viral lineages, we used a phylogenetic model of diffusion in continuous space [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This approach infers latitude and longitude locations for ancestral nodes in a phylogeny using a relaxed random walk model. When projected through space and time, the reconstruction of the subtype C spatial diffusion further supports a spatial origin in or around Mbuji-Mayi and reveals a rapid eastward spread of subtype C (

Notably, we find that the lineage dispersal velocity of subtype C was three-fold higher compared to subtype A1 and four-fold higher compared to subtype D (
