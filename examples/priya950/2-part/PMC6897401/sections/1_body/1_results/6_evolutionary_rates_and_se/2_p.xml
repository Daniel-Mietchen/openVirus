<p>Interestingly, we find a higher synonymous rate for subtype C compared to A1 and D, and similar but less pronounced differences in nonsynonymous rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Our analysis shows that the 
 <italic>pol</italic> region is subjected to strong overall purifying selection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with a posterior mean of dN/dS ratios of 0.18 across subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These ratios, obtained using a Bayesian renaissance counting approach, are consistent with point estimates using simpler methods that provide per-site dN/dS ratios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, dashed and solid vertical lines). Given that these estimates for dN/dS ratios indicate that most residues are under strong negative selection, such averaging can also mask strong heterogeneity in positive selection acting upon sites along the gene. Consequently, although these findings suggest the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene in subtype C lineage has not experienced strong positive selection during its evolutionary history, we cannot eliminate the possibility that positive selection may occurred at some sites or outside the 
 <italic>pol</italic> region under study that may have led to an increase in transmission potential.
