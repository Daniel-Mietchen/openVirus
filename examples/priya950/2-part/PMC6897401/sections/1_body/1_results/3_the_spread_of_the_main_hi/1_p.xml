<p>To quantify the evolution and dispersal patterns of the dominant HIV-1 lineages out of the DRC and into East Africa, we collated additional HIV-1 genetic data from 20 cities and villages across Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, collected between 1996 and 2011 (Tables 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s003">S3</xref>). For comparative purposes, we focused here on central and East African (CEA) data sets of unambiguously typed subtype C, A1 and D sequences (see the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref> section). Together, these subtypes account for a total of &gt;84% of all HIV-1 infections in East Africa [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s016">S4</xref> Figs). The ML reconstructions are consistent with a model of limited migration events of each subtype into East Africa followed by rapid expansion in the region [
