<p>By jointly considering phylogenetic and ancestral location uncertainty in a discrete phylogeographic framework [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we consistently identify Kinshasa as the ancestral root location of group M diversity (mean location posterior probability, LPP, across the three data sets = 0.92, with a standard deviation across LPP estimates of 0.09;
