<p>To reconstruct the evolutionary history of HIV-1 lineages, we used Bayesian inference through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework as implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], and BEAGLE library 2.1.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] to increase computational performance. For each subtype, mid-point rooted ML trees were used as starting trees. We employed the GTR+4Г [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with an underlying lognormal distribution [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Since little or no temporal signal was present in our data sets (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s018">S6 Fig</xref>), normal priors were placed on the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of sub-subtype A1, subtype C and subtype D based on an analysis of the genetic data from a previous study [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s020">S8 Fig</xref>). To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run in triplicate for 250 million steps for each subtype, sampling 5,000 trees and 10,000 parameter estimates from the posterior distribution. The resulting MCMC chains were combined and inspected in Tracer 1.7 [
