<p>Whether the rapid expansion of HIV-1 subtype C has been the result of ecological or evolutionary circumstances has been a matter of debate. We investigated the evolutionary origins of the HIV-1 group M diversity by analysing 
 <italic>pol</italic> data from the DRC with data from eastern Africa. We find that the emergence of HIV-1 subtypes resulted from two distinct scenarios (i) where ancestral lineages from Kinshasa seeded epidemics elsewhere, e.g., subtype C in Mbuji-Mayi and subtype H in Matadi, and (ii) the emergence and circulation of subtypes within Kinshasa such as sub-subtype A1, and subtypes D, G and F1 (

For scenario (i), two contrasting epidemiological outcomes seem to occur, depending on the remoteness/accessibility of the location where different lineages first emerged. For example Mbuji-Mayi, where subtype C emerged, was a thriving, well-connected, economic hub with the largest production of diamonds in the world, which attracted migrants from Lubumbashi and from other countries, such as Zambia and Zimbabwe [

In contrast, Matadi, a remote port city in Central west DRC, where subtype H and J are estimated to have emerged, was relatively poorly connected to the rest of the sub-Saharan African region. As a result, transmission of subtypes H and J is now confined to Central west DRC and neighbouring areas in northern Angola [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast, scenario (ii) is consistent with local circulation of group M strains in Kinshasa that may have been associated with different transmission routes and/or different risk groups since the beginning of the HIV pandemic [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is possible that some of these lineages became extinct, e.g. subtype E, while others may have been amplified by iatrogenic transmission in Kinshasa between 1950â€“1960 [
