<p>Overall, we find no evidence of a strong selective advantage nor for increased transmission potential for subtype C. We here postulate that founder effects and epidemiological circumstances, such as introduction to and circulation among mining populations in the southern DRC with subsequent onward spread through the Copperbelt mining region, are more likely to have contributed to the success and spatial spread of subtype C throughout sub-Saharan Africa, where it currently accounts for 75% of HIV infections. However, we acknowledge that the estimates presented here relate only to the polymerase region of the virus genome and we contend that future studies that generate large full-genome data sets from sub-Saharan Africa will allow to investigate lineage-specific determinants of between-host and within-host transmission. Future work could improve on this study by performing comparative, genome-wide analyses of HIV-1 subtypes [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Our results show that the complex patterns of HIV epidemics have been shaped by migration and travel and therefore it is important to consider both local and international strategies when designing interventions to end HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa.
