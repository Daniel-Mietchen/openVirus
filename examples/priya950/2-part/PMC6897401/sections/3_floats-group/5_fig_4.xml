  <title>Synonymous and non-synonymous rates of substitution for main subtypes circulating in Central and East Africa.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>Panel a</bold> shows the posterior distributions for the overall nucleotide substitution rates (substitutions per nucleotide site per year) based on the entire gene region under study. 
   <bold>Panel b</bold> shows the absolute non-synonymous and the synonymous rates obtained using a renaissance counting approach. Finally, the inset shows the dN/dS ratio obtained using a renaissance counting approach [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with dashed and solid lines indicating the mean dN/dS ratios estimated with MEME [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and aBSREL [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Please note that the mean dN/dS ratios for subtypes A1 (dark grey solid line) and D (light grey solid line) estimated with aBSREL are overlapping.
