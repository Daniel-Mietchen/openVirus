  <title>Spatiotemporal diffusion of HIV-1 subtypes A1, C and D across Central and East Africa.</title>
  <p>Internal nodes of maximum clade credibility and 95% HPD regions based on 1,000 trees subsampled from the posterior distribution of each continuous phylogeographic analysis. MCC tree internal nodes are coloured according to their time of occurrence, and 95% HPD regions were computed for successive time layers and then superimposed using the same colour scale reflecting time. Crosses indicate the position of the sampling locations.</p>
