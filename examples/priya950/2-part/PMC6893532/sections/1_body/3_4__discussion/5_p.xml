<p>According to HA gene analysis, the motif PQIEP
 <underline>R</underline>↓GLF in the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 of A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) was not different from that of an H2N2 isolate from a human sample (A/Korea/426/1968) showing PQIES
 <underline>R</underline>↓GLF, a monobasic cleavage site. Human A/Korea/426/1968 may achieve adaptation in humans by substitution of different amino acids in the 220 loop (
