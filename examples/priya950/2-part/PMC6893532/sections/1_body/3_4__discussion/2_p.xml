<p>The peninsular Republic of Korea is crossed by the East Asian Australasian and West Pacific Flyways and is near the Central Asian Flyway. This creates diversity in migratory birds and in AIVs. In our study, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the HA and NA genes of A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) belonged to the Eurasian lineage, with HA and NA genes showing the closest relationship to A/duck/Mongolia/482/2015 (H2N3) and A/duck/Bangladesh/8987/2010 (H10N9), respectively. In contrast, the internal genes (PB2, PB1, NP, PA, M, and NS) were of East Asian lineage, with the six gene segments of our H2N9 isolate being most closely related to those in other countries such as China (PB1, PA, M, and NS) and Japan (H8N6). Among the internal genes, only the PB1 gene of our H2N9 strain was grouped with Korean AIV strains (A/wild waterfowl/Korea/F14-5/2016(H6N1), A/wild waterfowl/Korea/F7-18/2018 (H4N8), and A/mallard/Korea/F94-16/2017 (H4N6). The remaining genes were absent from the Korea strain groups.</p>
