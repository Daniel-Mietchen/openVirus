<p>A deletion in the NA stalk region at position 69â€“73 that increases virulence in mice was not found in our strain and the Hong Kong strains, whereas this deletion is present in human strains (A/Shanghai/1/2013/H7N9 and A/Anhui/1/2013/H7N9). Interestingly, the mutations M26I, 107V, R144K, and N144S, which may increase virulence in mammals, were found in both our isolate and the reference strain of H2N9. The A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) harbored no mutation at position E627K of PB2, which plays an important role in the adaption of AIVs to mammals. These results imply that the avian A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) may not exhibit host tropism to humans.</p>
