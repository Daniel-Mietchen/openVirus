<p>For AIV surveillance in wild birds, AIV genomic analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is ideal, as the mutation rate of influenza A viruses has been traditionally determined by sequencing different cDNA clones obtained from multiple plaques descending from a plaque-purified influenza A virus [
