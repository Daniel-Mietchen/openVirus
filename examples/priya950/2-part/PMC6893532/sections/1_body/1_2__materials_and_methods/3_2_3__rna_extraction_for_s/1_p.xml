<p>Viral RNA was extracted from allantoic fluid (640 hemagglutination units (HAU)/mL) using a total RNA extraction kit (Macherey Nagel, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, RNA was eluted in 60 μL of RNase-free water, and after addition of 20 U of RNase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), was stored at −80 °C until further use. In the negative control, sterile water was added instead of the specimen.</p>
