<p>To evaluate influenza growth and determine the subtype, conventional real-time RT-PCR for influenza A virus that amplifies the matrix gene coding sequence was performed using total RNA following the WHO guidelines [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Host identification was confirmed using a DNA barcode and a 539 bp region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome 
 <italic>c</italic> oxidase I (COI) using COI sequences from all 260 bird species as previously described [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The host of the new isolate was identified using Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) [
