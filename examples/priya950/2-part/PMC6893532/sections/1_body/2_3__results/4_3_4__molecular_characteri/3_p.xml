<p>Two substitutions in the NP protein, V41I and D210E, contribute to viral transmissibility in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, the A184K substitution in the NP protein increases replication and pathogenicity of H5N1 [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. All three mutations were found in A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9). In addition, our H2N9 isolate had signature mutations in other proteins that are associated with the increased virulence factor of the influenza virus A H5N1 strain in mice, such as N30D and T215A in M1 and P42S in NS1 [
