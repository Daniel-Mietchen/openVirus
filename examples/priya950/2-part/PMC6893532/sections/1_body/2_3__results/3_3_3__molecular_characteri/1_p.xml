<p>The receptor-binding site (RBS) of HA was assessed by analyzing mutations that change host tropism from bird to human (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01046-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The RBS structure is conserved across all HA subtypes and is comprised of the 130 loop (residues 135 to 138), 190 helix (residues 190 to 198), and 220 loop (residues 221 to 228) [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In these residues, two adaptive mutations in RBS were necessary to switch the preference from avian- to human-type receptors: E190D and G225D for H1N1, and Q226L and G228S in the case of H2N2 and H3N2 [

The HA of our isolate was compared with a strain isolated from a human (A/Korea/426/1968 (H2N2) and three strains isolated from birds (A/northern shoveler/Hong Kong/MPL133/2010, A/northern shoveler/Hong Kong/MPL961/2011, and A/wild waterfowl/Hong Kong/MPL696/2011), which are closely related to the genesis of human H7N9 virus [
