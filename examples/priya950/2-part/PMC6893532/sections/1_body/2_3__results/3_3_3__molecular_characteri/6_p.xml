<p>However, other mutations at positions 26, 107, 144, 146, and 224 in the NA gene, which increases virulence in mice and mammals, were found in our isolate and the reference strains (

Interestingly, the mutation at position 294, arginine (R) to lysine (K), was only found in A/Shanghai/1/2013 isolated from humans, and this single substitution has been demonstrated to reduce susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir [
