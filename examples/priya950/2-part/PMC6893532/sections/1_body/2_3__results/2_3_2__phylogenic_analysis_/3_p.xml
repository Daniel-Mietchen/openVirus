<p>The remaining genes from our isolate (PB1, NP, M, and NS) showed a close relationship with A/Duck/Dongting/D76-1/2016 (H5N7), A/duck/Hokkaido/X9/2016 (H8N4), A/duck/Chongqing/S4362/2017 (H5N3), and A/wild bird/Jiangxi/P419/2016 (H6N8), respectively. The percent sequence homology for each gene segment from A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) compared to the closest genetic relative is shown in
