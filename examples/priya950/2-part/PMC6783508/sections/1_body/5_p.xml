<p>A cluster of papers within the topic discuss the role of endogenous retroviruses (ERV) in the immune response. This includes an up-to-date review on the shaping of the immune response by human ERVs (HERVs) (

Further, four original research articles explore diverse aspects of ERVs and immunity. Firstly, ERV sequences within the genome are a potential source of genetic diversity that are known to be co-opted by the host. This has been shown most recently to include HERV-H sequences contributing to stem cell identity.
