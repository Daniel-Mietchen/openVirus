<p>“
 <italic>Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution</italic>” was argued by Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1973. After more than 100 years since Charles Darwin's 
 <italic>Origin of Species</italic>, it was increasingly realized that the theory of evolution can help us disentangle biological mechanisms. Here we asked contributors to see their antiviral research interests “through the looking glass” of evolution and to consider how evolutionary theory may help us understand human antiviral immunity. Thus, our special topic explored the scope of the evolution of human antiviral immunity, whether this included short-term effects or long-term impact. We specifically asked contributors to provide thought-provoking manuscripts that could fall within the scope of co-evolution of viruses and the human immune response. They submitted articles discussing the ongoing dynamics of co-existing with ancient endogenous retroviruses, as well as the pressures exerted by extant exogenous viruses such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Our understanding of antiviral immunity was broadened by papers exploring mechanisms such as T cell function and RNA structural components.
