<p>Thirdly, the effect of the histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat on HERV expression in CD4+ T cells was analyzed using RNA-Seq (

Vorinostat is one latency reversing agent being examined in HIV-1 shock and kill strategies. The study found over 2000 HERV elements were modulated by vorinostat, notably the downregulation of ERVL and upregulation of HERV-9 elements, the latter of which was confirmed by digital droplet PCR. This study identified three HERV-9 members (LTR12 elements) that were upregulated by vorinostat in a dose-dependent manner. The relevance of this finding lies in the transcriptional regulation of certain genes by LTR12 elements, including the pro-apoptotic genes TP3 and TNFRSF10B (

In agreement with our previous work using RT-qPCR, members of the HERV-K (HML-2), HERV-W and HERV-FRD families were not found to be upregulated by vorinostat (
