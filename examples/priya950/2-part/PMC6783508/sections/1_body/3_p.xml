<p>The co-evolution of influenza virus and host immunity is discussed in the second mini-review (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02017" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Voskarides et al.</ext-link>). The authors argue that this is an example of antagonistic evolution, with influenza virus a predator and the human host as prey. This conflict manifests in the genetic variability of Influenza viruses, a result of the absence of proof-reading by the RNA polymerase, that continually challenges the host immune system. In response, the human host has genetic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity which facilitates T cell-mediated immunity to diverse pathogens.
