<p>The evolutionary gameplay underlying the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus's e antigen (HBVeAg) is reviewed and explored by

There is significant variability in HBeAg seroconversion and transmission efficiency among genotypes, which the authors suggest can be explained as a result of short-sighted evolution. The virus-host interplay of HBV is further explored by

The authors review the evidence that CD8+ T cells play an important role in the chronicity of HBV infection as well as the disease outcomes such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (

The authors show that the variable tandem repeat [VNTR: −77(GT)n] has a significant impact in the transcription profile of IFNAR1 and this may be relevant in cancer pathophysiology.
