This raises the question of how a cluster of connected HIV-1 exposed individuals could remain uninfected within an HIV-1 outbreak. The authors discuss potential explanations including the possibility that long-term infections act as a “firewall” in spreading the infections to the full-population. The latter could be explained by the existence of an epidemic equilibrium of co-existence where human-HIV co-evolution would be acting in the absence of treatment.
