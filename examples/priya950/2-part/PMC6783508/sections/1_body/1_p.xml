Importantly, they identified T-box 21 (Tbx21)-mediated gene expression as a hallmark of inflation but not exhaustion of memory CD8+ T cells. This finding has potential to shape our understanding of the genes that define memory T-cell populations. Further, this shows how different viral infections can influence either exhaustion or inflation. This highlights the adaptability of the immune response to viral infection but also how infection could alter gene expression to shift T cell phenotypes.
