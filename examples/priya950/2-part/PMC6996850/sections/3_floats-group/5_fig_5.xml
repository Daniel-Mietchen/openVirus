  <title>Numbers of differentially expressed genes among HEV infected pregnant women presenting with subclinical and acute infection during 2nd /3rd trimester.</title>
  <p>Venn diagram A and B, C and D displaying numbers of differentially expressed up-regulated genes as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control) and respective healthy trimester 2 and 3 controls (PR-2-control and PR-3-control) respectively. The green and orange circle represents DEGs in PR-2-SC/ PR-3-SC and PR-2-acute/PR-3-acute patients and shadow of corresponding colors represent overlapping genes between the groups respectively.</p>
