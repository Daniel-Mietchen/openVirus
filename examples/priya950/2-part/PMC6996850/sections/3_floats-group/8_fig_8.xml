  <title>Changes in gene expression and biologic pathways affected following subclinical or acute HEV infection in the pregnant women in 2nd trimester with reference to pregnant controls from corresponding trimesters.</title>
  <p>Differential expression analysis in PBMCs from pregnant subclinical (PR-2-SC) and acute (PR-2-acute) patients as compared to respective healthy pregnant controls. (A) DAVID was used to identify over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Significant enriched GO terms of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in PR-2-SC and PR-2-acute patients. The vertical axis is the GO category and the horizontal axis is–log P value &lt;0.05. (B)The enriched KEGG pathways of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in PR-2-SC and PR-2-acute patients (P value &lt;0.05).(P value is modified Fisher’s Exact test P- value or EASE score).</p>
