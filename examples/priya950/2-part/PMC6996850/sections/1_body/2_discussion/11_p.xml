<p>In an interesting study by Huang et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], microarray analysis of PBMCs from asymptomatic and symptomatic Influenza infections following experimental infection of the virus to human volunteers showed that activation of all known classes of PRRs led to symptomatic infection while the absence or downregulation was characteristic of asymptomatic infection. Though the differentiation of immune response during symptomatic and asymptomatic HEV infection in the present study is complicated by the pregnancy status and duration of pregnancy, a similar trend is seen when compared to non-pregnant controls. Acute disease was characterized by the activation of TLRs and additionally NOD1 signaling pathway in the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> trimester. On the contrary, NOD-like receptor signaling was associated with subclinical infection in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester.
