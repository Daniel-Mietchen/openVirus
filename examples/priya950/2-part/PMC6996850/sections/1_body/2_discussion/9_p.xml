<p>We now would like to address two small antimicrobial peptides of innate immune system that seem to have a role in protection/pathogenesis of hepatitis E. The observed upregulation of some of the S100 series molecules transcripts during acute disease with either downregulated or normal levels during subclinical infections suggests possible association with the outcome of HEV infection. High levels of S100A4 protein in human carcinoma cells are strongly associated with their metastatic capability [
