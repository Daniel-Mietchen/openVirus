<p>The absence of induction of IFNγ gene during acute phase irrespective of pregnancy and 2.99fold increase during convalescence among NPR patients is noteworthy and in accordance with our earlier observations of (i) a significant reduction in the circulating IFNγ levels in the NPR patients that were further reduced in the PR patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the FHF patients, IFNγ levels increased significantly, a further rise marked recovery. Patients with unaltered IFNγ levels succumbed to the infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results suggest protective role of this Th1 cytokine. Majumdar et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] confirmed these findings. The concordance in the expression at gene and protein levels emphasizes definite role of IFNγ in recovery even from fulminant disease. Further studies are needed to explore the role / utility of this gene/molecule in modulation /treatment of severe disease.
