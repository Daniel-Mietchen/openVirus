<p>Pathogen recognition is an important step in the activation of inflammatory pathways. Of the three types of pattern recognition receptors, our data shows possible involvement of TLRs and NLRs in HEV infection. Of note, we earlier reported temporal activation of TLR4/7/8 (protein and gene levels) and TLR3 (gene) in the NPR patients that was reduced in the PR patients. This reduction actually reflected pregnancy status and not HEV infection [

The overexpression of toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TLR-4 signaling pathway and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway suggests role of TLR4 in the PR patients. Additionally, patients in the third trimester enriched MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In the light of these findings, we would like to point out that expression of TLR2 / TLR3 /TLR4 genes was increased in acute hepatitis E patients while a significant reduction was evident in the fulminant category [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] documented that the expression of TLR3 and TLR9 and downstream MYD88 signaling molecules IRF3 and IRF7 were significantly down regulated in pregnant women with FHF-E than with acute hepatitis E.
