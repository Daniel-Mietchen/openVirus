TLRs have been evaluated in hepatitis E patients with pregnancy. Contrary to the temporal activation of TLR4/TLR7/TLR8 at protein and mRNA levels in the NPR patients, the ANC-patients and controls exhibited reduced TLRs indicative of impaired TLR response [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The expression of TLR3 was associated with recovery while the patients with lower expression progressed to acute liver failure. A significant downregulation of TLR3 and TLR9 and downstream MYD88 signaling molecules IRF3 and IRF7 was shown in pregnant women with FHF-E than with acute hepatitis E [
