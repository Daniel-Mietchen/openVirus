Patients examined within two weeks of the onset of clinical symptoms were grouped as acute-phase while convalescent phase patients were studied during 4–5 weeks post-disease onset. The study groups included (A) healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control), (B) healthy,trimester-1 pregnant controls (PR-1-control), (C) healthy, trimester-2 pregnant controls (PR-2-control), (D) healthy, trimester-3 pregnant controls (PR-3-control), (E) non-pregnant patients (NPR) during early acute phase (NPR-acute), (F) NPR patients during convalescence (NPR-conv), (G) pregnant patients, trimester-2, early acute phase (PR-2-acute), (H) pregnant patients, trimester-3, early acute phase (PR-3-acute), (I) pregnant patients, trimester-1,sub-clinical (PR-1-SC), (J) pregnant patients, trimester-2, sub-clinical (PR-2-SC) and (K) pregnant patients, trimester-3, sub-clinical (PR-3-SC). During the study period, we did not identify any trimester-1 pregnant woman with clinical hepatitis E. Groups B and I were included only for “Principal component and correlation” analyses and not for further detailed analysis.
