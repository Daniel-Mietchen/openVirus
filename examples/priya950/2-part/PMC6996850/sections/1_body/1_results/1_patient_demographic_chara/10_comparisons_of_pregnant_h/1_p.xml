<p>Our next aim was to understand differences in the biologic processes between acute and subclinical HEV infections in the later trimesters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g005">Fig 5</xref>). By comparing subclinical and acute HEV infections during the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester relative to the NPR controls / PR controls, we identified 256/112 (common to both groups), 303/183 (unique to subclinical infection) and 557/251 (unique to acute disease) genes. Respective gene expression during the third trimester was 385/130, 245/204 and 540/173.
