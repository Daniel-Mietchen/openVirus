 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), Ribosome, systemic lupus erythematosus, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway were common to both forms of HEV infection. Association of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and Intestinal immune network for IgA production was unique in subclinical infection and that of toll-like receptor signaling pathway was restricted to acute infection.
