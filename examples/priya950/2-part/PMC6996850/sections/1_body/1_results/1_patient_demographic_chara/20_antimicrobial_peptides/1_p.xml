<p>Defensins represent an important group of antimicrobial peptides in humans. This study showed the involvement of alpha defensins (DEFA) in hepatitis E. In both clinical and subclinical categories, DEFA1 gene was upregulated (NPR 3.5fold; PR-2-acute/SC, 5.3fold/3.8fold and PR-3-acute/SC, 6.3fold/5.1fold) suggesting protective role in both PR and NPR patients. In addition, raised gene expression of DEFA1B, DEFA3 and DEFA4 was recorded in the PR patients with clinical or subclinical HEV infection. When compared to the PR controls, DEFA4 was raised in both the clinical PR categories, DEFA5 was 3.7 fold down regulated in PR-2-acute while no change was noted in PR-3-acute group.</p>
