<p>Immunoglobulin genes deserve a special focus. In humans, there is a potential to generate 8262 heavy chain genes and 320 light-chain genes as a result of variable region gene rearrangements. Therefore, the potential number of heavy and light-chain combinations is very high (~million combinations). In this context, the number of genes upregulated in the NPR patients was 28 while none and 1 gene exhibited higher levels in the PR patients. In the control PR women, these genes were downregulated (14 in PR-2-control and 16 in PR-3-control). When compared to the PR controls, 26 and 48 Ig mRNA transcript levels were elevated in PR-2-acute and PR-3-acute categories respectively documenting HEV induced expression of Ig genes in the NPR and PR patients.</p>
