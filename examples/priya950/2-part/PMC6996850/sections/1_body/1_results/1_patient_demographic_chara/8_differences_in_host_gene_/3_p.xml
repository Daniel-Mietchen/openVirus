<p>Of the pathways enriched (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), ribosome and systemic lupus erythematosus were common to all the patient categories. Unique group-specific pathways included: oxidative phosphorylation (NPR-acute), Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Chemokine signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (PR-2-acute) and epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection, complement and coagulation cascades (PR-3-acute). Helicobacter pylori infection related GO term included NFKBIA, JUN, ATP6V1G1, CXCR1, ATP6V1F and IL8 genes.
