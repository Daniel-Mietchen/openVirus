<p>As far as the adaptive response is considered, GO terms associated with T cell activation, proliferation, were common to both subclinical and acute presentations. However, active T cell response was seen uniquely in the subclinical category (antigen processing and presentation, adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains, regulation of adaptive immune response, antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via MHC class II, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class II, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II). Humoral immune response related GO terms such as humoral immune response was common to both, while B cell mediated immunity (C1QB, HLA-DRA, C1QC, FCERIG, CIQA, CLU) was uniquely in subclinical infection.</p>
