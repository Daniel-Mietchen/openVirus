<p>Pregnancy is known to modulate immune response to accommodate fetus, pregnancy duration being an important factor. To differentiate the effect of pregnancy and the virus or a possible interaction of both, pregnant patients were compared with NPR controls (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Of the 1260 DEGs recorded in all the acute-phase patients, 209 were overlapping suggestive of common biologic mechanisms operative during HEV infection while 240 were unique to the disease during pregnancy. Interestingly, the pattern of unique genes was NPR&gt;PR-2&gt;PR-3. When pregnancy associated modulations were taken into consideration, the number of overlapping genes reduced to 6 while 190 were common to the PR category.
