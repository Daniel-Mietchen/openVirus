<p>As far as the KEGG pathways are concerned (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), proteasome was enriched in both the patient groups in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester while acute and subclinical infections respectively were associated with NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and pathways in cancer (VHL, MMP9, PIAS4, PTGS2, DVL2, SMAD4, SPI1, CRKL genes). In the third trimester, systemic lupus erythematosus and proteasome were enriched in the acute disease while Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (VAV1, MARCKSL1, WASF2, DNM2, HCK, MAP2K1 genes) and adherens junction (ACTG1, WASF2, SMAD4, CSNK2B, EP300 genes) represented the subclinical category (
