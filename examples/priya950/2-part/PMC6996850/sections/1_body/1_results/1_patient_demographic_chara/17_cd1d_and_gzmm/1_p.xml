<p>We report higher expression of CD1D mRNA in both PR and NPR self-recovering patients in the early acute phase. The raised mRNA transcripts of CD1D and GZMM (and CD69) in the healthy pregnant women suggest increased circulating NK/NKT cells as a part of pregnancy-associated immunomodulation. HEV infection of these women led to the downregulation of these genes, the levels being comparable to NPR patients. It appears that though self-recovering, the PR and NPR patients behave differently with respect to these cells. When we compared clinical and subclinical HEV infections, an upregulation was seen during subclinical infection in the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> trimester while no change was recorded in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester.
