<p>To identify which biologic processes were over-represented in the DEGs, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis at a false discovery rate of 5%. The most significant first 17 GO terms associated with the acute phase were related to biosynthesis and metabolism functions, while immune system / immune response was within the first 5 GO terms in the convalescing patients. During both phases, the common GO terms were indicative of primary non-specific immune response: response to virus, immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response (

Mounting of robust innate as well as adaptive T cell and B cell immune response was unique to convalescence while over expression of blood coagulation was unique to the acute phase. Some KEGG pathways were significantly overrepresented during both phases of the disease, with upregulated genes after correction for multiple testing (FDR 5%), including: ribosome, systemic lupus erythematosus and oxidative phosphorylation with higher gene count in the convalescent phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).The identification of systemic lupus erythematosus pathway is probably on account of the overlap with the complement pathways and the large number of histone genes that were upregulated. Unique immune response pathways upregulated during convalescence included: antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), proteasome, spliceosome graft-versus-host disease, allograft rejection hematopoietic cell lineage and intestinal immune network for IgA production that correlates with enteric infection with HEV.
