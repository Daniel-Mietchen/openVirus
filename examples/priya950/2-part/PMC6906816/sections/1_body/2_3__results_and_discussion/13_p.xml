<p>In Ecuador, the temperature inside the social housing is correlated with the outside temperature. However, the temperature difference between day and night can be up to 10Â°C, approximately. In this sense, the variation of temperature in one day can affect the health of the occupants of the edifications and much more to those of social housing.
