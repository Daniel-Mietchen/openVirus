<p>This lack of proper living conditions directly affects the indoor air quality [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Latin America and Caribbean, approximately 34 million families [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Physical conditions in social housings could potentially increase the risk. The selection of construction materials responds to cultural, economics, and availability patterns; therefore, the use of inadequate construction materials also affects the housing conditions and the occupants' health [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, researchers in [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated the link between people's health and security with the materials which were used in the construction. “The main health outcome shown to be related to housing is that of respiratory health, measured by the presence of respiratory disease or by lung function” [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This kind of housing solves principally a space problem but does not provide proper indoor thermal conditions or high air quality; moreover, these parameters are affected by the high number of inhabitants.
