<p>On the contrary, influenza is “… an acute respiratory infectious disease related to climate and seasonal clustering cycles” [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which has caused global epidemics and pandemics [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], due to its rapid transmission. “In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly” [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Most influenza infections are spread by droplets of several microns in diameter that contain the virus and are expelled during coughing and sneezing [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; therefore, “the airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments, especially in unventilated conditions” [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It supposed that most cases of influenza are transmitted by aerosol “suspensions in air (or in a gas) of solid or liquid particles, small enough that they remain airborne for prolonged periods because of their low settling velocity” [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. And “when an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can spread up to one meter, and infect people in close proximity who breathe these droplets in” [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in this case inside a housing during the night. A study about the transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the pandemic and postpandemic seasons in a house shows that the probability of virus transmission varies according to the weather station, and that people who shared a bedroom were at a higher risk of presenting influenza-like illness, being the children the most affected [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The percentage of influenza contagion is very high worldwide so that the development of symptomatic influenza A or B each year in children represents about 20% and 5% of adults [
