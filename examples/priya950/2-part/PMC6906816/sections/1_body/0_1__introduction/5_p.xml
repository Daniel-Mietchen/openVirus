<p>In the same way, the exterior environment and the interior microclimate of inhabited spaces interact with the construction materials and influence the interior [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is important to consider the impact of weather on the performance of buildings [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and how changes in climate patterns affect human health [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For instance, the increase in the relative humidity in the air affects the humidity content of permeable materials such as wood, paper, carpet, and food allowing mildew to spread, which reproduces trough spores transported by air [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], generating respiratory problems [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There is evidence that links the humidity in the interior and allergies and respiratory diseases [

Less severe cold conditions encourage condensation, and parents report more respiratory problems in their children if they live in damp houses” [
