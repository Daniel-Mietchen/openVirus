<p>The temperature and relative humidity conditions inside the homes are related with the outside climate, but these can change depending on the characteristics of the materials of housing envelope, infiltration, percentage of glazing, height of the roof, and among many other construction features that must be appropriate to the climate. The indoor microclimate varies, being able to increase or decrease the transmission of diseases among its inhabitants. This work found that a part of the housings that do not comply with temperature and relative humidity standards in the interior are built with inappropriate materials so that the well-being of their inhabitants is affected. In addition, an increased rate of influenza spreading, in combination with overcrowding, converts these housings in origin of spreading diseases.</p>
