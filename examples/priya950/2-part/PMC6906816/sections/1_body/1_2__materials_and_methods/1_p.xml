<p>For this work, an epidemiologic approach has been used, but as the data available were aggregated by geographic unit, only the ecologic type of study can be applied, adapting the quantitative method of relative risk estimation to it, in order to relate possible determinants to spatial distribution of disease [

These parameters were applied to a digital model of social housing defined by Ministerio de Desarollo Urbano y Vivienda (Miduvi) (Ministry of Urban Development and Housing) in Ecuador. This typical house is unique for all Ecuadorians, and no adaptation to specific regions has been considered for economical reasons. The behavior of indoor conditions of temperature and relative humidity was simulated in DesignBuilder software. This social house model has been established for the whole country including urban and rural zones, using the same architectural design, dimensions, and materials. However, the weather conditions in the 1040 parishes in continental Ecuador are different. The rate in each one of the 1040 parishes was calculated using hospital records from Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INEC) (National Institute of Statistics and Census) for cases coded from J09 to J12, according to the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (IDC-10) and population totals. The housing models for the simulations are the same for each parish; however, its behavior changes according to the climatic conditions that will generate internal and external temperature and relative humidity values. In spite of relative climatic stability, there is a variation in the temperature between day and night; specifically, the temperature at sunset is decreasing and reaches its lowest values at night, when the house is more occupied.
