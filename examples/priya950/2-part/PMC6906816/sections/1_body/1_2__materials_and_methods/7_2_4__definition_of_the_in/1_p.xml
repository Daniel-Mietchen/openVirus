<p>The data of indoor conditions were obtained using simulations of the thermal behavior of house models. EnergyPlus linked with the DesignBuilder (DB) environment was used to perform simulations with virtual building models. EnergyPlus is capable of performing simulations with “time steps of less than an hour, modular systems and plant integrated with heat balance-based zone simulation, multizone air flow, thermal comfort, and photovoltaic systems” [
