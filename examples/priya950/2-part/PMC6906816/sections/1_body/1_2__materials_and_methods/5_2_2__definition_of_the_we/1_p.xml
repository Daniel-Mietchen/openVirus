<p>To define weather conditions, we generated meteorological information in EPW format with hourly data, through Meteonorm software for each parish. Because of the large quantity of iterations and combinations, it was necessary to use an automatization process. Once the working environment was defined, we used a virtual box to assemble all the tools over a virtual machine (VM), Mouse Recorder Pro (MRP), which was used to record the sequence that Met provides to obtain the files. MRP calendar allowed scheduling the task to be performed at a specific hour; besides, it was used to repeat the cycle as many times as needed. Once the configuration was done, the VM was turned off and its status was saved. The current VM was cloned 10 times; hence, for gaining velocity and saving space, a cloned cycle was linked to the original VM.</p>
