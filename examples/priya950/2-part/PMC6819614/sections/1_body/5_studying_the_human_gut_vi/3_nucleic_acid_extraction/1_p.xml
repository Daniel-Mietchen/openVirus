<p id="Par24">Similar to gut microbiome studies, gut virome studies begin by isolating the genetic material from intestinal specimens (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Given the perceived predominance of DNA viruses in human stool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], current virome studies mainly use DNA extraction from fecal samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. However, the current conception of gut virome composition might underestimate the abundance of RNA viruses. For example, RNase I is commonly used in VLP isolation protocols to remove free capsid-unprotected RNA of non-viral origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. However, RNase I has recently also been shown to affect the RNA-fraction of the virome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. To get a true estimate of the RNA viruses in the sample, one needs to restrict the use of RNase I, although this might come at a cost of increased contamination (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
