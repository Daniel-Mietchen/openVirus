<p id="Par40">Similarly, in soil ecosystems, where bacteria dominate over archaea and eukaryotes as they do in marine ecosystems, it has been shown that phages play an important role in defining ecosystem composition and function [

Moreover, in ecosystems such as anaerobic digesters, more than 40% of the total variation of the prokaryotic community composition is explained by the presence of certain phages, and this is much higher than the explanatory potential of abiotic factors (14.5%) [
