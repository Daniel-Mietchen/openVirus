<p id="Par41">It is important to bear in mind that ecological concepts from one ecosystem might have limited applicability to another. Even if two ecosystems have similar viral community structures, the underlying ecological relationships may differ. For example, a predominance of temperate viruses was reported in a polar aquatic region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. This predominance of temperate phages corresponds to that in the gut ecosystem. However, for the polar marine ecosystem, it was shown that temperate phages switch from lysogeny to lytic infection mode with the rise of bacterial abundance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. This is opposite to the Piggyback-the-Winner model observed in the human gut, where temperate phages dominate over lytic phages when the bacterial host is abundant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. This difference in ecological concepts between the gut and distinct marine ecosystem reflects the exposure to different factors of the environment. The polar aquatic region has a periodic nature owing to the change of seasons, while the gut ecosystem can be considered relatively stable (see “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Major hallmarks of the human gut virome</xref>” section)
 <italic>.</italic> Therefore, while human gut viromics might benefit from considering some cutting-edge approaches developed in environmental studies, caution should be exercised in extrapolating ecological concepts found in distinct ecosystems to situations pertaining to the human gut.
