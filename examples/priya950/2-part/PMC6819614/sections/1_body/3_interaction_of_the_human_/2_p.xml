<p id="Par13">In recent years there have also been attempts to characterize a “healthy gut phageome”. In 2016, Manrique et al. used ultra-deep sequencing to study the presence of completely assembled genomes of phages in 64 healthy people around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The authors proposed that the phageome could be split into three parts: i) the core, which is composed of at least 23 bacteriophages, one of them crAssphage, found in &gt; 50% of all individuals; (ii) the common, which is shared among 20–50% of individuals; and (iii) the low overlap/unique, which is found in a small number of individuals. The latter fraction represented the majority of found bacteriophages in the whole dataset [

Therefore, crAssphage, the abundance of which was not associated with any health-related variables, is likely to be a core element of the normal human virome [
