<p id="Par7">In the human gut ecosystem, temperate bacteriophages dominate over lytic bacteriophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is believed that the majority of bacterial cells have at least one phage inserted into their genome, the so-called prophage. Some prophages may be incorporated in bacterial genomes for millions of generations, losing their ability to excise from host genomes because of genetic erosion (degradation and deletion processes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These prophages, which are called cryptic or defective, have been shown to be important for the fitness of the bacterial host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and thus represent an essential part of a bacterial genome.
