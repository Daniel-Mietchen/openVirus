<p id="Par4">Bacteriophages are the most abundant group of viruses and are obligatory parasites propagating in bacterial hosts. The potential host range is phage-specific and can vary from only one bacterial strain to multiple bacterial species. During infection, a bacteriophage attaches to the bacterium surface and inserts its own genetic material into the cell. The bacteriophage then follows one of two main life cycles: a
