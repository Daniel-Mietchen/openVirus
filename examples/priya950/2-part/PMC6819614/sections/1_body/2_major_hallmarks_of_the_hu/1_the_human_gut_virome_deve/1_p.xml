<p id="Par8">During early development, the virome, like the bacteriome, is extremely dynamic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In 2008 Breitbart et al., using direct epifluorescent microscopy, concluded that meconium (earliest infant stool) contained no phages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Just 1 week later the infant stool contained 10
 <sup>8</sup> viral-like particles (VLPs) per gram of feces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similar to the bacteriome, the infant virome was found to be less diverse than that of adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The exact mechanism of the origin of phages in the infant gut has yet to be identified, although one hypothesis could be that the phages arise as a result of the induction of prophages from gut bacteria. Numerous other factors are also thought to shape the infant gut virome, including environmental exposures, diet, host genetics, and mode of delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. McCann et al. compared the virome of infants born via vaginal delivery to that of infants born via cesarean delivery and found that the alpha- and beta-diversity of the infant virome differed significantly between birth modes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The authors were able to identify 32 contigs that were differentially abundant by birth mode, including several contigs bearing high levels of nucleotide homology to 
 <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> temperate phages. This was thought to reflect differential colonization by 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> with birth mode. Furthermore, an increased abundance of the vertebrate ssDNA virus 
 <italic>Anelloviridae</italic> was found in infants born via vaginal delivery, suggesting its vertical transmission from mother to baby [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The abundance of this virus had previously been shown to decrease after the age of 15 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but it nonetheless remains highly prevalent in humans worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Diet may also play a role in colonization of infant gut, as Pannaraj et al. showed that a significant proportion of bacteriophages were transferred from mothers to infants through breast milk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Despite these interesting results, only a few studies to date have investigated the infant virome longitudinally. In 2015, Lim et al. conducted a longitudinal study of the virome and bacteriome in four twin pairs, from birth to 2 years, and found that the expansion of the bacteriome with age was accompanied by a contraction and shift in the bacteriophage composition [
