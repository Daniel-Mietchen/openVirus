     <p>• Studying RNA viruses requires additional effort due to the relative instability of RNA genetic material:</p>

     <p> - Restricted usage of RNase in protocols handling both DNA and RNA viruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]

     <p>• Studying ssDNA viruses requires additional effort:</p>
     <p> - Some of the WGA techniques that precede the genomic library preparation procedure might introduce biases into the representation of ssDNA viruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]
     </p>
     <p> - The majority of current genomic library preparation procedures cannot handle ssDNA genomes due to the use of dsDNA adapters</p>
     <p> - ssDNA viruses have been shown to have higher mutation rates than dsDNA viruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], thus increasing the microdiversity of the metagenome, which limits reference-based approach
     </p>

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], though some are limited to known prophages. The combination of multiple methods has been shown to enrich the set of detected prophages [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] and therefore prevent their concurrent removal with bacterial sequences.

     <p>• De novo assembly approach is sensitive to biases introduced during genomic library preparation and sequencing:</p>
     <p> - Low DNA input for genomic library preparation decreases the percentage of reads that map back to the corresponding assemblies [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]
     </p>
     <p> - Shifts in GC content during genomic library preparation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] affect the completeness of genomes and cause assembly fragmentation

    <td>
     <p>• Adjustment of the assembly pipeline according to applied genomic library preparation procedure [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] preceded by read de-duplication [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]

     <p>• Use of genomic library preparation protocols without any amplification procedure (needs high DNA input, probably not applicable for viromics) [
