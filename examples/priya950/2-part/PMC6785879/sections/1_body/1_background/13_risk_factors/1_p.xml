<p id="Par65">The risk of SBV infection in domestic ruminants appears to differ among farm animal species, for example: within-group seroprevalence was typically lower in sheep flocks compared to cattle herds in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] and SBV seroprevalence was lower in goats compared to sheep in Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. One study demonstrated that goats have a lower risk of SBV infection compared to sheep [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. These findings suggest that the risk of SBV infection may be due to the inherent differences in the susceptibility of domestic ruminants to SBV infection. An alternative explanation may be due to 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> host species preferences. Cattle are the preferred host for the most common 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> arbovirus vector species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. The differences in the exposure of host species to 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> arbovirus vectors, for example, different housing conditions and farming practices should also be considered. Dairy cattle herds managed outside appeared to have higher SBV seroprevalence compared to herds kept indoors, most likely due to the lower midge activity indoors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. Similar results were also found in goats where flocks managed outdoors had high within-herd SBV seroprevalence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>].
