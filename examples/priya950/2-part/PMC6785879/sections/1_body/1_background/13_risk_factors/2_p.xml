<p id="Par66">Timing of the reproductive season, particularly in sheep flocks with early breeding seasons (which overlapped with the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vector-active season), was also identified as a risk factor for congenital Schmallenberg disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. As SBV infection induces long-duration immunity in cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>,
