<p id="Par45">SBV infection during early gestation in cattle has also been associated with embryonic mortality and return to oestrus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. This is supported by reports of reduced fertility in SBV-affected herds in Switzerland (increased number of inseminations per cow) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], in Germany and in the Netherlands in 2011 (repeat oestrus, increased number of abortions and short gestations and an increase in the number of artificial inseminations per cow) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. In ruminants, the primary pregnancy recognition signal is an interferon (IFN-tau); interestingly a number of studies have shown that the NSs protein of SBV plays a major role in inhibiting IFN production and contributes to SBV pathogenesis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Reports of abortions and increased numbers of repeated oestruses suggestive of early embryonic mortality have also been attributed to SBV infection in sheep flocks [
