<p id="Par48">The CNS, the axial skeleton and skeletal muscle are the most commonly reported sites for congenital malformations, individually or in combination, in domestic ruminants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Arthrogryposis can be pathognomonic for SBV infection and can be associated with skeletal muscle hypoplasia, with histological evidence of decreased number and diameter of myofibrils, with and without loss of cross-striation in myofibrils and fatty replacement [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In the CNS, the most commonly reported lesions described are hydranencephaly, porencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebellar hypoplasia and micromyelia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with histological evidence of non-suppurative inflammation, neuronal degeneration and necrosis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Malformations of the vertebral column can also be pathognomonic for SBV infection and include lordosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, kypho-scoliosis and torticollis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), a number of animals are also reported to have brachygnathia inferior [
