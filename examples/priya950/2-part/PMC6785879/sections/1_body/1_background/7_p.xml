<p id="Par36">In 2016, SBV re-emerged and recirculated in Ireland, the UK and in Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] resulting in a second outbreak of abortions and congenital malformations in ruminants. SBV was also confirmed in regions that had previously been unaffected by SBV (north and north west of Ireland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), and in countries outside of the EU [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], highlighting the continued geographical expansion of SBV. The virus continued to circulate in Ireland and the UK in 2017, which is in contrast with other European countries which have not (yet, September 2019) reported notable SBV circulation during this time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Further research is recommended to determine the extent of SBV circulation in continental Europe during this time.
