<p id="Par52">The use of laboratory-based small animal models, principally mouse models, has facilitated research studies on the biology and pathogenesis of SBV. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that the SBV non-structural protein NSs is an important virulence factor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] and has an important role in SBV pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. A mouse model has been developed in NIH Swiss mice to study SBV infection in brain tissue; intracerebral SBV inoculation resulted in deaths and severe brain lesions (malacia and haemorrhage of the cerebral cortex, multifocal vacuolation in the white matter of the cerebrum, and lymphocytic perivascular cuffing in the grey matter) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Embryonated Chicken Egg models (ECEs) have been used previously to study the pathogenesis of a number of Simbu viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. More recently, Collins et al. (2018) demonstrated that ECE models are also suitable 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> small animal models to study SBV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Barry et al. (2014) demonstrated an association between activated caspase-3 (indicator of apoptosis) and SBV in the brain tissue of NIH Swiss mice inoculated intracerebrally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Type I interferon receptor knock-out (IFNAR-/-) mice are also susceptible to SBV infection and can develop fatal disease and are thus a useful model to study SBV [
