<p id="Par50">When an adult animal is bitten by an infectious 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vector, they can become infected with SBV and develop viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. SBV infection induces long-duration protective immunity in cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] and sheep [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. However, if a na√Øve adult animal develops SBV viraemia during the critical stage of gestation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), the virus can cross the placenta and infect the foetus, possibly resulting in congenital Schmallenberg disease. While the gestation-susceptible period for AKAV has been defined in domestic ruminants (see Section Vertical Transmission 
 <italic>vide infra</italic>), it has yet to be determined for SBV; it is assumed to be similar to that of AKAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, a number of studies which have tried to elucidate the most susceptible stages of gestation for congenital SBV disease (based on the critical period for AKAV), have only led to foetal malformations in a very limited number of cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
