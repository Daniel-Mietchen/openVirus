<p id="Par53">The effects of AKAV infection on developing embryos vary depending on the stage of gestation at which the dam becomes infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. While, it is assumed this is similar for congenital SBV infection, further research is required to help elucidate the age-associated effects of SBV infection on developing embryos. The gestation-susceptible period for congenital AKAV infection is between day 28 and 56 days in small ruminants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>], and between day 80 and 150 in cattle [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. However, experimental SBV infection in domestic ruminants during these dates has led to congenital malformations only in a very small number of cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This highlights the need for further research in this area; the development of suitable ruminant models to study SBV infection in developing embryos would be useful to help elucidate SBV pathogenesis.
