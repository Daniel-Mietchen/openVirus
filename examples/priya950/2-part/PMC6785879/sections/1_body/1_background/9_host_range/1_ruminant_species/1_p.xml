<p id="Par41">Schmallenberg virus primarily infects ruminants. Direct and indirect detection of SBV in has been identified in cattle, sheep and goats (either in adult animals or in their offspring) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. SBV RNA or antibodies have been detected in a wide range of wild and exotic ruminants (alpacas, elk, State Anatolian and Congo water buffalo, European bison, red deer, fallow deer, roe deer, sika deer, llama, reindeer, moufflon, water buffalo and chamois) and camelids in a number of European countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], and in wild (fallow, red and sika) deer in Ireland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In Spain, SBV antibodies were also confirmed in wild (red, fallow) deer and also wild moufflon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Experimental infection with SBV in alpacas and llamas resulted in sub-clinical infection with detectable SBV-RNA viraemia for 3 to 7 days post inoculation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In Poland, a cross-sectional study of Schmallenberg virus seroprevalence in wild ruminants at the end of the vector season of 2013 suggested that wild ruminants might play a role in SBV transmission, however the lower seroprevalence in relation to the domestic ruminants suggests the spill-over effect from the latter, rather than inverse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. SBV antigen was also confirmed in the serum of a 6-month-old elk found in Białowieża national park in Poland, however no clinical sign were observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This may be due to the free-ranging nature of these wild animals and the limited contact with humans. In Belgium, Italy and France, SBV antibodies were also confirmed in wild ruminants (wild cervids and wild alpine ungulates) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Additionally, serum samples collected from a wide range of zoo ruminants have also tested positive for SBV antibodies in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], in France and in the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In contrast to domestic ruminants, clinical signs associated with SBV infection have not been described in these wild and exotic species; further investigation is required to clarify the effects of SBV infection in these species and to assess their role in the epidemiology of SBV [
