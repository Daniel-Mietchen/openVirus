<p id="Par42">Owing to the fact that a number of viruses in the Orthobunyavirus genus can cause disease in humans, one of the most critical questions regarding SBV during the initial epidemics was whether SBV transmission from animals to humans was possible. Molecular and serological investigations in highly exposed human populations in Germany and in the Netherlands revealed no evidence of SBV infection; neither SBV-RNA nor antibodies were detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Evidence of indirect SBV infection has been reported in a range of non-ruminant species. SBV-specific antibodies have been detected in free-ranging wild boar in a number of countries including Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], Poland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] and Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. A limited number of reports suggest that SBV infection can occur in dogs. In France SBV-RNA was detected in the brain of a puppy with torticollis and degenerative encephalopathy, while SBV antibodies were detected in its mother [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. SBV antibodies were also reported in one dog without clinical signs in Sweden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. However, SBV serological investigations in 132 dogs in Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] and in wild carnivores in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] found no evidence of SBV infection. Experimental SBV infection in pigs leads to transient seroconversion, however no SBV-RNA was detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] suggesting they may become infected but do not develop disease. SBV antibodies have also been detected in exotic zoo species (onager, Grevyâ€™s zebra, Asian elephant and babirusa) in two zoological parks in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Previously, The European Food Safety Authority considered that horses did not play a role as a reservoir in the epidemiology of SBV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, one recent study reported the detection of SBV-specific antibodies in horses in Iran; this is the first reported evidence of SBV infection in equine species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution; these positive results were not confirmed using virus neutralisation tests and SBV RNA was not detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, the animals tested originated in the Simbu serogroup endemic areas of northern and northeast Iran; the possibility of cross-reaction with other related Simbu serogroup viruses such as Shuni (SHUV), Aino (AINV), and Akabane (AKAV) virus could not be excluded [
