<p id="Par74">The detection of SBV-specific antibodies may be a more reliable diagnostic test in adult animals compared to virus detection considering the short duration of viraemia (approximately 4-6 days) and the non-specific clinical signs associated with SBV infection in adult animals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Moreover, the detection of SBV-specific antibodies in foetal heart blood (aborted foetuses) or in serum collected prior to ingestion of colostrum (neonates) can confirm congenital SBV infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>]. Serum is the matrix of choice for detecting SBV RNA and antibodies in adult animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Milk (lacto-serum) samples can also be used to detect SBV-specific antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. Similar to a number of other livestock diseases such as Bovine Viral Diarrhoea and Bovine Leukemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>], a number of research studies have investigated the relationship between SBV antibody titres in serum and milk samples. Bulk tank milk antibody titres are highly predictive of within-herd SBV seroprevalence and can be used as a surveillance tool to monitor SBV infection dynamics in dairy cattle herds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>]. One study demonstrated that antibody titres in individual animal milk samples were significantly higher when compared to serum samples in dairy cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. A number of countries in Europe have used BTM-ELISA results to monitor SBV infection dynamics in dairy herds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. Virus-specific antibodies can be detected in serum and milk using a variety of assays including in-house and commercial ELISAs (there are several commercial antibody ELISA-Kits available), micro-neutralisation and indirect immunofluorescence tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. A European-wide ring trial demonstrated limited inter-laboratory variation in the detection of SBV-specific antibodies in serum and that the virus neutralisation test was more sensitive compared to a number of different ELISAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. While the SBV virus neutralisation test is highly specific [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>], the S-segment based ELISAs could lead to cross-reactivity between SBV and other Simbu viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. This is particularly important to consider in the context of selecting the most appropriate diagnostic tests to use in order to confirm the emergence of SBV in new geographical regions. Currently (September 2019), SBV is the only known Simbu serogroup Orthobunyavirus virus reported in Europe.
