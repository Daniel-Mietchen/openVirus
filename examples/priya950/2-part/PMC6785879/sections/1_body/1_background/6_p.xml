<p id="Par35">However, there was little or no evidence of SBV circulation in Ireland in the three years (2013-2015) following the initial emergence of SBV in Ireland in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; a similar situation was present in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In Ireland it is possible that a high herd immunity (animal-level seroprevalence was 62.5 % in spring 2014) may have reduced the SBV’s ability to circulate in animals in previously exposed herds in the vector seasons of 2014 and 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SBV is typically highly efficient in spreading in herds in the presence of transmitting vector species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is due to the rapid rate of virus replication and the high probability of transmission from host to vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is supported by evidence of high within-herd seroprevalence in cattle and sheep after the 2011/2012 Schmallenberg epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These epidemiological characteristics of SBV result in a high basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), estimated to be as high as 6.2 for cattle-only farms and 7.6 for sheep-only farms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which reduces the probability of finding low numbers of seropositive animals once the virus has circulated in a naïve ruminant population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Using this R
 <sub>0</sub> value, it is interesting to note that the effective reproductive number (R
 <sub>e</sub> = R
 <sub>0</sub> × fraction of the population of susceptible animals) in animals in previously exposed herds in Ireland in spring 2014 (one year after the Irish Schmallenberg epidemic) would have been greater than one (Re = 2.33; Re = 6.2 × 0.375) highlighting the potential for SBV to re-circulate in these herds during 2014 and subsequent vector seasons, despite a perceived high herd immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].
