<p id="Par68">Sheep flocks are likely to be more susceptible to the impact of SBV infection than cattle herds due to the compact nature of the sheep breeding season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These species-specific patterns are often influenced by the time interval in pregnancy during which transplacental infection can lead to foetal damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. For example, early lambing sheep flocks are at greater risk of congenital Schmallenberg disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>]; this is because the gestation susceptible period of early lambing ewes can overlap with the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vector-active season, enabling congenital SBV infection. This is consistent with reports of substantial losses associated with mortality and congenital malformations in early lambing sheep flocks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. In the Netherlands, deformities in lambs varied from mild to severe, and ewes were reported to have given birth to normal lambs, deformed lambs and dummy lambs that were unable to suckle; dystocia was also common [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the UK, a sheep farmer survey that was conducted following the initial SBV epidemic reported that lamb and ewe losses were high on farms where SBV was confirmed or suspected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. In the same survey, the median number of lambs born (and the median number of deformed lambs) that died within one week of birth per 100 ewes were 18.2 (5.5) on farms where SBV was confirmed,11.3 (2.9) where SBV was suspected and 8.6 (0.0) where SBV was not suspected, respectively, while 8 to 16 per cent of SBV confirmed or suspected farms reported lamb mortality of ≥40 per cent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. Stokes et al. (2018) conducted a similar survey in the UK to determine the farm-level impact of SBV during the 2016–2017 lambing season and describe comparable results to the findings reported for the 2011/2012 outbreak; higher neonatal lamb mortality, dystocia and associated ewe deaths, and higher perceived impacts on sheep welfare, flock financial performance and farmer emotional wellness were reported on SBV confirmed (
 <italic>n</italic>=59) and SBV suspected (
 <italic>n</italic>=82), than SBV not suspected (
 <italic>n</italic>=74) farms [
