<p id="Par60">Experimental subcutaneous inoculation of cows with SBV resulted in detectable concentrations of SBV RNA in faecal, oral and nasal swabs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In contrast, experimental oral inoculation of cattle and nasal inoculation of sheep did not result in SBV RNA viraemia and animals remained seronegative [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. These findings suggest that direct transmission of SBV from one infected ruminant to another by direct contact, by oral route or by nasal route is unlikely. The possibility of venereal SBV transmission has not yet been fully determined; SBV has been detected in bovine semen samples collected from bulls naturally infected with SBV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>] however, it remains unknown whether females can become infected via this route. Experimentally infected goat bucks did not show evidence of SBV shedding in semen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Interestingly, viraemia was produced in cows inoculated with Akabane virus into the uterus at oestrus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>], suggesting AKAV infected semen resulted in viraemia. Further research studies in this area using SBV are recommended.
