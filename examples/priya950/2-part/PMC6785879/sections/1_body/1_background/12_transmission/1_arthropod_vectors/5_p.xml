<p id="Par58">A number of countries across Europe have established national surveillance systems to monitor 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species and abundance to monitor for the (re-)emergence and (re-)circulation of arboviruses such as BTV. However, arbovirus surveillance programs which solely monitor vectors (
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species) for evidence of infection are not considered the most effective programs to detect arbovirus circulation or emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Virus detection (sensitivity) in insect specimens is frequently lower when compared to mammalian samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, the detection of SBV in midges can be ambiguous as it does not always mean the virus is present at transmissible levels; bimodal distributions of cycle threshold (Ct) values for SBV in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> sp. is reported suggesting that the virus can be present in the vector at transmissible and sub-transmissible levels [
