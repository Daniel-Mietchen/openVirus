<p id="Par63">A number of hypotheses have been proposed in order to help elucidate SBV overwintering. Overwintering in animal hosts has been explored though not yet proven, however this is unlikely due to the short-duration viraemia associated with SBV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the low SBV RNA detection rates in malformed lambs and calves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that SBV can persist until birth in the placenta (cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes) of ewes infected with SBV-infectious serum at day 45 and 60 of gestation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. This persistence of SBV for at least 100 days in pregnant ewes is a new aspect of SBV pathogenesis and could help to explain how SBV overwinters the cold season in temperate climate zones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. There is no documented evidence of persistently infected foetuses in pregnant hosts as seen with Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDv) persistently infected animals.
