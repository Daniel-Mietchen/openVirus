<p id="Par62">SBV appears to have the ability to overwinter, that is, to survive for prolonged periods in vectors and/or in hosts during lower vector activity when no new hosts appear to become infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. One of the first reports of SBV overwintering occurred during the winter of 2011-2012 in France; in May 2012, eight months following the most likely introduction date of SBV into France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>], evidence of acute infection was detected in cows suggesting SBV overwintered or was re-introduced during the winter of 2011-2012 [
