<p id="Par56">Virus detection studies in field-caught 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations have implicated a range of Palearartic 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> in the transmission of SBV; SBV RNA has been detected in members of the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> Obsoletus group (
 <italic>C. obsoletus, C. scoticus, C. dewulfi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chiopterus</italic>) and in members of the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> Pulicaris group (
 <italic>C. pulicaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. punctatus</italic>), (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. SBV-RNA has also been detected in field-caught 
 <italic>C. nubeculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. imicola, C. newsteadi, C. lupicaris</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>] (Note that 
 <italic>C. lupicaris</italic> is currently considered a synonym of 
 <italic>C. delta</italic> (preferred) by the UK reference laboratory), suggesting that these species may be involved in SBV transmission; however conclusive evidence of the potential role of these species in SBV transmission is required. Vector competence (the intrinsic ability of an arthropod to become infected, to support the development or replication of a pathogen, and to transmit it to a vertebrate host) has been demonstrated for both 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> in laboratory experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. More recently, Pagès et al. (2018) demonstrated that 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> in the Obsoletus group and 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> are highly susceptibility to SBV infection in laboratory studies highlighting their role as competent SBV vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. Field data have confirmed the vector competence of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus, C. scoticus, C. dewulfi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chiopterus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. The role of mosquitos in SBV transmission has also been investigated and results indicate that they are not competent vectors; no evidence of SBV RNA was detected in 50,000 mosquitos trapped in Germany in 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>], nor was there evidence for the persistence of Schmallenberg virus in overwintering mosquitoes in the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. Experimental oral infection of two mosquito arbovirus vector species (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>) did not result in SBV replication to transmissible levels, indicating that these two species are not SBV arbovirus vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. In Germany, black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) were also analysed for the presence of SBV and proved negative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>].
