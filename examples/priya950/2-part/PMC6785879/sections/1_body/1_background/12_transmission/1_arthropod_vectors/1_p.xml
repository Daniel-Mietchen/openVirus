<p id="Par54">SBV is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted by haematophagous arthropods from the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> genus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). The arbovirus transmission cycle between vector and host is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Uninfected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> take a blood meal from a SBV-infectious host (ex: bovine, ovine, caprine). 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> become infectious (SBV replicates to transmissible levels within the midge) during the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is assumed to range between 9 and 41 days depending on microclimatic temperatures on farms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Virus transmission from vector to host occurs when infectious female 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> bite immunologically na√Øve animals and transmit the virus via their saliva. The intrinsic incubation period for SBV can range from 2-6 days [
