<p id="Par75">A number of surveillance systems were established across Europe in order to monitor for SBV (re-)emergence and (re-)circulation. These included syndromic surveillance, sentinel herd surveillance, cross-sectional seroprevalence studies and pathogen surveillance in animals and vectors. In the Netherlands a syndromic surveillance system based on routinely collected cattle reproduction and milk production data proved effective for the early detection of outbreaks of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses [

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> dispersion model has been developed by DAFM in conjunction with the Irish Meteorological Office (Met Ã‰ireann) and UCD Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis to monitor weather conditions which may favour a possible incursion of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> from the UK and continental Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, it is recognised that microclimatic temperatures provide better estimates of vector-borne disease transmission parameters when compared to standard meteorological temperatures, as the microclimate represents the actual temperatures to which the vectors are exposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Vector-borne disease transmission models for Schmallenbreg virus commonly use mathematical equations originally developed for Bluetongue virus serotype 9, for example Bessel et al. (2014) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>] and Haider et al. (2018). This is often because there are no specific experimental data on the relationship between temperature and virus replication rate (extrinsic incubation period) in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges for SBV. Further research in this area is recommended in order to determine the microclimatic conditions which are favourable for SBV replication in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species; this could enable more reliable predictions of SBV epidemics.
