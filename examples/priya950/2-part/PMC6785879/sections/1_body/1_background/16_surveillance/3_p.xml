<p id="Par77">Schmallenberg virus re-emergence and recirculation occurred in cattle herds in Ireland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] and in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>] during 2016 and 2017 resulting in a drop in milk yield and congenital malformations in calves and lambs. More recently (January/February 2018), SBV infection was also confirmed in malformed bovine foetuses in Ireland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. While a number of these cases are in livestock in regions where SBV had circulated previously, confirmed reports of SBV emergence in the north and north west of Ireland (where the virus had not been detected previously), suggests geographical expansion of SBV into regions with little, if any, SBV herd or flock immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Reports of SBV re-emergence and recirculation during 2017 is restricted to Ireland and the UK; this may be due to lack of notable virus circulation (possibly due to high herd immunity/endemic circulation) in continental Europe or possibly underreporting/cases not yet reported. Further research is recommended to determine the current herd immunity to SBV in Europe; this information can in turn be used by policy makers, veterinarians and farmers to inform decisions regarding the future risk of SBV circulation and possible epidemics.
