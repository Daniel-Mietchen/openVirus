<p id="Par19">MDCK or A549 cell monolayers (overnight confluent, 6-well plate format, triplicates) were used for infection at moi = 1. After virus adsorption at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and replaced with serum free medium. At the indicated time points, media was removed, and total RNAs were extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT
 <sub>16</sub>) primers (DNA synthesis, Russia) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using (2x) BioMaster HS-qPCR SYBR Blue (Biolabmix). The primers used are provided (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). NS1 gene expression was calculated by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>method, and GAPDH mRNA was used for normalization. The average value of the “reference sample” replicates (“1–1” sample at 1 h post-infection, h.p.i.) was designated as expression level ‘1.0’ and used for relative expression quantitation.
