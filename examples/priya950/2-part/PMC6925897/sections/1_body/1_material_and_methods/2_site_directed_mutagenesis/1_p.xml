<p id="Par12">The pHW-PR8-NS plasmid, encoding the NS segment of the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus, was used as a starting point. PCR with primers featuring incompletely overlapping sequences was used to introduce mutations, as described by Zheng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The primers used for PCR site-directed mutagenesis are listed (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Mutations were first introduced into the 82–148 region, then into the 497–564 region. Four plasmid variants were obtained, and modifications were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing [
