<p id="Par18">MDCK or A549 monolayers (overnight confluent, 48-well plate format, triplicates) were infected with assembled viruses at moi = 10. After virus adsorption at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and replaced with serum free medium containing antibiotic-antimycotic and TPCK-trypsin. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods and then fixed with 80% acetone in DPBS (ice cold at application) for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (PBST) and blocked with 5% milk in PBST for 6 h at 4 °C. After 2 washes, plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight with mouse polyclonal serum raised against recombinant NS1
 <sub>(1–124)</sub> protein. Plates were then washed three times with PBST, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) was added (1 μg/ml final), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Immunoreactivities were analyzed by adding TMB Peroxidase EIA Substrate (Bio-Rad), and reactions were stopped with 2 N H

 <sub>4</sub>. Optical density was measured at 450 nm with removal of noise (measured at 655 nm) using a CLARIOstar multi-function reader (BMG Labtech).
