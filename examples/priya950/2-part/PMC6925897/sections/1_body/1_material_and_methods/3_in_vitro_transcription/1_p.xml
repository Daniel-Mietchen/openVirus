<p id="Par13">RNA fragments of NS regions 82–148 and 496–564 were prepared by in vitro transcription. At first, PCR products containing the regions of interest were amplified from modified pHW-PR8-NS plasmids, and T7 promoter sequences were added via the primers used (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Next, RNA regions were synthesized by T7 RNA Polymerase (Promega, #P207B) according to the enzyme manufacturer’s instructions. Following RNA synthesis, template DNA was removed by subsequent digestion with DNase (Promega, #M6101). Transcripts were purified by double isopropanol precipitation [
