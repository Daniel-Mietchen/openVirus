<p id="Par10">The influenza A virus (IAV) poses a serious threat to human health. Despite significant progress in surveillance and control measures, including the development of antiviral drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, IAV continues to evolve and cause epidemics. IAV belongs to the 
 <italic>Ortomyxoviridae</italic> family, and its genome consists of eight segments of negative sense RNA which encode more than 17 proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The smallest segment (NS) encodes two proteins (NS1, NEP), and the switch between corresponding ORFs is regulated by mRNA splicing. NEP is a multi-functional nuclear export protein implicated in mediating the export of vRNPs from the host cell nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NS1 is a protein involved in multiple virus-host interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and a key function is to antagonize the cell’s interferon system, thereby preventing an innate immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. NS1 is actively expressed early in infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and genetically-engineered deletions in the NS1 open reading frame result in virus attenuation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The level of NS1 expression in infected cells varies between IAV strains. The virus from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1), is characterized by a high level of NS1 protein expression, while other strains often feature more moderate NS1 expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) NS mRNAs are less efficiently spliced in comparison to other influenza viruses; this may be associated with higher NS1 protein production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The formation of stable secondary structures in NS (+) RNA has been demonstrated earlier by several research groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Two regions, corresponding to RNA positions 82–148 and 497–564, are located near splice sites and form stable RNA secondary structures. It has been predicted that the type of these structures can vary between influenza A virus strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The first region (82–148) forms multi-branch or stem-loop structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while the second region (497–564) has a tendency to fold into pseudoknot or stem-loop structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been noted that highly virulent avian H5N1 influenza viruses which appeared after the 2005 outbreak carry stable, energetically-favored, hairpin structures in the second region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other researchers have shown that mutant influenza A viruses with altered RNA structure in the second region display changes in NS mRNA splicing and viral replication in cell culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this research, we analyzed the roles in NS1 protein expression and viral reproduction in vitro of mutations that influence conserved RNA secondary structures located in two NS regions.
