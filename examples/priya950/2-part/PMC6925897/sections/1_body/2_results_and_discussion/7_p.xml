<p id="Par27">We also determined NS1 mRNA levels in cells during the first hours of infection by quantitative RT-PCR. Cells were infected at moi = 1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell, and total RNA was extracted at 1–5 h.p.i. for MDCK and 3–8 h.p.i. for A549 cells. NS1 mRNA accumulated more rapidly for MDCK cells than for A549 cells (100 vs 30-fold difference from 3 h.p.i. to 5 h.p.i.) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although small differences were observed between viruses at some time points, they did not exceed 2-fold; as such, they were interpreted as biologically insignificant. To address the possibility that NS1 protein expression may also be connected to changes in NS mRNA splicing efficiency, we checked the NEP/NS1 mRNA ratio. The data obtained agreed with work previously reported by Huang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and showed that NEP mRNA levels ranged from 20 to 40% of the NS1 mRNA level, with no significant differences seen between viruses (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2). Thus, we did not observe changes in splicing that should significantly affect NS1 mRNA level or NS1 protein expression.
