<p id="Par29">Although we sought from the outset to clarify the effects (joint or individual) of both conserved hairpins in NS RNA, the data do not reveal any obvious influences attributable to structure in the second region. Our interest in the effects of secondary structure in the second region (497â€“564) was especially provoked by earlier work showing that highly virulent H5N1 avian strains tend to possess a stable stem-loop structure in the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, alterations of RNA structures in the second region have been shown to lead to changes in NS mRNA splicing and attenuated viral replication in cell culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, secondary structure at the second region may be involved in processes distinct from regulation of NS1 protein expression, yet still contributing to viral pathogenesis. Thus, a joint influence, arising from both regions of NS RNA secondary structure, should not be ruled out. Further study is needed to precisely determine the individual and joint roles of these structures.
