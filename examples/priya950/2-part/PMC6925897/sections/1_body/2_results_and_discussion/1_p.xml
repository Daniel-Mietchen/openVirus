<p id="Par21">RNA secondary structures at NS nucleotide regions 82–148 and 497–564 have been previously predicted for a large number of influenza A viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In order to investigate whether these secondary structures are indeed involved in viral replication or NS1 protein production, we chose sequences from A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1)and A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) pathogenic influenza virus strains characterized by NS (+) RNA hairpin structure in the 82–148 and 497–564 regions, respectively. Based on our previous RNA structure analysis of human influenza A viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we chose mutations that change hairpin structures in both regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the 82–148 region we introduced two synonymous mutations: G123A and A132G. In order to change hairpin structure in the 497–564 NS (+) RNA region, we introduced three nucleotide substitutions(G511A, G512A and C537G) that lead to one amino acid mutation in the NS1 open reading frame (G166 N) and two mutations in the NEP ORF (V14 M and A22G) (Additional file
