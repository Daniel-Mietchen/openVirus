  <p>Infectious activity of assembled viruses featuring different NS RNA structures after their rescue by the reverse genetics technique</p>
  <p>Viruses are: “1–1” - hairpin in regions 1 and 2; “1–0” - hairpin at region 1; “0–1” - hairpin at region 2; and “0–0” - without hairpins. Assembled virus titers were determined 72 h post transfection in Vero cell culture. Error bars represent mean ± s.d (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 in two independent experiments). Differences were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test
