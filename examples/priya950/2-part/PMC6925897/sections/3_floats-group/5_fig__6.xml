  <p>Relative NS1 mRNA expression levels, by RT-qPCR, in cells infected by assembled viruses featuring different NS RNA structures</p>
  <p>MDCK (
   <bold>a</bold>) or A549 (
   <bold>b</bold>) cell cultures were infected at moi = 1 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell, and NS1 mRNA was measured at the indicated time points. NS1 expression was normalized to GAPDH and presented relative to the “reference sample” (virus “1–1” at the first time point). Error bars represent geometric mean ± 95% CI
