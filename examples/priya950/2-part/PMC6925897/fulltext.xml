The importance of RNA structures has been demonstrated in the life cycle of RNA-containing viruses, including the influenza virus. At least two regions of conserved secondary structure in NS segment (+) RNA are predicted to vary among influenza virus strains with respect to thermodynamic stability; both fall in the NS1 open reading frame. The NS1 protein is involved in multiple virus-host interaction processes, and its main function is to inhibit the cellular immune response to viral infection. Using a reverse genetics approach, four influenza virus strains were constructed featuring mutations that have different effects on RNA secondary structure. Growth curve experiments and ELISA data show that, at least in the first viral replication cycle, mutations G123A and A132G affecting RNA structure in the (82&#x02013;148) NS RNA region influence NS1 protein expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>NS gene</kwd><kwd>RNA secondary structure</kwd><kwd>RNA hairpin</kwd><kwd>NS1 protein</kwd><kwd>Reverse genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Russian Science Foundation (RU)</institution></funding-source><award-id>18-74-00130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sergeeva</surname><given-names>Mariia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">The influenza A virus (IAV) poses a serious threat to human health. Despite significant progress in surveillance and control measures, including the development of antiviral drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, IAV continues to evolve and cause epidemics. IAV belongs to the <italic>Ortomyxoviridae</italic> family, and its genome consists of eight segments of negative sense RNA which encode more than 17 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The smallest segment (NS) encodes two proteins (NS1, NEP), and the switch between corresponding ORFs is regulated by mRNA splicing. NEP is a multi-functional nuclear export protein implicated in mediating the export of vRNPs from the host cell nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NS1 is a protein involved in multiple virus-host interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and a key function is to antagonize the cell&#x02019;s interferon system, thereby preventing an innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. NS1 is actively expressed early in infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and genetically-engineered deletions in the NS1 open reading frame result in virus attenuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The level of NS1 expression in infected cells varies between IAV strains. The virus from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1), is characterized by a high level of NS1 protein expression, while other strains often feature more moderate NS1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) NS mRNAs are less efficiently spliced in comparison to other influenza viruses; this may be associated with higher NS1 protein production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The formation of stable secondary structures in NS (+) RNA has been demonstrated earlier by several research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Two regions, corresponding to RNA positions 82&#x02013;148 and 497&#x02013;564, are located near splice sites and form stable RNA secondary structures. It has been predicted that the type of these structures can vary between influenza A virus strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The first region (82&#x02013;148) forms multi-branch or stem-loop structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while the second region (497&#x02013;564) has a tendency to fold into pseudoknot or stem-loop structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been noted that highly virulent avian H5N1 influenza viruses which appeared after the 2005 outbreak carry stable, energetically-favored, hairpin structures in the second region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other researchers have shown that mutant influenza A viruses with altered RNA structure in the second region display changes in NS mRNA splicing and viral replication in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Vero, MDCK, or A549 cells were infected at low multiplicity of infection (moi&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), and the titers of viral progeny (from infected cell supernatants) were determined at 24, 36, 48, and 72&#x02009;h post infection (h.p.i). No significant differences were identified between the viruses as a function of NS gene RNA structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The only difference seen was between host cell types; infection in A549 cells developed more slowly, as indicated by the lower TCID<sub>50</sub> values for the first time point. Despite the observed uniformity of multi-cycle infection, the fact that viruses with various NS RNA structures differed from each other by infectious activity after transfection, led us to theorize that RNA structure may be important in the early stages of infection. Therefore, we continued our research, yet limiting ourselves to the first infection cycle.

Cell cultures were infected at high dose (moi&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), and cell samples were fixed every 2&#x02009;h for evaluation of NS1 expression by ELISA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We observed that NS1 levels were significantly higher at 6&#x02009;h.p.i. for viruses 1&#x02013;1 and 1&#x02013;0, both of which feature a hairpin-type secondary structure in the first NS region. The reduced NS1 protein expression/accumulation observed is likely due to the role of the structures designed (via mutations G123A and A132G in the 82&#x02013;148 NS RNA region). We cannot, however, definitively rule out that the primary changes (DNA/RNA substitutions) may play some kind of role. The type of structure in the second region had no obvious effect. Observations were similar in MDCK cells and A549 cells.

Cells were infected at moi&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell, and total RNA was extracted at 1&#x02013;5&#x02009;h.p.i. for MDCK and 3&#x02013;8&#x02009;h.p.i. for A549 cells. NS1 mRNA accumulated more rapidly for MDCK cells than for A549 cells (100 vs 30-fold difference from 3&#x02009;h.p.i. to 5&#x02009;h.p.i.) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although small differences were observed between viruses at some time points, they did not exceed 2-fold; as such, they were interpreted as biologically insignificant. To address the possibility that NS1 protein expression may also be connected to changes in NS mRNA splicing efficiency, we checked the NEP/NS1 mRNA ratio. The data obtained agreed with work previously reported by Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and showed that NEP mRNA levels ranged from 20 to 40% of the NS1 mRNA level, with no significant differences seen between viruses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2). Thus, we did not observe changes in splicing that should significantly affect NS1 mRNA level or NS1 protein expression.

NS1 expression was normalized to GAPDH and presented relative to the &#x0201c;reference sample&#x0201d; (virus &#x0201c;1&#x02013;1&#x0201d; at the first time point).

This result fits with previously published research wherein disruption of the 82&#x02013;148 hairpin resulted in decreased NS1 protein expression in plasmid transfection experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Here, we confirm that the effect also takes place in vitro during viral infection. Our data also supports the suggestion that the RNA hairpin of the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (hairpin in first region) may promote the production of higher NS1 protein levels, potentially determining the pathogenic properties of that strain. Thus, we consider the hairpin RNA structure in the first NS mRNA region as a potential upregulator of NS1 expression.</p><p id="Par29">Although we sought from the outset to clarify the effects (joint or individual) of both conserved hairpins in NS RNA, the data do not reveal any obvious influences attributable to structure in the second region. Our interest in the effects of secondary structure in the second region (497&#x02013;564) was especially provoked by earlier work showing that highly virulent H5N1 avian strains tend to possess a stable stem-loop structure in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, alterations of RNA structures in the second region have been shown to lead to changes in NS mRNA splicing and attenuated viral replication in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, secondary structure at the second region may be involved in processes distinct from regulation of NS1 protein expression, yet still contributing to viral pathogenesis. Thus, a joint influence, arising from both regions of NS RNA secondary structure, should not be ruled out. Further study is needed to precisely determine the individual and joint roles of these structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
