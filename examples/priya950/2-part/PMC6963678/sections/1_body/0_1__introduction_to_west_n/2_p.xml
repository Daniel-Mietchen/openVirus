<p>WNV is cytolytic and induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types including neurons, resulting in illness in a range of vertebrate hosts including humans, horses, and birds. In humans, infections with WNV are either asymptomatic or can lead to life-threatening neuroinvasive diseases. Despite intensive laboratory and clinical research in the last 20 years, there are still no approved vaccines or antivirals available for human use, and supportive care remains the standard. Here, we review the current understanding of WNV epidemiology, clinical manifestations, protective immune responses, mechanisms of neuroinvasion and neuropathogenesis, and provide immunotherapeutic implications.</p>
