<p>WNV has become a major global health concern in the past 20 years and its geographic range now includes six of seven continents. Basic and clinical research has made great progress in understanding WNV biology, transmission, host immune responses, neuroinvasion, and immunopathogenesis. However, no specific therapy or vaccine has been approved for human use and supportive care remains the standard. Merging the current knowledge of post-infectious immune-mediated pathogenesis is critical to navigating therapeutic implications and treatment strategies that control this immunological cascade have already proven beneficial in clinical patient management. Appropriate clinical trials to confirm this therapeutic benefit are needed. Notwithstanding, future research must still be directed at further understanding of the pathogenesis of WNV infection, both in animal models and humans, that will aid in the development of novel and effective therapeutics and vaccine candidates.</p>
