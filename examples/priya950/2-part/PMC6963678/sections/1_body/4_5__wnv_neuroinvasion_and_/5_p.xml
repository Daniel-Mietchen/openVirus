<p>Histopathologic analysis of brain and spinal cord tissues from patients with neuroinvasive diseases showed perivascular inflammation, microglial nodules, neuronophagia, and variable necrosis and neuronal loss [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These changes were prominent in deep nuclei of the brain and anterior horns of the spinal cord. Focal demyelination, gliosis, and occasional perivascular infiltrates were also observed among patients with prolonged clinical courses [

 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Severe degenerative changes in the spinal nerves and to a lesser degree the dorsal root ganglion was also observed in patients who succumbed to neuroinvasive disease [
 <xref rid="B156-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Others have shown that receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) could also be activated by HMGB1 released from WNV infected cells undergoing necrotic cell death [

 <xref rid="B158-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The spinal nerves exhibited swollen axons surrounded with a thin layer of myelin sheath as well as degenerating axons with disrupted myelin sheaths. The astrocytic protein S100B co-localized to these myelin layers and showed an overall increase in S100B immunoreactivity in the WNV compared to the control specimens, which may lead to RAGE mediated damage at other unaffected regions [
