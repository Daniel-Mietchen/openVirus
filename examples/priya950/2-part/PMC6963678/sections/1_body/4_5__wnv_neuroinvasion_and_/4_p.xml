 <italic>Neuropathogenesis:</italic> WNV-mediated death of infected cells can occur by either necrosis or apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B148-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. In cultured Vero cells, a high multiplicity of infection (M.O.I) is followed by necrosis; whereas a low M.O.I results in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B147-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Studies have shown that both capsid protein and activation of immune cells such as CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells can induce apoptosis in neurons through the activation of mitochondrial/caspase-9 and caspase-3 pathways during WNV infection [

 <xref rid="B147-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. In WNV-infected mice, apoptotic neurons are prominent in the spinal cord but rare in the brain, suggesting that the mechanisms of WNV induced cell death may differ within specific regions of the CNS [
 <xref rid="B128-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In the CNS, WNV infects neurons, basal ganglia, brainstem and spinal cord [
 <xref rid="B140-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], while in cell culture WNV infects both neurons and astrocytes, although with differing kinetics [
 <xref rid="B149-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Infection of microglial cells results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-Î±), and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5) [
 <xref rid="B150-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Infected neurons and astrocytes also produce chemokines including CXCL10 and CCL5, which may play a critical role in the recruitment of virus-specific T cells into the CNS [
