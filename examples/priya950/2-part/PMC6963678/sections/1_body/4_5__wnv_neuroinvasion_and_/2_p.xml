<p>WNV replication in the peripheral organs and the blood cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, generates viremia in the blood circulation that may lead to infection in the CNS. WNV infection in the CNS can result in meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, including WNV poliomyelitis. The possible mechanisms by which WNV enters the CNS include: ① WNV infection induces the expression of TNF-α, MIF, MMP9, ICAM-1 and Opn, which directly or indirectly increase the permeability of the BBB allowing the virus to penetrate to the CNS; ② WNV may infect endothelial cells in the cerebral microvasculature, from which progeny viruses may be released into the CNS; ③ WNV may enter the CNS from infected olfactory bulbs via olfactory neurons; ④ WNV-infected leukocytes, such as neutrophils via a “Trojan horse” transport of WNV to the CNS; and ⑤ WNV may be transported to the CNS through the infected peripheral nerves. In the CNS, WNV may infect neurons, microglia, and astrocytes producing cytokines and chemokines and leading to inflammation, neuron apoptosis and necrosis. Some molecules including IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, S100B, IL-17A and OPN, remain persistently elevated in the blood for months after clearance of WNV from the body, which can lead to a post-infectious pro-inflammatory state that may promote autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis.
