<p>The BBB, composed of endothelial cell tight junctions and astrocyte extensions, poses an obstacle for the entry of pathogens into the brain [
 <xref rid="B130-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. However, neurotropic viruses are capable of crossing the BBB and causing inflammation and neuronal death in the CNS. In mice, WNV induces systemic infection and then crosses the BBB, leading to neuronal infection and damage [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B132-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. It has been shown that TNF-α receptor-1 signaling and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, or CD54) and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) are vital for the transient BBB permeabilization upon WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B132-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>,
 <xref rid="B133-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. In addition, a study on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus) infection indicated that the virus initially enters the CNS through the olfactory pathway and initiates viral replication in the brain, which induces the opening of the BBB, allowing a second wave of virus from the periphery to enter the brain [
 <xref rid="B134-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. While the initial site of WNV entry into the CNS is still debatable, the rostral-caudal spread of WNV antigen from the olfactory bulb to the remaining structures of the brain has been reported [
 <xref rid="B135-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Our results in mice also support this notion because olfactory bulbs have been observed to have more WNV antigens than other brain regions by immunostaining in the early time points of CNS infection [
 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], suggesting olfactory bulbs are a possible route of WNV entry into the CNS bypassing the BBB. In contrast, WNV antigen localizing to the olfactory lobes in horses and humans is rare [
 <xref rid="B138-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], and viral antigen is primarily seen in mid to hindbrain and spinal cord [
 <xref rid="B139-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. These non-comparable results may be due to postmortem delays or inconsistent sampling of the olfactory bulb in these hosts [
 <xref rid="B138-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Moreover, infected T cells and macrophages have been suggested carriers of WNV into the CNS [
 <xref rid="B141-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="B143-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], however, our results demonstrated that WNV replicates more efficiently in human and mouse polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) than in macrophages [
 <xref rid="B77-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In mice, PMNs are recruited into the brain at an early stage of WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In addition, clinical data also showed that PMNs were the predominant infiltrating leukocytes into the CNS of patients at the early stage of WNV neuroinvasive disease [
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Our recent results show that WNV-infected neutrophils contribute to the viral burden in the mouse brain, suggesting neutrophils could play a major “Trojan horse” role in transporting WNV into the CNS [
 <xref rid="B78-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, it is possible that some of the neutrophils were infected after they arrived in the CNS.
