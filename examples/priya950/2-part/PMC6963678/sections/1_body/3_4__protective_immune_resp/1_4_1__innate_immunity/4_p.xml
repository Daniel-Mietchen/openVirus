 <italic>Dendritic cell and macrophage:</italic> Mosquito transmitted WNV infection begins in the skin, and the virus replicates initially in keratinocytes and Langerhans cells (LCs), skin resident dendritic cells (DCs). After being activated by the WNV antigens, LCs can migrate to the draining lymph node, leading to T-cell priming. In a murine model of dermal WNV infection, bone marrow-derived monocytes infiltrate the skin, cluster near infected fibroblasts and then differentiate into DCs [

 <xref rid="B69-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Interestingly, signaling of type I IFN has been shown to decrease in DCs from aged donors infected with WNV, which could partially explain the more severe WNV infections in elderly patients [
 <xref rid="B67-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, type I IFN produced from DCs may fail to activate the proinflammatory function of iNKTs, a type of natural killer T cell specifically contributing to antiviral response [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Type I IFN may also diminish DC maturation, reduce production of IL-1β, and weaken antiviral T cell immunity in AXL receptor tyrosine kinase deficient (
