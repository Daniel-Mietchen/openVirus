 <italic>Natural Killer (NK) cell:</italic> NK cells are important innate immune cells to control viral infection and cancer. NK cells are able to kill virally infected cells by inducing apoptosis of the target cells that are missing major-histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I by releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes as well as producing inflammatory cytokines that limit infection [

Although NK cells can be activated and recruited in the CNS following WNV infection in mice, and they have been shown to lyse WNV-infected cell lines in vitro suggesting a protective role, NK cells seem to fail to kill WNV-infected mouse astrocytes [

In addition, depletion of NK cells from circulation of mice either by using an antibody against NK1.1 or in the Ly49a transgenic strain of mice also failed to alter the susceptibility to WNV infection, suggesting NK cells may not have a primary role in controlling WNV infection and disease in mice [
 <xref rid="B82-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In contrast, human NK cells can be activated and able to inhibit WNV infection of Vero cells through both cytolytic and noncytolytic activities [
 <xref rid="B83-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Specific subsets of human NK cells have been shown to mount a robust response to WNV infection, resulting in cytolytic activity, cytokine secretion, and chemokine secretion in vitro [
 <xref rid="B84-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Some flaviviruses including WNV, have developed mechanisms to evade the NK cell response, and the lack of NK protection in mice may be due to WNV suppressing or bypassing the NK response. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that blocking the viral evasion process and reinforcing NK cell function might lead to improved control and accelerated clearance of the viral infection [
