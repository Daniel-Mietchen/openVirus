<p>Mammalian cell PRRs recognize the PAMPs of WNV and induce type I IFN productions during the early stages of WNV infection. Experimental mice with genetic defects in the receptor for IFN-α/β (IFN-α/βR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice with 129Sv/Ev and C57BL/6J background) show markedly enhanced viral accumulation in various tissues, leading to rapid lethality [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The induced IFN restricts WNV viral replication, however, WNV has evolved to counter IFN function at multiple steps of the induction and signaling cascade [

 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In addition, WNV is resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN in cell culture once infection is established, which may explain the relatively narrow therapeutic window for IFN administration that has been observed in animal models or humans infected with WNV [
