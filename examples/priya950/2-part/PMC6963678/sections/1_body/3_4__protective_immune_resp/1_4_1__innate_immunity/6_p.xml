 <italic>Neutrophil:</italic> Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in human blood and the first immune cells to arrive at the site of infection. In combating microbial pathogens, neutrophils can engulf pathogens, produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, release granules containing proteolytic enzymes and antimicrobial peptides, and extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [

Neutrophils can serve as reservoirs for WNV replication and dissemination in the early stages of infection but contribute to WNV clearance later in the infection process [
