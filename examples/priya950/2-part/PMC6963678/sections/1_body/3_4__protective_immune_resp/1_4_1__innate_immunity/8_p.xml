 <italic>Gamma-Delta T cell:</italic> γδ T cells are small subsets of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that respond rapidly to microbial antigens without requiring antigen processing and MHC presentation of peptide epitopes and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-17. γδ T cells have been documented to play unique roles in many microbial infections, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and immunoregulation. Both protective and pathogenic roles of γδ T cells have been indicated during WNV infection. In mouse models, both γδ T cell-deficient (TCRδ
 <sup>−/−</sup>) mice and mice depleted of Vγ1+ cells, a subset of γδ T cells, had elevated viremia and more severe encephalitis compared to the wild-type (WT) control mice, which may be due to the reduced IFN-γ production in these animals [

 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In addition to IFN-γ, γδ T cells have also been suggested to contribute to regulate intracellular perforin levels against WNV in the periphery αβ T cells [

 <sup>+</sup> cells in mice resulted in lower levels of viremia, encephalitis, and mortality rates following WNV infection. The pathogenic effects of Vγ4+ cells are mediated via the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β. TNF-α has been shown to compromise the integrity of the BBB and facilitate WNV entry into the brain [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been shown to play a negative role in controlling WNV infection in mice [
 <xref rid="B88-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Vγ4
 <sup>+</sup> cell-depleted mice had reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-10, accompanied by a decreased viral load in the brain and a lower mortality rate to WNV encephalitis [
 <xref rid="B89-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In addition, Vγ4+ cells negatively regulate Vγ1
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses via the production of TGF-β during WNV infection [
