<p>The innate immune system serves as the first line of host defense against infections. It detects viral infection through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs). There are three distinct classes of PRRs in recognizing viruses, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). While TLRs are membrane-associated sensors, either on the cell membrane or in the endosome, RLRs and NLRs detect viruses in the cytoplasm. TLRs recognize viral nucleic acids and other viral components, such as TLR3 and TLR7/8 recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) respectively, to trigger the production of interferon I (FN) and other cytokines. WNV has an ssRNA genome but makes dsRNA intermediates while its genomic RNA is replicating, and thus can be recognized by TLR3 [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our research has demonstrated that TLR7 signaling plays a protective role against WNV infection in mouse models by triggering IL-23 mediated immune cell infiltration into the CNS [

 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although TLR8 may not directly sense WNV RNA, it interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and restrains TLR7 mediated antiviral immunity in mice [
