 </italic> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system in that they provide help to B cell for antibody production and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to kill the cells infected with intracellular pathogens. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have been documented to have both indirect and direct roles in defense against WNV infection. Infection of mice that lack CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells either by antibody depletion or genetic deficiencies in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and MHC class II resulted in a prolonged WNV infection in the CNS that culminated in uniform lethality by 50 days after infection. CD4 deficient mice exhibited significant low levels of IgG and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T compared to WT control mice, indicating an indirect protective role of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell during primary WNV infection by sustaining antibody production and effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that allow rapid viral clearance [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells may also play a direct role in limiting WNV replication by producing IFN-γ, IL-2 and granzyme B, and lysing target cells both in vitro and in vivo [

 <xref rid="B123-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Regulatory T cell (Treg) is a subset of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that can suppress effector T cells to prevent or control reactivity to self or non-self antigens, and to blunt inflammation. However, studies in human and mouse models have shown that Tregs appeared to play a protective role in limiting WNV disease. Tregs expanded significantly in the peripheral after WNV infection in both humans and mice. In humans, the Treg frequencies were lower in the symptomatic donors than the asymptomatic donors. In parallel prospective studies in mice, symptomatic WNV-infected mice also developed lower Treg frequencies compared with asymptomatic mice after infection and Treg-deficient mice developed lethal WNV infection at a higher rate than the controls [
 <xref rid="B124-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In addition, Treg-dependent production of TGF-β results in increased expression of CD103 on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen and brain, indicating that Tregs are essential to maintain the resident memory T cells post-WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B125-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Furthermore, innate immune signaling TLR7 seemed to positively regulate Treg expansion, while intrinsic MAVS signaling, the signaling adaptor for RNA helicases such as RIG-I, was dispensable for Treg proliferation and suppressive capacity during WNV infection in mice [
