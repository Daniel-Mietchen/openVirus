 <italic>WNV fever and neuroinvasive disease:</italic> WNV infection in humans can result in a spectrum of diseases ranging from a febrile illness classified by the CDC as WNV fever to severe neuroinvasive disease classified as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis variant) [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Before 1996, WNV was primarily known to cause febrile illness, now classified by the CDC as WNV fever and often described as a “summer flu” associated with fever, chills, malaise, headache, backache, myalgias, arthralgias, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), and maculopapular rash. By definition, neurological symptoms (neuroinvasion) do not occur in WNV fever patients and most recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can persist for weeks or months [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since 2002, approximately half of reported cases have been classified as WNV fever and half as neuroinvasive disease. For example, in the WNV epidemic of 2012, of the 5387 reported WNV cases nationwide, 2734 (51%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease cases and 2653 (49%) as non-neuroinvasive disease cases [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], cognitive-behavioral impairment and irreversible sensorineural deafness [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and kidney diseases [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Symptoms of neuroinvasive disease include high fever, worsening headache, neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity), confusion, stupor, tremors, seizures, muscle weakness or paralysis, and focal neurological deficits. About 1 in 10 people who develop severe CNS illness die [
