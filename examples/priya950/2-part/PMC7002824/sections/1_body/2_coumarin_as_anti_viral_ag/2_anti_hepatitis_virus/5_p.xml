<p id="p0045">Resembling many of the currently used anti-viral drugs which act on polymerase components of virus to inhibit its replication, NS5B, a hepatitis C virus polymerase is a novel target for newly synthesized coumarin derivative 6,8-diallyl-5,7-dihydroxycoumarin. This compound was found to act as anti-viral by binding in thumb pocket-1 (TP-1) of NS5B and inhibit the viral polymerase activity [

In this report, a synthesized derivative of anilinocoumarins having OMe as a strong electron-donating substituent, showed enhanced anti-HCV activity by targeting host factors of the IFN pathway [

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These compounds were found to inhibit hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepA2 cells. Their analogues were synthesized using hydrogenation, methylation and epoxidation reactions by Chung-Ren Su et.al in 2008 and their potency as anti-HBV was studied. They have observed that analogues of pyranocoumarin consisting of dimethylallyl or dimethylpropyl side chain along with functional groups attached to pyran ring, were showing the highest anti-HBV activity becoming a potential future candidate to be anti-HBV drug [
