 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In 2001 Okamoto and co-workers found coumarin, a probable model chemical to bring shift in the hypercarcinogenic state of the liver to a hypocarcinogenic state which was detected by lower levels of plasma ALT by using mouse liver injury models [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Benzimidazole-coumarin conjugates were synthesized by connecting benzimidazole and coumarin derivatives with methylenethio linker. Their role as anti-hepatitis C virus agents was evaluated by studying its effect on HCV replication and proliferation in Huh 5-2 cells. Two of these conjugates, 2-[(6_-bromocoumarin-3_-yl) methylenethio]-5-fluorobenzimidazole and its derivative 1-[(2__,3__,4__,6__-tetra-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl) glucopyranos-1__-yl]-2-[(6_-bromocoumarin-3_-yl) methylenethio] benzimidazole inhibited HCV RNA replication up to 90% exhibiting a potential anti-HCV activity [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another case new conjugates were synthesized by attaching coumarin with naphthalene moiety and by adding benzimidazole with 5,6-benzocoumarin, these compounds displayed a remarkable anti-viral activity, mechanism of action of which still needs further studies [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Likewise, various heterobicycle-coumarin conjugates were synthesized using -SCH2- linker and their structure-activity relationship was studied for measuring their anti-hepatitis potential [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In similar manner, conjugates of coumarin attached with purine ribofuranosides found to inhibit the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in the Huh 5-2 cells [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These studies displayed the essentiality of the scaffold in the form of heterobicycles and other aromatic rings on coumarin in their inhibitory activity against HCV [
