Vaccination represents the most effective strategy to prevent such infections and/or to reduce viral disease. Two major types of influenza vaccines are approved for human use: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Two Master Donor Virus (MDV) backbones have been used to create LAIVs against influenza A virus (IAV): the United States (US) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA) and the Russian A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Len) H2N2 viruses. The mutations responsible for the temperature sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>), cold-adapted (<italic>ca</italic>) and attenuated (<italic>att</italic>) phenotypes of the two MDVs have been previously identified and genetically mapped. However, a direct comparison of the contribution of these residues to viral attenuation, immunogenicity and protection efficacy has not been conducted. Here, we compared the In vitro and in vivo phenotype of recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) viruses containing the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> mutations of the US (PR8/AA) and the Russian (PR8/Len) MDVs. Our results show that PR8/Len is more attenuated in vivo than PR8/AA, although both viruses induced similar levels of humoral and cellular responses, and protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our findings support the feasibility of using a different virus backbone as MDV for the development of improved LAIVs for the prevention of IAV infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>live-attenuated vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-11-00928"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In the United States (US), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that influenza has caused between 9.3 and 49.0 million illnesses each year, since 2010- along with between 12,000 and 79,000 deaths annually [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Two types of influenza cause seasonal, global epidemics in human populations each year: influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IAVs can also cause sporadic pandemics of great consequences when new viruses are introduced into humans [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination is the most cost-effective approach to prevent influenza infections [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, three major influenza vaccines are approved for human use in the US: recombinant (r) hemagglutinin (HA) protein, inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IIVs are delivered by the intramuscular route and principally induce humoral responses against the viral HA protein [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], one of the major antigenic determinants of influenza viruses which is responsible for viral entry [<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, LAIVs are administrated intranasally (mimicking the natural route of infection) and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in the mucosa [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the US and the European Union, the age indication for both vaccines is different: in general, IIVs are used in children 6 months of age and in all adults; and LAIVs are used in individuals between 2 to 49 years old, with the exception of pregnant woman and/or immunocompromised people [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, since the introduction of the quadrivalent vaccine formulation during the 2013&#x02013;2014 influenza season, different studies revealed less than expected effectiveness of the LAIV and, therefore, a recommendation of the IIVs over LAIV over IIVs.</p><p>LAIVs have been generated by passaging influenza viruses at gradually reduced temperatures in eggs or cultured cells to generate temperature sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) viruses that replicate efficiently at low temperatures (cold adapted, <italic>ca</italic>) but not at elevated temperatures (temperature sensitive; <italic>ts</italic>); such viruses also possess an attenuated phenotype (<italic>att</italic>) in vivo [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The generation of these viral variants was based on the ability of influenza viruses to replicate in the upper (25&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) and lower (37 &#x000b0;C) respiratory tract (URT and LRT, respectively). LAIVs have restricted replication at non-permissive temperatures encountered in the LRT (37 &#x000b0;C&#x02013;39 &#x000b0;C) but are able to replicate efficiently at permissive temperatures encountered in the URT and nose (33 &#x000b0;C). As a consequence, they induce mucosal immunity at the site of infection (URT) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as well as robust humoral [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and cellular [<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] immunity -leading to the recruitment of influenza-specific CD8 T cells into the lungs and protection against subsequent infections [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The traditional methods for generating seasonal LAIVs is based on the co-infection of embryonated chicken eggs with a Master Donor Virus (MDV) and the seasonal virus recommended by the CDC and international health agencies to be part of the vaccine [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The viral passages are carried out at low temperatures (25&#x02013;26 &#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the reassortant virus (6 + 2) containing the six internal genes of the MDV (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) and the HA and NA from the seasonal viral strain is cloned by limited dilution in the presence of antibodies against the surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) of the MDV strain. Thus, all LAIVs share the same internal genes (derived from the MDV) and differ only in their HA and NA components. More recently, reverse genetics techniques have been used to generate seasonal LAIVs (e.g., Flumist<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Quadrivalent Vaccine, AstraZeneca).</p><p>Two approaches have been used to develop seasonal IAV LAIVs that differ in the MDV: (1) the US A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV (AA) that is commercialized under the names of FluMist in the US and Canada, and Fluenz in the European Union; and (2) the Russian A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2 LAIV (Len) that is commercialized under the names Ultravac (Russia) and Nasovac-S (India) [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and also used in China and Thailand [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the case of the US AA MDV, the mutations responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype have been mapped to PB2 (N265S), PB1 (K391E, E581G and A661T) and NP (D34G) [<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the case of the Russian Len MDV, the mutations responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype have been mapped to PB2 (V478L), PB1 (K265N and V591I) and NEP (M100I) [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Introduction of the US AA MDV mutations into the genomes of IAVs such as A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], A/canine/NY/dog23/09 H3N8 [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or A/equine/Ohio/1/03H3N8 [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] resulted in similar <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotypes as that of the original US AA MDV. However, introduction of the mutations of the US AA MDV into the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 virus (Cal/09) resulted in reduced <italic>ts</italic> and <italic>ca</italic> in vitro and limited attenuation in vivo [<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These results suggest that the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotypes induced by the mutations of the US AA MDV are influenced by the virus backbone into which they are introduced. Although some groups have generated recombinant viruses by using the internal genes of AA or the Len (with the LAIV mutations) as MDVs with different HA and NA combinations [<xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], a direct comparison of the contribution of the US and Russian MDVs residues to viral attenuation, immunogenicity and protection efficacy in the same viral genetic background has not been conducted.</p><p>Here, we compared the contribution of the mutations present in the US AA and the Russian Len MDVs using the backbone of influenza PR8 In vitro and in vivo. Our results show that PR8 containing the mutations of the Russian Len MDV (PR8/Len) is more attenuated in vivo than the PR8 containing the mutations of the US AA MVD (PR8/AA). However, both PR8/AA and PR8/Len induced similar levels of humoral and cellular responses and both induce protection against homologous (PR8, H1N1) and partially heterologous (X31, H3N2) viral challenges. Collectively, these findings support the feasibility of using the mutations of the US AA or the Russian Len MDVs in the PR8 virus backbone for the development of novel and improved LAIVs for the prevention of IAV infections. The use of circulating IAVs as MDVs in new LAIVs could grant a higher level of protection by the induction of more robust cellular immune responses against internal viral proteins (current H2N2 AA and Len LAIV backbones were isolated in 1960 and 1957, respectively). In addition, our findings have an important impact on the development and implementation of LAIVs with high levels of attenuation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-00928"><title>2.

In vitro, these mutations affected viral replication at non-permissive temperatures (37 &#x000b0;C&#x02013;39 &#x000b0;C), and the virus was attenuated in a mouse model of infection as compared to wild-type PR8 (PR8/WT) [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate if the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> mutations of the Russian Len MDV [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] resulted in a similar phenotype in the backbone of PR8 (named henceforth PR8/Len), we introduced the amino acid substitutions into PR8&#x02019;s PB2 (V478L), PB1 (K265N and V591I) and NEP (M100I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and tested them in a minigenome assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) expression levels induced by PR8/WT polymerase were similar at the three temperatures assayed (33 &#x000b0;C, 37 &#x000b0;C and 39 &#x000b0;C). In the case of cells transfected with the PR8/AA polymerase complex, GFP and Gluc expression were reduced at 37 &#x000b0;C and, more notably, at 39 &#x000b0;C in comparison with the expression levels at 33 &#x000b0;C (~ 50% and ~ 70% reduction, respectively). Likewise, GFP and Gluc expression levels in cells transfected with the PR8/Len polymerase were highly reduced at 37 &#x000b0;C and almost undetectable at 39 &#x000b0;C as compared to the levels observed at 33 &#x000b0;C.

Thus, we next evaluated which of the viral segments has a more significant impact on the temperature sensitive phenotype in PR8. Using the same minigenome approach and different combinations of PB2 and PB1 viral segments of PR8/WT, PR8/AA or PR8/Len, GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and Gluc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) expression levels were evaluated. PR8/WT polymerase activity was similar at the three tested temperatures (33 &#x000b0;C, 37 &#x000b0;C and 39 &#x000b0;C), while reporter gene expression by PR8/AA and PR8/Len polymerase complexes was reduced at 37 &#x000b0;C and, more markedly, at 39 &#x000b0;C, similar to our initial minigenome studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When PR8/AA PB2 or PB1 were combined with PR8/WT PB1 and PB2, respectively, we observed reduced GFP and Gluc expression levels at 37 &#x000b0;C and 39 &#x000b0;C as compared to those at 33 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B).

Interestingly, sera from mice vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA showed a significantly higher titer of antibodies than sera from mice immunized with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, while comparable antibody responses were detected in the sera from mice immunized with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA and 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len.</p><p>To have a more complete analysis of immune responses, we also evaluated and compared the induction of CD8 T cell responses by PR8/AA and PR8/Len (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>). To that end, groups of C57BL/6 mice (<italic>N</italic> = 5) were immunized with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, 10<sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/AA, or mock-vaccinated (PBS). At 10 days p.i., lungs and spleens were recovered and processed to collect CD8 T cells. The results showed that vaccination with both PR8 LAIVs induced NP- and PA-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,C) and the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,F). Although no statistical differences were observed when comparing the responses induced by PR8/Len versus PR8/AA (with the exception of the levels of PA-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of mice vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>C), the number of CD8 T cells in the lungs and spleen tended to be greater after vaccination with 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA than with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/Len. These results suggest that vaccination with both LAIVs elicits a robust virus-specific CD8 T cell response in the spleen and lung.</p><p>Having confirmed the immunogenicity of both LAIVs, we proceeded with challenge experiments, initially focusing on a homologous viral challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Groups of C57BL/6 mice (<italic>N</italic> = 5) were vaccinated with the same PR8 LAIVs doses used in the immunogenicity studies, or mock (PBS) vaccinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At day 15 post-vaccination, mice were challenged with 1000&#x000d7; MLD<sub>50</sub> of PR8/WT and monitored over 10 days for body weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). All mice mock vaccinated lost weight quickly and died at day 6 post-challenge. All mice vaccinated with PR8/Len (independently of the dose) and PR8/AA survived without body weight loss. These results indicate that although PR8/Len is more attenuated than PR8/AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>), it is able to confer protection against a homologous PR8 viral challenge with the same viral dose (10<sup>3</sup> FFU). Since all mice survived the challenge with PR8/WT, we cannot conclude which one of the two LAIVs (PR8/AA or PR8/Len) is more protective.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-11-00928"><title>3.5. Immune Responses and Protection Efficacy of PR8/Len and PR8/AA Against a Heterologous Viral Challenge</title><p>We next examined the humoral immune responses and the protection efficacy of PR8/Len and PR8/AA against a heterologous challenge with X31 (H3N2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Groups of C57BL/6 mice (<italic>N</italic> = 5) were vaccinated with the same PR8/Len and PR8/AA viral doses used in the homologous challenge studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Fourteen days post-vaccination, mice were bled and the presence of total antibodies against X31 were analyzed by ELISA. Sera from mice immunized with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA showed significantly higher antibody titers than sera from mice vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and, to a lower extent, than mice vaccinated with 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len. It is worth mentioning that X31 is a PR8 virus containing the HA and NA of A/Hong Kong/68 H3N2. Contrarily, the PR8 LAIVs (both AA and Len) contain their respective H1N1 glycoproteins and, therefore, the antibodies detected in the ELISA are mainly directed against internal PR8 viral proteins, which are the same in all viruses.</p><p>Then, fifteen days post-vaccination, mice were challenged with 50&#x000d7; MLD<sub>50</sub> of X31 H3N2 and monitored daily over 10 days for body weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). Mock-vaccinated mice and mice vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len lost weight and all succumbed to viral challenge with X31 at day 4 post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B). Mice vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA and 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len also lost weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) but 60% of them (in both groups) recovered and survived the X31 lethal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). These results indicate that, at the same dose, PR8/AA induces stronger immune responses and protection against a heterologous viral challenge than PR8/Len. However, induction of immune responses and protection efficacy with 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len is equivalent to that induced with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA. Altogether, these results indicate that it is necessary to vaccinate mice with a higher dose (~1 log) of PR8/Len than PR8/AA to induce the same levels of protective immunity against a heterologous challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-11-00928"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The mutations responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotypes of the two commercially available MDVs (US (AA) and Russian (Len)) have been previously described [<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. One mutation in PB2 (N265S), three substitutions in PB1 (K391E, E581G and A661T) and one amino acid change in NP (D34G) are the major contributors to the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype of US AA MDV. Mutations located in the PB2 (V478L), PB1 (K265N and V591I) and in the NEP (M100I) are responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype of the Russian Len MDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Using a bat influenza A virus polymerase structure solved by X-ray crystallography as a reference model (PDB ID 5M3H, [<xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]), which is homologous to H1N1 virus polymerase complex with greater than 80% sequence similarity (PB2: 83%, PB1: 89% and PA: 83%), the location of these mutations are identified as distal from the endonuclease catalytic site of the PA subunit and appear rather random. However, upon closer inspection, we realize many of these mutations are at or near the interface between subunits, in particular, A661T mutation present in the PB1 from US AA MDV, and V591I and K265N mutations found in the PB1 from Russian Len MDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>B,D, respectively). Therefore, we speculate that the mutations responsible for the <italic>ts</italic>, <italic>ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype may relate to their effect on polymerase complex formation, possibly affecting the stability of the complex, rather than affecting the stability of each subunit itself. Of particular note, it is interesting to see the presence of a mutation within the cap-binding domain of PB2 subunit (V478L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>C), possibly affecting its cap-snatching activity to generate a 5&#x02019;-capped primer for transcription initiation. This mutation is only found in the Russian Len MDV, and perhaps explains the difference seen in its attenuation when compared to that of US AA MDV. However, further experiments are necessary to elucidate the roles of the LAIV mutations and to gain a better mechanistic understanding of these attenuated LAIVs.</p><p>Since a direct comparison of the mutations responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotype of the US AA and the Russian Len MDVs in the same virus backbone had not been conducted, we introduced the mutations of the Russian Len MDV into PR8, and compared them to our previously described PR8 containing the US AA MDV mutations [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Using a minigenome assay, we observed that the mutations of the Russian Len MDV resulted in a greater reduction in polymerase activity at non-permissive (37&#x000ba;C and 39&#x000ba;C) temperatures compared to those of the US AA MDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained when the replicative phenotype of a recombinant PR8 containing the mutations in the PB2, PB1 and NEP of the Russian Len MDV (PR8/Len) was examined, and compared to our previously described PR8/AA [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In vitro results (multicycle growth kinetics and plaque phenotype) demonstrated that PR8/Len was more attenuated at high temperatures (37 &#x000b0;C and 39 &#x000b0;C) than PR8/AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>), similar to our minigenome results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Analogous results were obtained in vivo since PR8/Len was more attenuated than PR8/AA, with the PR8/Len MLD<sub>50</sub> being ~5&#x000d7; greater than the MLD<sub>50</sub> of PR8/AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>When we compared the ability of PR8/AA and PR8/Len to induce protective immune responses against homologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and heterologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>) viral challenges, as well as CD8T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>), we found that it was necessary to immunize mice with a ~ 1 log higher dose of PR8/Len (10<sup>4</sup> FFU) than PR8/AA (10<sup>3</sup> FFU) to reach similar levels of humoral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>) and cellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>) responses. Notably, vaccination with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len induced complete protection against a homologous challenge with PR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>), while similar levels of protection against heterologous challenge with X-31 were observed using 10x more PR8/Len than PR8/AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Although no statistically significant differences were observed in the levels of influenza-specific CD8 T cells induced with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, or 10<sup>3</sup> of PR8/AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;C), levels of positive CD8 T cells in the lungs from mice vaccinated with 10<sup>4</sup> FFU PR8/Len and 10<sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/AA were similar - and greater than those observed in mice infected with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, correlating with the level of protection against X31 challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that the mutations responsible for the <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotypes of the US AA MDV can attenuate a broad range of other influenza viral strains, including human [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], canine [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and equine [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] IAVs. Likewise, the mutations of the Russian Len MDV conferred robust <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> phenotypes in the genetic background of PR8. It remains to be determined whether this also applies to different influenza virus strains and/or subtypes. Nevertheless, our results have important implications for the development of new and improved LAIVs for the treatment of human and/or animal influenza infections. Specifically, our findings with PR8 suggest that it may be possible to update the MDV backbone of the currently available US or Russian H2N2 LAIVs by simply introducing the mutations of the Russian Len or US AA MDVs into the backbone of a more recent H1N1 (and maybe H3N2) seasonal circulating strain. However, it will be important to demonstrate that introduction of these <italic>ts, ca</italic> and <italic>att</italic> mutations results in the desired attenuated phenotype since we have previously shown that introduction of the US AA MDV mutations into the backbone of a recent pandemic Cal/09 did not resulted in an attenuated phenotype in vivo [<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources) for providing reagents.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Project was conceptualized by L.R., P.B.-L., E.C.R., T.M., A.N., A.S., D.J.T., S.D., B.K. and L.M.-S.
