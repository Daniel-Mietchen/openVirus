<p>Vaccination is the most cost-effective approach to prevent influenza infections [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, three major influenza vaccines are approved for human use in the US: recombinant (r) hemagglutinin (HA) protein, inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IIVs are delivered by the intramuscular route and principally induce humoral responses against the viral HA protein [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], one of the major antigenic determinants of influenza viruses which is responsible for viral entry [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, LAIVs are administrated intranasally (mimicking the natural route of infection) and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in the mucosa [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the US and the European Union, the age indication for both vaccines is different: in general, IIVs are used in children 6 months of age and in all adults; and LAIVs are used in individuals between 2 to 49 years old, with the exception of pregnant woman and/or immunocompromised people [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, since the introduction of the quadrivalent vaccine formulation during the 2013â€“2014 influenza season, different studies revealed less than expected effectiveness of the LAIV and, therefore, a recommendation of the IIVs over LAIV over IIVs.
