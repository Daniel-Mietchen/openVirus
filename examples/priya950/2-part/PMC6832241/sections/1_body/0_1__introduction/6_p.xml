<p>Here, we compared the contribution of the mutations present in the US AA and the Russian Len MDVs using the backbone of influenza PR8 In vitro and in vivo. Our results show that PR8 containing the mutations of the Russian Len MDV (PR8/Len) is more attenuated in vivo than the PR8 containing the mutations of the US AA MVD (PR8/AA). However, both PR8/AA and PR8/Len induced similar levels of humoral and cellular responses and both induce protection against homologous (PR8, H1N1) and partially heterologous (X31, H3N2) viral challenges. Collectively, these findings support the feasibility of using the mutations of the US AA or the Russian Len MDVs in the PR8 virus backbone for the development of novel and improved LAIVs for the prevention of IAV infections. The use of circulating IAVs as MDVs in new LAIVs could grant a higher level of protection by the induction of more robust cellular immune responses against internal viral proteins (current H2N2 AA and Len LAIV backbones were isolated in 1960 and 1957, respectively). In addition, our findings have an important impact on the development and implementation of LAIVs with high levels of attenuation.</p>
