<p>The traditional methods for generating seasonal LAIVs is based on the co-infection of embryonated chicken eggs with a Master Donor Virus (MDV) and the seasonal virus recommended by the CDC and international health agencies to be part of the vaccine [

Thus, all LAIVs share the same internal genes (derived from the MDV) and differ only in their HA and NA components. More recently, reverse genetics techniques have been used to generate seasonal LAIVs (e.g., Flumist
 <sup>®</sup> Quadrivalent Vaccine, AstraZeneca).
