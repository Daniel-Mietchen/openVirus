<p>To evaluate the presence of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies, mouse sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken) for 16 h at 37 °C and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C. Then, sera were serially 2-fold diluted (starting dilution of 1:50) in 96-well V-bottom plates and mixed 1:1 with 4 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of the indicated viruses during 30 min at RT. HAI titers were determined by adding 0.5% turkey red blood cells to the virus-Ab mixtures followed by a 30 min incubation on ice [
