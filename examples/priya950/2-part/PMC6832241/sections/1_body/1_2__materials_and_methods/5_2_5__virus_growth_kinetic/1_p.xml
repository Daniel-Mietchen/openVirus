<p>Multicycle growth kinetics were carried out by infecting MDCK cells (12-well plate format, 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) with PR8/WT, PR8/AA and PR8/Len at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. After 1 h of viral adsorption at RT, infection medium was replaced by p.i. medium and plates were incubated at different temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C). TCS were collected at the indicated times p.i. and viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/mL) in MDCK cells as indicated before [
