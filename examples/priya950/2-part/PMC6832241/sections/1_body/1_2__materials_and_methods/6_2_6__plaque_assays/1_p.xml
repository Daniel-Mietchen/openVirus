<p>Monolayers of MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected with PR8/WT, PR8/AA and PR8/Len for 1 h at RT, overlaid with agar, and incubated at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At three days p.i., cells were fixed for 1 h at RT with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and the overlays were removed. Cells were then permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at RT and immunostained using the anti-NP mAb HB-65 and Vector kits (Vectastain ABC Vector kits and DAB HRP substrate kit; Vector) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
