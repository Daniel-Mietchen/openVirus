<p>To generate PR8/Len, the PR8/WT PB2, PB1 and NS viral segments were subcloned into a pUC19 plasmid (New England BioLabs) to introduce, using site-directed mutagenesis, the mutations responsible for the 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotypes of the MDV A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2 LAIV: PB2 V478L; PB1 K265N and V591I; and NEP M100I. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT). Mutated PB2, PB1 and NS PR8/Len viral segments were subcloned from the shuttle pUC19 vector into the ambisense pDZ plasmid for virus rescue with the rest of the PR8 viral genes [
