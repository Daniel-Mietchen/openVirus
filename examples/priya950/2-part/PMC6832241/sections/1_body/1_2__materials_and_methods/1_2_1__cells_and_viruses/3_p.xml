<p>For viral infections, viral stocks were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.3% bovine albumin (BA) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (PS) (PBS/BA/PS). After 1 h viral adsorption at room temperature (RT), MDCK cells were maintained in post-infection (p.i.) DMEM media supplemented with 0.3% BA, 1% PSG, and 1 μg/mL of

 <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma). Viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (fluorescent forming units, FFU/mL) in MDCK cells at 33 °C using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against influenza virus nucleoprotein, NP (ATCC HB-65, HL16-L10-4R5); as described [
