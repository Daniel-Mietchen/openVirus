<p>Six-to-eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Rochester under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal protocols were approved by the University Committee of Animal Resources (UCAR-2014-019E, approval date 08/29/2919) and complied with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council [

 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin; 240 mg/kg of body weight) and inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 30 μL of a virus preparation containing the indicated doses of virus diluted in PBS [

 <italic>N</italic> = 6) were anesthetized and infected as described and viral titers in homogenized lungs at 2 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) and 4 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) days p.i. were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/mL) as previously described in MDCK cells at 33 °C [
