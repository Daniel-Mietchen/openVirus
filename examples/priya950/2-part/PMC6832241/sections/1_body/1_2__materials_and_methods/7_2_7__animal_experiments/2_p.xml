<p>For the vaccination and challenge experiments, 6â€“8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were anesthetized and vaccinated i.n. with the indicated doses and viruses. A group of mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) was also mock vaccinated with PBS as negative control. At fourteen days post-vaccination, mouse sera were collected by submandibular bleeding to evaluate the presence of total influenza antibodies (Abs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Twenty-four hours after bleeding, animals were challenged i.n. with the indicated dose of homologous (PR8) or heterologous (X31) WT viruses. After challenge, mice were monitored daily for 14 days for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality (survival) as described above. Viral titers in the lungs of challenged mice were also calculated (see above). In the homologous (PR8) challenge, and to compare the differences in the protection efficacy provided by PR8/AA and PR8/Len viruses, we used a high dose (1000 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of WT PR8. For the heterologous challenge, since the majority of the neutralizing antibodies induced after LAIV vaccination are directed against the viral surface HA and NA glycoproteins that are different between our vaccine PR8 viruses and the challenge X31 virus, a low viral dose (50 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) was used in these experiments.
