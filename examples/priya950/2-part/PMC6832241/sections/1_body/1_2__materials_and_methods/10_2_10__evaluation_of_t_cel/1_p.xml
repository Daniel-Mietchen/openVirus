<p>Six-to-eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (N = 5) were anesthetized and immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA or with 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, or mock- vaccinated with PBS. At 10 days p.i., lungs and spleens were collected and processed to obtain cellular preparations. Lungs were perfused with PBS before being surgically removed and dissociated in Gentle MACS (MiltenyiBiotek) C tubes using the Lung01 program. Samples were incubated in 5 mL (2 μg/mL) of Collagenase II in RPMI-1640 medium containing 8% FBS for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation every 10 min. After digestion, samples were further dissociated using the Heart01 program. Cell suspensions were filtered through 70 μm filters prior to 75:40 Percoll (GE Healthcare) discontinuous gradient separation. The top layer (containing fat and other debris) was eliminated by aspiration. The cell layer was then harvested and washed, prior to counting and staining. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from collected spleens by disruption in RPMI +8% FBS; yields were quantitated by viable cell counts using Trypan blue exclusion on a hemocytometer.
