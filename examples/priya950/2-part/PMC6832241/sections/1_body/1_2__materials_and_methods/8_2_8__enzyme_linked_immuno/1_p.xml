<p>We evaluated the levels of total virus-specific Abs in the sera of vaccinated mice by ELISA as described [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with cell lysates from mock-, PR8/WT- and X31-infected MDCK cells or with 250 ng/well of recombinant PR8 HA protein (NR-19240; BEI Resources) and incubated ON at 4 Â°C. Mouse sera were tested as two-fold dilutions (starting dilution of 1:50) and titers determined as described [
