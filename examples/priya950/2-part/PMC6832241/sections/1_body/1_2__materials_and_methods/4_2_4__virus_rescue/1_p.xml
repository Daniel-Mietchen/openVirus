 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, co-cultures (1:1) of HEK293T and MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were co-transfected in suspension, using Lipofectamine 2000, with 1 μg of the eight-ambisense PR8 pDZ-PB2-Len, -PB1-Len, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -M, and -NS-Len plasmids. At 12 h p.t., medium was replaced with p.i. medium and TCS were collected at three days p.t., clarified, and used to infect fresh monolayers of MDCK cells. After three days p.i., PR8-Len virus was plaque purified and scaled up using MDCK cells at 33 °C, as described [
