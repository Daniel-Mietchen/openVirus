<p>Based on the minigenome results using transfected cells in which Len MDV mutations induced a stronger reduction in the PR8 polymerase activity at high temperatures (37 °C and 39 °C) than those induced by the AA MDV mutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>), we next evaluated the impact of the AA and Len MDV mutations in the context of PR8 viral infections. To that end, we used reverse genetics [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to rescue a PR8/Len virus and then evaluated and compared the viral replication kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) and plaque phenotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) of PR8/Len with those of PR8/WT and our previously described PR8/AA [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] at different temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C). At 33 °C, PR8/WT reached higher viral titers than PR8/AA and PR8/Len viruses at early times (12 h and 24 h) post-infection (p.i.), but at 72 h p.i. the three viruses reached similar viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Replication of PR8/WT at 37 °C and 39 °C was similar to that observed at 33 °C. However, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], PR8/AA replication was reduced at 37 °C, and abolished at 39 °C. In the case of PR8/Len, replication was only detected at the latest time p.i. (72 h) at 37 °C, and virus was not detected at 39 °C. Likewise, the plaque phenotype of PR8/WT was similar at 33 °C and 37 °C and slightly reduced at 39 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), in agreement with the results of the growth kinetic studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). In the case of PR8/AA, both the number and the size of the plaques were reduced (37 °C), or not detected (39 °C), when compared to 33 °C. PR8/Len could only generate plaques at 33 °C, corroborating the growth kinetics results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mutations of the Russian Len MDV induce a more clear temperature sensitive phenotype in the backbone of PR8 than the mutations of the US AA MDV.
