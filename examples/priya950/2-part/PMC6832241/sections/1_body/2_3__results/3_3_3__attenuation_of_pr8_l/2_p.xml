<p>We also evaluated viral replication in the lungs of mice infected with PR8/Len and PR8/AA. To that end, groups of C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) were infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len or 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA (doses that resulted in 100% survival, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and viral replication was evaluated at days 2 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) and 4 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). No statistically significant differences were observed in lung viral titers in animals infected with PR8/Len or PR8/AA, although higher viral titers were detected in the lungs of mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len.
