<p>In our next set of experiments, we compared the virulence of both PR8 LAIVs in vivo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>). To that end, groups of C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup> and 10
 <sup>6</sup> fluorescent forming units (FFU) of PR8/AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B) or PR8/Len (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D) and monitored over 14 days p.i. for body weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C) and survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>,D). As previously described [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], mice infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> and 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU of PR8/AA showed a dramatic weight loss at early times p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), resulting in a rate of mortality of 100% at days 5 and 8 p.i., respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Two mice (40%) infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/AA lost weight and died at day 8 p.i., while mice infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA virus did not show noticeable weight loss and all of them survived infection, resulting in a theoretical 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of ~1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the case of PR8/Len (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D), all mice infected with 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU died at day 6p.i., 40% of mice survived infection with 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU and those infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU did not show body weight loss and all survived viral infection, resulting in a calculated MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of ~6.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU (i.e., ~5 fold greater attenuation than PR8/AA) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
