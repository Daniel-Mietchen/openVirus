<p>We next examined the humoral immune responses and the protection efficacy of PR8/Len and PR8/AA against a heterologous challenge with X31 (H3N2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Groups of C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were vaccinated with the same PR8/Len and PR8/AA viral doses used in the homologous challenge studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Fourteen days post-vaccination, mice were bled and the presence of total antibodies against X31 were analyzed by ELISA. Sera from mice immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA showed significantly higher antibody titers than sera from mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and, to a lower extent, than mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len. It is worth mentioning that X31 is a PR8 virus containing the HA and NA of A/Hong Kong/68 H3N2. Contrarily, the PR8 LAIVs (both AA and Len) contain their respective H1N1 glycoproteins and, therefore, the antibodies detected in the ELISA are mainly directed against internal PR8 viral proteins, which are the same in all viruses.
