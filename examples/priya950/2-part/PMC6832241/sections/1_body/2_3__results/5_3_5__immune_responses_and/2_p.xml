<p>Then, fifteen days post-vaccination, mice were challenged with 50Ã— MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of X31 H3N2 and monitored daily over 10 days for body weight loss (

 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len lost weight and all succumbed to viral challenge with X31 at day 4 post-challenge (

 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len also lost weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) but 60% of them (in both groups) recovered and survived the X31 lethal challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). These results indicate that, at the same dose, PR8/AA induces stronger immune responses and protection against a heterologous viral challenge than PR8/Len. However, induction of immune responses and protection efficacy with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len is equivalent to that induced with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA. Altogether, these results indicate that it is necessary to vaccinate mice with a higher dose (~1 log) of PR8/Len than PR8/AA to induce the same levels of protective immunity against a heterologous challenge.
