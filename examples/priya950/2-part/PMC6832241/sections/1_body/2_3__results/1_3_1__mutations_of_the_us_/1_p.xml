<p>In a previous work [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] into the PB2 (N265S) and PB1 (K391E, E581G and A661T) genes of PR8 to create a PR8 LAIV (named henceforth PR8/AA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In vitro, these mutations affected viral replication at non-permissive temperatures (37 °C–39 °C), and the virus was attenuated in a mouse model of infection as compared to wild-type PR8 (PR8/WT) [
