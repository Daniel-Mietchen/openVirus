 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] resulted in a similar phenotype in the backbone of PR8 (named henceforth PR8/Len), we introduced the amino acid substitutions into PR8’s PB2 (V478L), PB1 (K265N and V591I) and NEP (M100I) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) expression levels induced by PR8/WT polymerase were similar at the three temperatures assayed (33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C). In the case of cells transfected with the PR8/AA polymerase complex, GFP and Gluc expression were reduced at 37 °C and, more notably, at 39 °C in comparison with the expression levels at 33 °C (~ 50% and ~ 70% reduction, respectively). Likewise, GFP and Gluc expression levels in cells transfected with the PR8/Len polymerase were highly reduced at 37 °C and almost undetectable at 39 °C as compared to the levels observed at 33 °C. These results demonstrate that the mutations of the Russian Len MDV induce a more robust temperature sensitive phenotype than the mutations of the US AA MDV in the context of the viral polymerase complex of PR8.
