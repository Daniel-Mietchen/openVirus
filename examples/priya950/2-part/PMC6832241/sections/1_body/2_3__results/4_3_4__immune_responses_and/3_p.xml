<p>Having confirmed the immunogenicity of both LAIVs, we proceeded with challenge experiments, initially focusing on a homologous viral challenge (

 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were vaccinated with the same PR8 LAIVs doses used in the immunogenicity studies, or mock (PBS) vaccinated (

 <sub>50</sub> of PR8/WT and monitored over 10 days for body weight loss (

All mice vaccinated with PR8/Len (independently of the dose) and PR8/AA survived without body weight loss. These results indicate that although PR8/Len is more attenuated than PR8/AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>), it is able to confer protection against a homologous PR8 viral challenge with the same viral dose (10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU). Since all mice survived the challenge with PR8/WT, we cannot conclude which one of the two LAIVs (PR8/AA or PR8/Len) is more protective.
