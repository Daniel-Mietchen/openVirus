<p>We next evaluated and compared immune responses induced by PR8/Len and PR8/AA viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,D). Groups of C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were immunized with the same non-lethal doses of PR8/Len (10
 <sup>3</sup>/10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU) and PR8/AA (10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f004">Figure 4</xref>), or mock infected with PBS. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay results revealed a higher titer of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies in mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA than those vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, while no statistical differences were observed between the sera of mice immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Humoral immune responses were also evaluated by ELISA using cell extracts from MDCK cells infected with PR8/WT virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>C) or purified PR8 HA protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). Sera from all virus-vaccinated mice showed antibodies against total PR8 viral proteins and against the viral HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D, respectively). Interestingly, sera from mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA showed a significantly higher titer of antibodies than sera from mice immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, while comparable antibody responses were detected in the sera from mice immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len.
