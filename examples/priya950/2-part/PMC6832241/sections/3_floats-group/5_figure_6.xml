  <p>Induction of CD8 T cell responses by PR8/AA and PR8/Len viruses: Female six-to-eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were infected (i.n.) with 10
   <sup>3</sup> and 10
   <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA viruses. Mice were also mock (PBS) infected as an internal control. Ten days p.i., lungs (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) and spleens (
   <bold>D</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>) were collected and resident cells were prepared for flow cytometry. Live CD8 T cells specific for NP (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>) or PA (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) tetramers were counted. Data represent the means +/− SDs of the results for 5 individual mice. *,
