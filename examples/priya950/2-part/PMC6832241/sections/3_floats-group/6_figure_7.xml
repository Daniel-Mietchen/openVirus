  <p>Protection efficacy of PR8/AA and PR8/Len against homologous viral challenge: Six-to-eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were infected i.n. with 10
   <sup>3</sup> and 10
   <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA viruses, or mock vaccinated (PBS). At 15 days p.i., mice were challenged i.n. with 1,000 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> of PR8/WT and monitored daily over 10 days for body weight loss (
   <bold>A</bold>) and survival (
   <bold>B</bold>). Mice that lost 25% of their initial body weight were sacrificed. Data represent the means and SDs of the results determined for individual mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (
   <bold>A</bold>) and Dunnettâ€™s (
   <bold>B</bold>) tests comparing the PBS group to the other groups (* 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
