  <p>Effect of temperature on the polymerase activity of PR8/AA and PR8/Len. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of segments 1 (PB2), 2 (PB1) and 8 (NS) of PR8/WT (white, left), PR8/AA (black, middle) and PR8/Len (grey, right). Amino acid substitutions to generate PR8/AA and PR8/Len are indicated. B-C) Minigenome activity: HEK293T cells (12-well plate format, 4 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were transiently co-transfected with 250 ng of ambisense pDZ expression plasmids encoding the minimal requirements for viral genome replication and gene transcription (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) together with 500 ng of a vRNA-like expression plasmid encoding GFP (
   <bold>B</bold>) or Gluc (
   <bold>C</bold>) under the control of the human polymerase I promoter (hPol-I-GFP and -Gluc, respectively), and 100 ng of an SV40 Cluc expressing plasmid to normalize transfection efficiencies. After transfection, cells were placed at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C, and viral replication and transcription was evaluated 24 h later by GFP (
   <bold>B</bold>) and luciferase (
   <bold>C</bold>) expression. Gluc activity was normalized to that of Cluc. Data represent means and SDs of the triplicates. Normalized reporter expression is relative to that obtained in the absence of pDZ NP. Data were represented as relative activity considering the activity of each polymerase complex at 33 °C as 100%. *,
