<p id="Par26">Reported PPR outbreaks and infection studies in captive and wild ruminants have extended the known spectrum of potentially infected species to include most 
 <italic>bovidae</italic> and 
 <italic>suidae</italic>. In 2014, there were warnings of the risk of PPR infection of the saiga antelope (
 <italic>Saiga tatarica mongolica</italic>), which is a critically endangered species in central Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and since then there has been no proper actions to protect susceptible wild ruminants population from PPR outbreaks. This was followed by PPR epidemic in the small surviving population of a sub-species of saiga with extinction of more than half of the population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, the saiga catastrophes emphasized the failure of PPR eradication strategies in considering wildlife and possible virus spill over from livestock. From 2014 to 2016, more than 1000 wild goats (
 <italic>Capra aegagrus</italic>) and sheep (
 <italic>Ovis orientalis</italic>) in the northern and central provinces of Iran died from PPRV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Transmission of PPRV from infected goats to cattle has also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and PPRV antigen has been detected in camels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and even companion animals, in particular dogs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Goats and sheep are the maintenance hosts and the other hosts are apparently considered as spill over without any other reservoir populations confirmed.
