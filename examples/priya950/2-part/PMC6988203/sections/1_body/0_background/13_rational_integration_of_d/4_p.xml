<p id="Par46">Moreover, in cases of co-infections, the multiplex assays utilizing real-time amplification methods may be of value for simultaneous detection of multiple viral infections in PPR infected animals as some viruses are preferentially replicating in PPR infected hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. These assays may also detect the nucleic acid of viruses that are previously unrecognised and/or not cultivatable in vitro. Inevitably, high mutation rates in RNA viruses including PPRV can be rapidly identified using nucleic acid amplification coupled with sequencing platforms such as Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers, to curb highly emerging or reemerging virulent strains. In resource-limited countries, conventional methods are more readily replaced in virology because the tissue culture based virology methods are costly and generally less sensitive than newer molecular methods.
