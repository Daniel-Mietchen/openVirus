<p id="Par43">Despite of increased development and use of PPRV novel field-deployable diagnostic tools, diagnostics are not being integrated into disease control optimally. A comprehensible integration of diagnostic tools is essential in PPRV endemic areas. The efficient integration of diagnostics may be influenced by a multitude of factors including the existence of co-infections, clinically closely related diseases and asymptomatic cases in both wildlife and domestic animals. It is further influenced by the availability of appropriate technology and access to diagnostics, test characteristics, veterinary infrastructure and the experience and knowledge of the veterinary service providers in resource-limited settings. Regardless of the varying sensitivity and specificity of PPR diagnostic tests and prevalence of disease, it is clear that diagnostics play a valuable and critical role in early detection of PPR in infected animals with disease and those at risk of developing the disease.</p>
