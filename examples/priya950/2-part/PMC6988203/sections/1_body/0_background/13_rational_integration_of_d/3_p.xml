<p id="Par45">The characteristics of an ideal diagnostic test include accuracy wherever used; heat-stable reagents with an extended shelf life; portability; minimal technical skills for operation; rapid, sensitive, and specific results; on-demand testing capability or minimal batch sizes; cost effective tests; and suitable for a broad range of clinical samples [

This has led to the development of automated diagnostic tools. The newer automated tests using nanotechnology that no longer require the addition of multiple reagents are being used for point-of-care diagnosis. Therefore, for recognition of PPRV during early phases of the disease and for clinical samples that gave equivocal results in other tests and require re-confirmation, highly sensitive nucleic-acid-based diagnostic tests could be used [

A good number of these tests are available commercially including IC-LFDs, RT-LAMP and Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers and their uses continue to increase logarithmically and the cost of instruments and their assays continue to decrease and are becoming of high value in resource-limited nations.
