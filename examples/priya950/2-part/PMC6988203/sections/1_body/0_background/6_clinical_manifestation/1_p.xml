<p id="Par31">It takes 3–4 days before onset of clinical signs. During this incubation period, PPRV replicates in the draining lymph nodes of the oropharynx followed by spreading (via blood and lymph) to other tissues and organs including the lungs resulting in a primary viral pneumonia. The acute stage of disease is characterised by high body temperature (39.5 to 41 °C) which may last for 3–5 days [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The affected animals develop papules in the oral cavity, which become erosive and necrotic. In severe cases, these necrotic lesions occur concurrently with fibrin deposits on the tongue [

Terminally, the animal may become dyspnoeic, progressively lose weight and eventually dies. In mild infections, self-cure occurs after 10–15 days of infection. Protective immunity responsible for self-recovery is attributed to infection-induced antibodies against the haemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], although most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the H protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nucleoprotein (N) is the most abundantly transcribed gene in the host cells. For this reason, the H and N proteins are the two most preferred PPRV targets for the development of vaccine and immunodiagnostics, respectively [
