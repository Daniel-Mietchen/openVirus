<p id="Par36">PRRV isolation using primary cells (bovine, ovine and caprine kidney and lung epithelial cells) requires multiple, sequential blind passages and takes up to weeks in culture before the development of any cytopathic effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The quality of primary cells is not guaranteed due to the presence of endogenous virus and there is considerable batch to batch variation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The infection efficiency of PPRV in primary cultures is up to 100–1000 times less than that of the lymphoid cells expressing signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Thus, non-lymphoid cells expressing this recombinant protein, are used to isolate and propagate PPRV efficiently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. However, transformed marmoset B-lymphoblastoid cells (B95a) derived from Epstein-Barr virus, are more sensitive and support better growth of PPRV lineage IV compared to Vero cells. Virus isolation is expensive and time consuming, thus, it cannot be deployed for routine diagnostic, but it can only be used as gold standard for further disease confirmation and in research studies. Thus, establishment of cell lines with high infection efficiency to PPRV will be of help in confirming viable PPRV in the last phase of global PPRV eradication (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
