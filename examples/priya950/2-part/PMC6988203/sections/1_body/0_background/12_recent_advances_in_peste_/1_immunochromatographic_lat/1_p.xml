<p id="Par38">A novel pen-side diagnostic tool for diagnosis of PPR was developed at The Pirbright Institute (Pirbright, UK) in 2014. This lateral flow immunochromatographic assay is based on the specificity and affinity of conventional monoclonal antibody (MAb) C77 that was prepared using hybridoma cells technology in a miniPerm bioreactor and purified on a protein G HiTrap column [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In principle, the MAb C77 serves as the antigen fishing reagent on the chromatographic test strip and detection reagent that is labeled with colloidal gold-red. The performance of this diagnostic assay was evaluated in the laboratory and under field conditions on a superficial sample (ocular or nasal swabs). The test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 95%, respectively, relative to RT-PCR and detected as little as 10

 <sub>50</sub>of cell culture-grown PPRV. The test could detect PPRV in swabs from animals as early as 4Â days post-infection at a time when clinical signs were minimal. The IC-LFD kit is a prospect for field diagnosis of PPR and is being manufactured by Foresite Diagnostics Ltd (Sand Hutton, York, UK). The availability of this field-deployable diagnostic tool in developing countries will improve the diagnostic capacity for PPR. This will lead to early detection, which will significantly reduce the negative impact of PPR. Furthermore, this method could be utilised in the field without the need for expensive equipment, removing the requirement for its operation in a well established laboratory. However, case confirmation is essential during an outbreak of PPR. In such situation, field friendly, rapid and accurate nucleic acid-based diagnostic tools (RT-LAMP, RT-RPA and Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers) could be deployed.
