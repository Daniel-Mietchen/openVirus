<p id="Par41">In the advancements of the novel point-of-care molecular tests in recent years, RT-RPA assay was developed and coupled to a lateral flow. This assay is used for rapid detection of different viruses and parasites of veterinary and public health importance [

Then, the lateral-flow strips are coupled in the detection system. These assays are highly specific for detection of PPRV as there is no cross-reaction with

Firstly, reaction mixtures are pre-made pellets and provided in vacuum-sealed pouches, which can be kept at room temperatures for several days. This would save on cold chain costs and facilitate on-site diagnosis of PPR in the field. Secondly, the reaction can be performed in a water bath at a temperature of 37 to 45 °C for a maximum of just 20 min. The RT-RPA assay is rapid compared to RT-LAMP and it does not require expensive equipment and the results are read with the naked eye in less than 25 min. However, virus genetic sequences analysis could not be determined by aforementioned diagnostic tools in field settings to match with the plasticity of RNA viruses including PPRV. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers may be of choice in such situation.
