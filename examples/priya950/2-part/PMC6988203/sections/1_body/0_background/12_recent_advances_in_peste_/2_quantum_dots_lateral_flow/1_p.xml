<p id="Par39">Recently, a fast and ultrasensitive quantum dots lateral flow immunoassay stripÂ was established at the State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology in China to detect anti-PPRV antibodies. In this assay, N protein of PPRV is immobilised on the detection zone of the test strip and luminescent water-soluble carboxyl-functionalised quantum dots were used as signal output and were conjugated to streptococcal protein G. The performance of the test is extraordinary compared to C-ELISA and the IC-LFD for PPR serum IgG antibody detection [

This test cannot be used for early detection of active infection where only IgM and viral particles are present in circulation. Alternatively, nucleic acid-based tests or PPRV antigen detection methods could be used to assess during disease outbreaks.
