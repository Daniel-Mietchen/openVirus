<p id="Par33">Like other members of the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>, PRRV is enveloped, pleomorphic with the particles diameter ranging from 400 to 500 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The genome is a linear, non-segmented negative sense single stranded RNA, which is15,948 nucleotides long. There are six genes i.e. 3′-
 <italic>N, P, M, F, H, L</italic>-5′, which constitute the genome. Each of these genes codes for a distinct structural protein and each of these proteins bear the acronym of the respective gene of origin; nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), haemagglutinin protein (H) and large polymerase protein (L). Besides coding for the phosphoprotein, the 
 <italic>P</italic> gene also codes for two non-structural proteins designated C and V. The C and V proteins are generated through alternative start codons (leaky scanning) and RNA editing, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. It has been shown that the N protein is abundant in infected cells and highly immunogenic. On the other hand, given its abundance and antigenic stability, the N protein has been a preferred candidate antigen for development of PPRV immunodiagnostics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The P protein is a co-factor for viral replication and transcription in conjunction with the L protein, which is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The M constitutes the inner coat of the viral envelope and acts as a bridge connecting the surface glycoproteins (F and H) to the ribonucleoprotein core. The H protein mediates attachment of virions to the host receptors whilst F protein induces fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane in order to enter host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Then on-structural proteins play several functions including viral RNA synthesis, virulence determination and modulation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and blockade of interferon signaling.
