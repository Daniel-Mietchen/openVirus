<p id="Par32">The development of specific and sensitive molecular and serological techniques have improved the diagnostic precision for PPR since not all cases of PPR can be distinguish from rinderpest, pneumonic pasteurellosis and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, based on clinical sigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Based on previous similar outbreaks of the disease in Senegal and Guinea in 1871 and 1927, respectively, it was believed that PPR might have been existing much earlier than previously thought [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The disease spread subsequently to the neighbouring African countries like Nigeria and Ghana [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Until early 1980s, definite outbreaks of PPR were reported from different parts of West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and it was regarded as a disease of West African countries. However, it was later realised that the disease spread beyond West Africa with cases being recorded in Sudan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the northern part of Africa, PPR was reported in Morocco in 2008 and later Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have also reported PPR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Globally, PPR affects about 70 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Out of 70 countries that have either reported PPR infection to the OIE or are suspected of being infected, more than 60% are in Africa (except southern Africa). Other infected countries are in Asia (South-East Asia, China, South Asia and Central Asia/West Eurasia including Turkey) and the Middle East [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. PPRV lineages I and II have been found exclusively in western and central Africa; lineage III is common to eastern Africa and the southern part of the Middle East. Lineage IV is found in Southeast Asia, Middle East and North Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Incursions of PPRV lineages have been also reported, for instance lineage II and IV were found in East Africa and lineage IV in Ethiopia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Recent outbreaks of PPR in Bulgaria, Georgia and the Marmara region in Turkey increase the threat to Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The spread of PPR beyond its usual boundaries is attributed to cross-border movements of animals and animal products, which are being promoted by trade, nomadic lifestyle, tourism and migration of wild animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,
