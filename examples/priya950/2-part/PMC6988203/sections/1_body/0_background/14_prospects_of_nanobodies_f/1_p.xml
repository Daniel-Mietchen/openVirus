<p id="Par48">In the early 90’s, Hamers-Casterman and her colleagues made a remarkable discovery where they found a structurally different kind of antibodies which are part of the humoral immune response in the serum of camelids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. The heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) in camelids or similar molecules in shark (Ig-NAR) are devoid of light chains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. The antigen binding domain of Ig-NARs or HCAbs involves a single domain only, referred to as V-NAR when derived from Ig-NARs and VHHs (nanobodies) when derived from HCAbs. The nanobodies have proven to be powerful tools in diagnostics due to their unique characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. In particular, the recombinant expression of nanobodies in microbial systems and straightforward purification using His-tag by immobilised metal affinity chromatography makes their purification easy and very cheap. In contrast, traditional MAbs (used in virus detection) need more support costs and they are difficult for massive production compared to nanobody generation strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. Furthermore, nanobody proteins are robust against thermal denaturation, which obviates a cold chain for transport and storage. Interestingly, despite that nanobodies recognise their cognate antigen via one single domain-only, they still achieve a high affinity and specificity. In addition, the convex paratope of the nanobodies comprising three antigen binding loops or complementary determining regions prefer to interact with a concave surface on the antigen, an architecture that is not antigenic for classical antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Therefore, the use of nanobodies may circumvent binding interference caused by the host’s antibody response. Thus, nanobodies should detect both free antigens as well as those bound by host antibodies, which would make nanobodies based diagnostic tests rather attractive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. In contrast, the large size of MAbs prevents them from reaching cryptic epitopes andhost IgG molecules might as well conceal the epitopes from the MAbs employed in the diagnostic test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. The use of the nanobody coupled with lateral flow device may accelerate the development of cost effective, highly sensitive, specific and rapid immunoassays. In the light of global PPR eradication, a cost-effective, multiplex (multi-disease) diagnostic test would be very useful for concurrent bio-surveillance of PPR and similar infectious diseases such as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, bluetongue, contagious ecthyma and foot-and-mouth disease. These multiplex assays may also be indispensable in all phases of PPR eradication operation to rule out mixed infections.
