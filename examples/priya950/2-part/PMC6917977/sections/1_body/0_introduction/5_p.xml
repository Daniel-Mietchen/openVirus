<p>Here, we aimed to produce two glycoforms of anti‐CHIKV E1 mAb (CHKVmab) in plants and investigate their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. CHKVmabs were efficiently expressed and assembled in wild‐type (WT) 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, as well as in ∆XFT, a 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> glycosylation mutant lacking plant‐specific core xylose and fucose. ∆XFT‐derived CHKVmab (∆XFpCHKVmab) exhibited mammalian‐type GnGn glycans with high uniformity, while WT‐produced CHKVmab (WTpCHKVmab) carried a mixture of N‐glycans, including typical plant GnGnXF
 <sub>3</sub>, incompletely processed and oligomannosidic structures. Both mAb variants potently neutralized CHIKV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Notably, both pCHKVmab glycoforms also showed efficacy but with different potency against CHIKV infection in a murine model.
