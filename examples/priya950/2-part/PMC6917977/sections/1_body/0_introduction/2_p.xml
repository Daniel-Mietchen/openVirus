<p>The potential utility of antibodies as efficacious anti‐CHIKV therapeutics was suggested by early vaccine studies. It was found that vaccine potency correlates with its ability of inducing neutralizing antibodies in mice. Neutralizing antibodies from past infections in humans also show evidence of protectivity, as these subjects are immune to CHIKV reinfection (Kam

Indeed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CHIKV E1 and E2 have been shown to be protective against CHIKV infection in various mouse models. For example, anti‐E1 or E2 mAbs protected immune compromised (Ifnar ‐/‐) mice against lethal challenges of CHIKV when given as post‐exposure therapy (Pal
