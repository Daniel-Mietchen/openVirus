<p>The DNA expression cassette of the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) of CHKVmab was cloned into a MagnICON‐based plant expression vector (Giritch

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), transformed into

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The expression of CHKVmab was evaluated by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, WTpCHKVmab and ∆XFpCHKVmab have HC and LC with the expected molecular weight (Figure 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b, Lanes 3–4), and are fully assembled into the heterotetramer equivalent to a positive control IgG (Figure 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Lanes 3–4). The expression level of WTpCHKVmab and ∆XFpCHKVmab was estimated to be 100 and 130 μg/g leaf fresh weight (LFW), respectively. This level of expression is similar to that previously reported for non‐codon‐optimized mAbs produced in plants (De Muynck
