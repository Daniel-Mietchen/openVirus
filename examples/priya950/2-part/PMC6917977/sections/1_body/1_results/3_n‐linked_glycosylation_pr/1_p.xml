<p>Since the structure of N‐glycans in the Fc region of an antibody affects its Fc‐mediated effector functions (Jefferis, 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), the N‐glycosylation of pCHKVmabs was determined by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (LC‐ESI‐MS). pCHKVmab produced in ∆XFT plants exhibited the expected mammalian‐type GnGn N‐glycan structure lacking plant‐specific xylose and fucose with a high degree of uniformity (&gt;95%) (Table
