<p>Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used to evaluate the neutralization potential of plant‐produced mAbs against CHIKV (Yang

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2017b</xref>). While the negative control mAb (an anti‐WNV mAb) did not neutralize CHIKV, both WTpCHKVmab and ∆XFpCHKVmab showed strong neutralizing activity against CHIKV with statistically similar potency (∆XFpCHKVmab EC
 <sub>50 </sub>= 130.5 ng/mL vs. WTpCHKVmab EC

 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The mean EC
