<p>The coding sequence of CHKVmab variable region of HC (V

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) was fused to the corresponding DNA sequences of human IgG1 constant regions of HC (C
 <sub>H</sub>) and LC (C
 <sub>L</sub>), respectively. The resulting HC and LC coding sequences were cloned into MagnICON‐based plant expression vectors pICH21595 and pICH11599, and transformed into 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> as described previously (He
