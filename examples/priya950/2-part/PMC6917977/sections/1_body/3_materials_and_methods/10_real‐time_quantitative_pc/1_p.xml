<p>Total RNA was isolated from mouse blood samples using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). The first‐strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by using the iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio‐Rad). CHIKV envelope protein 1 (CHIKV E1) and cellular β‐actin RNA copy numbers were determined by RT‐qPCR in a CFX96 Real‐Time System (Bio‐Rad) using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio‐Rad). Viral copy numbers were expressed as the ratio of CHIKV E1 to cellular β‐actin. Primer sequences for mouse β‐actin and CHIKV E1 gene were previously described (Acharya
