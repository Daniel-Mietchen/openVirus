<p>The potential enhancing activities of the anti‐CHIKV mAbs for DENV infection were examined by using FcγRIIa
 <sup>+</sup> K562 cells (ATCC, CCL‐2243) as previously described (Dent 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Serial dilutions of CHKVmabs or the positive control mAb 4G2 were initially incubated with DENV‐2 (ATCC, VR‐1584) for 1 hr at 37 °C. Thereafter, the mAb–virus complexes were incubated with K562 cells (MOI = 1) for 48 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma), and stained with Alexa 488 (Invitrogen)‐conjugated 4G2 (ATCC, HB112). Stained cells were washed and analysed with a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) to determine the percentage of infected cells.
