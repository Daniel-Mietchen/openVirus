<p>LC‐ESI‐MS was used to determine the N‐linked glycosylation profiles of CHKVmab variants as previously reported (Dent 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Briefly, the HC band of purified CHKVmabs on Coomassie‐stained SDS‐PAGE was excised from the gel. Peptide fragments were generated by S‐alkylation and tryptic or tryptic/GluC digestion and subsequently eluted from the gel with 50% acetonitrile. Peptide fragments were then separated on a Reversed‐Phase Column (150 × 0.32 mm BioBasic 18, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 1%–80% acetonitrile gradient. Glycopeptides were analysed with a quadruple time‐of‐flight (Q‐TOF) Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). Spectra were summed and deconvoluted for identification of glycoforms. The ProGlycAn nomenclature (
