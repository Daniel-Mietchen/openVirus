<p>Another striking feature of the plant transient expression platform is the rapid production for an identified target. This is particularly important in cases of sudden disease outbreaks and the subsequent urgent need of therapeutics for immediate use, a typical scenario of viral outbreaks. In the plant transient system, a time frame of 1–2 weeks is sufficient for the generation of 1 g of product per kg of leaves after gene construct delivery (Lomonossoff and D'Aoust,

At this moment, this production speed cannot be matched by any other expression system and our work may contribute to rapidly producing pharmaceuticals to combat emerging diseases.
