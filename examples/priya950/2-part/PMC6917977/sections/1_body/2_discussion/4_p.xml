<p>To be considered as therapeutic candidates, plant‐made mAbs must have at least equivalent potency as their mammalian cell‐produced counterparts. A major mechanism of antiviral activity for anti‐CHIKV mAbs is viral neutralization (Pal

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Plant‐made CHKVmab exhibited strong neutralizing activity against CHIKV with potencies similar to mammalian cell‐derived CHKVmab (Pal 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Importantly, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of plant‐made CHKVmabs translated to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. There are several mouse models for evaluating the protectivity of mAbs against CHIKV. Immune compromised (Ifnar ‐/‐ or AG129) mice are subject to lethal CHIKV infection, providing a convenient survival model (Pal 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, these mice do not develop the arthritis observed in humans. In contrast, CHIKV infection in WT C57BL/6 mice causes arthritis and swelling in feet and ankles (Broeckel 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), presenting a more relevant animal model for studying human CHIKV infection. CHIKV infection in WT C57BL/6 mice does not cause lethal infection, but a transient viraemia – detectable at 1 dpi, reaching its peak at 2 dpi and subsiding by 4 dpi (Acharya 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In this relevant model, we observed that pCHKVmabs significantly reduced titres of virus in blood at 2 dpi, demonstrating the potential of plant‐produced mAbs as efficacious post‐exposure therapeutics
