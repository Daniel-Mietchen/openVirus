<p>One of the advantages of using plant‐based platforms to produce antibodies is the ability to alter N‐glycans present on the single glycosylation site at the Fc domain (Strasser 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). IgG Fc effector functions depend on the specific interaction between the IgG Fc domain and FcγR on immune cells which, in turn, is highly sensitive to the composition of N‐linked Fc glycans (Jefferis, 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). MAbs produced in mammalian cells usually carry a mixture of N‐glycans, with some glycoforms being more bioactive than others (Jefferis, 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). As such, glycoengineered plant lines that produce mAbs with distinct N‐glycans are highly appreciated for optimizing the therapeutic potency of mAbs, especially for those that require Fc effector function for efficacy. For example, glycoengineered plants have been used to increase the efficacy of anti‐filovirus and anti‐HIV antibodies (Forthal 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Zeitlin 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Moreover, our laboratory has demonstrated that anti‐DENV antibodies produced in ∆XFT and WT 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants forgo their ADE activity and, consequently, have superior efficacy and safety profiles than their mammalian‐produced counterparts most likely due to their specific N‐glycosylation profile (Dent 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Since anti‐CHIKV E1 and E2 mAbs require Fc effector function for their efficacy (Pal 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), their activities may be optimized by modulating glycosylation profiles. Indeed, our results showed that ∆XFpCHKVmab had better 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy against CHIKV than WTpCHKVmab. These results support our hypothesis that some antibody glycoforms may have superior protectivity than others by enhancing antibody's effector functions. We believe that the difference in potency between ∆XFpCHKVmab and WTpCHKVmab can be much greater if they both carry a homogenous glycoform. These results warrant further studies with additional anti‐CHIKV mAbs using multiple glycoengineered plant lines (Chen,
