<p>Collectively, we demonstrate the efficient expression, purification and the potent efficacy of two glycoforms of an anti‐CHIKV E1 mAb in plants and show that their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> potency may be optimized by the attachment of defined glycan profiles. In addition, neither of the two mAb glycoforms promoted ADE for DENV infection. These results suggest that mAbs have the potential to be used as effective and safe prophylaxis to prevent CHIKV infection during outbreaks, especially for populations with high risk of developing severe diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the efficacy of plant‐produced mAbs against CHIKV. Our results warrant future studies in mouse arthritis models that mimic symptoms of human CHIKV infection. In the context of recent studies that demonstrate broadly neutralizing human mAbs against CHIKV E2 with therapeutic activity (Smith
