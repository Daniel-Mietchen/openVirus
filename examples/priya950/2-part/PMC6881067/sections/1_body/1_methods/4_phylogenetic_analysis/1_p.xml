<p>Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA X [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method based on the Tamura-Nei model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with 1,000 bootstrap resampling. Each sequence was analysed based on the nucleotide sequences of the capsid pre-membrane (CprM) gene to determine the genotype and genetic relationship of each strain. Reference sequences of DENV genotypes from different years and geographical regions were included in order to characterise the genotypes of each sequence. Sylvatic strains available for each serotype were also included in the analysis.
