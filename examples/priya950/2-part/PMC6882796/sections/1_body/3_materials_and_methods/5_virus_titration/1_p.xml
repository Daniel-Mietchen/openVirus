<p id="Par25">Samples were inoculated onto monolayers of C6/36 cell culture (CHIKV and DENV) or Vero cells (ZIKV) in 96-well plates. Inoculated Vero cells were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C then stained with a solution of crystal violet (0.2% in 10% formaldehyde and 20% ethanol). Inoculated C6/36 cells were incubated for 3 days (CHIKV) or 5 days (DENV) at 28 °C and then were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed, and revealed using hyper-immune ascetic fluid as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG as the second antibody (Life Technologies, CA, USA).</p>
