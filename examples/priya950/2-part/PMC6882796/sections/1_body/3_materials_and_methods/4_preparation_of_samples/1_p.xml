 </sup>. The proboscis of legs- and wings-removed mosquito was inserted into a P20 tip filled with 5 µL of fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 30 min, saliva was expelled from the tip to 45 µL of L-15 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA) for CHIKV and DENV samples, and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle (DMEM) medium (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) for ZIKV samples. After salivation, mosquito head and body were collected and grounded individually in 300 µL of L-15 or DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, 200 µL of supernatant were collected for viral titration. Mosquitoes were examined at 7, 14, and 21 dpi.
