<p id="Par26">Three indexes were used to describe the vector competence of each combination virus - mosquito population. The infection rate (IR), dissemination efficiency (DE) and transmission efficiency (TE) illustrate the migratory route of the virus after ingestion by the mosquito. IR measures the proportion of mosquitoes with the midgut infected after the infectious blood meal resulting from a successful entry of the virus in the midgut epithelial cells followed by active replication. DE corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes able to disseminate the virus from the midgut into the mosquito general cavity where the hemolymph contributes to the dissemination and infection of mosquito internal tissues and organs; the detection of the virus in mosquito heads means that the virus has disseminated from the midgut. Lastly, TE refers to the proportion of mosquitoes with virus having infected the salivary glands after penetration into acinar cells, replication and release of produced virus in the salivary conduct during mosquito blood feeding.</p>
