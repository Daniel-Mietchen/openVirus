<p id="Par27">The virus efficiency to disseminate from the midgut to other tissues and then to salivary glands were modeled using a two-step logistic regression by restricting the mosquito population to those with a detectable viral load in the compartment of origin (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>. midgut or head). We compared a model using viral load and mosquito population as explanatory covariates to a null model, not accounting for mosquito population, using a likelihood-ratio test. The performance of the resulting classifier was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The probabilities of a successful dissemination and transmission were then derived from these models through inverse logit transformation, yielding population-specific probabilities of dissemination as a function of viral load. In the text, P50 and P75 values refer to 50% and 75% probability of dissemination or transmission, along with their corresponding viral load.
