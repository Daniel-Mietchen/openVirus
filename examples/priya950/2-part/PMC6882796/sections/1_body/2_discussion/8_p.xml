<p id="Par18">To conclude, environmental and biological factors are shaping the global distribution of mosquito vectors, and consequently, changing the epidemiology of associated diseases. As a newly emerging arboviral disease in Europe, CHIKV has become a new threat to European public health. Several information is crucial for the control of arboviral diseases; here, the vector competence of European

This study provides complete information on viral dissemination and transmission at different periods of viral incubation; the dissemination and transmission models help in understanding the virus propagation in mosquitoes, and reveal differences in vector competence among populations highlighting the risk of CHIKV outbreaks in Europe associated with
