 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations were highly competent to CHIKV and to a lesser extent, to DENV-1 and ZIKV. Here we show how vector competence data combined with vector distribution, can provide an accurate risk map for CHIKV transmission, which matched with the occurrence of human local cases in sampled sites of Rome, Anzio and Guardavalle in Italy
