<p id="Par10">The interpolated risk of transmission from a mosquito vector into human population is presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, ranging from ~0% in eastern European countries (inner Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro) to ~35% near Athens (Greece), also peaking to ~25% in northern Italy, notably higher than the median risk (12%). Regions where CHIKV outbreaks have already been observed in the past are consistent with predicted regions of higher transmission risk (Rome: 27%, Anzio: 25% and Guardavalle: 18%).
