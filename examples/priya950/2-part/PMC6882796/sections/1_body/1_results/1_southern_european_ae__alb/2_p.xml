<p id="Par6">Among the three viruses, CHIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>) provided the highest indexes of vector competence (infection, dissemination and transmission) than DENV-1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–f</xref>) and ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g–i</xref>). For CHIKV, while populations could show different infection rates (IR) at 7 dpi (Fisher’s exact test: p &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), IR reached values higher than 79% at 14 dpi in all populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Once the midgut is infected, mosquitoes should allow an active viral dissemination inside the mosquito general cavity; while only AAF (Faliro, Greece), AAE (Tenero, Switzerland), and AAC (Canton, China) populations showed dissemination efficiency (DE) higher than 70% at 7 dpi, all populations reached high and comparable DEs at 14 dpi ( &gt; 62%; Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.391; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Active viral dissemination could lead to viral transmission with virus detected in mosquito saliva; except AAE, all populations showed transmission efficiency (TE) lower than 33% at 7 dpi and 37.5% at 14 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Collectively, all populations showed the same profiles at 14 dpi, IR &gt; 80%, DE &gt; 62%, and TE between 8% and 33% suggesting a slightly higher viral blocking at the salivary glands than at the midgut level.
