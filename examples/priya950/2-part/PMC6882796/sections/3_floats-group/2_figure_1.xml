  <p>Infection rate, dissemination and transmission efficiencies of each Southern European 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> population for CHIKV (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>), DENV-1 (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>), and ZIKV (
   <bold>g</bold>–
   <bold>i)</bold>. Mosquitoes challenged an infectious blood meal were analyzed for infection, dissemination, and transmission at 7, 14 days post-infection (dpi) for CHIKV; 7, 14, and 21 dpi for DENV-1 and ZIKV. Infection rate (IR) refers to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected body among engorged mosquitoes. Dissemination efficiency (DE) corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected head among mosquitoes examined. Transmission efficiency (TE) represents the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes examined. AAF: Faliro, Greece; AAT: Tivat, Montenegro; AAM, Mirogoj, Croatia; AAV: Velika, Croatia; AAA: Arogno, Switzerland; AAE: Tenero, Switzerland; AA9: Cesena9, Italy; AA4: Cesena3 + 4, Italy; AAC: Canton, China. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals.
