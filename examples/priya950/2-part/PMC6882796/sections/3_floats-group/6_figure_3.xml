  <p>Probabilities of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic>-mediated CHIKV transmission in Southern Europe. The colors correspond to probabilities: lower (blue) or higher (red) than the median probability across the whole map (white). Probabilities were derived using an inverse distance-weighting spatial model as described in the methods. Blue dots correspond to sampling locations while red labeled dots highlight places where a CHIKV outbreak has been reported in a recent past. This map uses data published by Kraemer 
   <italic>et al</italic>. as well as modeled vector competence (see methods) and was generated with R v3.5.2 (packages raster v3.0.7 and gstat v2.0.3).
