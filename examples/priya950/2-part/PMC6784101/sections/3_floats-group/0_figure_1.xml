 <caption>
  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of 590 Chikungunya virus genomic sequences highlighting the geographic locations (tree branches) and lineages (tree leaves). Tree was computed using 
   <monospace>MAFFT</monospace> alignment of individual ORFs and partitioned tree search with model test using IQ-Tree. Leaves are colored by lineage association. Branches of the tree are colored by geographic location of a sample. Colors of ancestral nodes and branches do not imply geographic origin and therefore are depicted in gray.
