<p>To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the 3’UTR phylogeny in the context of diverged CHIKV lineages, we computed a separate phylogeny based exclusively on 3’UTR sequences (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00798">Figure S1</xref>). Although coding and non-coding parts of the viral genome are subject to different evolutionary pressures, mapping lineage association onto this tree reproduces the topology of the full CDS tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This is to some extent surprising, as the nature of evolutionary forces acting on both entities is supposed to be different, best illustrated by the requirement to maintain a reading frame. This means that the 3’UTR evolution is not disentangled from CDS evolution in CHIKV, as expected intuitively. On a broader scale, our data provide evidence that CHIKV CDS and 3’UTRs show coherent evolutionary patterns, with leads to the hypothesis that the 3’UTR might represent an evolutionary scaffold that can rapidly replace functional elements, as required for adaptation to environmental change, e.g., by means of recombination [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Still, CHIKV 3’UTRs do not exhibit the high degree of plasticity known from other arboviruses with functional 3’UTRs, such as flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
