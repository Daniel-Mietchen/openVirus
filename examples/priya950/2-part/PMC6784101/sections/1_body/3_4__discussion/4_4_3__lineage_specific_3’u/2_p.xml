<p>We hypothesize that such intrinsically unstructured repeat regions act as structural insulators that separate functional secondary structures from each other. Unstructured stretches can mediate the formation of structure in adjacent regions by prohibiting base pairs that are in conflict with the element structure. Likewise, single-stranded, unstructured RNAs can serve as easily accessible protein binding sites. In particular, the enrichment of 
 <monospace>A</monospace> nucleotides in the unstructured region not only indicates the lack of secondary structure, but might also facilitate the sponging of RNA-binding proteins [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. While HuR binding in CHIKV appears impaired [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], stabilization of viral RNA through host factors is an evolutionary trait to counteract viral genome degradation by host nuclease activity [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conversely, other RNA-binding proteins, such as the Musashi family of translational regulators, have been shown to efficiently interact with viral 3’UTRs [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The canonical Musashi binding motif, 
 <monospace>UAG</monospace>, is present at multiple loci within the unstructured repeat of all CHIKV 3’UTR sequences, supporting the biological role of intrinsic lack of structure. Besides protein-aided regulation, RNA interference is a crucial mechanism that controls viral replication in mosquitoes. Host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to interact with the 3’UTRs of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The miRNA binding site reported by Dubey et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] overlaps with the structured Y-shaped element (SL-Y) characterized here. Whether or not the CHIKV genome encodes for endogenous viral miRNAs, as observed in flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], remains to be established.
