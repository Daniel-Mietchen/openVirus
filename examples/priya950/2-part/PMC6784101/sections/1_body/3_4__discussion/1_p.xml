<p>Studies on CHIKV phylogenetics have provided phylogenomic means of understanding disease spread in the context of correlating disease epidemiology. The phylogenetic analyses we present are in agreement with the current literature, although the increased number of sequences presented provide insights on the hidden history of ECSA. Interestingly, the phylogeny based on ORFs is in agreement with the phylogeny based on complete UTRs, despite the intuitive idea that different evolutionary forces should act on coding and non-coding regions.</p>
