<p>In order to remain consistent with the current literature we kept the naming scheme based on geography, but defined lineage as the pool of individual taxa found in a clade that are not isolated geographically. We define epidemic clade as a monophyletic group that may encompass one or more lineages regardless of geography.</p>
