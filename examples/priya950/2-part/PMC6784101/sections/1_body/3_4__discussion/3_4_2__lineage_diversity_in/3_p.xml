<p>We propose that the ECSA genotype is too reductive in light of the rapid expansion and increased taxonomic sampling, and should be separated into their respective regions of the African continent: Eastern, Central, and Southern. Nevertheless, it is important to raise the attention to the lack of sampling in Africa which obscures the Chikungunya virus dynamics between the distinct regions within Africa. The current but limited amount of African sequences utilized in this study indicate that there may be multiple co-circulating lineages and these results should serve as justification for the importance of understanding the virus dynamics in Africa. As more isolates are sequenced, a more nuanced history of CHIKV evolution will emerge which will aid in our understanding of the dynamics of these outbreaks.</p>
