<p>Multiple waves of CHIKV infection have occurred over the past two decades, with outbreaks traced from Eastern and Middle Africa to Southeastern Asia (e.g., Thailand and Malaysia), Southern Asia (India) and the Americas [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Clades of CHIKV observed in the analyses are consistent with those found in the literature with an important exception. Similar to White et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], who alluded to the presence of ECSA subgroups, we observed that ECSA has multiple co-circulating lineages which gave rise to the current outbreaks in Southern and Southeastern Asia and the Americas. With the large amount of new sequences we analyzed, what was once called ECSA, East Central South African lineage, is no longer a single lineage because it is not monophyletic. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f001">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that Middle African taxa gave rise to the outbreak in South America, while Eastern African strains gave origin to IOL. IOL has remained nearly exclusively on the Asian continent, with exception of a few African and European outbreaks. AUL, a sister clade to all ECSA derived lineages, has reached the American continent with extensive nesting diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In Africa, AUL is known to have emerged in 2004 and spread explosively in the Comoros islands and incited a severe epidemic in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the Americas, strains from AUL are observed as coming from the US to Central America (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f002">Figure 2</xref>), and given the absence of locally acquired cases in the US, the indication of an ancestral sequence originating a transmission event to Central America could be due to lack of sampling the ancestral strain sequence and the close similarity of it with strain sequences found in Central America.
