<p>We obtained viral genome data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 
 <monospace>Genbank</monospace> database [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We downloaded 598 whole genome sequences of CHIKV. We compiled all geographic metadata available in these genome records to create data sets for the analyses described below. We removed eight sequences from the data set due to missing geographic location metadata or designation as a vaccine sequence. The metadata associated with geographic location was associated with the United Nations geoscheme for consistency. Therefore, “Central Africa” is labeled “Middle Africa”.
