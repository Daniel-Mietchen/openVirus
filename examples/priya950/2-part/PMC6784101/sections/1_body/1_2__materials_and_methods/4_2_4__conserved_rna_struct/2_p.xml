<p>All CHIKV 3â€™UTRs were processed and curated from full genomes by custom Perl scripts based on the 
 <monospace>ViennaNGS</monospace> toolbox [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Structural RNA alignments were computed with 
 <monospace>mlocarna</monospace> [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and consensus structures were generated with 
 <monospace>RNAalifold</monospace> [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Locally stable secondary structures were computed using 
 <monospace>RNALalifold</monospace> from the 
 <monospace>ViennaRNA</monospace> package [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Homologies of both sequences and secondary structures were inferred by HMMs and CMs as implemented in the 
 <monospace>Infernal</monospace> package [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as outlined previously [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. All secondary structure plots were rendered using the 
 <monospace>RNAplot</monospace> utility [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].
