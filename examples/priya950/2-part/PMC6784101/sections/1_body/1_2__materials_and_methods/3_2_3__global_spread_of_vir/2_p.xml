<p>In order to evaluate the historical spread of CHIKV using a parsimonious ancestral reconstruction, the tree must be rooted to infer event directionality. Thus, we selected a root for each clade based on the complete CHIKV phylogeny. For each individual clade, the sister taxon to all other taxa was selected. When a clade had multiple sister taxa, we randomly selected one as the root. We selected HM045788.1 (India) as the outgroup for AUL-Am, KF283986.1 (Comoros) for ECSA-IOL and KX262996.1 (Cameroon) for ECSA-MASA.</p>
