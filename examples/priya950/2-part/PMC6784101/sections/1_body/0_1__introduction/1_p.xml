<p>Phylogeographic inquiries can reveal viral transmission patterns and pathogenesis of viral diseases. Dramatic (re)emergences of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile, Zika, and Dengue, have increased in frequency and intensity, thus raising public health concerns [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prolific expansion of arboviruses in countries where the viruses have previously not been recorded has drawn public attention. These trends are considered to be a function of climate change effects on the geographic range in which the vector can complete its life cycle and transmit CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Here, we investigate the RNA architecture of CHIKV untranslated regions (UTRs) that underlies their ability to adapt and transmit in new environments and provide an updated large-scale phylogeny summarizing the geographic spread of CHIKV lineages.
