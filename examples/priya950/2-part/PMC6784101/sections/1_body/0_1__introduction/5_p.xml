<p>The virus had not been associated with life-threatening symptoms before an outbreak in 2005 on La Réunion island off the East African coast [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which demonstrated a drastic expansion of the disease spectrum. In La Réunion, and after, higher morbidity has been associated with CHIKV infection, including neurological issues, such as visual and hearing loss, paralysis, Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) and renal complications [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent mutations that change protein structure have been attributed to increased ability to establish infection (infectivity) and outbreaks as the virus becomes better adapted to vector species (e.g., 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, the only suitable agent for transmission in La Réunion island) [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Species of the Aedes genus, in particular 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic> are carriers of CHIKV, and are capable of transmission to humans [
