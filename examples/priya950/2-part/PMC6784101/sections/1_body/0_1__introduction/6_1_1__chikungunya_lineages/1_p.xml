<p>CHIKV is a virus for which four major lineages have been proposed: Asian Urban (AUL), Indian Ocean (IOL), East, Central and South African (ECSA), and West African (WA) [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite these notions, the origin and the history of how CHIKV spreads inside of Africa remains elusive. This gap in our understanding is due to undersampling and confounding factors such as co-circulating Dengue and Yellow Fever viruses. The co-circulation of viruses diminishes the value of serology test which are not species specific. While the AUL has historically been constrained in Southeast Asia, there have been recent outbreaks in the Americas [
