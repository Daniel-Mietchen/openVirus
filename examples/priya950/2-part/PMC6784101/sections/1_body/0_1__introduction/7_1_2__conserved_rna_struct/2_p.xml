<p>Populations of RNA viruses exhibit large genetic variability. This variation allows populations to have variants that are suited to changing conditions and immune escape. Viral variation results mainly from two mechanisms, mutation and recombination. Mutation occurs during replication by mis-introduction of nucleotides by error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that lack proof-reading capacity. Recombination occurs when co-circulating lineages co-infect a host and mixed segments are incorporated into the descendent viruses [
