<p>A large number of genomic sequences and metadata have been deposited recently to public repositories. These data have raised the possibility of revising the lineages of CHIKV as a whole, reevaluating the historical global spread of the major epidemic clades and evaluating the RNA structural patterns among different clades. We also set out to structurally characterize the UTRs of all known CHIKV lineages, and found evidence for lineage-specific structured and unstructured repeat elements. We hypothesize such RNA elements to be involved in viral replication, vector adaptation and specificity, host factor binding, and pathogenicity.</p>
