<p>Evolutionary conservation in RNA viruses is typically maintained in secondary structure and manifested in rich base pair-conserving covariation patterns [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Relatively little is known about structured RNAs in alphaviruses, both in coding and non-coding regions. Coding regions evolve under strong selection pressure to maintain protein function. Nevertheless, it has become apparent that structure within coding regions can also have biological function, as seen in the HIV RRE element [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the context of alphaviruses, Kutchko et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] performed RNA structure probing experiments, focusing on Sindbis virus (SINV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), but could not find evidence for broad conservation of functional RNA structures.
