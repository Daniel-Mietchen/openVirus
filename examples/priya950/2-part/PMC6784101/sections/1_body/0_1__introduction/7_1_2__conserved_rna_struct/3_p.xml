<p>The role of functional RNA elements in pathogenesis is well established in flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], where they are typically conserved evolutionarily in UTRs [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In CHIKV, patterns of coupled historic recombination and mutation events are encoded in the 3’UTRs of different lineages [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The resulting variants have highly divergent 3’UTRs that vary in length. Characteristics of these 3’UTR variants are variable number of direct repeats (DRs) at the sequence level [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Distinctive CHIKV lineages also differ in their 3’UTR architecture, in particular in the copy number and arrangement of sequence repeats [
