<p>Thus, we extrapolate the names for these discrete lineages based on geographic location: Indian Ocean, Eastern African, South American, Middle African, African/Asian, Asian Urban, American, and Western African (denoted as “leaves,”

Some of these lineages belong to the three major epidemic clades: AUL-Am (Asian Urban + American lineages), ECSA-MASA (Middle Africa/South American Lineage), and ECSA-IOL (Eastern Africa + Indian Ocean Lineage). In this paper, we distinguish the individual lineages, which are delimited by geographic region (e.g., IOL and WA), from epidemic clades, which may encompass more than a single lineage (e.g., AUL, ECSA-IOL, and ECSA-MASA). Individual limited outbreaks (e.g., IOL in Europe) are not considered new lineages as the outbreak did not generate a new endemic region for the CHIKV lineage (
