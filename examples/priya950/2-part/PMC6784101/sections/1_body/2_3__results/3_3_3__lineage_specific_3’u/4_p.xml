<p>The structured elements, SL-a, SL-b, and SL-Y, are separated by one or two repeats of an intrinsically unstructured repeat (UR) element (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f003">Figure 3</xref>e). The total copy number of UR elements varies from three to five between lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This sequence repeat element lacks structure, as marked by its incapability to fold into any stable RNA secondary structure. Both single sequence predictions of individual repeats, as well as consensus structure prediction using an alignment of all instances did not yield a stable minimum free energy structure, or alternative base pairing probabilities.
