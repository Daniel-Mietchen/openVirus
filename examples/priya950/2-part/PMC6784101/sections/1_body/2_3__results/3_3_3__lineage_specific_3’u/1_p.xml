<p>Composition and length of the full 3’UTRs analyzed in this study differ substantially between lineages and range from 510 to 930 nucleotides. Earlier studies reported cascades of repeated sequence elements (RSEs) [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and a structurally conserved sequence element (CSE) required for replication [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in CHIKV 3’UTR. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] proposed distinct direct repeat elements 1 and 2 (DR1 and DR2, respectively), together with a structured Y-shaped element, which all appear in lineage-specific duplication patterns. Filomatori et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] adopted this classification in a recent study, however they were not able to see in silico secondary structure signals in DR sequences except for a Y-shaped element. Here, we follow up on previous knowledge, using the full set of presently available sequence data (i.e., 196 complete and truncated CHIKV 3’UTRs), and conclusively infer hitherto unresolved structural properties of all conserved elements.
