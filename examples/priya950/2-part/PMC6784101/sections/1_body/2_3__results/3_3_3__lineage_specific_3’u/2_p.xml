<p>From a multiple sequence alignment of all available 3â€™UTRs from all lineages, we manually characterized five highly conserved regions into four structured and one non-structured elements (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f003">Figure 3</xref>). We inferred sequence and structural homology from searches in the complete UTR set of all lineages, thus characterizing all instances of each conserved element. We used structural alignment and consensus structure prediction to find the conserved structures of the four structured elements.
