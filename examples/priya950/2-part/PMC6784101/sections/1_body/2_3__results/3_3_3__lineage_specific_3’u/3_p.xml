<p>We characterized two stem–loop (SL) elements, termed SL-a and SL-b, the latter being conserved among all lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f004">Figure 4</xref>). While SL-a is only conserved among the ECSA-derived and AUL lineages, comparison of the two SL elements indicates that SL-b is likely a shortened variant of SL-a and comprised of its innermost hairpin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d). Interestingly, this characteristic can also be observed in O’Nyong-Nyong virus (ONNV), which shares common ancestry with CHIKV. The genomic coordinates of both elements approximately correspond to the previously reported DRs, with DR1a spanning over the downstream portion of SL-a and DR1b being consistent with SL-b. The Y-shaped element (SL-Y) is conserved among all lineages but varies in copy number between ECSA-derived/WA (one copy) and AUL (two copies), and shows strong sequence conservation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The previously described CSE [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] folds into a short hairpin loop and is found upstream of the poly-A tail in all CHKIV isolates (
