<p>Annotation of all available 3’UTR sequences with CMs and HMMs revealed that different CHIKV lineages have evolved distinct patterns of structured and unstructured functional RNA elements. This lineage-specificity of potentially functional RNAs has led to a varied 3’UTR architecture among CHIKV strains. This is particularly pronounced in the AUL and its descendants, which show a characteristic 3’UTR organization. Several geographically diverse isolates of the AUL-Am (also referenced as Caribbean lineage (AUL-Cbn)) appear to have undergone a partial duplication event in the 3’UTR [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. As a result, an additional copy of the nonstructural sequence repeat UR and the structural element SL-b are found immediately downstream to the first copy of SL-b and UR (
