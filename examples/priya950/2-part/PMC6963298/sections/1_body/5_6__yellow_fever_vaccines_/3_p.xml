<p>Even though there are several YF vaccine producers, two with large scale capability, supply has not been able to keep up with demand. Production capacity is limited because the vaccines are produced in embryonated eggs using a labor-intensive method that is relatively unchanged since 1945 [
 <xref rid="B85-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. As a result, only about 80 million doses are produced each year [
 <xref rid="B86-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. It is estimated that there are between 393.7 and 472.9 million people residing in YFV transmission risk areas who need to be vaccinated to achieve the recommended 80% population coverage threshold [

 <xref rid="B87-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Moreover, the incidence of YF appears to be increasing not only in under-vaccinated areas but also in historically non-endemic areas [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When YF outbreaks occur, the vaccine supply is insufficient to meet the needs for mass vaccination campaigns [
 <xref rid="B88-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. For example, in an outbreak in Kinshasa in 2016, vaccine shortage led to the emergency use of a fractional (i.e., one-fifth) dose of YF 17-DD vaccine after the vaccine stockpile was depleted [

 <xref rid="B91-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In 2018, a campaign using fractional doses of YF vaccine was initiated in Brazil in response to urban outbreaks in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. While fractional dosing may be employed during public health emergencies, broader application is not recommended because of insufficient data regarding the immunogenicity of fractional doses in infants, young children and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in endemic areas [
