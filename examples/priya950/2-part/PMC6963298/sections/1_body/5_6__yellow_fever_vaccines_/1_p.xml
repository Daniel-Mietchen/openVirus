<p>A live-attenuated YF vaccine was first developed in 1936 using an attenuated wild-type YFV strain that was isolated in 1927 from a Ghanaian patient named Mr. Asibi [

The Asibi 17D strain was passaged 53 times in monkeys, followed by serial passage in minced tissue preparations: mouse embryo (18 passages), whole chick embryo (58 passages), and whole chick embryo without brain and spinal cord (100 passages) [

During the passage series, the virus was assayed for neurotropism in mice by intracerebral injection, and pathogenicity in monkeys by intracerebral and extraneural administration. The 176th viral passage was selected to make vaccine sub-strains 17D-204 and 17DD because it was less lethal when delivered intracerebrally than a 114th passage strain, the first strain to lose pathogenicity in mice. A third sub-strain, which is a derivative of 17D-204, the 17D-213 sub-strain, was produced in 1977 and is a reference stock maintained by WHO for new manufacturers or emergency production [
