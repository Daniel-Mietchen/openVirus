<p>Currently, the most promising therapeutic agents in early clinical development are nucleoside analogs that inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [

For example, sofosbuvir, a uridine analog used to treat hepatitis C, has shown antiviral activity against YFV in cell-based assays and rodent infection models [
