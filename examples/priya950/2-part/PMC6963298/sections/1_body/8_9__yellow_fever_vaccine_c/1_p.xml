<p>New YF vaccines that are produced using modern technologies are needed to address the limited production capacity of existing vaccines especially considering the expanding geographic distribution, threat of re-urbanization and possibility of introduction into YFV-na√Øve Asia [
 <xref rid="B120-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. In addition, new YF vaccines would ideally have a better safety profile for infants, breastfeeding women, immunocompromised individuals, and older people [

 <xref rid="B122-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. One method, intradermal administration of YF vaccine, mimics the natural route of transmission and takes advantage of the skin dendritic cells role in the immune response [

 <xref rid="B124-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In one study, the immunogenicity of a fractional (one-fifth) intradermal dose of YF 17D vaccine was not inferior to that of a full subcutaneous dose.
