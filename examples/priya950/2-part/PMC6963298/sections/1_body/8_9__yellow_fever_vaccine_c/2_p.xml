<p>One approach being taken to address these issues is to produce an inactivated whole virus vaccine using the 17D virus produced in cell culture [

 <xref rid="B125-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B126-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,

 <xref rid="B129-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Such a vaccine would provide scalable production and would likely not have the adverse effects associated with viral replication. A candidate vaccine comprised of 17D virus inactivated by treatment with beta-propiolactone (BPL) was shown to protect mice against a lethal YFV challenge [

 <xref rid="B130-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Another similar inactivated whole virus vaccine that is under development uses a new hydrogen peroxide-based inactivation method that preserves neutralizing epitopes on the virion better than conventional methods (Mark Slifka, personal communication) [
 <xref rid="B131-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. It is possible that this improved inactivation method will result in a vaccine that induces protective immunity after a single dose, but that remains to be determined.
