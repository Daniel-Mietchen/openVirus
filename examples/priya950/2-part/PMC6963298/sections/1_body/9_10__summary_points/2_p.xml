<p>In response to the recent resurgence in YF, the EYE strategy was developed by WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF in collaboration with 50 other partners to vaccinate at-risk populations, mitigate outbreaks and prevent the spread of the disease. In order to do this, 80% of the population in risk areas need to be vaccinated, surveillance and laboratory capacity strengthened, and newer methods to predict emerging risk areas developed and utilized. This means that an adequate supply of YF vaccine needs to be made available.</p>
