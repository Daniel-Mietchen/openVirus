<p>YF 17D vaccines are effective and safe for most people. However, with an aging population throughout much of the tropics, a new vaccine with a better safety profile in person &gt;60 years is desirable. In addition, a new vaccine with robust production capacity is needed to keep up with the demand as demonstrated by the recent outbreaks in DRC and Brazil in which fractional dosing had to be used. Two vaccine development approaches are being investigated to address production capacity and safety: inactivated whole virus vaccines using the 17D virus produced in cell culture and replication-defective MVA vector vaccine expressing the YFV pre-M and E proteins.</p>
