<p>Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) was first described in 2001, although cases as far back as the 1970s have been identified retrospectively [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While YEL-AVDs are rare events, the case fatality rate is &gt;60%. YEL-AVD typically presents about 4 days after the first YF vaccine dose is administered and has a natural history similar to severe wild-type disease. YEL-AVD occurrence is thought to be due to underlying host susceptibility rather than the vaccine virus reverting to a virulent phenotype [

 <xref rid="B104-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Older individuals may be at increased risk due to immune senescence and/or underlying chronic diseases. In fact, one study found that older first-time 17D vaccine recipients had a delayed antibody response and a longer duration of viremia than younger vaccine recipients [
