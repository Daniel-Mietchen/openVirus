<p>Those who recover from YF likely have long-lasting immunity, however most data on immune response and antibody kinetics in YF are from vaccine models [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. IgM antibodies are typically detected during the first week of illness, peak during the second week, and rapidly decline over the next sixty days. While IgM antibodies can persist after YF immunization, it is unknown if there is similar endurance after natural infection [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies, which primarily consist of IgG antibodies, can remain for many years after immunization and natural infection, and can confer protection against re-infection [

 <xref rid="B49-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that previous heterologous flavivirus exposure, for example from prior dengue virus infection, may provide partial cross protection against severe YF [
