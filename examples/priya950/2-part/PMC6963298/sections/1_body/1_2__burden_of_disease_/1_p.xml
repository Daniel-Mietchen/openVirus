<p>More than 900 million people reside in 35 African and 13 Central and South American countries where there is high to moderate risk of YFV transmission [

 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], 90% of YF cases reported to WHO via passive surveillance are still from Africa. One recent study estimated that there were 130,000 (95% CI 51,000–380,000) YF cases with fever and jaundice or hemorrhage in 2013, including 78,000 (95% CI 19,000–180,000) deaths in Africa [

In the Americas, the annual reported incidence of YF is typically less than 500 cases with the exception of 524 cases in 1995, 825 cases in 2017, and 1401 cases in 2018 [
