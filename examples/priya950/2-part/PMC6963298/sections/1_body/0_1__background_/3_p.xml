<p>In response to outbreaks in Angola and DRC, in 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance developed a new global initiative, the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy, in collaboration with 50 partners in support of 40 high-risk countries [
 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. EYE focuses on preventing sporadic YF cases from developing into outbreaks, mitigating outbreaks, and preventing exportation once outbreaks are identified. The goal of EYE is to eliminate YF outbreaks globally by 2026 by vaccinating 1.4 billion people in 40 countries by supporting vaccination programs and campaigns and strengthening surveillance and laboratory capacity to detect, monitor and respond to YFV transmission. EYE built upon lessons learned from the WHO Yellow Fever Initiative which was created in collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF in response to YF outbreaks in West Africa in the early 2000s. The Yellow Fever Initiative introduced YF vaccine into routine childhood immunization schedules in endemic countries, conducted mass preventive campaigns in risk areas, and established a global vaccine stockpile to respond to outbreaks. While initiative efforts successfully prevented YF outbreaks in West Africa, many of the recent African outbreaks have occurred in Central and East Africa.
