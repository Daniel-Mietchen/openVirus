<p>We aim to find tools that assess local-level vulnerability in the context of infectious threats and AMR. As mentioned above, we also include vulnerability assessment tools linked to natural hazards or disasters in our search. Of interest are tools that explore recently emerging, less visible and locally relevant vulnerable groups.
