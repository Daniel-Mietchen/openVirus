<p>Articles, websites, book chapters and grey literature from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and non-profit organisations (NPOs) working in the field of health will be considered relevant. Publications in English, French, Ukrainian, Russian or Bangla will be included. SoNAR-Global partners in Ukraine and Bangladesh will assist in reviewing papers in Ukrainian, Russian or Bangla. In this review, we consider studies published between 1978 and 2019 because the key role of primary healthcare in promoting health for everyone was agreed on in the declaration of Alma Ata in 1978. This marks a critical waypoint in considering socio-structural determinants as influencing an individual's health and degree of vulnerability.
