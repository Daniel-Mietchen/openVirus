<p>In our scoping review, we seek to map vulnerability assessment tools with (or without) conceptual underpinnings and procedures for identifying vulnerability. We take into consideration vulnerability assessment tools or methodologies that assess locally relevant case definitions of vulnerability
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and identify specific groups at greatest risk of marginalisation and thus at greatest risk of suffering disproportionately the consequences of a disaster. This could be due to social, cultural, political, economic or other context-specific reasons that influence peopleâ€™s exposure, susceptibility, resilience (and coping mechanisms), adaptive capacity or capacity to recover. Additionally, we seek to find vulnerability assessment tools that are tailored to infectious threats (and AMR). This is why we look for both local-level assessments and tools targeted at infectious threats.
