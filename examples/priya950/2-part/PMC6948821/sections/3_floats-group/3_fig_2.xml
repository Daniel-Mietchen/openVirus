  <title>Expected number of tests for vector and human surveillance strategies.</title>
  <p>This figure shows the 50% uncertainty interval (UI, dark) and 95% UI (light) for the expected number of RT-PCR tests required per week for different surveillance strategies and transmission levels in a population of 100,000 people. The human surveillance strategy indicates the number of tests among emergency department patients with two or more ZIKV symptoms given transmission scenarios of 0 (green), 1 (grey), and 10 (red) infections per 10,000 people per week. The yellow, blue, and black bars are the number of tests required for pools of female
