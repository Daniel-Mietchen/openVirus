<p>In contrast to the simulations, more human cases (127) than positive pools (49) were observed in Caguas, suggesting that human surveillance may be more sensitive than virological surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Part of this difference is explained by the different population coverage (130,000 for human surveillance and 80,000 for vector surveillance). However, using the model to estimate the infection rate in both populations, we found that the difference was still clear; in almost every week the estimated incidence was higher using human surveillance data. The discrepancy may result from higher risk in the additional 50,000 people covered by human surveillance, but there is no obvious reason for this to be the case. Alternatively, the difference may result from mischaracterization of human surveillance in the simulation model. The model was limited to patients seeking care in an emergency department with two or more ZIKV symptoms, whereas the actual surveillance data likely includes individuals from other health facilities, those with only one ZIKV symptom, patients suspected of having infection for other reasons, and individuals who may have been infected outside of Caguas. These components commonly vary across surveillance systems and locations, and all of these could lead to underestimates of the sensitivity of human surveillance in the simulations.
