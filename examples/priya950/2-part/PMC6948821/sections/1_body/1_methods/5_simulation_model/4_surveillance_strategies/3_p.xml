<p>For vector surveillance, we started each simulation with a specific number of traps and simulated the total numbers of mosquitoes and pools collected from those traps based on the Caguas collection data. The probability of a pool containing a positive mosquito was calculated as the product of the average number of mosquitoes collected per pool and the probability of an individual mosquito being infected (described above). Mosquito testing was performed with RT-PCR. Two studies demonstrated sensitivities of 88.7% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for RT-PCR detection of ZIKV in mosquitoes. Based on those findings and studies of RT-PCR for detecting WNV in mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we assumed the test has a sensitivity of 85%-100% and a specificity of 99.9â€“100%, which we approximated with uniform distributions. ZIKV RNA is stable enough to allow detection for up to 30 days [
