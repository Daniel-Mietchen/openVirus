<p>For each surveillance strategy, we ran 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. All analyses were performed in R 3.5.2 statistical software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). We used Stan to implement the Bayesian models. We used three chains with a burn-in of 1,000 samples and a further 1,000 samples collected from each chain with clear convergence and no significant autocorrelation.</p>
