We developed simulation models to estimate ZIKV transmission and detection in humans and mosquitoes at varying transmission levels. Four surveillance strategies were assessed: mosquito trapping systems with 180, 360, and 720 traps; and human surveillance. We started by simulating population sizes of humans and vectors, the incidence of infection in both populations, and surveillance for infection in each population. We then compared the total number of detections and probability of detection between the strategies. These processes are described in detail below with key parameters in
