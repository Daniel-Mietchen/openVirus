<p>To identify the relationship between detected infections and incidence, we assessed the relationship between the simulated infection incidence and the observed number of positive pools or human cases in the same simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007988.g003">Fig 3</xref>). There was high variability across simulations and high uncertainty in the relationship between the number of observed positive pools or confirmed human cases and the number of underlying infections. For each positive mosquito pool, we estimated an additional 23.3 infections (95% Credible Interval (CI): 0.7, 171.1) (
