<p>We used this model to estimate the incidence of infection on a weekly basis using the observed number of confirmed cases and positive pools and calculated the rate of infection given the distinct population sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007988.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Although the 95% CIs overlapped for all weeks, the 50% CIs had minimal overlap during late 2016 when incidence in both systems was relatively high. Overall, estimates based on human surveillance were substantially higher in most weeks of 2016 and the incidence rate of the entire study period was 90 (95% CI: 50, 140) infections per 10,000 people based on mosquito pool data in the vector surveillance area versus 500 (95% CI: 340, 680) based on human surveillance data in all of Caguas.
