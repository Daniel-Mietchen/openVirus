<p>Finally, we compared these simulations to the data reported from Caguas from October 10, 2016, to April 16, 2017. Over this period, there were 127 confirmed human ZIKV cases out of 452 suspect cases detected through passive surveillance (28.1% positive) in the entire municipality of Caguas and 49 ZIKV positive pools of female

We reran the simulations using the populations of all of Caguas (130,000) and the study area (80,000) for the human and vector surveillance systems, respectively, to estimate the relationship between the number of infections in populations of these specific sizes and the number of positive mosquito pools or confirmed human cases detected. The relationships were similar to those generated with a uniform population size of 100,000 people for each system; mean expected number of infected humans increasing by 47.6 (95% CI: 0, 341.9) and 19.7 (95% CI: 0.6, 167.4) infections per additional confirmed case or positive pool, respectively.
