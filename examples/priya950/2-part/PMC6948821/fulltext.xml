A previous assessment of surveillance strategies for U.S. counties where no known transmission had occurred, found that testing people seeking medical care with signs of Zika virus was a more effective strategy than testing blood donors or pregnant women. An alternative strategy to testing humans is to test the mosquitoes directly for viruses. In this study, we used data from human and mosquito surveillances during the Zika epidemic of 2016 in Caguas, Puerto Rico to compare these strategies for detecting and monitoring Zika virus activity. Using simulation models for human and mosquito surveillance strategies, we examined different transmission scenarios with varying Zika virus infection rates. The results suggest that in high Zika virus transmission scenarios, both approaches effectively identified transmission. In low transmission scenarios, routine mosquito surveillance had the potential for increased sensitivity compared to human-based surveillance. However, resource availability may also be an important factor when considering the most effective approach.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000061</institution-id><institution>Fogarty International Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D43TW009343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5667-9660</contrib-id><name><surname>Madewell</surname><given-names>Zachary J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>ZM was supported by the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Number D43TW009343 and the University of California Global Health Institute (UCGHI).

The emergence of ZIKV highlighted several challenges for arbovirus surveillance. Many infections do not result in apparent illness [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and acutely ill individuals do not always seek care or receive confirmatory testing [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, multiple surveillance strategies are possible (e.g. active and passive, vector-based and human); all have tradeoffs that may vary depending on the epidemiological situation. For example, a previous assessment of human-based surveillance systems to detect ZIKV transmission in U.S. counties found that despite low probabilities of care-seeking among ZIKV-infected individuals, testing symptomatic people seeking medical care was a more effective strategy than testing blood donors or all pregnant women [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Testing pregnant women was found to be a less efficient strategy because it requires more tests, has a much higher false positive rate, and has a lower probability of detection than testing only patients with two or more Zika symptoms.</p><p>Effective prevention and control of arboviruses such as ZIKV, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus is dependent on timely and accurate detection of elevated viral activity in the population. Surveillance systems detect virus circulation, track geographical spread, monitor epidemic progression, detect adverse health outcomes associated with infection, and guide response efforts [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Although previous work suggested that testing clinical patients with at least two ZIKV symptoms was a relatively effective strategy for detecting ZIKV transmission in humans, the probability of detection was &#x0003c;25% even under optimal circumstances and incidence of one infection per 10,000 people per week in a population of 100,000 [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, none of the surveillance strategies evaluated could detect even 5% of all ZIKV infections.</p><p>An alternative to detecting arboviruses in humans is virological surveillance in mosquitoes, which involves capturing and testing host seeking female mosquitoes. For West Nile virus, which has a primary transmission cycle between infected <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and birds, virological surveillance in mosquitoes can facilitate viral detection prior to human disease case identification [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, transmission of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses occurs mainly between <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and human hosts. Even during outbreaks, detecting these viruses in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is infrequent [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this context, the possible tradeoffs between vector and human virological surveillance are unclear. Here, we leveraged a unique set of data from human and vector surveillance during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Caguas, Puerto Rico to compare strategies for detecting and monitoring arbovirus activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study includes frequencies of ZIKV cases in humans obtained from online weekly reports from the Department of Health, Puerto Rico.

The relationships were similar to those generated with a uniform population size of 100,000 people for each system; mean expected number of infected humans increasing by 47.6 (95% CI: 0, 341.9) and 19.7 (95% CI: 0.6, 167.4) infections per additional confirmed case or positive pool, respectively.</p><fig id="pntd.0007988.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0007988.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Time series relationship between the actual number of positive mosquito pools and human cases in Caguas, Puerto Rico, and estimated incidence rate of human infections.</title><p>Panel A shows the actual number of ZIKV positive mosquito pools (navy bars) in the Caguas study area and confirmed human cases (red bars) in Caguas municipality from October 10, 2016, to April 16, 2017.

Although the 95% CIs overlapped for all weeks, the 50% CIs had minimal overlap during late 2016 when incidence in both systems was relatively high. Overall, estimates based on human surveillance were substantially higher in most weeks of 2016 and the incidence rate of the entire study period was 90 (95% CI: 50, 140) infections per 10,000 people based on mosquito pool data in the vector surveillance area versus 500 (95% CI: 340, 680) based on human surveillance data in all of Caguas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><p>Population-based surveillance and detection of ZIKV is critical to guide timely public health and medical responses to emerging epidemics. Optimal surveillance strategies should be sensitive, specific, and cost-effective [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-transmitted arbovirus surveillance systems have widely focused on testing the human population at risk. In a previous comparison of human-focused ZIKV surveillance approaches, a strategy focusing on patients seeking emergency department care was found to be more effective and efficient than routine testing of pregnant women or blood donors [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Virological surveillance of <italic>Aedes</italic> transmitted arboviruses in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> provides an alternative approach to early detection of virus circulation and monitoring of transmission dynamics during outbreaks that does not depend on human surveillance.</p><p>In our simulation models for high transmission scenarios, both vector and human surveillance strategies effectively detected ZIKV. In low transmission scenarios, routine mosquito surveillance with high trap numbers had higher detection probabilities, although the probability of detection was still low (7%). This increased sensitivity also implies that for every confirmed human case there are more infected humans in the population than for every positive mosquito pool. That difference may result from the higher barriers to testing among humans in our model, which included developing two or more symptoms seeking care in an emergency department, and being viremic at the time of testing [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Identification of a positive mosquito pool is not influenced by the same contingencies.</p><p>In contrast to the simulations, more human cases (127) than positive pools (49) were observed in Caguas, suggesting that human surveillance may be more sensitive than virological surveillance of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. Part of this difference is explained by the different population coverage (130,000 for human surveillance and 80,000 for vector surveillance). However, using the model to estimate the infection rate in both populations, we found that the difference was still clear; in almost every week the estimated incidence was higher using human surveillance data. The discrepancy may result from higher risk in the additional 50,000 people covered by human surveillance, but there is no obvious reason for this to be the case. Alternatively, the difference may result from mischaracterization of human surveillance in the simulation model. The model was limited to patients seeking care in an emergency department with two or more ZIKV symptoms, whereas the actual surveillance data likely includes individuals from other health facilities, those with only one ZIKV symptom, patients suspected of having infection for other reasons, and individuals who may have been infected outside of Caguas. These components commonly vary across surveillance systems and locations, and all of these could lead to underestimates of the sensitivity of human surveillance in the simulations.</p><p>Overall, the simulations suggested that virological surveillance of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as performed in Caguas could potentially provide improved sensitivity to detect virus transmission, but the data from Caguas tell a different story. The observed data confirm that both systems were able to detect transmission in high and low incidence weeks, but they also indicated higher sensitivity for human surveillance. It is also important to consider these approaches in context. The Caguas study was conducted in high and low incidence periods after the peak of the outbreak in July 2016, when clinicians and the local population were already sensitized to ZIKV, which may have increased the number of observed cases. Passive surveillance for arboviral diseases in clinical patients is routine in Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and many other locations, so testing of humans may represent little or no additional resource burden. In contrast, mosquito surveillance is less widely implemented and thus may require even more resources, especially for laboratory testing. The resource investment of mosquito-based surveillance is directly related to the sensitivity, which is not necessarily true for human surveillance. In the absence of human surveillance systems or to identify local transmission risk by detecting infected mosquitoes, virological surveillance of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> may be an effective approach.</p><p>An important limitation to this study is that we did not collect data on attendant costs required for virological surveillance in mosquitoes and humans (e.g., traps, field work, laboratory supplies). These resource considerations are not trivial in terms of man hours and laboratory test costs. A second limitation was the considerable uncertainty around key model parameters. We accounted for uncertainty by sampling from parameter distributions, but those distributions were based on data from other locations and therefore do not necessarily reflect the reality of surveillance in Caguas. As described above, this was particularly evident when comparing the simulations to the observed data. We also used a very generic representation of trapping effort, including only the number of traps per person and collections based on the data from Caguas. We therefore ignored all components of spatiotemporal variability in vector populations, trapping effort, and incidence, despite their importance [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The simulations suggested some potential gains in sensitivity for virological surveillance of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, a finding substantiated by the detection of ZIKV in mosquitoes in Mexico without reported human cases [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the increased resources needed are likely prohibitive in most circumstances. For example, during the study period there were 8,518 tests on mosquito pools in a subsection of Caguas compared to 452 tests on suspect human cases in all of Caguas. Some of the testing burden may be ameliorated by using &#x0201c;superpools&#x0201d; for mosquito testing [<xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but the trapping itself also remains a challenge. Moreover, despite the intensive mosquito trapping and testing in Caguas and the small proportion of ZIKV-infected people who seek care, human surveillance was more sensitive than mosquito surveillance. In communities without health care facilities or in which people do not seek care, virological surveillance in mosquitoes have an important role. Virological surveillance in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> could also potentially help detect low levels of virus circulation, but only with extensive trapping and testing. In most situations where human surveillance systems already exist, such as in Caguas, human surveillance is likely to be more effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007988.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007988.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007988.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Positive predictive value of testing mosquito pools for Zika virus and emergency department patients with two or more Zika virus symptoms.</title><p>Panel A describes the positive predictive value (PPV) of a single positive Trioplex Real-time RT-PCR Assay test result on a pool of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females.
