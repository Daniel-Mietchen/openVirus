<p>We infer signatures of virusâ€“virus interactions from the nonrandom patterns of virus mixing captured by coinfection information by assessing whether the propensity of a given virus X to coinfect with another virus Y was higher, lower, or equal to the overall propensity of any (remaining) virus group to coinfect with virus Y. We adjusted for the effects of age, gender, patient origin (hospital versus general practice), and the time period (with respect to the 3 major waves of the 2009 IAV pandemic). To distinguish interactions between explanatory and response viruses from unrelated seasonal changes in infection risk, we also adjusted for the monthly background prevalence of response virus infections.</p>
