<p>We evaluated correlations in the monthly prevalence time series for each pair of respiratory viruses. We first employed a simple bivariate nonparametric cross-correlation analysis by estimating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and observed 26 significant virus–virus correlations, 13 negative and 13 positive (

However, examining whether these are genuine virus–virus interactions (mediated at either the host or population level) required us to address several methodological limitations in this relatively simple approach: It fails to account for autocorrelation in the time series of individual viruses, or for potentially confounding factors which might independently explain correlations, and it can produce spurious negative correlations with proportional data or, alternatively, spurious positive correlations with absolute infection counts.
