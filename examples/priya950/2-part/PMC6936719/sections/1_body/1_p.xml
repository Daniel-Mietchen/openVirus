<p>Early interest in the potential for interference among taxonomically distinct groups of respiratory viruses stemmed from epidemiological observations of the temporal patterns of infection in respiratory virus outbreaks (

It was postulated that rhinovirus (RV) may have delayed the introduction of the pandemic virus into Europe (
