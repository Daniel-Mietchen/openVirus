<p>The role of adaptive immunity in driving virus interferences that alter the population dynamics of antigenically similar virus strains is well known (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For example, antibody-driven cross-immunity is believed to restrict influenza virus strain diversity, leading to sequential strain replacement over time (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Such antibody-driven virus interactions might even shape the temporal patterns of RSV, human parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV) infections, which are taxonomically grouped into the same virus family (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, where antigenically distant virus groups are concerned, the mechanisms are obscure, although the variety of possibilities includes innate immunity, resource competition, and other cellular processes (

 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) viral growth to the attenuation of disease (

 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It has also been shown that cell fusion induced by certain viruses may enhance the replication of others in coinfections (
