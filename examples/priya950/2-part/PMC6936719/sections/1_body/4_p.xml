<p>Here, we apply a series of statistical approaches and provide robust statistical evidence for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses. We examined virological diagnostic data from 44,230 episodes of respiratory illness accrued over a 9-y time frame in a study made possible by the implementation of multiplex-PCR methods in routine diagnostics that allow the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses from a single respiratory specimen. Each patient was tested for 11 virus groups (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), providing a single, coherent data source for the epidemiological examination of infection dynamics of both cocirculating viruses in general and coinfection patterns in individual patients. Using these data, our study addresses the following questions: 1) Is there statistical evidence of virus–virus interactions in the temporal patterns of infection at the population scale?, 2) Is there statistical evidence of virus–virus interactions in coinfection patterns at the individual host scale?, and 3) Is a short-lived immune-mediated interference at the scale of individual hosts sufficient to induce asynchronous seasonal patterns of infection at the population scale?
