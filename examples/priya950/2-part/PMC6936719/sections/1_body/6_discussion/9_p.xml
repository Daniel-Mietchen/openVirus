<p>It is important to consider that virus–virus interactions are likely shaped by evolutionary processes and thus their existence, magnitude, and dominant form (whether competitive or facilitative) may not be static in nature, and instead depend on particular virus strains, as well as host and environmental factors (
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The virus–virus interactions we detect may represent a “net effect” of the evolutionary processes (
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) driving the virus strains circulating in the UK population over the 9-y timeframe of this study. It should also be borne in mind that a large proportion of respiratory infections, including influenza, are expected to be asymptomatic (
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and coinfections of some viruses may be associated with attenuated disease (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the form of interaction detected in a patient population, although of clinical importance, may differ from that occurring in the community at large.
