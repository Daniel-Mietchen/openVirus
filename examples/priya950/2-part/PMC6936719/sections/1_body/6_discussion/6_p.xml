<p>Age patterns of infection may provide important insights into the opportunity for, or alternatively the consequences of, virus–virus interactions. A lag in epidemic peaks across children and adults has been observed in the case of RSV (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Such a lag between ages may influence the potential for interaction with other cocirculating viruses, or it may reflect niche segregation as a consequence of viral interference. Although an interference between RSV and IAV has been proposed (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), a hypothesis recently supported in an experimental ferret model (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), this was not supported by our data. It is possible that such an effect was masked because our analysis did not enable stratification of effects by age, a step that is anticipated to severely limit the statistical power of our highly comprehensive analysis of virus–virus interactions. More detailed investigation to address more precisely when, and among whom, virus–virus interactions occur will be an important challenge for future research.
