<p>Of further note is the lack of interaction detected between IAV and IBV, since there is some suggestion from global data of a short lag between their outbreak peaks. However, epidemiological data are inconsistent in that they report both asynchrony and codominance (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). We believe that a lack of confirmation of interference between IAV and IBV is consistent with current virological understanding. These viruses are genetically and antigenically different; although studies have identified cross-reactive B cell and T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the viral genome (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), sufficient natural cross-protection has not been demonstrated (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is, however, possible that their ecological relationship depends on the particular strains cocirculating. Further work is needed to better understand how the existence and nature of virusâ€“virus interactions varies at the level of virus strains. On the other hand, some evidence exists in support of immune-driven interference between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our data did not permit reliable analysis at this level of virus differentiation because low and inconsistent numbers of influenza cases were routinely subtyped.
