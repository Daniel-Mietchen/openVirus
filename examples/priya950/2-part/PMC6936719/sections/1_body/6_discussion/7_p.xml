<p>Our study describes positive interactions among respiratory viruses at the population scale. These positive epidemiological interactions were not mirrored at the host scale, which suggests they are independent of host-scale factors and may instead be explained by variables that were not captured by our study. For example, some respiratory viruses, such as RSV and MPV, are known to enhance the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia (

 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is possible that we are observing an intermediary effect of secondary bacterial infections, which may lead to enhanced hospitalization with both viruses, rather than a direct virusâ€“virus interaction.
