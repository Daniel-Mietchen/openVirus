<p>Our study provides strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among genetically broad groups of respiratory viruses at both population and individual host scales. Our findings imply that the incidence of influenza infections is interlinked with the incidence of noninfluenza viral infections with implications for the improved design of disease forecasting models and the evaluation of disease control interventions. Future experimental studies are required to decipher the biological mechanisms that underpin virusâ€“virus interactions and their effects on the within-host dynamics of infection.</p>
