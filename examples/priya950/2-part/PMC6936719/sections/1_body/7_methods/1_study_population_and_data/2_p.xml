<p>Data were available to our study for the period January 2005 to December 2013 comprising 61,427 clinical samples, most of which were nasal and/or throat swabs (98%). The test results of individual samples were aggregated to the patient level using a window of 30 d to define a single episode of illness, giving an overall infection status per episode of respiratory illness. This yielded a total of 44,230 episodes of respiratory illness from 36,157 individual patients. In this study population, 35% (15,302) of patient episodes were virus-positive, 8% (1247) of which were coinfected with more than one virus group.</p>
