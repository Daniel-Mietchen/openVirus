<p>These data provide a coherent source of routine laboratory-based data for inferring epidemiological patterns of respiratory illness, reflecting typical community-acquired respiratory virus infections in a large urban population (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Of the total 44,230 episodes of illness, 62% (27,284) were tested for all 11 virus groups, increasing to 83% (22,420) among 26,974 episodes tested out with the 3 major waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation. More than 99% of patients were tested for all viruses in each calendar month (except for AdV in 2005 to 2007, PIV4 in 2005, and during pandemic influenza). Virological diagnostic assays remained consistent over the 9-y period, with the exception of the RV assay, which was modified during 2009 to detect a wider array of RV and enteroviruses (including D68), and 1 of 4 CoV assays (CoV-HKU1) was discontinued in 2012.
