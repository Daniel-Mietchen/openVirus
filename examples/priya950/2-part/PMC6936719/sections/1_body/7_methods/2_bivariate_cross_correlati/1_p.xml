<p>Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were computed and tested between all pairs of virus infection prevalences (the proportion positive among those tested) in each month using cor.test in R (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) version 3.4.4 (
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). These analyses were based on 26,974 patient episodes of respiratory illness excluding the period spanning the 3 major waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation. We additionally conducted an analysis of the distribution of correlation coefficients generated under the null hypothesis of no virus–virus interactions. To do so, we randomly permuted the monthly prevalence time series of each virus pair 1,000 times and computed the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of each distribution of correlation coefficients. See
