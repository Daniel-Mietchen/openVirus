<p>To address these methodological limitations, we developed and applied a statistical approach that extends a multivariate Bayesian hierarchical modeling method to times-series data (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The method employs Poisson regression to model observed monthly infection counts adjusting for confounding covariates and underlying test frequencies. This framework uses a multivariate normal distribution to model the random temporal variation in the adjusted virus counts, naturally incorporating a between-virus covariance matrix that enabled estimation of virusâ€“virus correlations. Through estimating, and scaling, the off-diagonal entries of this matrix, we were able to estimate posterior interval estimates for correlations between each virus pair. Under a Bayesian framework, posterior probabilities were estimated to assess the probability of zero being included in each interval (one for each virus pair). Adjusting for multiple comparisons, correlations corresponding to intervals with an adjusted probability less than 0.05 were deemed significantly different from zero. Crucially, the method makes use of multiple years of data, allowing expected annual patterns for any virus to be estimated, thereby accounting for typical seasonal variability in infection risk while also accounting for covariates such as patient age (as well as gender and hospital vs. general practice [GP] patient origin). We identified significant interactions between IAV/RV, IBV/AdV, RSV/MPV, and PIV1/PIV2. See
