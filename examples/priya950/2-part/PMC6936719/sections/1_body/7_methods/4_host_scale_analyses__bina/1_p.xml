<p>We analyzed the patient-level coinfection data with a series of binary logistic regression models and evaluate whether virus–virus interactions may be explained by interactions operating at the scale of individual hosts. Of the 44,230 total episodes of respiratory illness, 73% represent patients experiencing a single episode during the 9-y study period, while the remaining 27% represent patients experiencing 2 or more episodes (range 2 to 26; mean = 3 episodes per patient). Retaining the first observed episodes generated 36,157 patient records and 20,703 with complete testing across all virus groups [note that pressures on laboratory resources led to high partial testing during the major waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation]. Of these 20,703 patients, 6,884 were virus-positive, 11% of which were coinfected with 2 or more viruses. We note that the coinfection prevalence and detected virus–virus interactions were robust to the choice of window used to define an episode of illness when aggregating individual samples (see
