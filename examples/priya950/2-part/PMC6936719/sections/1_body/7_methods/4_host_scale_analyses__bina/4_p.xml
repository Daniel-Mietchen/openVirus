<p>Specifically, the relative odds of coinfection with virus Y (versus any other virus group) was estimated for each of the 8 explanatory viruses, for each response virus Y. Thus, each virus model (IAV, IBV, RV, RSV, CoV, AdV, MPV, PIVA, and PIVB) used a specific subset of the virus-positive population (because each virus model excluded virus-negative patients and single infections involving only the response virus Y) with each data subset ranging from 4,629 to 6,743 (see
