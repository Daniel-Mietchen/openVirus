<p>This framework was implemented in MATLAB software v.R2013b using the ode45 differential equation solver. Each simulation was run for a period of 20 y; a “burn-in” period of 10 y was excluded from the analyses. Using this framework, we quantified the effect of transient immune-mediated viral interactions on the percentage decrease in daily nonseasonal common cold-like virus prevalence during peak seasonal influenza-like virus activity.</p>
