<p>We developed a 2-pathogen deterministic SIR-type mechanistic model to study the population dynamics of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus cocirculation. We used this framework to compare the frequency of common cold-like virus infections with and without an interference with the influenza-like virus. A schematic representation of the model is provided in

 </ext-link>. The temporal dynamics of the viruses were distinguished in 2 key ways. First, seasonal forcing was applied to the influenza-like virus (virus 1) via a sinusoidally varying transmission rate. Second, the rate of waning immunity of the common cold-like virus (virus 2) was assumed to be 10 times faster than for the influenza-like virus. This more rapid replenishment of susceptible individuals was designed to reflect the high year-round prevalence and diversity of circulating subtypes that are characteristic of RV infections (
