<p content-type="flushleft">where {1,2} denotes the infection status of individuals with respect to virus 1 (the seasonal influenza-like virus) and virus 2 (the nonseasonal common cold-like virus) for each of 12 combinations of infection classes, whereby S = susceptible, I = infectious refractory phase, J = noninfectious refractory phase, R = immunity phase, and subscripts 1 and 2 denote the corresponding virus-specific parameters. For example, {SI} indicates the state of being susceptible to virus 1 and infectious with virus 2.

 <sub>1</sub>(t) denotes the time-dependent rate at which new infections with virus 1 are generated and comprises a fixed transmission parameter B together with a seasonal amplitude parameter b; and 
 <italic>φ</italic> represents a background, nonacute-respiratory-infection–induced rate of mortality given by 1/the average life expectancy (days

 <sub>0</sub>s of these 2 viruses assuming a completely susceptible homogeneous population are 1.6 (virus 1) and 2 (virus 2). Full parameter values and ranges are provided in
