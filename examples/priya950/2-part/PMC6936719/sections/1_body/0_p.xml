<p content-type="flushleft">The human respiratory tract hosts a community of viruses that cocirculate in time and space, and as such it forms an ecological niche. Shared niches are expected to facilitate interspecific interactions which may lead to linked population dynamics among distinct pathogen species (

In contrast, evidence for the occurrence of virus–virus interactions remains scarce and the potential mechanisms are elusive, demanding greater research attention. The occurrence of such interactions may have profound economic implications, if the circulation of one pathogen enhances or diminishes the infection incidence of another, through impacts on the healthcare burden, public health planning, and the clinical management of respiratory illness.
