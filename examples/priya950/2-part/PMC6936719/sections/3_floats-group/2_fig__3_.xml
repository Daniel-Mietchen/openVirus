  <p>Negative and positive interactions among influenza and noninfluenza viruses at population scale. Significant unadjusted correlations from bivariate cross-correlation analysis applying Spearman’s rank method to monthly viral infection prevalences are shown in gray, with negative and positive correlations indicated by − and +, respectively, and noncorrelated virus pairs in white. Significant support for virus–virus interactions based on correlations derived from Bayesian disease mapping analysis adjusting for fluctuations in testing frequency, temporal autocorrelation, and alternative drivers of correlated seasonality are shown in blue (negative) and red (positive).</p>
