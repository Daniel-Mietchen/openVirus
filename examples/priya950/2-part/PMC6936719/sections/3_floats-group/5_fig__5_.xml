  <p>Mathematical ODE models simulating the impact of viral interference on the cocirculatory dynamics of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Percentage decrease in the minimum daily incidence of common cold-like virus infections during peak influenza-like virus activity for varying interaction strengths and refractory periods. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Asynchronous incidences of influenza-like virus (in red) and common cold-like infections in the presence (blue) and absence (green) of interference with the influenza like virus. This example assumes a strong interaction (Ï† = 1) and 7-d refractory period shown over 10 simulated years. The R
   <sub>0</sub>s of these viruses assuming a completely susceptible homogeneous population are 1.6 (virus 1) and 2 (virus 2). The model supports the hypothesis that temporary nonspecific protection elicited by influenza explains the periodic decline in rhinovirus frequency during peak influenza activity (
