<p>The mechanism of pathogenesis associated with heparin-binding is driven by electrostatic interactions at the five-fold axis of the virus surface. Alteration of the five-fold axis may affect capsid instability resulting in conformational changes which trigger genome uncoating, bypassing the need for receptor-virus binding. Mouse adaptation in poliovirus is controlled by a balance between capsid plasticity during uncoating and thermostability of the virion [

Multiple VP1-244 variants (244K, 244T and 244E) were generated with different effects on electrostatic interactions with heparin (K&gt;T&gt;E). As K to E represents a non-conservative substitution, the virus has evolved to transition through a non-charged residue (T) which has lower fitness cost during viral dissemination [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. As GAGs are ubiquitous in tissues, a natural selective pressure thus exists to revert weak heparin-binding variants to heparin-binding variants which can then attach to and infect a wide range of tissues. This observed dynamic switching between weak and strong heparin-binding phenotypes highlights the importance for the virus to maintain an optimal electrostatic interaction for stable capsid conformation.
