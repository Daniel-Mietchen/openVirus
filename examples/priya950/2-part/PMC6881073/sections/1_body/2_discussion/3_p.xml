<p>Establishment of viremia is crucial for further dissemination to other target tissues such as skin and invasion into CNS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. During 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> dissemination, the strong binding affinities of heparin binders KEQ and IEQ increase the likelihood of virus being sequestered by tissue GAG, resulting in rapid virus clearance from blood circulation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This gives rise to a low viremia level with a substantial reduction of virulence in mice. Kobayashi and colleagues reported that KEG virus is less virulent compared to KEE due to the former harbouring the VP1-145G residue, enabling the virus to adsorb more strongly to heparin, resulting in attenuated virulence in SCARB2-expressing transgenic mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similarly, IEE, KEE and KKE were cleared slowly in the bloodstream, and the poor heparin-binder IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> remained in the blood. Our findings that a strong heparin-binding phenotype attenuates virulence is also observed in other viruses, including Sindbis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], West Nile virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], yellow fever virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Using a monkey model, Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the establishment of viremia was strongly correlated with EV-A71 neuroinvasion into CNS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A clinical study correlating prolonged viremia in EV-A71 patients with severe CNS involvement further suggests the importance of viremia in determining severity outcome [
