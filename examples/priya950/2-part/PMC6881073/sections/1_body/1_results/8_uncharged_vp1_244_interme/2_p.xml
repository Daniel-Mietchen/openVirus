<p>Deep sequencing of the EV-A71-positive organ samples revealed changes mainly at position VP1-145 and VP1-244 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, Q145E mutation was detected in hind leg muscle samples 7 dpi-M1 and M2 with frequency of over 80%. We observed a sequential transition of 244K to 244E from day 7 to day 9 post-infection. At day 7 post-infection, VP1-244K was predominant in two out of five hind limb samples (M1 and M2), while only a single sample (M4) showed VP1-244E as the dominant viral population. Notably, we identified a substitution, VP1-K244T from the hind limb of sample 7dpi-M3 with high frequency of over 90%. Sample 7 dpi-M5 also showed 244T and 244E, but due to poor sequencing coverage it was eliminated from the analysis. The emergence of an uncharged 244T intermediate appears to be important during the transition from positively-charged 244K to negatively-charged 244E, which is a radical change in physicochemical properties. As infection progressed, VP1-244E was solely detected in the organs harvested at day 9 post-infection, further affirming the contribution of VP1-244E to
