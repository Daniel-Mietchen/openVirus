<p>To test if VP1-244E variant will develop specific mutation or reversion during cell culture adaptation, the IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> homogenates harvested from muscle and brain were propagated in RD cells. No significant CPE was observed in passage 1, and therefore the cell supernatants were collected for further propagation. At passage 2, mild CPE was observed with three out of four samples showing VP1-244E had reverted very quickly to 244K (
