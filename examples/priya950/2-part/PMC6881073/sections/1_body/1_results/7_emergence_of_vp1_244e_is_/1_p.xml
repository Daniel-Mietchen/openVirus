<p>To determine if emergence of the VP1-244E mutation is critical for systemic dissemination, we next examined neurovirulence (the ability to directly infect the CNS) of all the EV-A71 variants following direct intracerebral inoculation. A dose of 1 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of each of the EV-A71 variants was intracerebrally injected into separate litters of one-day old mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Similar mortality rates (100% mortality at day 4 post-infection) were shown by the IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> variants, the former having been earlier shown to be highly lethal following i.p. infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Notably, IEQ infection, which caused 66.7% mortality when inoculated intraperitoneally, now showed a drop of virulence to 8.3% (n = 1) mortality following i.c. infection. Detection of the VP1-K244E mutation by sequencing in organ samples from dead IEQ-infected mice further confirmed its importance as a neuroinvasion determinant. No virus was detected in the remaining mice with no disease symptoms. Taken together, our data indicates that the critical mutation conferring neuroinvasive phenotype to the IEQ variant is VP1-244E, which mainly arises during systemic dissemination when IEQ is inoculated intraperitoneally and not directly into the brain.
