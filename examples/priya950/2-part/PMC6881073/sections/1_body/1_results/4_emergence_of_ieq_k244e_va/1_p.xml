<p>Since VP1-244K is a key determinant of heparin-binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we speculated that the emergence of VP1-244E had abolished the heparin-binding of the IEQ variant. To investigate the role of VP1-K244E mutation in heparin-binding and virulence in mice, we introduced this mutation into the IEQ variant through site-directed mutagenesis. The IEQ variant with K244E mutation (termed IEQ-244E) however failed to achieve high virus yield in cell culture for subsequent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. We thus collected IEQ-244E and IEE from the brain homogenates (indicated with 
 <sup>+</sup>) for subsequent experiments, after confirming the sequences using Sanger sequencing. IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> displayed significant reduction of heparin-binding compared to clone-derived IEQ and IEE, and IEE
 <sup>+</sup> (

 <sup>+</sup> from brains and muscles showed dominance of 98E and 145E, which explained the weak heparin binding observed (
