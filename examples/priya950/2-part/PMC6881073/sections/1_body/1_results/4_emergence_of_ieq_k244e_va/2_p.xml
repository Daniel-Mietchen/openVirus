<p>To determine the association of heparin-binding and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, we then infected one-day old suckling mice with clone-derived IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> by i.p. administration. Brain homogenate from IEQ-infected surviving mice was also harvested and used as a negative control (IEQ
 <sup>+</sup>; viral RNA not detected in RT-PCR). At day 4 post-infection, 100% mortality was observed in IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup>-infected mice but none of the mice succumbed to IEQ
 <sup>+</sup> infection (
