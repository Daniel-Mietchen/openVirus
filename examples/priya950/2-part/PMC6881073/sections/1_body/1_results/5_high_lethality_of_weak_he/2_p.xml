<p>To investigate the association of viremia with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenesis, three- to four-week-old mice were infected intravenously with KEQ, KKE, KEE, IEE, IEQ and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> variants. Blood samples were then collected at 5, 15 and 30 min post-inoculation for viral load quantitation. Both strong heparin-binding variants KEQ and IEQ showed rapid viral clearance, with approximately 70% cleared from the bloodstream at 30 minutes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Weak heparin-binding variants such as KKE, KEE and IEE displayed mild reduction of viremia throughout 30 minutes. Only about 23% of IEE had been cleared by 30 minutes post-infection. A sustained viremia level with minimal clearance was observed in IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup>-infected mice. Our data indicated stronger heparin-binding resulted in low viremia levels in the host, which may be due to adsorption and sequestration of viruses in surrounding tissues. The low viremia level may render the virus less efficient in disseminating to other organs, as seen in KEQ and IEQ variants.
