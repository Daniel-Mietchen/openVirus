<p>We have previously described the role of VP1-98 and VP1-145 as modulators of heparin-binding in cell culture [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the present study, we elucidated the role of heparin-binding in shaping EV-A71 virulence in mice. Five EV-A71 variants were engineered from a laboratory-adapted EV-A71 strain (5865/SIN/00009, subgenogroup B4), which posesses VP2-149K, VP1-98E and VP1-145Q residues (designated as KEQ, following amino acid residue order). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the five variants denoted as KKQ, KKE, KEE, IEE and IEQ (
