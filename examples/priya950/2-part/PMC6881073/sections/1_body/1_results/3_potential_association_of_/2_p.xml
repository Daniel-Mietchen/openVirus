<p>We further asked why the IEQ variant, a strong heparin binder, exhibited a relatively high virulence in mice. Viral genomic RNA from the brains and hind limbs of dead IEQ-infected mice (n = 3) were harvested for genome sequencing, and revealed that the IEQ variant had acquired a VP1-K244E mutation (
