<p>To determine the role of heparin-binding in EV-A71 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, we performed intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection of one-day old suckling mice with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of each EV-A71 variant. The clinical score and survival analysis of infected mice are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. IEE-infected mice exhibited the highest virulence 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, with all the infected mice dying by day 4 post-infection (n = 10). Notably, 66.7% (n = 8) of the IEQ-infected mice died by day 12 post-infection, followed by 20% (n = 2) mortality in KEE-infected mice. Consistent with previous findings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], EV-A71 variants with VP1-145E were associated with an increased virulence phenotype in animal models, except for KKE. Mice infected with other EV-A71 variants showed no apparent clinical signs and survived beyond day 13 post-infection. These data suggest that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenicity in mice was increased by an additional VP2-K149I mutation, as demonstrated in the IEE-infected mice.
