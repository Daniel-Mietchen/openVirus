<p>IEE was experimentally proven to be highly lethal in mice. However, we observed that IEQ selectively acquires VP1-K244E over the VP1-Q145E mutation to gain neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g006">6</xref>). We reasoned that VP1-244E exhibits weaker heparin-binding ability compared to VP1-145E, and therefore, could be favorably selected

 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis to characterize the heparin-binding affinity of VP1-145E and VP1-244E. VP1-98, 145 and 244 are located around the five-fold axis of the EV-A71 pentamer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Based on the electrostatic maps, the five-fold axis of the IEQ variant is highly positive-charged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), implying strong affinity to heparin. With the VP1-Q145E substitution, IEE has lower positive charges at its five-fold axis. Since the VP1-244K residue is protruding from the surface of the five-fold axis, substitution of a positively-charged lysine residue to a negatively-charged glutamic acid at this position greatly reduces the electrostatic potential on the five-fold axis and could change the capsid conformation.
