<p>When examining the heparin docking of non-synonymous variants detected by NGS, the additional VP1-E167G mutation had no effect on interaction energy compared to IEQ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Interestingly, variants with VP1-L97R and VP1-N104S mutations showed slight increase in the interaction energy of IEQ-244E variants, suggesting an enhanced effect of heparin-binding. Although IEQ-244E-97R showed very weak binding strength similar to IEQ-244E, a compensatory effect was seen in the 97R site which singly contributes to a more negative interaction energy, i.e. strong heparin-binding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Meanwhile, the additional VP1-N104S mutation has also increased the heparin-binding of IEQ-244E variant. Taken together, different compensatory mutations could emerge to overcome the capsid instability and alter the virus fitness.
