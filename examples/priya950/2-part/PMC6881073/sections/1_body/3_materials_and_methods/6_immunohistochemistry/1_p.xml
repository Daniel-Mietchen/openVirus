<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed by the standard ENVISION technique as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Briefly, deparaffinised and rehydrated tissue sections were blocked using standard immunoperoxidase procedure before antigen retrieval (30 minutes, 99°C, Tris EDTA buffer with 0.05% Tween-20). Tissues were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal EV-A71 VP1 (GeneTex, USA) at 4°C overnight. After washing, tissues were then incubated with goat-anti rabbit HRP-conjugate (Dako, Denmark) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Tissues were stained using DAB (Dako) and counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako). The tissues were mounted using DPX (Dako) prior to examination under a light microscope. The negative control tissues for IHC included mock-infected ICR mice brains (n = 2) and hind-limb muscle tissues (n = 2). Isotype control antibodies or normal rabbit immunoglobulin fractions (Dako) were also used to exclude non-specific staining.
