<p>A binding assay was performed using columns with immobilized heparin sepharose beads as previously reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In brief, 200 μl of heparin sepharose (Abcam, UK) was aliquoted into a Pierce Spin Cup with cellulose acetate filter (Thermo Scientific, USA). The heparin sepharose beads were washed twice with binding buffer (0.02 M Tris-HCl, 0.14 M NaCl, pH 7.4), before addition of each virus variant (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU in 600 μl). The columns containing viruses were incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C, and this was followed by centrifugation and 5 washing steps. The heparin-bound viruses were collected after eluted with elution buffer (0.02 M Tris-HCl, 2M NaCl, pH 7.4). Both virus input and output fractions were quantitated using real-time PCR, and the heparin binding efficiency was normalized by dividing the output viral RNA copy number over the input viral RNA copy number.
