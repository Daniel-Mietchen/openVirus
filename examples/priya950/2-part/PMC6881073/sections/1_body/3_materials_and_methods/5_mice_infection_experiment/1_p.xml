<p>Groups of one-day old ICR suckling mice (n = 9 to 12) were obtained from AEU. Each group of suckling mice were either intraperitoneally or intracerebrally inoculated with 1 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of each EV-A71 variant or PBS alone. All infected mice were monitored daily for weight change and health status up to 13 days post-infection. A clinical score was recorded using the following grades: 0, healthy; 1, weak or less active; 2, hunched posture and lethargy; 3, one-limb paralysis; 4, two-limb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. Moribund mice were sacrificed and removed along with any mice found dead. Harvested mice organs were homogenized using hard tissue homogenizing mix (Omni International, USA). RNA was extracted from the homogenates with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The viral loads in organs were determined using TaqMan fast virus 1-step master mix (ABI, USA). One step RT-PCR was also performed to amplify viral RNA from the organs using MyTaq One-Step RT-PCR kit (Bioline, UK) for Sanger sequencing or deep sequencing. Illumina Miseq (Illumina, USA) was performed with 150 nucleotides and 250 nucleotides paired end reads. All listed mutations had an average coverage of at least 20,000 reads unless otherwise stated. The NGS reads were analyzed using CLC Bio Genomic Workbench (Qiagen) and Geneious Prime (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). Only variants with frequency &gt;1% were reported.
