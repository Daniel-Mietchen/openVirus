<p>For the virus clearance assay, 3- to 4 weeks old ICR mice (weighing within 25-35g) were i.p. injected with ketamine/xylazine cocktail prior to infection. Anesthetized animals were then intravenously inoculated with 5 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of each EV-A71 variant via the tail vein. At certain timepoints, blood was collected from anaesthetized mice through the retro-orbital plexus with the use of a sodium heparinized hematocrit capillary (Hirsschmann, Germany). The collected whole blood was then used for viral RNA quantitation.
