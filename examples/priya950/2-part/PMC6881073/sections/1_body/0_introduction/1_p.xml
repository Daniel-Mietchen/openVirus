<p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes cyclical outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in the Asia-Pacific region [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HFMD primarily affects children younger than 5 years old. The clinical manifestations are usually mild and characterized by fever, oral ulcers and skin rashes on hands and feet [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In some cases, infection also results in severe neurological complications, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis and death [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are no licensed antivirals, and licensed vaccines are only available in China. The EV-A71 genome encodes a polyprotein with a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The polyprotein is cleaved into four capsid proteins (VP1 to VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C and 3A to 3D). The capsid proteins form a protomer, and five protomers form a pentamer, and then twelve pentamers assemble around a genome forming a provirion. The five-fold axis symmetry is formed by VP1 and surrounded by a canyon. Virus-receptor binding at the canyon or other physical alterations, such as heat, will displace the lipid pocket factor and trigger viral uncoating [
