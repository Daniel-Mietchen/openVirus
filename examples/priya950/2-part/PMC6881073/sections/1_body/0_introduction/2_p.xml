 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have roles in EV-A71 attachment or entry. Following infection, EV-A71 can disseminate to different organs and invade the human central nervous system (CNS) either through retrograde axonal transport or hematogenous spread [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the neuropathogenesis of EV-A71 remains unclear and virulence determinants are not well elucidated. Recent reports have shown that EV-A71 strains with VP1-145G/Q were more frequently isolated from severe HFMD with neurological complications [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These findings were also consistent with studies in cynomolgus monkeys, in which strong selection of VP1-145E over VP1-145G was observed [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. VP1-145G/Q residues but not VP1-145E are responsible for binding to the receptor PSGL-1 [
