   <italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of constructed EV-A71 variants.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Schematic illustration of the EV-A71 genome and the infectious clone constructs. Different amino acids were substituted at VP2-149, VP1-98 and VP1-145 (labeled in bold), with reference to the wild type (WT) strain KEQ. (B) The clone-derived EV-A71 variants were propagated in RD cells and showed comparable plaque morphologies (C) The binding affinity of EV-A71 variants to heparin sepharose beads was analyzed. (D) Inhibitory effect of heparin on EV-A71 variants was evaluated by pretreating the viruses with soluble heparin before infection of RD cells. Results are presented as mean Â± SD (n = 3). Error bars indicate standard deviations from triplicates. Statistical significances are denoted with *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 as compared to the WT.
