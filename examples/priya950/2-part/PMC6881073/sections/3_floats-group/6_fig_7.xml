  <title>Sequential emergence of K244E mutation involves intermediate transition variants.</title>
  <p>One-day old suckling mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of IEQ. (A) At days 3 and 7 post-infection, mice were euthanized to harvest their hind limb muscles and brains. At day 9 post-infection, two moribund mice were sacrificed for processing (highlighted in red). At the end of the experiment (day 11 post-infection), the remaining three healthy mice were sacrificed and categorized as ‘survivors’. The boxes indicate RT-PCR results for EV-A71 for each muscle and brain sample. A total of nine samples were positive, comprising five muscle samples from day 7 post-infection, and two muscle and brain samples from day 9 post-infection. (B) NGS results showing the frequency of different variants at the VP1-145 and VP1-244 sites. Note that 7 dpi-M5 sample had poor sequencing coverage. M indicates muscle; B indicates brain.
