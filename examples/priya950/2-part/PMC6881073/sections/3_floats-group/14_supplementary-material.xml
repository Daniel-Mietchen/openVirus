  <title>Effects of EV-A71 exposure on a porcine 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB model.
  </title>
  <p>Illustration of the porcine 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB model which simulates the movement of virus particles through an 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> BBB, in which the luminal side represents the blood capillary while the abluminal compartment represents the brain (A). The 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> model was exposed to different EV-A71 variants with titer of 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU. The BBB permeability induced by EV-A71 variants were assessed in terms of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), with a greater reduction of TEER indicating greater permeability of BBB through tight junction leakages. The TEER was recorded at 2 hours (B) and 6 hours post-exposure (C) along with non-infected cell controls (white bars) and normalized with TEER values measured before virus exposure. Results are presented as mean ± SD (n = 6). Significant differences between viral variants and WT (black bars) are labelled as * (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and **(
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), using the Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test.
