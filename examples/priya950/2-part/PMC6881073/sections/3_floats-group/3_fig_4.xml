  <title>Viral load quantitation from harvested organs and viremia level induced by EV-A71 variants.</title>
  <p>(A) At selected time points, IEQ, IEE and IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup>-infected mice (n = 5) were sacrificed and viral loads were determined from harvested hind limbs and brains using qRT-PCR. Significant differences between viral variants are labelled as ** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and *** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). (B) Virus clearance from blood was quantitated using qRT-PCR following intravenous inoculation of KEQ, KKE, KEE, IEE, IEQ or IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> into 3â€“4 weeks old mice. The viral RNA copies were quantitated at selected timepoints up to 30 minutes. The data are presented as V
   <sub>t</sub>/V
   <sub>0</sub>, indicating the fraction of viral RNA copies at each timepoint (V
   <sub>t</sub>) over the initial viral RNA copies (V
   <sub>0</sub>). Significant differences between KEQ and IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> are labelled as * (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and ** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
