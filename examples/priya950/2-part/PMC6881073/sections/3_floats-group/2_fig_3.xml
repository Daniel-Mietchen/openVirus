  <title>Characterization of virulent phenotype of IEE and IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> variants.
  </title>
  <p>(A) EV-A71 variants collected from the brain homogenates of dead infected mice were compared to clone-derived variants for heparin-binding properties. (B) One-day old suckling mice (n = 8â€“12) were infected with IEE, IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> and IEQ
   <sup>+</sup> through i.p. injection. A control group receiving PBS injection was also included. The clinical scores and percentage of survival are shown over 13 days post-infection. Significant differences compared to WT are labelled as ** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and ***
   <italic>P</italic> (&lt; 0.001). Tissue samples of mice which succumbed to IEE (n = 2) and IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> (n = 2) infection were subjected to IHC and H&amp;E staining. Virus antigen was seen in muscle cells (C), along with increased inflammatory infiltrates. In brains (D), antigen-positive neurons were seen in the pons (representative image from an IEE-infected brain) and dentate nucleus (representative image from an IEQ -244E
   <sup>+</sup>-infected brain), with mild inflammation in the cortex shown by H&amp;E staining. Magnification for IHC staining: X40; H&amp;E staining: X20.
