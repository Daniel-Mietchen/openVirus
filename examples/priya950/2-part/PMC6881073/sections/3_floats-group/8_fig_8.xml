  <title>Comparison of electrostatic surface properties of the EV-A71 structure.</title>
  <p>The analyzed amino acid residues are labelled in different colors in the EV-A71 capsid pentamer structure (PDB ID: 4AED). (A) The front views of the EV-A71 pentamer are displayed along with a magnified view of the five-fold axis using Chimera 1.10.1. (B) Electrostatic surface properties of IEQ, IEE and IEQ-244E variants were examined. Electrostatic charges are contoured from red (-5 kcal/mol·e, negatively-charged) to blue (+5 kcal/mol·e, positively-charged). Magnified views of the five-fold axis are shown for each variant. Total interaction energy (C) and individual interaction energy of residues (D) within a 4Å radius of EV-A71 variants and VP1-244 variants docked to heparin were evaluated. Total interaction energy (E) and individual interaction energy of residues (F) within a 4Å radius of other mutations detected from NGS docked to heparin were examined.</p>
