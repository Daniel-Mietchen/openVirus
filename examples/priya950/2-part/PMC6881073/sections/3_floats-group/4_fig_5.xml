  <title>High fidelity and impairing recombination attenuate 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence of IEQ.
  </title>
  <p>The RdRp of IEQ was modified to harbor the high fidelity G64R and L123F mutations (HF) or the recombination-deficient Y276H mutation (Rec
   <sup>-</sup>) and virulence was analyzed in mice. (A) EV-A71 subgenomic replicon (EV-A71 Nluc Rep), EV-A71 Nluc Rep-HF (HF mutations are indicated by yellow triangles), EV-A71 Nluc-Rep-Rec
   <sup>-</sup> (Rec
   <sup>-</sup> mutation is denoted by orange triangle) and truncated replicon (EV-A71 Nluc Rep-del3D) were transfected separately into RD cells. (B) Luciferase activities were determined up to 8 hours post-transfection. Significant differences between replicon variants and WT are labelled as *** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0. 001). (C) Virulence of IEQ-HF, IEQ-Rec
   <sup>-</sup> and IEQ following i.p. infection of mice was measured by clinical scores and percentage of survival. IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
   <sup>-</sup> curves are identical to that of the mock-infected PBS group. Significant difference between viral variants and IEQ is labelled as ** (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
