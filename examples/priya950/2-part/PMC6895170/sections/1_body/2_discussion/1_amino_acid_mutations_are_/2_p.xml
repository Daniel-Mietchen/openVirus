<p id="Par15">Almost all the networks are robust to the random or targeted removal of about 10% of nodes and they start showing differential behavior beyond this (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The differences in network characteristics relative to a random or a targeted node removal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), combined with one of the interpretations in the network theory

 </sup>, leads us to a possible hypothesis. Scale free (powerlaw) networks were originally speculated to be stable against any attack, and only later

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> it was learnt that while this may be true under a random attack, these networks are vulnerable to a targeted attack. A possible inference, specifically for the viral complexity, is that the viruses with powerlaw covariance networks may be vulnerable to an attack on a group of their amino acids in a targeted manner. This inference is conceptual in nature, suggesting that there might be a better way to design drugs targeting even these otherwise complicated viruses. The drug targets may be chosen from either the same protein or from multiple proteins, as suggested by the strength of intra- or inter-protein interaction networks. However, the practical choices of drug targets, chosen from the networks, and the possible consequences are out of the scope of the present work.
