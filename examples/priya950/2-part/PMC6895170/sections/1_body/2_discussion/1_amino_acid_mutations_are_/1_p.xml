<p id="Par14">Mutations occur very frequently among viral proteins. Yet among these variations occurring at different sites, in different viral proteins, there are interdependencies. Most co-evolution or covariance based studies focused on bacterial proteins, and very few on viral proteins. Some examples are of intraprotein co-evolutionary interactions in the GAG polyprotein of HIV subtype B

While interesting questions on genome-wide relationships among different viruses had been raised in that work, in a similar spirit as the present work, the analyses were based on less than hundred sequences. Several issues remained unclear - the sensitivity of these analyses to larger data sets, to a different choice of the definition of covariance, the origins of power-law and possible connections to the biological complexity of viruses. These are the questions we explored in this work. Even with the choice of larger data sets, the covariance relations remained.
