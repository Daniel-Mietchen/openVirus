 </sup>. The multitude of coevolutionary relations among viral proteins could be arising out of direct interactions among themselves as well as because of the common interaction partners in the host. These interaction networks involve hundreds of human proteins

 </sup>. We investigated the possible correlation of number of common interaction partners and the number of covariance connections for protein pairs for HIV, human influenza and dengue (Methods section) and is shown in Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>. The positive correlation between the strength of covariance couplings and the number of common interacting host proteins in dengue virus was partly reassuring about the utility of covariance method, although the no pattern could be seen in the other two virus-host interactions.
