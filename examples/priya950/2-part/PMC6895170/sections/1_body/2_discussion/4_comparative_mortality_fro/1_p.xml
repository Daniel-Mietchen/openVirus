<p id="Par21">An important question to pursue is about why the human immune system finds it easy to fight certain infections and not others. On the surface, defining the complexity of the viral infections seems plausible because the viral genome is relatively simple, and is about 1000 times smaller than the bacterial genome. An attempt to define and quantify the complexity of the viral genome seems relevant and timely, especially since the genomic data is becoming readily available. However, it is difficult to describe complexity, and even more to quantify it with one single measure. The lack of a simple and precise metric for complexity is a challenge both in biology as well as from theoretical calculations. For biological complexity of viruses, here we use the strength on virus Richter scale

 </sup> as a surrogate measure. Virus Richter scale indicates mortality from viruses, which implicitly includes several factors from how fast the virus mutates to how poor the public health provisions are. We use virus Richter scale as, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other metric comparing the strengths of viruses or difficulty of developing vaccines against them. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows a plot between the virus strength and the network characteristic - network density. Richter scale data for avian influenza was not available and hence was not included in this analysis. The observed anticorrelation between the network density which is a network metric and the biological metric is obtained from just four viruses (
