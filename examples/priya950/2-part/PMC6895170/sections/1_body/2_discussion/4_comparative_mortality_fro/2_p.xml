<p id="Par22">Node-degree distribution of the covariance networks, depending on the virus, was demonstrated to assume qualitative patterns ranging from predominantly powerlaw to a predominantly random network distribution. It was also clear from the results that the random component quantitatively has a higher contribution to the node degree. Thus the higher values of the network density in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> reflect higher contributions from the random components, and the reducing network density describes the transition from primarily random network to one with a powerlaw. The former type of network was seen more sensitive to random attacks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which offers a plausible thread of logic for why with the continuously decreasing network density, decreases the randomly networked connections making the overall network of interactions resilient to random attacks on them.
