<p id="Par7">Using the complete genome data from different patients, the covariance networks for different viruses were constructed. We performed the Principal Component Analysis on the covariance matrix, rank ordered the eigenvalues and used Cattell’s criterion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup> for noting the significant number of clusters. This criterion resulted in about 3 to 4 significant clusters for all the viruses. Clustering of nodes was also performed in Cytoscape software, using correlation as a weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with the goal of observing patterns which are more general than those seen in pairwise relations and this analysis also resulted in 3 to 4 significant clusters. As can be seen, the amino-acid composition of each of the clusters in the viruses was noticeably different. In HIV the inter-protein covariance relations are much stronger. The same qualitative difference is quantitatively summarized by the number of connections within and between different proteins in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref> to 1e. The summary of the fine-grained inter- versus intra-protein covariance relation strengths in each of the clusters is visualized as chord-diagrams and the compositions of the clusters from different proteins are represented in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A-E</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> respectively. Seen at the protein-protein interaction level, clearly there are interactions between any pair of proteins, however, the differences in the numbers of interactions or the overall strengths come from basing the analysis at an amino acid level. For dengue, hepatitis and human influenza also the clusters have residues from multiple proteins.
