<p id="Par13">We examined the possible relation of covariance couplings to host-virus interactions, with the interactomes from dengue, human influenza and HIV-1. Two different comparisons were made: (i) the number of common host proteins between a pair of proteins and the total number of inter-protein covariance couplings for this pair (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>) (ii) the importance of a viral protein in the combined virus-host interactome, quantified by the eigenvector centrality, and the number of total covariance couplings a protein has (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Other centrality measures were also analyzed, but there was no difference in the conclusions. The two different comparisons showed correlation between the number of covariance couplings and the strength of interactions in the interactome for dengue. The same pattern could not be seen in the interactome data we used for the other viruses. With the data available, the viral interprotein interactions were classified as direct, indirect mediated by host proteins, and non-existent (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>), but no clear inference could be drawn. We performed a complementary analysis by counting the number of viral proteins that each host protein interacts with. The analysis represented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows that the viral proteins are clustered closely in dengue and influenza interactomes because many of the host proteins interact with more than one viral protein, making the couplings stronger.
