<p id="Par10">Network density is the fraction of the edges (connections) between the nodes in a network relative to the total number of edges possible between the nodes from purely combinatorial considerations that edges can be formed between any pair of nodes. The densities were calculated using Cytoscape software, and they range from sparse to dense networks. These parameters are related to the qualitative nature of the node-degree distribution, as the sparse networks tend to be scale-free, while dense networks are more likely to be random networks. In fact, network density parameter quantified the transition from different degrees of randomness to systematic connections which result in power-laws, and we wanted to compare this with a known metric of biological complexity. The only scale that we are aware of, that makes a direct comparison between the impact of different viruses is the Virus Richter scale

 </sup>, which ranks viruses according to the logarithm of the mortality they cause. The network density for each virus was calculated by choosing the threshold which was the cusp of the transition between random to powerlaw behaviors. The network density from our calculations was plotted against the virus Richter scale in Fig.
