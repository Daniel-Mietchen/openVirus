<p id="Par8">One advantage of transforming the covariance matrix into a network is that several systems-level statistical analyses can be performed. The complexity of the networks is analyzed by studying its node-degree distribution, 
 <italic>n</italic>(
 <italic>k</italic>) - the number of times a node with a certain number of edges 
 <italic>k</italic> appears in the network
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Two commonly observed universality classes in these distributions - power-law and Poissonian, suggest a systematic or random underlying basis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>

 </sup>, 
 <italic>γ</italic> ~ 1, was significantly observed, while dengue and human influenza show random distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Hepatitis and avian influenza on the other hand showed a mixed behavior including both powerlaw and random behaviors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We further analyzed the role of the threshold by varying 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>th</italic>
 </sup> in the analysis of hepatitis. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, as the 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>th</italic>
 </sup> was increased from 0.50 to 2.0, the powerlaw component becomes more pronounced (similar data for other viruses is shown in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> to 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The data shows a clear separation of network connections arising from two different origins, an organized network of covariance above a certain threshold and random network connections at lower thresholds of covariance. Within this powerlaw regime a further change in cutoff did not result in a change in the exponent significantly. We also performed another simple phylogenetic check by comparing the analysis on dengue serotype 1 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), with that on the combined data from all dengue serotypes. While this analysis does not prove that the phylogenetic effects were negligible, it does suggest that even strong phylogenetic corrections such as performing the analysis only on one subtype did not change the conclusions.
