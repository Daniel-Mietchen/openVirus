<p id="Par9">The analysis presented so far is the statistical description of data collected from patients and is averaged over all the years of sample collection. In order to study the temporal evolution patterns, we performed time analysis on the data set which is most abundant, human influenza (subtype A). We divided the complete genome data from human influenza into periods where the number of sequences is similar (~2000 complete genomes each). A node-distribution analysis shows that over this period, there is no significant change in the covariance complexity of viruses (Supplementary Fig.Â
