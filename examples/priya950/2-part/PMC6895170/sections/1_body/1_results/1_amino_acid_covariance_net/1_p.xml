<p id="Par6">Degree of conservation is a statistical measure at individual amino acid level, and covariance is its extension to pairwise amino acid interactions. In this work we create a systems level extension of this pairwise covariance, the amino acid covariance network, which can represent the statistical nature of the variations in the complete viral genome across patients. Large scale genomic data of viruses was obtained from the NCBI servers (Methods section). With the current publicly available data, and our constraint that complete genome data from at least 1000 patients is available, only five viruses were chosen for analysis: HIV-1 subtype B (referred to as HIV), hepatitis subtype B (referred to as hepatitis), dengue, avian influenza and human influenza subtype A (referred to as human influenza); however, the availability of such data is increasing. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the complete genome data from all patients was performed. Using consensus sequence as a reference, the entire MSA was converted into a binary representation, 1 if the amino acid at a given position in a sequence is the same as that in the consensus sequence, 0 otherwise. Using the Statistical Coupling Analysis protocol

 </sup>, weighted covariance matrix 
 <bold>C</bold> that quantifies the relations among the different amino acids was created. The covariance matrix was further corrected for phylogeny effects by eliminating the component corresponding to the highest eigen value, as well by removing the modes with eigenvalues smaller than the eigenvalues of a random matrix (Methods section). Since the sequences for viruses which are from a cohort rather than across multiple species are closely related, the modes other than the first one also could have contribution from phylogeny and hence the covariance can have phylogenetic origin. The data on pairwise covariance was then converted into a network representation, where the amino acids form the nodes and the covariance relations form the edges or the connections between the nodes. The network representation allows visualization and analysis of the relations at a complete genome level, more intuitively than with covariance matrices,
