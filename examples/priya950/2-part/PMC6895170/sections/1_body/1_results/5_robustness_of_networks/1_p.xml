<p id="Par11">In typical network analyses, pairwise relations are used for constructing the network, and the systems-level statistical properties are interpreted from it. As such it is important to see the effect of the removal of a few nodes and the edges connected to them

 </sup>. The change in the system level properties such as network diameter on the removal of a few nodes has been interpreted as the sensitivity of the network to a random or targeted attack

 </sup>. We checked for the robustness of amino acid covariance network by removing different fractions of nodes and all the edges connecting to them, the spirit being that the critical amino acids or groups of them can be a potential drug target. The nodes to be removed were chosen according to two strategies: (a) randomly or (b) by picking those with the highest degree, to simulate a random error or a targeted attack, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows how the effective diameter - a metric of network connectivity - is affected by the targeted or random removal. Targeted removal has the highest effect on HIV followed by avian influenza. For these two virus covariance data sets, the difference between targeted and random removal of nodes is significant, compared to all other viruses. The disruption of the network in the case of HIV, with the removal of a small fraction of the nodes, suggests that very few nodes act as hubs and moderate most of the interactions in the network. The overall characteristics of robustness may be intuitively expected from the the power-law distribution of nodes.
