<p id="Par12">The powerlaw exponents, 
 <italic>γ</italic> ~ 1, observed in our study is different from the usually observed power-laws with 
 <italic>γ</italic> ~ 2 − 3 for which there are several mechanistic explanations including influencer models
 <sup>

 </sup>. In our analysis the exponent was also robust to halving the data sets, and needed an alternative interpretation relevant for covariance. Considering amino acid conservation (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) as a surrogate for their fitness, we developed a fitness based model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. The model uses two distributions derived from the whole genome data: (a) the distribution of the conservation among the amino acids, 
 <italic>p</italic>(
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>) (b) the covariance fitness potential of the node 
 <italic>η</italic>(
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) corresponding to a given conservation of the amino acids. The latter can be modeled as a gaussian distribution, with minimal covariance fitness for amino acids with very high and very low conservation, a peak in between at 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> and standard deviation 
 <italic>σ</italic>. Considering a pair of amino acid nodes 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>, and two random numbers 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> drawn from a uniform distribution, edge 
 <italic>i</italic> − 
 <italic>j</italic> is created in our model if 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> ∗ 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> ≤ 
 <italic>η</italic>(
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) ∗ 
 <italic>η</italic>(
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub>). This algorithm generates a node-degree distribution with 
 <italic>γ</italic> ~ 1 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The model explains power-law with exponent 
 <italic>γ</italic> ~ 1, random distribution, and a transition to the powerlaw, as seen in hepatitis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, for HIV, the conclusion is relatively invariant for a gaussian with 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> = 0.6–0.7 and 
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0.02–0.07. As the parameters go out of this range, node degree distribution eventually transforms to a random network model.
