<p id="Par3">One way of describing the systems-level complexity involved in healthy and diseased cells is by studying interaction networks. Biological networks can be formed out of transient molecular interactions such as in proteins interacting with other proteins

Protein-protein interaction networks reveal several insights into the cellular functioning, such as the proteins in the network hubs which ubiquitously interact with other proteins, the evolutionary conservation of the networks across different species, and systems-level stability of the networks under removal of certain proteins.
