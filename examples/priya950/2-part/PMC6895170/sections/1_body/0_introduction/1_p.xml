<p id="Par2">The genome size and complexities in different organisms vary widely. While bacteria have genes encoding several thousand types of proteins, most viruses have barely around ten types of proteins. This is true for viruses as benign as common flu to the lethal ones like ebola. As the number of base-pairs encoding these genes across the species varies from hundreds of millions to tens of thousands, the mutation rate which is the chance of making an error over a generation increases by many orders of magnitude

 </sup>. Despite this high rate of mutations or errors in the amino acids of viral proteins, many viruses remain functional and infect the hosts possibly because many deleterious mutations are compensated by other mutations. Continuously evolving viruses thus become much more unpredictable both for the immune system as well as the drugs developed against them. Characterizing the evolutionary behavior of viruses will thus be an important step towards understanding the complexity of viruses. Yet, to date there is no theoretical way of describing the complexity of viruses and their evolution.
