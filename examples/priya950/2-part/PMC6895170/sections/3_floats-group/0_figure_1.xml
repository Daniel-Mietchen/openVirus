  <p>Covariance networks from complete genome analysis of different viruses: (
   <bold>A</bold>) HIV, (
   <bold>B</bold>) Avian influenza, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Hepatitis (
   <bold>D</bold>) Dengue andÂ (
   <bold>E</bold>) Human influenza. The networks are generated using covariance strength as a weight. The side bar indicates the different types of proteins found in these viruses, as well as the coloring notation used. The networks show three to four major clusters. While in HIV, each cluster has a mixed representation from all the proteins, avian influenza clusters are mainly from intraprotein covariance relations. Network representations were generated using Cytoscape
