  <p>Node degree distribution sensitivity was studied in hepatitis network by changing the cut-off value used for defining edge connectivity between the nodes. At a very low cut-off there is a mixed behaviour in the node degree distribution, with both power-law as well as a random component. As the cutoff is increased, the random component is selectively removed, while preserving the power-law component. This suggests a clear separation of network connections from random and systematic origins. By choosing a threshold value, one can filter and study just the systematic component. The dashed line corresponding to power-law with exponent âˆ’1 is drawn for reference.</p>
