   </sup>. HIV and avian-influenza data show a significant difference between targeted and random removal, the latter being much lower, suggesting that these networks can be destabilized more by a targeted attack. After removing a very high fraction of nodes, networks break down into smaller disconnected clusters, resulting in a decreased diameter, and this part of the data where the network is heavily destabilized is not shown in this graph.
