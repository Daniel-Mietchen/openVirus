  <p>Analysis of host-virus interactions was performed using the interactomes of human protein with HIV, dengue and human influenza (details in Methods section). The networks of interactions are shown in (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) with the host and viral proteins represented in cyan and red colors respectively. The number of viral proteins any given human protein is interacting with is denoted as the node-degree (viral) and the number of such proteins in the interactome are indicated on the y-axis in (
   <bold>D</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>). HIV has the highest number of proteins interacting with a single viral protein and dengue has the largest number of host proteins interacting with more than one viral protein.
