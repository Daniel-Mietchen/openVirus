We determined the immunogenicity of two homologous and one heterologous intramuscular prime-boost vaccination regimens using replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors of human serotype 26 and 35 (Ad26 and Ad35), expressing a prototype antigen based on the wild-type fusion (F) protein of RSV strain A2 in adult, RSV-naive cynomolgus macaques. All regimens induced substantial, boostable antibody responses that recognized the F protein in pre- and postfusion conformation, neutralized multiple strains of RSV, and persisted for at least 80 weeks. Vaccination induced durable systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses characterized mainly by CD4+ T cells expressing Th1-type cytokines, as well as RSV-F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgG, and IgA in the respiratory tract. Intramuscular immunization with Ad26 and 35 vectors thus is a promising approach for the development of an optimized RSV vaccine expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses that distribute systemically and to mucosal sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Drug discovery</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), recently reclassified as a member of the pneumovirus family,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> causes annual recurrent epidemics of upper and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in people of all ages, with young infants and the elderly being particularly susceptible to severe disease in part owing to limitations in immune function compared with adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> With 64 million cases estimated annually, RSV is the leading cause of LRTI in children under the age of 5, causing approximately three million hospitalizations and up to 199,000 deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Natural infection with RSV induces only short-lived and incomplete protection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> allowing reinfection with RSV to cause considerable morbidity and mortality also in the elderly.

The high, regimen-independent, and boostable immunogenicity of this RSV prototype vaccine demonstrates that vectors based on Ad26 and Ad35, even when applied intramuscularly and in a homologous regimen, are a promising platform for the development of an RSV vaccine and can be expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 prime-boost regimens induce durable antibody responses that recognize RSV-F in its pre- and postfusion conformation and neutralize multiple RSV strains</title><p id="Par6">Immune responses in cynomolgus macaques were measured over 86 weeks after intramuscular immunization with three prime-boost regimens using Ad26 and Ad35 expressing RSV-FA2.

First, in cynomolgus macaques, CD4+ and CD8+ responses in the lung were characterized by secretion of the Th1 cytokines IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;. In addition, binding and functional antibodies as measured by ELISA and virus neutralizing assay (VNA), respectively, developed with similar, rather stable kinetics, indicating that there was no loss of functionality in the presence of a persistent binding antibody response. Finally, both vectors used in this study previously showed a strong Th1-type immune response in mice and did not induce ERD in the cotton rat model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Th1-type immunity has also been observed in response to an Ad26-based human immunodeficiency virus vaccine in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and may be a characteristic intrinsic to the vector backbone irrespective of the encoded insert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">In summary, we conclude that the largely regimen-independent, boostable, durable, and respiratory tract-directed immunogenicity of Ad26 and Ad35 vectors expressing the prototype antigen RSV-FA2 in the NHP model demonstrates that Adenoviral vectors are a promising vaccine platform for the development of an RSV vaccine for use in infants and elderly, expected to safely induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses. The prototypic RSV-FA2 vaccines in this study have been assessed in two completed Ph1 studies in healthy adults (NCT02561871 and NCT02440035). Replacement of the prototypic wild-type FA2 antigen by a stabilized pre-F protein is expected to further enhance the magnitude and quality of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the Adenoviral vector platform, without changing systemic and mucosal responses. Therefore, ongoing clinical evaluation is focusing on optimized vectors expressing RSV-F in a stabilized pre-F conformation (studies NCT03334695, NCT03339713, NCT03303625, NCT02926430, NCT03606512, and NCT03502707).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par23">The study was conducted in a facility assured by the NIH OLAW (National Institute of Health Office of Animal Welfare) and accredited by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) and AAALAC (International, Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) operated by Advanced BioSience Laboratories Inc.

To coat plates with cross-linked co-stimulatory anti-CD49d, sterile 96-well round-bottom, tissue culture-treated polystyrene plates (VWR, Radnor, PA) were incubated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of 2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml affinity purified antibody F(ab&#x02019;)2 fragments of Goat-anti-Mouse IgG(H&#x02009;+&#x02009;L) (Beckman Coulter, Carlsbad, CA, catalog number IM1618) in D-PBS, washed twice with D-PBS, incubated with 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml of unconjugated, co-stimulating antibody targeting CD49d (BD Biosciences, clone 9F10, catalog number 556634) in D-PBS for &#x02265;1&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and washed one final time with D-PBS.</p><p id="Par36">Stimulated cells were washed in FACS staining buffer (D-PBS with 0.5% FBS) and incubated in 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l 0.02% EDTA (UltraPure EDTA, 0.5&#x02009;<sc>m</sc>. pH 8.0, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in D-PBS (Quality Biological) for 15&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to disengage interactions of the cells with the cross-linked co-stimulatory antibody.

Cells were washed in FACS staining buffer, then surface stained for 30&#x02009;min at RT in the dark with 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of a cocktail containing antibodies targeting CD3 (BD Biosciences, clone SP34-2, catalog number 557917, 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), CD4 (BD Biosciences, catalog number 562843, clone L200, 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), CD8 (BD Biosciences, catalog number 557834, clone SK1, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), CD28 (BD Biosciences, clone L293, catalog number 337181, 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), and CD95 (clone DX2, catalog number 561978, 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;l). Cells were then washed in FACS staining buffer, fixed, and permeabilized with Caltag Fix &#x00026; Perm solutions (Life Technologies), and incubated with 130&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of a cocktail containing antibodies targeting CD69 (Beckman Coulter, clone TP1.55.3, catalog number 6607110, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), IL-2 (BD Biosciences, clone MQ1-17H12, catalog number 560702, 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), IFN&#x003b3; (BD Biosciences, clone B27, catalog number 560924, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;l), and TNF&#x003b1; (BD Biosciences, clone Mab11, catalog number 552889, 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;l) for 20&#x02009;min at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the dark, then washed in FACS staining buffer, and fixed in 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l freshly prepared PBS with 0.1% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA). Uncompensated flow cytometric events were acquired on a Beckton-Dickinson LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) 1&#x02013;24&#x02009;h after fixation. BD CompBeads (Anti-Mouse IgG&#x003ba; and Anti-Rat IgG/Negative Control (FBS) compensation particles, BD Biosciences) stained separately with the individual monoclonal antibodies used in the test samples, were used as a basis for electronic compensation. Samples were analyzed in one single technical replicate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Multi-parameter ICS data analysis</title><p id="Par37">Test samples were electronically compensated for spectral spill-over of fluorochromes and gated using FlowJo version 9.4.11 software (FlowJo LLC., Ashland, OR). Gates for the expression of CD69, IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-2, CD95, and CD28 on PBMCs were based on fluorescence-minus-one controls (FMO-controls) as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and on positive and negative ICS controls. Lymphocytes were identified on forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) characteristics after exclusion of doublets based on their FSC-area/FSC-height characteristics, exclusion of dead cells based on positivity for the Live/Dead cell discrimination fluorochrome (amine reactive) and based on determination of CD69 co-expression. To allow multifunctionality analysis, Boolean gates were calculated for activated, cytokine-secreting cells. ICS data were subjected to an exploratory positivity analysis, which utilized the method described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> To identify samples responding to the RSV-FA2 peptide pool stimulation with expression of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; or IL-2 within the CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, a two-by-two contingency table was created to compare data from the peptide-stimulated test samples with their corresponding negative controls. Each of the tables contained four records with the number of cells positive and negative for expression of one of the detected cytokines (IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, or IL-2) in the test sample and negative control sample. To evaluate whether the number of positive cells in the stimulated sample was equal to that in the negative control, a one-sided Fisher's exact test was applied. The T-cell subset was marked as a responder to RSV-A2 peptides stimulation when the <italic>p</italic> value for the test sample exceeded 0.00001.</p><p id="Par38">Polyfunctionality analysis was performed separately for CD4 and CD8 T cells on Boolean cytokine gates. For visualization purposes, all individual populations were subjected to background subtraction based on their corresponding negative controls and any resulting negative values were censored to 0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par39">All immunological parameters (i.e., ELISA, VNA, ELISPOT, ICS) were log-transformed. Vaccine regimens were compared using two-sided tests based on analysis-of-variance, or analysis-of-variance for potentially censored values (Tobit regression). A Tukey correction was applied to account for multiple testing. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered statistically significant. The correlation between assays was examined using the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient. Since no formal lower limit of quantification was determined for ICS data, a stringent, exploratory statistical responder analysis was performed at week 14, to determine whether the antigen-specific T-cell responses after peptide stimulation differed significantly from background responses. Positive responses to RSV-F peptide stimulation within each functional T-cell population were determined per animal in comparison with the corresponding negative control, using a one-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in R 3.3.3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par40">Further information on research design is available in the <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
