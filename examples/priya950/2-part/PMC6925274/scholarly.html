Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) can cause severe respiratory disease, yet a licensed vaccine is not available. We determined the immunogenicity of two homologous and one heterologous intramuscular prime-boost vaccination regimens using replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors of human serotype 26 and 35 (Ad26 and Ad35), expressing a prototype antigen based on the wild-type fusion (F) protein of RSV strain A2 in adult, RSV-naive cynomolgus macaques. All regimens induced substantial, boostable antibody responses that recognized the F protein in pre- and postfusion conformation, neutralized multiple strains of RSV, and persisted for at least 80 weeks. Vaccination induced durable systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses characterized mainly by CD4+ T cells expressing Th1-type cytokines, as well as RSV-F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgG, and IgA in the respiratory tract. Intramuscular immunization with Ad26 and 35 vectors thus is a promising approach for the development of an optimized RSV vaccine expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses that distribute systemically and to mucosal sites.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), recently reclassified as a member of the pneumovirus family,<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup> causes annual recurrent epidemics of upper and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in people of all ages, with young infants and the elderly being particularly susceptible to severe disease in part owing to limitations in immune function compared with adults.<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a>,<a href="#CR3">3</a></sup> With 64 million cases estimated annually, RSV is the leading cause of LRTI in children under the age of 5, causing approximately three million hospitalizations and up to 199,000 deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries.<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup> Natural infection with RSV induces only short-lived and incomplete protection,<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup> allowing reinfection with RSV to cause considerable morbidity and mortality also in the elderly. Approximately 5.5% of adults over the age of 65 are infected with RSV annually, leading to pneumonia in 10–20% and death in 8% of those hospitalized owing to RSV.<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a>–<a href="#CR7">7</a></sup> At present, no treatment for RSV infection is available and prophylaxis is limited to palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein, which is licensed for prevention of severe LRTI in high-risk infants.<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a></sup> However, high costs and the need for monthly administration limit its application.<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup></p> <p id="Par3">Despite the significant disease burden, no vaccine is currently licensed for human use. Vaccine development for infants faces the obstacle of safety concerns raised after the occurrence of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) following natural RSV infection in RSV-naive infants that had received a poorly protective formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine in the 1960ies.<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a>,<a href="#CR11">11</a></sup> Although the functional mechanism for FI-RSV-induced ERD has not been fully elucidated yet, there are indications that a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) biased response and/or immune complex deposition and complement activation in the lung owing to the formation of poorly protective antibody responses with limited functional capability play a role in its etiology.<sup><a href="#CR12">12</a>,<a href="#CR13">13</a></sup> In elderly, ERD is not of concern, however several vaccines aimed to protect this population have been discontinued owing to missing signs of efficacy.<sup><a href="#CR14">14</a></sup></p> <p id="Par4">Protective immunity against RSV infection appears to involve multiple arms of the immune system. An important role is attributed to serum-neutralizing antibodies against RSV envelope proteins, mostly the fusion (F) glycoprotein, which are inversely associated with the risk of reinfection,<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a>,<a href="#CR16">16</a></sup> reduce the risk of RSV-associated illness,<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a>,<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup> LRTIs,<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup> and hospitalizations in both children and elderly adults.<sup><a href="#CR20">20</a>,<a href="#CR21">21</a></sup> Recently, it was shown that these neutralizing antibodies are predominantly prefusion F-specific.<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup> Systemic T-cell responses to RSV may additionally contribute to protective immunity against RSV disease in infants and in the elderly, although their role is less unequivocal.<sup><a href="#CR23">23</a>–<a href="#CR26">26</a></sup> Mucosal IgA and IgG responses in the nose and lung may further act as a first barrier against RSV infection at the portal of viral entry.<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a>,<a href="#CR27">27</a></sup> In addition, abundance of RSV-specific tissue-resident memory T cells in the lung correlates with reduced symptoms and viral load, implying their capacity to protect against severe respiratory viral disease when humoral immunity is insufficient.<sup><a href="#CR28">28</a></sup> Based on these observations, we hypothesize that a protective RSV vaccine needs to elicit RSV-specific immunity that is characterized by high levels of functional antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response that distributes systemically and to mucosal sites. Vaccines based on recombinant, replication-incompetent vectors derived from human Adenovirus serotypes with low pre-existing immunity on a population level, such as serotype 26 or 35 (Ad26, Ad35),<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a>,<a href="#CR30">30</a></sup> potently induce humoral and cellular, Th1-biased immune responses against various encoded antigens in animal models<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a>–<a href="#CR33">33</a></sup> and in humans.<sup><a href="#CR34">34</a>–<a href="#CR37">37</a></sup> In addition, Adenoviral vectors have a favorable safety profile in humans including infants,<sup><a href="#CR38">38</a></sup> and can be readily manufactured in high quantities under GMP conditions,<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a></sup> making them an attractive platform for an RSV vaccine.</p> <p id="Par5">In this study, we determined the immunogenicity of three intramuscular prime-boost vaccination regimens using Ad26 and Ad35 expressing the F protein of RSV strain A2 (RSV-FA2) as a prototype RSV antigen in cynomolgus macaques. Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2, were previously shown to induce RSV-specific humoral and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in mice, and to be safe, cross-neutralizing and protective against challenge with homologous and heterologous RSV strains in the cotton rat challenge and ERD model.<sup><a href="#CR40">40</a></sup> Here we show that in macaques, all three regimens induced substantial, boostable, cross-neutralizing, and long-lasting antibody titers, and T-cell responses characterized by expression of the Th1-type cytokines interferon-gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) that could be measured in peripheral blood and the respiratory tract, where protective immunity is particularly important to prevent RSV-mediated LRTI. The high, regimen-independent, and boostable immunogenicity of this RSV prototype vaccine demonstrates that vectors based on Ad26 and Ad35, even when applied intramuscularly and in a homologous regimen, are a promising platform for the development of an RSV vaccine and can be expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 prime-boost regimens induce durable antibody responses that recognize RSV-F in its pre- and postfusion conformation and neutralize multiple RSV strains</div> <p id="Par6">Immune responses in cynomolgus macaques were measured over 86 weeks after intramuscular immunization with three prime-boost regimens using Ad26 and Ad35 expressing RSV-FA2. With an interval of 12 weeks, five animals each received either a homologous prime-boost of 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (vp) of Ad26.RSV.FA2 mixed with 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp Ad35.RSV.FA2 (group "Mix/Mix�?, 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp total dose), a homologous prime-boost regimen of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.FA2 (group "26/26�?), or a heterologous prime-boost of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.FA2 followed by 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp of Ad35.RSV.FA2 (group "26/35�?, see Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a> for regimens, immunization timelines and sampling time points). Development of a neutralizing antibody response targeting the vector backbones was measured as an indication for vaccine take in the baseline Ad26- and Ad35-seronegative animals (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Vector exposure was reflected in seroconversion and subsequent increases in Ad26-neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in all animals receiving a prime and boost containing the Ad26-based vector (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1A</a>), whereas seroconversion upon prime immunization with Ad35 was rare (one of five animals) and re-exposure to the vector did not increase Ad35 NAb titers in all animals (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1B</a>), consistent with previous observations in NHPs and humans.<sup><a href="#CR33">33</a>,<a href="#CR37">37</a></sup></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Prime immunization with 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp of the Ad26/Ad35 mix or Ad26 alone induced measurable antibody responses binding to RSV-F in its postfusion and prefusion conformations (post-F and pre-F) in all animals (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). No significant differences were detected between the three regimens in the mean post prime responses averaged over weeks 0–12 to the post-F (Mix/Mix 2.31 standard deviation (SD) 0.89, 26/26 2.34 SD 0.98, 26/35 2.40 SD 0.77) or pre-F proteins (Mix/Mix 1.89 SD 0.91, 26/26 1.51 SD 0.87, 26/35 1.96 SD 0.98; all <i>p</i> values &amp;gt; 0.05; ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons), even though the mean pre-F-specific titers in the 26/26 group were slightly lower than those in the 26/35 group. Boost immunization with 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp of either the Ad26/Ad35 mix, Ad26, or Ad35, induced a strong expansion of antibody responses to both post-F and pre-F in all animals, resulting in a peak 4 weeks post boost for post F-specific antibodies (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a, d</a>) and 2 weeks post boost for pre-F-specific antibodies (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2b, e</a>).

Systemic T-cell responses are mainly mediated by CD4+ T cells that express TNFα or IL-2 in addition to IFNγ</div> <p id="Par11">To further characterize qualitative aspects of the systemic T-cell response to the three vaccination regimens, RSV-F-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed longitudinally by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and polychromatic flow cytometry (see Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">5</a> for gating strategy). Although systemic CD8+ T-cell responses were very low (data not shown), all three regimens induced RSV-F-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 responses in CD4+ T cells upon prime. As for IFNγ ELISPOT responses, ICS responses increased upon boost immunization, peaking 2 weeks post boost (week 14) and remaining above background levels until the end of the observation period (IFNγ responses shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4a–c</a>, TNFα, and IL-2 responses see Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">6</a>).

A functional subset analysis on the peak response at week 14 further showed a high degree of polyfunctionality across all three groups, in which more than half of the RSV-F-specific CD4+ T cells in each individual animal produced all three or any combination of two cytokines upon stimulation (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4a–c</a>, pie-graphs). A stringent, exploratory statistical responder analysis was performed at peak response on week 14, determining whether the antigen-specific T-cell responses after peptide stimulation differed significantly from background responses (one-sided Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). The analysis demonstrated a post boost responder rate of 100% for the 26/35 regimen (5/5 animals), followed by 80% in the 26/26 group (4/5 animals), and 60% in the Mix/Mix group (3/5 animals). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Adenoviral vectors expressing RSV.FA2 induce strong cellular responses in the lung, consisting of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with a high degree of polyfunctionality</div> <p id="Par12">To evaluate whether the different vaccine regimens induced mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract, RSV-F-specific responses were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) material at eight time points throughout the study (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). RSV-F-specific cytokine responses were determined on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in purified BAL cells by ICS. In contrast to the blood, all three regimens induced strong antigen-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 CD8+ T-cell responses in the lung (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a–c</a>), which were detectable 4 weeks post-prime. Responses increased considerably after boost administration (week 16) and remained detectable until week 86. CD4+ T-cell responses, which were ~10-fold higher than those determined in the blood, followed the same kinetics. No significant differences were detected in the group mean CD4 + responses after prime (week 4) or after boost (week 16) for any of the three measured cytokines (ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). Within the CD8+ T-cell subset, lower responses for all three measured cytokines were observed in the 26/26 group compared with the 26/35 group (<i>p</i> = 0.007 for IFNγ, <i>p</i> = 0.0009 for TNFα, and <i>p</i> = 0.031 for IL-2) and lower TNFα responses compared to the Mix/Mix group (<i>p</i> = 0.0026) after boost (ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). A functional subset analysis performed on the peak boost response in the lung at week 16 revealed a high degree of polyfunctionality within the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell compartments. A particularly high degree of polyfunctionality was detected in the CD4+ T-cell compartment, with more than half of the antigen-specific cells expressing all three evaluated cytokines in most animals, and any combination of two of them in a sizable percentage of the remaining cells (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5h</a>). The polyfunctional profiles of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were not statistically compared, but no obvious differences were detected between the three regimens. The antigen-specific CD8+ T cells showed a lower degree of tri-functionality compared with CD4+ T cells owing to lower expression of IL-2 as characteristic of an effector-type CD8+ T-cell response, but tri- and bi-functional T cells still constituted more than half of the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response in more than half of the animals (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5d</a>). The exploratory statistical responder analysis reflected the high peak responses in the lung at week 16, demonstrating that—as in blood—100% of the animals in the 26/35 group were statistical responders within the CD4+ and the CD8+ T-cell compartments (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4c</a>).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par15">Three different intramuscular prime-boost immunization regimens with Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 induced strong and durable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses to RSV-FA2 in cynomolgus macaques. Those responses were also present in the lung and nose, where protective immunity is particularly important to prevent RSV-mediated LRTI, and antibodies neutralized a wide array of RSV strains. All regimens induced immune responses of similar magnitude and quality across the assessed RSV-specific immune readouts, irrespective of whether a homologous or heterologous approach was chosen. This confirms our results in mice and cotton rats<sup><a href="#CR40">40</a></sup> and indicates that simple intramuscular prime-boost regimens using Adenoviral vectors are a robust approach to generating strong, cross-neutralizing and durable vaccine-mediated RSV-specific immunity that is able to migrate to the respiratory tract. As adult cynomolgus macaques are only semi-permissive to RSV without showing any clinical signs of disease<sup><a href="#CR46">46</a></sup> protective efficacy of the regimens was not assessed in this model. However, we previously demonstrated robust protective capacity of these vaccines against RSV-A2 and RSV B15/9 challenge in the permissive cotton rat model, compared with viral pre-exposure.<sup><a href="#CR40">40</a></sup></p> <p id="Par16">Although post-F-specific antibodies are able to neutralize RSV in in vitro assays to a certain extent, most neutralizing antibodies in serum from RSV-exposed subjects target the pre-F protein.<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a>,<a href="#CR44">44</a></sup> Pre-F-specific antibodies are reported to have higher affinity compared with those targeting post-F<sup><a href="#CR45">45</a></sup> and vaccines using stabilized pre-F induced substantially higher neutralizing antibody titers than post-F in preclinical animal models.<sup><a href="#CR47">47</a>–<a href="#CR49">49</a></sup> Wild-type F protein is intrinsically prone to refold from the labile pre- into the more stable post-F conformation on viral surfaces and in solution.<sup><a href="#CR50">50</a></sup> We therefore hypothesize that by expressing the wild-type F protein in cells after transduction, both the prefusion and postfusion conformations are expected to be presented on the surface of the vaccine-transduced cells, allowing the induction of prefusion F- and postfusion F-specific antibodies. We indeed observed that the vaccine regimens induced pre- and post-F-specific antibodies with similar kinetics, but with a bias towards post-F targeting responses immediately after each vaccination in most animals (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">3A–C</a>), which could confirm this hypothesis. Alternatively, antibodies recognizing epitopes common between pre- and post-F, which are detected by both used assays, may be induced more quickly. Over time, the ratio of pre- to post-F-specific antibody titers balanced, indicating that the initially high post-F-specific antibody responses may have been easier to induce, yet more short-lived than pre-F-specific responses, perhaps owing to different dynamics of B cell populations. Affinity maturation processes, on the other hand, likely play a role in the comparatively late onset of the pre-F-specific and neutralizing antibody responses.</p> <p id="Par17">To our knowledge, our study provides the longest preclinical follow-up of RSV-specific immunity upon vaccination to date, with durability being an important aspect of a vaccine intended to provide protection across annually recurring RSV epidemics. In contrast to reports on other vaccination approaches in NHPs, which either demonstrated rapid decline of initially high responses,<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a></sup> did not assess durability,<sup><a href="#CR52">52</a>,<a href="#CR53">53</a></sup> or applied a late boost immunization after set-point titers were reached,<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a>,<a href="#CR54">54</a></sup> we established that prime-boost vaccination with Adenoviral vectors induced humoral and cellular RSV-specific immunity that persisted systemically and in the lung for more than a year and a half. This long-term durability in the absence of a late boost may be facilitated by the sustained, polyfunctional RSV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses induced upon vaccination, providing IL-2 mediated T-cell help over time.</p> <p id="Par18">Although the magnitude and polyfunctional cytokine profile of T-cell responses elicited by RSV vaccines based on unadjuvanted soluble protein or DNA have been shown to be rather modest,<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a>,<a href="#CR54">54</a></sup> heterologous prime-boost regimens including a mucosal or intramuscular Adenoviral vector prime or boost have proven to induce higher and more polyfunctional systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses also in the absence of an adjuvant.<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a>,<a href="#CR52">52</a></sup> Confirming and extending these findings, all three regimens in this study induced measurable systemic and mucosal T-cell responses upon prime and potently expanded them upon boost vaccination, including the homologous regimens. Systemic responses largely consisted of CD4+ T cells, as previously observed in NHPs vaccinated with Ad35-based vaccine regimens,<sup><a href="#CR55">55</a></sup> but contrasts with reports of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination of cynomolgus macaques with heterologous PanAd3 and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) regimens.<sup><a href="#CR52">52</a></sup> In the lung, however, both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses were induced that strongly exceeded the peripheral response. Although being ~ 10-fold higher, the frequency of RSV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in the lung correlated well with the systemic responses using the same assay, which may indicate a biological link between systemic and mucosal T-cell responses after Adenoviral vaccination. To our knowledge RSV-F-specific BAL responses in the same order of magnitude have so far not been described after intramuscular immunization but could only be generated using complex combinations of systemic and mucosal vaccination with heterologous vaccine modalities. BAL responses exceeding systemic responses were for example observed in NHPs receiving a DNA prime by intramuscular electroporation followed by a heterologous, intra-tonsillar Adenoviral boost<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a></sup> or in mice receiving a PanAd3-based intramuscular or intranasal prime, followed by a heterologous, intramuscular boost with MVA.<sup><a href="#CR52">52</a></sup></p> <p id="Par19">Even though the limited size of the study precludes conclusions on any subtle qualitative differences between regimens, a generally high degree of polyfunctionality was detected in the antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell response in the periphery, and in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung at the post boost peak response for all three regimens. No non-Adenoviral comparator platform was included in this study, but a similarly high degree of polyfunctionality was observed after heterologous intramuscular electroporation reported above by Grunwald et al.,<sup><a href="#CR41">41</a></sup>, but not after a homologous intramuscular electroporation DNA/DNA regimen.<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a></sup> Whether the induction of strong, polyfunctional antigen-specific T cells with the ability to migrate to the lung may be an inherent quality of Adenoviral vectored vaccines, irrespective of the route of administration remains to be confirmed. Contradicting previously observed insensitivity of the T-cell compartment to respond to repeated homologous administration of Adenoviral vectors,<sup><a href="#CR51">51</a></sup> we observed expansion of RSV-F-specific immune responses, including T cells in blood and BAL, irrespective of whether the boost was heterologous (<i>n</i> = 5) or homologous (<i>n</i> = 10). Although boost immunization occurred in the presence of vector targeting immunity induced by the prime immunization, as evidenced by the presence of vector neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1</a>), the responses induced by the homologous regimens did not consistently differ in magnitude, quality, or durability compared with the heterologous regimen, indicating that the negative impact of anti-vector immunity on vaccine immunogenicity was limited for these Ad26/Ad35-based vaccine regimens.</p> <p id="Par20">Recent assessments indicate that mucosal antibody responses may play a key role in protection of the respiratory tract against RSV infection. In an experimental controlled human infection model for RSV, pre-challenge nasal IgA titers against RSV were more clearly associated with protection than serum-neutralizing antibody titers.<sup><a href="#CR27">27</a></sup> This emphasizes the importance of a potential RSV vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic RSV-specific antibody responses. Remarkably and unexpectedly, in this study intramuscular immunization with all three vaccine regimens induced durable RSV-F-specific antibody responses in the respiratory tract (in BAL and nasal secretions) of RSV seronegative animals.</p> <p id="Par21">The mechanisms of ERD have not been conclusively elucidated to date, but two aspects have been associated with vaccine-mediated ERD in preclinical models: a Th2-biased response and/or immune complex deposition and complement activation in the lung owing to the formation of poorly protective antibody responses with limited functional capability.<sup><a href="#CR12">12</a>,<a href="#CR13">13</a></sup> The induction of Th2 cytokines was not assessed in the present study and animals were not exposed to an RSV challenge because adult cynomolgus macaques do not support productive infection with RSV.<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a>,<a href="#CR56">56</a></sup> However, multiple findings indicate that the immune response induced by Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 used in this study is qualitatively distinct to responses predisposing towards ERD upon viral infection. First, in cynomolgus macaques, CD4+ and CD8+ responses in the lung were characterized by secretion of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. In addition, binding and functional antibodies as measured by ELISA and virus neutralizing assay (VNA), respectively, developed with similar, rather stable kinetics, indicating that there was no loss of functionality in the presence of a persistent binding antibody response. Finally, both vectors used in this study previously showed a strong Th1-type immune response in mice and did not induce ERD in the cotton rat model.<sup><a href="#CR40">40</a></sup> Th1-type immunity has also been observed in response to an Ad26-based human immunodeficiency virus vaccine in humans<sup><a href="#CR57">57</a></sup> and may be a characteristic intrinsic to the vector backbone irrespective of the encoded insert.<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup></p> <p id="Par22">In summary, we conclude that the largely regimen-independent, boostable, durable, and respiratory tract-directed immunogenicity of Ad26 and Ad35 vectors expressing the prototype antigen RSV-FA2 in the NHP model demonstrates that Adenoviral vectors are a promising vaccine platform for the development of an RSV vaccine for use in infants and elderly, expected to safely induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses. The prototypic RSV-FA2 vaccines in this study have been assessed in two completed Ph1 studies in healthy adults (NCT02561871 and NCT02440035). Replacement of the prototypic wild-type FA2 antigen by a stabilized pre-F protein is expected to further enhance the magnitude and quality of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the Adenoviral vector platform, without changing systemic and mucosal responses. Therefore, ongoing clinical evaluation is focusing on optimized vectors expressing RSV-F in a stabilized pre-F conformation (studies NCT03334695, NCT03339713, NCT03303625, NCT02926430, NCT03606512, and NCT03502707).</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Cells were then washed in FACS staining buffer, fixed, and permeabilized with Caltag Fix &amp;amp; Perm solutions (Life Technologies), and incubated with 130 µl of a cocktail containing antibodies targeting CD69 (Beckman Coulter, clone TP1.55.3, catalog number 6607110, 5 µl), IL-2 (BD Biosciences, clone MQ1-17H12, catalog number 560702, 10 µl), IFNγ (BD Biosciences, clone B27, catalog number 560924, 5 µl), and TNFα (BD Biosciences, clone Mab11, catalog number 552889, 10 µl) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark, then washed in FACS staining buffer, and fixed in 200 µl freshly prepared PBS with 0.1% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA). Uncompensated flow cytometric events were acquired on a Beckton-Dickinson LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) 1–24 h after fixation. BD CompBeads (Anti-Mouse IgGκ and Anti-Rat IgG/Negative Control (FBS) compensation particles, BD Biosciences) stained separately with the individual monoclonal antibodies used in the test samples, were used as a basis for electronic compensation. Samples were analyzed in one single technical replicate.</p> </div> <div class="multi-parametericsdataanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Multi-parameter ICS data analysis</div> <p id="Par37">Test samples were electronically compensated for spectral spill-over of fluorochromes and gated using FlowJo version 9.4.11 software (FlowJo LLC., Ashland, OR). Gates for the expression of CD69, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, CD95, and CD28 on PBMCs were based on fluorescence-minus-one controls (FMO-controls) as described in ref. <sup><a href="#CR63">63</a></sup> and on positive and negative ICS controls. Lymphocytes were identified on forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) characteristics after exclusion of doublets based on their FSC-area/FSC-height characteristics, exclusion of dead cells based on positivity for the Live/Dead cell discrimination fluorochrome (amine reactive) and based on determination of CD69 co-expression. To allow multifunctionality analysis, Boolean gates were calculated for activated, cytokine-secreting cells. ICS data were subjected to an exploratory positivity analysis, which utilized the method described in ref. <sup><a href="#CR64">64</a></sup> To identify samples responding to the RSV-FA2 peptide pool stimulation with expression of IFNγ, TNFα or IL-2 within the CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, a two-by-two contingency table was created to compare data from the peptide-stimulated test samples with their corresponding negative controls. Each of the tables contained four records with the number of cells positive and negative for expression of one of the detected cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-2) in the test sample and negative control sample. To evaluate whether the number of positive cells in the stimulated sample was equal to that in the negative control, a one-sided Fisher's exact test was applied. The T-cell subset was marked as a responder to RSV-A2 peptides stimulation when the <i>p</i> value for the test sample exceeded 0.00001.</p> <p id="Par38">Polyfunctionality analysis was performed separately for CD4 and CD8 T cells on Boolean cytokine gates. For visualization purposes, all individual populations were subjected to background subtraction based on their corresponding negative controls and any resulting negative values were censored to 0.</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalyses" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Statistical analyses</div> <p id="Par39">All immunological parameters (i.e., ELISA, VNA, ELISPOT, ICS) were log-transformed. Vaccine regimens were compared using two-sided tests based on analysis-of-variance, or analysis-of-variance for potentially censored values (Tobit regression). A Tukey correction was applied to account for multiple testing. <i>P</i> values &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The correlation between assays was examined using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Since no formal lower limit of quantification was determined for ICS data, a stringent, exploratory statistical responder analysis was performed at week 14, to determine whether the antigen-specific T-cell responses after peptide stimulation differed significantly from background responses. Positive responses to RSV-F peptide stimulation within each functional T-cell population were determined per animal in comparison with the corresponding negative control, using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in R 3.3.3.<sup><a href="#CR65">65</a></sup></p> </div> <div class="reportingsummary" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
