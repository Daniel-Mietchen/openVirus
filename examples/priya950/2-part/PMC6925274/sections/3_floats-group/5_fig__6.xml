  <title>Pre-F RSV-specific IgG and IgA responses in BAL after immunization with the three RSV.FA2 vaccine regimens.</title>
  <p>Antibody titers were measured by IgG ELISA 
   <bold>a</bold> and IgA ELISA 
   <bold>b</bold> in BAL fluid obtained from animals immunized with the indicated regimens (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 each) at the indicated time points. Shown are arithmetic group means with standard deviation of log-transformed endpoint titers, defined as the reciprocal dilution at which the signal reached a threshold set at 3× standard deviation above the mean signal of all samples at baseline. Individual titers per animal were normalized to the protein content of the BAL fluid as measured by OD280. LoB = limit of background, set to 1.
