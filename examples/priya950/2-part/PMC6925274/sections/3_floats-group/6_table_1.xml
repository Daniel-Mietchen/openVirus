  <p>Antibody titers were measured by IgA ELISA in nose swab eluates obtained from animals immunized with the indicated regimens (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 each) at the indicated time points. Shown are arithmetic group means of log-transformed endpoint titers with ranges. Endpoint titer is defined as the reciprocal dilution at which the signal reached a threshold set at 3× standard deviation above the mean signal of all samples at baseline
