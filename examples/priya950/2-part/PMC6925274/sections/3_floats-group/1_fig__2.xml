  <title>Humoral immune responses after immunization with the three RSV.FA2 vaccine regimens.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Binding antibody titers specific for RSV post-F 
   <bold>a</bold> and pre-F 
   <bold>b</bold> conformation. Serum antibody titers were measured by ELISA (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 each for each regimen). Shown are arithmetic group means with standard deviation of the log10 inverse IC50 values determined relative to assay standard; LLoD = lower limit of detection (log
   <sub>10</sub> lowest serum dilution in both the post-F and pre-F-specific assay, 1/10). 
   <bold>c</bold> RSV-A2-neutralizing capacity. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined using an RSV-A2 based VNA (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 each for each regimen). Shown are arithmetic group means with standard deviation of the log2 inverse IC50 values; LoB = limit of background (log
   <sub>2</sub> 95th percentile of mean serum titers in all animals at all pre-immunization time points). 
   <bold>d–</bold>
   <bold>f</bold> Fold-changes of humoral immune responses after boost. Shown is the ratio of binding antibody titers to post-F 
   <bold>d</bold>, pre- 
   <bold>e</bold>, and RSV-A2 virus neutralization titers 
   <bold>f</bold> at the peak of the responses post boost (week 16 for post-F-specific IgG and virus neutralization titers, week 14 for pre-F-specific IgG) over those measured at the time of boost immunization at week 12. Fold-increases were calculated as a ratio of linear titers at week 16 (post-F ELISA and VNA) or week 14 (pre-F ELISA) divided by those at week 12. Each symbol represents one animal, bars depict geometric group means.
