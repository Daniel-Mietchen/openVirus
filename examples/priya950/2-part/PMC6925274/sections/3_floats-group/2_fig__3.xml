  <title>RSV-F-specific IFNγ ELISPOT responses.</title>
  <p>IFNγ ELISPOT responses in PBMC were determined after stimulation with a pool of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids, covering the RSV-F protein sequence. 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold> Shown are background subtracted values per animal receiving a homologous prime-boost with the Ad26/Ad35 mix 
   <bold>a</bold>, a homologous prime-boost with Ad26 
   <bold>b</bold>, or a heterologous prime-boost with Ad26 and Ad35 
   <bold>c</bold>. Dotted line = assay threshold based on CV, at 50 SFU/10
   <sup>6</sup> cells. Red bars depict geometric group means.
