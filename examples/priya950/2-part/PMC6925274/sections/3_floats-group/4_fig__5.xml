  <title>RSV-F-specific ICS responses in the lung and polyfunctionality post boost.</title>
  <p>RSV-F-specific CD8+ T cells 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold> and CD4+ T cells 
   <bold>e–h</bold> expressing IFNγ 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>, TNFα 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold>, or IL-2 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>g</bold> were determined in cells extracted from BAL, using polychromatic flow cytometry, after stimulation with a pool of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids, covering the RSV-F protein sequence. Shown are arithmetic group means with upper 95% confidence limit (upper whisker) over time, of individually background subtracted values. Animals received a homologous prime-boost with the Ad26/Ad35 mix (light gray), a homologous prime-boost with Ad26 (dark gray), or a heterologous prime-boost with Ad26 and Ad35 (black). Arrows indicate immunization time points. Polyfunctional composition of the cytokine response in CD8+ T cells 
   <bold>e</bold> and CD4+ T cells 
   <bold>h</bold> of individual animals 4 weeks post boost (study week 16) was determined as described before and is summarized in the pie charts. Responders as defined by Fisher’s exact test are indicated by an asterisk. Data from individual animals in Figures 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>h</bold> are shown in corresponding order.
