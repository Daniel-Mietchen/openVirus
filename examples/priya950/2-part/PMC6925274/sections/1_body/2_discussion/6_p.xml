<p id="Par20">Recent assessments indicate that mucosal antibody responses may play a key role in protection of the respiratory tract against RSV infection. In an experimental controlled human infection model for RSV, pre-challenge nasal IgA titers against RSV were more clearly associated with protection than serum-neutralizing antibody titers.

 </sup> This emphasizes the importance of a potential RSV vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic RSV-specific antibody responses. Remarkably and unexpectedly, in this study intramuscular immunization with all three vaccine regimens induced durable RSV-F-specific antibody responses in the respiratory tract (in BAL and nasal secretions) of RSV seronegative animals.
