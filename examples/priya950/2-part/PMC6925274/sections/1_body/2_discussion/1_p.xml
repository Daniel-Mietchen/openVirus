<p id="Par15">Three different intramuscular prime-boost immunization regimens with Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 induced strong and durable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses to RSV-FA2 in cynomolgus macaques. Those responses were also present in the lung and nose, where protective immunity is particularly important to prevent RSV-mediated LRTI, and antibodies neutralized a wide array of RSV strains. All regimens induced immune responses of similar magnitude and quality across the assessed RSV-specific immune readouts, irrespective of whether a homologous or heterologous approach was chosen. This confirms our results in mice and cotton rats

 </sup> and indicates that simple intramuscular prime-boost regimens using Adenoviral vectors are a robust approach to generating strong, cross-neutralizing and durable vaccine-mediated RSV-specific immunity that is able to migrate to the respiratory tract. As adult cynomolgus macaques are only semi-permissive to RSV without showing any clinical signs of disease

 </sup> protective efficacy of the regimens was not assessed in this model. However, we previously demonstrated robust protective capacity of these vaccines against RSV-A2 and RSV B15/9 challenge in the permissive cotton rat model, compared with viral pre-exposure.
