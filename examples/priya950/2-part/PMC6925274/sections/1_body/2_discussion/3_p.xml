<p id="Par17">To our knowledge, our study provides the longest preclinical follow-up of RSV-specific immunity upon vaccination to date, with durability being an important aspect of a vaccine intended to provide protection across annually recurring RSV epidemics. In contrast to reports on other vaccination approaches in NHPs, which either demonstrated rapid decline of initially high responses,

 </sup> or applied a late boost immunization after set-point titers were reached,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> we established that prime-boost vaccination with Adenoviral vectors induced humoral and cellular RSV-specific immunity that persisted systemically and in the lung for more than a year and a half. This long-term durability in the absence of a late boost may be facilitated by the sustained, polyfunctional RSV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses induced upon vaccination, providing IL-2 mediated T-cell help over time.
