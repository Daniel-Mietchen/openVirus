<p id="Par9">The ratio of antibodies specific for post-F and pre-F slightly favored post-F in the weeks immediately following prime and boost immunization in all three regimens (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A</xref>), whereas a more balanced pre-/post-F-specific antibody response was reached during the long-term follow-up period. Although pre-F-specific antibodies have been described as the predominant mediators of viral neutralization,

Finally, cross-neutralization of RSV A strains A 11-050878, A 13-0000323, A 18-0011989, A CL57 and RSV-B strains RSV-B 11-052099, B 14-006938, B 17-058221, and B1 was determined by neutralization assays in sera pooled by vaccination group at baseline, week 16, and week 86 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and found to be of comparable magnitude across strains and durable until the end of the observation period.
