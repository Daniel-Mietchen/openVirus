<p id="Par6">Immune responses in cynomolgus macaques were measured over 86 weeks after intramuscular immunization with three prime-boost regimens using Ad26 and Ad35 expressing RSV-FA2. With an interval of 12 weeks, five animals each received either a homologous prime-boost of 2.5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> viral particles (vp) of Ad26.RSV.FA2 mixed with 2.5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad35.RSV.FA2 (group “Mix/Mix”, 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp total dose), a homologous prime-boost regimen of 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.FA2 (group “26/26”), or a heterologous prime-boost of 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.FA2 followed by 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of Ad35.RSV.FA2 (group “26/35”, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for regimens, immunization timelines and sampling time points). Development of a neutralizing antibody response targeting the vector backbones was measured as an indication for vaccine take in the baseline Ad26- and Ad35-seronegative animals (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Vector exposure was reflected in seroconversion and subsequent increases in Ad26-neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in all animals receiving a prime and boost containing the Ad26-based vector (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>), whereas seroconversion upon prime immunization with Ad35 was rare (one of five animals) and re-exposure to the vector did not increase Ad35 NAb titers in all animals (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>), consistent with previous observations in NHPs and humans.
