<p id="Par8">In all animals, RSV-F-specific antibodies raised by priming with either the Ad26/Ad35 mix or Ad26 alone neutralized the vaccine-homologous strain RSV-A2 in an assay based on the expression of Fluc from recombinant RSV-A2-like virus in target cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In all groups virus neutralizing titers increased sharply 4 weeks post boost (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), with the Ad35/Ad26 Mix boost inducing an over 20-fold mean fold-change (mostly owing to one outlier) to a mean log2 IC50 titer of 15.3 1.5 SD, whereas boosting with Ad26 or Ad35 induced a more modest increase to 12.15 SD 1.16 for 26/26 and 13.87 SD 0.95 for 26/35 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Titers contracted slightly over time but remained at post-prime levels throughout the duration of the trial. No significant differences were detected between the three regimens post prime (averaged log2 IC50 titers over weeks 0–12: Mix/Mix 9.60 SD 2.82, 26/26 8.58 SD 2.62, 26/35 9.78 SD 3.21) and post boost (averaged log2 IC50 titers over weeks 14–32: Mix/Mix 13.39 SD 1.92, 26/26 10.71 SD 1.72, 26/35 12.42 SD 1.61), but during the long-term follow-up period titers in the 26/26 group dropped below those of the other two regimens, with the comparison with the Mix/Mix group reaching statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011, averaged log2 IC50 titers over weeks 66–86: Mix/Mix 10.88 SD 1.57, 26/26 8.65 SD 1.35, 26/35 10.21 SD 1.14; ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). This may be owing to the limited sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) and natural variation in the efficiency of the Ad26 prime immunization, as evidenced by the higher post-prime responses in the 26/35 group that was primed with the same vector.
