 </sup> none of the animals in this study showed detectable serum antibody responses to the RSV-F protein prior to vaccination at week 0, or against the RSV-G protein at weeks 25, 32, and 65 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indicating that the animals were RSV inexperienced and did not get exposed to the virus after vaccination. Prime immunization with 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of the Ad26/Ad35 mix or Ad26 alone induced measurable antibody responses binding to RSV-F in its postfusion and prefusion conformations (post-F and pre-F) in all animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). No significant differences were detected between the three regimens in the mean post prime responses averaged over weeks 0–12 to the post-F (Mix/Mix 2.31 standard deviation (SD) 0.89, 26/26 2.34 SD 0.98, 26/35 2.40 SD 0.77) or pre-F proteins (Mix/Mix 1.89 SD 0.91, 26/26 1.51 SD 0.87, 26/35 1.96 SD 0.98; all 
 <italic>p</italic> values &gt; 0.05; ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons), even though the mean pre-F-specific titers in the 26/26 group were slightly lower than those in the 26/35 group. Boost immunization with 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of either the Ad26/Ad35 mix, Ad26, or Ad35, induced a strong expansion of antibody responses to both post-F and pre-F in all animals, resulting in a peak 4 weeks post boost for post F-specific antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, d</xref>) and 2 weeks post boost for pre-F-specific antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, e</xref>). There were no significant differences between the three regimens in mean responses over weeks 14–32 to post-F (Mix/Mix 2.90 SD 0.48, 26/26 2.81 SD 0.46, 26/35 2.98 SD 0.46 SD) or pre-F (Mix/Mix 2.50 SD 0.53, 26/26 2.21 SD 0.56, 26/35 2.58 SD 0.51 and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>; all 
 <italic>p</italic> values &gt; 0.05, ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). All three regimens induced similar mean fold-changes in the post-F and pre-F responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>), with stronger individual fold-changes in animals that had lower pre-boost titers than in those with higher pre-boost titers. In all three groups, antibody titers against post- and pre-F contracted slightly by week 32, then remained at or above post prime levels until week 86, with no significant differences detected (averaged over weeks 66–86 for post-F: Mix/Mix 2.37 SD 0.48, 26/26 2.25 SD 0.39, 26/35 2.37 SD 0.21 SD; for pre-F: Mix/Mix 2.19 SD 0.37, 26/26 2.04 SD 0.29, 26/35 2.19 SD 0.30; all 
 <italic>p</italic> values &gt; 0.05, ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons).
