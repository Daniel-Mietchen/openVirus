<p id="Par13">To understand whether vaccine-induced T-cell responses in the periphery would be indicative of those induced in the lung, week 14 RSV-F-specific IFNγ ELISPOT and IFNγ + CD4+ T-cell ICS responses in blood were correlated with week 16 RSV-F-specific IFNγ + CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in the lung, respectively, pooled across all three regimens (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). IFNγ ELISPOT responses in blood correlated moderately with IFNγ + CD8+ T-cell responses in the lung (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7A</xref>; 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.5581, Spearman correlation) but weakly with the IFNγ + CD4+ T-cell response (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7B</xref>; 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.3113, Spearman correlation), possibly stemming from the inherent differences between ELISPOT and ICS in defining the parental cell population. However, a strong correlation was detected between RSV-F-specific IFNγ + CD4+ T cells in blood and in the lung by the same assay (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7C</xref>; 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.8571, Spearman; all correlations 
 <italic>n</italic> = 15).
