<p id="Par10">RSV-F-specific T-cell responses were assessed longitudinally in blood using an IFNγ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). RSV-F-specific IFNγ ELISPOT responses were detectable within 2 weeks post-prime in the Mix/Mix (2/5 animals) and the 26/26 groups (all animals) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>). In all three groups, boost immunization induced a substantial, more than sixfold expansion of the mean IFNγ ELISPOT response (7.14-fold in Mix/Mix group, 6.66-fold in the 26/26 group, 7.55-fold in the 26/35 group) within 2 weeks post boost. There were no significant differences between groups in the ratio of peak post (week 14) over pre-boost (week 12) responses (all 
 <italic>p</italic> values &gt; 0.05; ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). Two animals in the Mix/Mix group showed low post boost responses, corresponding with low RSV-F-specific humoral immune responses throughout (all readouts). In all groups, IFNγ ELISPOT responses contracted to levels at or above those detected post-prime by week 25 and persisted at those levels until week 86.
