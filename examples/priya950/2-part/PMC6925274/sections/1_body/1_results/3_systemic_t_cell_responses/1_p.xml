<p id="Par11">To further characterize qualitative aspects of the systemic T-cell response to the three vaccination regimens, RSV-F-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed longitudinally by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and polychromatic flow cytometry (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> for gating strategy). Although systemic CD8+ T-cell responses were very low (data not shown), all three regimens induced RSV-F-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 responses in CD4+ T cells upon prime. As for IFNγ ELISPOT responses, ICS responses increased upon boost immunization, peaking 2 weeks post boost (week 14) and remaining above background levels until the end of the observation period (IFNγ responses shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>, TNFα, and IL-2 responses see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). No statistically significant differences were detected between the mean IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-2 responses per group after prime (week 2) or post boost (week 14; ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). A functional subset analysis on the peak response at week 14 further showed a high degree of polyfunctionality across all three groups, in which more than half of the RSV-F-specific CD4+ T cells in each individual animal produced all three or any combination of two cytokines upon stimulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>, pie-graphs). A stringent, exploratory statistical responder analysis was performed at peak response on week 14, determining whether the antigen-specific T-cell responses after peptide stimulation differed significantly from background responses (one-sided Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). The analysis demonstrated a post boost responder rate of 100% for the 26/35 regimen (5/5 animals), followed by 80% in the 26/26 group (4/5 animals), and 60% in the Mix/Mix group (3/5 animals).
