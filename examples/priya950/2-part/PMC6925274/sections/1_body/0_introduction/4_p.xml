<p id="Par5">In this study, we determined the immunogenicity of three intramuscular prime-boost vaccination regimens using Ad26 and Ad35 expressing the F protein of RSV strain A2 (RSV-FA2) as a prototype RSV antigen in cynomolgus macaques. Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2, were previously shown to induce RSV-specific humoral and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in mice, and to be safe, cross-neutralizing and protective against challenge with homologous and heterologous RSV strains in the cotton rat challenge and ERD model.

 </sup> Here we show that in macaques, all three regimens induced substantial, boostable, cross-neutralizing, and long-lasting antibody titers, and T-cell responses characterized by expression of the Th1-type cytokines interferon-gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) that could be measured in peripheral blood and the respiratory tract, where protective immunity is particularly important to prevent RSV-mediated LRTI. The high, regimen-independent, and boostable immunogenicity of this RSV prototype vaccine demonstrates that vectors based on Ad26 and Ad35, even when applied intramuscularly and in a homologous regimen, are a promising platform for the development of an RSV vaccine and can be expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses.
