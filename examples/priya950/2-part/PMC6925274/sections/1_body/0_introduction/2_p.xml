<p id="Par3">Despite the significant disease burden, no vaccine is currently licensed for human use. Vaccine development for infants faces the obstacle of safety concerns raised after the occurrence of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) following natural RSV infection in RSV-naive infants that had received a poorly protective formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine in the 1960ies.

 </sup> Although the functional mechanism for FI-RSV-induced ERD has not been fully elucidated yet, there are indications that a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) biased response and/or immune complex deposition and complement activation in the lung owing to the formation of poorly protective antibody responses with limited functional capability play a role in its etiology.

 </sup> In elderly, ERD is not of concern, however several vaccines aimed to protect this population have been discontinued owing to missing signs of efficacy.
