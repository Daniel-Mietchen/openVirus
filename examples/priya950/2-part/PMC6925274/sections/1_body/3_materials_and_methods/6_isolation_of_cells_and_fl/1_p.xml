<p id="Par28">BAL wash fluid was strained through a 100 µm pore size cell strainer and spun at 700 G for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (BAL fluid) was aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C until time of analysis. The cell pellet was visually inspected for the presence of red blood cells and if present, residual RBCs were lysed as described before. Viable cell numbers were determined as described before, then cell suspensions were adjusted to 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI-10 and kept on ice until analysis.
