<p id="Par26">All animal procedures were performed under anesthesia with either ketamine (10 mg/kg intramuscularly or intravenously), Dormitor (0.015 mg/kg intramuscularly), or under intubation with 3–5% isoflurane, depending on the length of the procedure. Using an online list randomizer (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.random.org</ext-link>), 15 animals were randomly assigned to three study groups of five animals each, receiving one of three prime-boost vaccination regimens (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with an interval of 12 weeks between prime and boost: a homologous prime-boost regimen with 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of a mixture of Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 (group “Mix/Mix”, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of each serotype), or a homologous prime-boost with 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of Ad26.RSV.FA2 (group “26/26”), or a heterologous prime-boost with 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of Ad26.RSV.FA2 at prime and 5 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of Ad35.RSV.FA2 at boost (group “26/35”). No sample size calculation was performed, a sample size of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 animals per group was chosen based on historical experience with Ad26-based vaccines in general, where this number provided an indication of humoral and cellular immunogenicity of vaccines in the NHP model. Blinding of the study was not possible owing to pair-housing of animals of the same study group. Animals were vaccinated intramuscularly in the quadriceps of the leg (0.5 ml/leg) with the indicated vector particle-doses in formulation buffer. Venous blood for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation or serum was collected from the femoral vein. Blood volumes taken did not exceed 12 ml/kg within 30 days and a maximum of 9 ml/kg at each individual bleeding time point. BAL was performed by inserting a premeasured, disposable plastic tube through a laryngoscope into the trachea using a guide wire, until the level of the manubrium. After removal of the guide wire, 50 ml of sterile 
 <sc>d</sc>-PBS (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) was flushed into and immediately aspirated from the bronchus in installments of 10 ml at a time, using a syringe attached to the end of the plastic tube. BAL wash material was transferred into sterile 50 ml conical tubes and kept on ice until processing. Nasal swabs were gathered by inserting a pre-moistened sponge (Weck-Cel, Beaver-Visitec International, MA) into each naris, rotated in a continuous motion while entering deeper. The sponges were allowed to rest inside the naris for 5 min to absorb the nasal secretions, then placed into cryovials and frozen at − 70 °C.
