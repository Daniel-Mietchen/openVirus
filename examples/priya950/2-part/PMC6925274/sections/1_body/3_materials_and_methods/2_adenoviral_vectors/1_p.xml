 </sup> A codon optimized, full-length gene encoding the fusion (F) protein from the RSV strain A2 (Genbank ACO83301.1) was inserted into the E1-position of the adenovirus genomes under transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV-40 polyadenylation sequence. Cloning, rescue, and manufacturing of the replication deficient adenoviral vectors Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 in the complementing cell line PER.C6 was described in ref. 
 <sup>

 </sup> Virus particle (vp) titers in the viral preparations were quantified by measurement of optical density at 260â€‰nm

 </sup> The vp/IU ratio was between 1:1 and 6:1 for the viral preparations. Adenovirus-mediated expression of RSV-F was confirmed by western blot analysis of cell-culture lysates from infected A549 cells using a human monoclonal antibody against RSV-F (CR9503).
