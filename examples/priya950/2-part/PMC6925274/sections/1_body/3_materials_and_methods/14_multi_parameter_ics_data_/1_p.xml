<p id="Par37">Test samples were electronically compensated for spectral spill-over of fluorochromes and gated using FlowJo version 9.4.11 software (FlowJo LLC., Ashland, OR). Gates for the expression of CD69, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, CD95, and CD28 on PBMCs were based on fluorescence-minus-one controls (FMO-controls) as described in ref.

 </sup> and on positive and negative ICS controls. Lymphocytes were identified on forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) characteristics after exclusion of doublets based on their FSC-area/FSC-height characteristics, exclusion of dead cells based on positivity for the Live/Dead cell discrimination fluorochrome (amine reactive) and based on determination of CD69 co-expression. To allow multifunctionality analysis, Boolean gates were calculated for activated, cytokine-secreting cells. ICS data were subjected to an exploratory positivity analysis, which utilized the method described in ref.

 </sup> To identify samples responding to the RSV-FA2 peptide pool stimulation with expression of IFNγ, TNFα or IL-2 within the CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, a two-by-two contingency table was created to compare data from the peptide-stimulated test samples with their corresponding negative controls. Each of the tables contained four records with the number of cells positive and negative for expression of one of the detected cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-2) in the test sample and negative control sample. To evaluate whether the number of positive cells in the stimulated sample was equal to that in the negative control, a one-sided Fisher's exact test was applied. The T-cell subset was marked as a responder to RSV-A2 peptides stimulation when the
