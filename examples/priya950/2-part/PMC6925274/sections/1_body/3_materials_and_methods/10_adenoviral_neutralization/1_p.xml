 </sup> A549 human lung carcinoma cells (catalog number ATCC CCL-185, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well black-and-white isoplates (Wallac, Turku, Finland). E1/E3-deleted Ad26- or Ad35-luciferase reporter constructs were then added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500, together with twofold serial dilutions of individual heat-inactivated cynomolgus macaque serum samples starting at a 1:64 dilution for Ad26, or a 1:32 dilution for Ad35 in 200 μl reaction volumes. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C and 10% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, luciferase activity in cryolysed cells was measured using the Neo-Lite Luciferase Assay System (PerkinElmer, Groningen, Netherlands) on a BioTek Synergy Neo luminescence counter (BioTek). Ninety percent neutralization titers (IC90) were defined as the maximum serum dilution that neutralized 90% of luciferase activity. Each serum sample was analyzed in duplicate.
