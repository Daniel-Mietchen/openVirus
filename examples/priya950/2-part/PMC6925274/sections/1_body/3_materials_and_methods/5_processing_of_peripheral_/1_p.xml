<p id="Par27">Serum samples were prepared from clotted blood drawn into serum tubes after spinning at 1900 G for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Serum was stored at − 80 °C until time of analysis. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood drawn into anticoagulant-containing tubes (EDTA) by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Blood was diluted 1:1 with D-PBS without Ca
 <sub>2</sub>+ or Mg
 <sub>2</sub>+ (Quality Biological), underlayed with an equal volume of Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and spun at 1800 G for 20 min at RT. Buffy layers were transferred into a fresh tube, washed once with D-PBS, spun at 700 G for 10 min at RT, followed by lysis of residual red blood cells (RBCs) in RBC Lysis Solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 10–15 min at RT. Lysis was stopped by addition of excess 
 <sc>d</sc>-PBS and tubes spun at 1900 G for 5 min at RT. Viable cell numbers were subsequently determined by Trypan Blue exclusion using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). Cells were adjusted to a concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI-10 (RPMI complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH), 10 m
 <sc>m</sc> Hepes buffer (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD), 2 m
 <sc>m</sc>
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Quality Biological), 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Quality Biological) and kept on ice until analysis.
