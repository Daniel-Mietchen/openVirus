<p id="Par25">Five- to 6-year old, healthy female cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) of Vietnamese origin (body weight 3.0–8.1 kg at study start) were purchased from Covance (Alice, TX) and kept in a BSL-2 facility under specific pathogen free conditions after screening negative for 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (by Mantoux test), for simian immunodeficiency virus, simian retrovirus, and simian T-lymphotropic virus (all three by serology and polymerase chain reaction). Screening included Herpes B virus and measles serology, but results were not included in the SPF conditions. Animals were housed in stainless steel cages placed in study-dedicated, USDA-approved rooms under controlled, recorded environmental conditions of humidity, temperature and light (12-hour light cycle). Animals were pair-housed in groups of two or three animals of the same study group per cage except for brief, procedure-related periods, and provided sensory and cognitive environmental enrichment including manipulatable objects and foraging devices. Three times a day, animals were fed a standard NHP diet that consisted mainly of high-protein monkey biscuits, but included primatreats, soft dough diet, and a selection of fresh fruit, peanuts, cereals, or other treats. Tap water was provided ad libitum through an automated system. Animal well-being was monitored daily by husbandry staff and routine animal health surveillance, including blood chemistry and hematology, was provided by veterinary staff. Pre-set humane endpoints were used to define study-unrelated sacrifice criteria by a veterinarian. All measures were taken to minimize pain, distress and suffering and all procedures were performed by trained personnel. Upon termination of the study, animals were reassigned to other studies, no euthanasia was performed.
