<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) worldwide. In 2017 alone, approximately one-million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, highlighting the need for alternative or complementary remedies to eradicate HIV infection. HIV is an enveloped virus with two identical single-stranded RNAs which serve as a template for reverse transcription into a single double-stranded DNA intermediate that can integrate into the host genome. This DNA is the template for RNA that codes for new genomes or for viral proteins. Full-length RNA codes for a structural polyprotein that includes matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) (

Inefficient supression of a stop codon between the gag and the downstream pol reading frame produces a polyprotein that is extended to include the pol proteins protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN). All are cut into their constituent parts by PR. A singly spliced mRNA encodes the env glycoproteins gp41 (TM, transmembrane, a fusion protein) and gp120 (SU, surface glycoprotein). Other more extensively spliced messages, encode the regulatory proteins Tat, a transactivator of transcription, and Rev, an HIV-specific RNA exporter. Yet other messages code for accessory proteins Vif and Vpr, which facilitate the degradation of cellular defense proteins, and Vpu and Nef, which remove cellular proteins from the cell surface [

Knowledge of HIV biology and pathogenesis has lead to the identification of several pharmacological targets for antiretroviral drug therapy. Following approval of the first anti-HIV drug viral azidothymidine (AZT; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor), additional classes of drugs targeting viral attachment/fusion, viral genome replication, integrase activity, and the viral protease have been developed, some of which were subsequently included in combinational antiretroviral drug therapy, resulting in effective clinical management of HIV infection and AIDS-related illnesses [

Each class of currently available drug has the potential to cause acute and chronic toxicities in patients (e.g., cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities). Lastly, side-effects of the drugs adversely impact patient compliance.
