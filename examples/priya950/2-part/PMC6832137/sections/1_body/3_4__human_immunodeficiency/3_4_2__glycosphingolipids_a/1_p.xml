<p>HIV particle assembly and budding takes place in the plasma membrane’s lipid rafts which contain high levels of cholesterol, sphingolipid (sphingomyelin), and glycosphingolipids. Notably, genetic analysis and lipid mass spectrometry showed that the HIV particle is enriched in sphingolipids (sphingomyelin and dihydro sphingomyelin) and glycosphingolipids (hexosylceramide, GM3, GM2, GM1) [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], implying that sphingolipids contribute to the biogenesis of infectious HIV particle and are acquired during HIV budding. There is also increasing evidence that glycosphinolipids help facilitate HIV’s infection of macrophages. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that GM3, GM2, and GM1 in HIV’s envelope interact with Siglec-1, a molecule that specifically binds to the sialyllactose moiety in glycosphinolipids [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This interaction between glycosphinolipids and Siglec-1 captures HIVs on macrophages, which might exist as a reservoir for HIV’s transmission to T cells.
