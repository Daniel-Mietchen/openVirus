<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for chronic liver disease in 60–90 million people worldwide [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses that encompass dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. HCV is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome encoding structural proteins (Core, E1, and E2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f002">Figure 2</xref>) required for infectious HCV particles formation. The nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) are involved in the replication of HCV genome and the packaging of the newly generated genome [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Major insights in the molecular and structural biology of HCV have led to the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting HCV NS34/A protease (e.g., Simeprivir and Voxilaprevir), NS5A (e.g., Ledipasvir and Pibrentasvir), and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or RDRp (e.g., Sofosbuvir and Dasabuvir) [

 <sup>-5</sup> per nucleotide per genome replication) [
