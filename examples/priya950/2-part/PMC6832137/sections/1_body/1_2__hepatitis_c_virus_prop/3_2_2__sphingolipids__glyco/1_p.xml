<p>Sphingolipids are also known to facilitate HCV genome replication. In one study led by Hirata et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the authors showed that HCV infection stimulates sphingomyelin production, leading to sphingomyelin enrichment in the HCV replication complex and sphingomyelin-induced stimulation of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize more viral RNA. During infection, HCV induces the formation of a distinct membrane structure in the cell. This platform called the membranous web [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] recruits viral and host factors to foster HCV genome amplification. In another study from our laboratory, we found that HCV redirects the glycosphingolipid carrier protein, FAPP2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f001">Figure 1</xref>), to the membranous web to facilitate HCV genome replication [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is likely that FAPP2 transports glycosphingolipids to the virus replication platform, as FAPP2 knockdown impedes HCV replication, whereas providing glycosphingolipids to the FAPP2 knockdown cells rescues HCV genome replication [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Finally, FAPP2 knockdown was found to disrupt the membranous web and alter the colocalization of HCV replicase proteins, implying that FAPP2 and/or glycosphingolipids contribute to the formation or maintenance of the HCV replication platform.
