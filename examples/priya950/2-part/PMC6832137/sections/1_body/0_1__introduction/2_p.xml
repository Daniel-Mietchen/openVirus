<p>Enveloped RNA viruses are further divided into two classes based on the polarity of the genome. For example, most positive-stranded RNA viruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and in intimate contact with intracellular membranes. This strategy enables viral and host factors to concentrate in distinct cellular locations to optimize a new virus particleâ€™s formation and evade innate immune responses [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. By contrast, the replication cycles of some negative-stranded RNA viruses (e.g. Influenza virus), and human immunodeficiency virus, occurs in the nucleus [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, positive and negative-stranded RNA viruses require a distinct set of host membranes, and the lipids present therein, for successful virus propagation. This review will feature a few medically important enveloped RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and influenza virus (IAV), and highlight the role of sphingolipids in their replication cycle and pathogenesis.
