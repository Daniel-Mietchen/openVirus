<p>Human viruses come in various shapes and sizes with DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The focal point of this review is on enveloped RNA virus particles, which consist of a lipid bilayer typically surrounding the genomic-RNA-protecting shell or capsid. While the lipid composition of the envelope varies between these RNA viruses, it is often enriched in phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids. In many instances, the integrity of the virus envelope is crucial for viral infectivity. For example, specific phospholipids in the envelope of some members of the Flaviviridae family of viruses are reported to facilitate virus attachment to host cells, a key step in viral entry [
