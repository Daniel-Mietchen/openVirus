<p>There is evidence that sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids are also required for the replication of some flaviviruses. For example, DENV has been reported to upregulate the expression of sphingolipids (ceramide and sphingomyelin) in mosquito cells and cause an accumulation of these lipids in a membrane fraction enriched in the viral replication complex [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] exploited mouse melanoma WT cells (B16) and a mutant counterpart (GM95) to demonstrate that the glycosphingolipid GM3 is required for DENV genome replication. The authors found higher levels of GM3 in DENV-infected cells and relocalization of GM3 to sites where DENV replicates its genome. Importantly, the authors found that inhibition of GM3 synthesis with soyasaponin I increases the survival rate of DENV-infected mice [
