<p>Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are archetype flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes, mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. According to the world health organization, DENV is responsible for 50–100 million infections each year with mild complications resembling flu-like symptoms and major complications, including deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever. WNV causes flu-like symptoms, neuroinvasive disease, and death in many countries in the world. WNV was first introduced in the United States (US) in 1999 from infected Israeli birds imported into New York state. The virus has now spread to most states and is responsible for many deaths in birds, humans and horses. By contrast, ZIKV only emerged as a global health concern since 2016, due its association with neurological disorders, such as microcephaly in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults [
