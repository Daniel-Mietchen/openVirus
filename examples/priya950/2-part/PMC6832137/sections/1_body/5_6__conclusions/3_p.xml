<p>Sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids are critical for membrane integrity and depleting them can have deleterious impact on distinct tissues or organs. However, minor changes in host glycosphingolipids can have a much greater impact on viruses that need them for successful infection. Hence, there is a need to develop more pharmacological inhibitors targeting sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid metabolic pathways. These inhibitors have the potential for a broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In addition, they can be combined with existing antivirals to increase their effectiveness and reduce the cost of these drugs.</p>
