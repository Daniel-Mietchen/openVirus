<p>The two classes of flu antiviral drugs include M2 ion channel blockers (e.g., amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., zanamivir, oseltamivir). Early administration of these antivirals reduces disease symptoms, shortens the duration of illness, reduces hospitalization rates, and reduces viral transmission [

 <sup>−3</sup> to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substititution per genome) [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], resulting in the frequent accumulation of amino acid changes in IAV proteins. These changes enable IAV to evade host immunity acquired by prior exposure or vaccination and is the reason why IAV vaccines must be reformulated annually. Additionally, these amino acid changes may allow the virus to develop resistance against currently available antiviral agents that target the activity of the flu NA protein. As such, novel antivirals against influenza are critically needed.
