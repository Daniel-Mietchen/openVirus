<p>Like several other enveloped viruses, influenza uses “raft-like” microdomains on the cell surface as platforms for viral assembly. Newly synthesized HA and NA concentrate in microdomains enriched for sphingomyelin and cholesterol [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that perturbation of host sphingomyelin biosynthesis adversely impacted the trafficking of influenza virus HA and NA to the cell surface, which in turn impaired viral maturation, budding, and release. Additionally, though abbreviated treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin at the late stages of infection was found to increase the release of viral particles from infected MDCK cells, the infectivity of the released particles was significantly reduced, as their envelope possessed lower contents of cholesterol and disrupted raft microdomains [
