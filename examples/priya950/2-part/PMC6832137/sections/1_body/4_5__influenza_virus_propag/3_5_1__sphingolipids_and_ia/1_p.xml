<p>The influenza virus’s envelope, derived from the host cell’s plasma membrane, consists of a lipid bilayer decorated with the viral hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and M2 proteins. The lipidome of purfied IAV particles consists of glycerophospholipids and sterols (primarily cholesterol) [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Attachment and entry into host cells requires interactions between the viral HA, concentrated in microdomains on the viral envelope, and sialic acid residues present on the cell surface. These microdomains, paralleling the lipids rafts present on the cell surface, are enriched with cholesterol and various sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Residues in the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of IAV HA are important for its association with lipid microdomains [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Disruption of these microdomains has an adverse effect on viral attachment. Sun and Whittaker showed that pretreatment of IAV virions with methly-β-cyclodextrin to deplete envelope cholesterol resulted in reduced viral fusion and infectivity [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Though not examined in their study, the authors suggested that cholesterol depletion perturbed the organization of HA in envelope lipid microdomains. Viral infectivity has been found to be reduced by approximately a thousandfold when HA fails to associate with lipid microdomains [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Similarly, it is expected that depletion of the IAV envelope sphingolipds would adversely impact IAV binding and infectivity.
