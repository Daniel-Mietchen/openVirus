<p>Following binding to host target cells, influenza virus enters the cytoplasm via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The viral M2 ion channel protein allows the influx of protons into the virion, triggering the release of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytoplasm. The vRNPs, made up of viral negative-stranded RNA, viral NP, and the viral RNA polymerase complex, then travel to the nucleus for transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome. Research suggests that products derived from sphingolipids are involved in influenza virusâ€™s genome replication. Seo et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] found that cells infected with influenza virus possessed increased levels of the enzyme sphingosine kinase (SK1), which converts sphingosine into sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). The authors further showed that inhibition of SK1 impaired viral RNA synthesis and the subsequent nuclear export of newly generated vRNPs. Similarly, it was demonstrated that SK1 is critical for the nuclear export of viral proteins (NP, NS2, and M1) involved in transporting vRNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [
