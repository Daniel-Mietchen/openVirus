  <p>Organization of the HIV-1 genome. The HIV-1 genome consists of two identical copies of noncovalently linked, linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecules. Each identical copy contains nine genes that encode fifteen proteins. Many of the proteins are synthesized as precursor polyproteins which are proteolytically processed by host or viral proteases into individual proteins with roles in viral architecture, replication, regulation of cellular functions, and evasion of the host defenses. The gag gene encodes viral proteins involved in the structure of the virus. The pol gene encodes viral proteins critical for replication and integration of provirus into the host genome. The env gene encodes proteins needed for viral attachment and fusion with target cells.</p>
