  <p>Diagram of sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways in mammalian cells. The initial step in the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids is the conversion of serine and palmitoyl CoA to ceramide. Following that, ceramide is subjected to conversion to sphingomyelin or to various glycosphingolipid intermediates on their way to becoming complex glycosphingolipids. The enzymes involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids are denoted in gold. Chemical inhibitors of key enzymes are indicated in red. SGMS1/2: sphingomyelin synthase; GCS: glucosylceramide synthase; B4G5: lactosylceramide synthase; ST3GAL5: lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase or GM3 synthase; A4GalT: alpha 1,4-galactosyltransferase or Gb3 synthase; SPT: serine palmitoyl transferase; CERT: ceramide transfer protein; FAPP2: four-phosphate adaptor protein 2; GlcCer: glucosylceramide; LacCer: lactosylceramide.</p>
