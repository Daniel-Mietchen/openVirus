  <p>Anti-Zika virus activity of NAR is concentration-dependent. The A549 cells were infected with ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261; MOI 0.1) for 90 minutes and treated with different concentrations of NAR (125 to 15.6 µM) after inoculum removal. After 48 hours, the cells were harvested and stained for flow cytometry assay using anti-flavivirus E protein monoclonal antibody (4G2). IFN-α 2A (200 IU/mL) was used as a positive anti-viral control, and the non-infected cells (MOCK) were used as a negative control. (

   <bold>C</bold>) The viral titers detected by foci-forming immunodetection assay (FFU
   <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL) in A549 cell culture supernatant after 48 hours of infection. (

   <bold>E</bold>) The concentration response curve of NAR against ZIKV. The NAR concentration that inhibited 50% and 90% of the infection (IC
   <sub>50</sub> and IC
   <sub>90</sub>) was defined using a sigmoidal dose response curve (variable slope). Results from three independent experiments performed in technical triplicate and analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey´s Multiple Comparison Test (*
