  <p>Naringenin treatment was effective even after the infection establishment. The A549 cells were infected with ZV BR 2015/15261 (MOI 0.1) and treated (one time) with NAR (125 μM) or IFN-α 2A (200 IU/mL) at different times points after the infection establishment, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-infection (hpi). After 48 h of infection, the A549 cells were harvested and stained with mouse anti-flavivirus E protein (4G2) monoclonal antibody for the flow cytometry analyses. (

The data represent three independent experiments for which each was performed in technical triplicate then analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey´s Multiple Comparison Test (*
