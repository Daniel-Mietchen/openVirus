  <p>NAR impairs the infection of Zika virus from Asian- and African-lineage in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with four additional strains of ZIKV (ZV BR 2016/16288, ZV BR 2015/15098, ZIKV PE243, ZIKV MR766; MOI 0.1), three from Asian- and one from African-lineage and treated with NAR (125 μM) or IFN-α 2A (200 IU/mL). After 48 hours, the cells were harvested and stained for flow cytometry assay using anti-flavivirus E protein monoclonal antibody (4G2). (
