  <p>NAR impairs the infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells by ZIKV. Human monocytes derived-dendritic cells from five healthy donors were tested. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative density plot showing the phenotype of hmdDCs (CD14
   <sup>−</sup>/CD11c
   <sup>+</sup>) after seven days of differentiation. To determine the MNTC of NAR for hmdDCs cells were treated with different concentrations of NAR (500 to 125 µM) for 24 h. DMSO was used as a control and vehicle for the preparation of NAR stock solution. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The frequency of viable hmdDCs (Annexin-V
   <sup>−</sup>/7-AAD
   <sup>−</sup>) were shown. For antiviral activity of NAR, hmdDCs were infected with ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261 at MOI 10) and treated with NAR (125 μM) or IFN-α 2A (200 IU/mL). After 24 hours, the cells were harvested and stained for flow cytometry assay using anti-human CD11c-PE, anti-CD14-APC and anti-flavivirus E protein monoclonal antibody (4G2-FITC). (

   <bold>E</bold>) The viral titers detected by foci-forming immunodetection assay (FFU
   <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL) in hmdDCs culture supernatant after 24 hours of infection. Data represent each donor measure and were evaluated by paired one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-test (*
