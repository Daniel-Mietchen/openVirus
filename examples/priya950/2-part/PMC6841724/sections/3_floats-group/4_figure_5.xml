  <p>Time-of-drug-addition experiments of NAR in A549 cells. The A549 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI of ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261 strain) and cells were treated with NAR (125 μM) at different moments. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation from the experimental design. A549 cells were submitted to different treatment regimens: (1) infected and left untreated (positive control of infection); (2) treated with NAR (125 μM) for 90 minutes prior to ZIKV infection; (3) treated with NAR during ZIKV infection; (4) treated with NAR during and after ZIKV infection; (5) treated with NAR after ZIKV infection; or (6) treated with IFN-α 2A (200 UI/ml) after ZIKV infection as a control of treatment. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative density plot showing the frequency of infected cells (4G2
   <sup>+</sup>) in each experimental condition. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Frequency of ZIKV-infected cells (4G2

   <bold>D</bold>) The viral titers detected by foci-forming immunodetection assay (FFU

   <bold>E</bold>) Representative foci-forming immunodetection assay (FFU
   <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL) from Fig. 5D. The data represent three independent experiments in technical triplicate that were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey´s Multiple Comparison Test (*
