<p id="Par34">Viral titers in cell culture supernatant were determined by the foci-forming immunodetection assay in C6/36 cells (FFU
 <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL). Briefly, cell culture supernatants were 10-fold serially diluted in Leibovitz’s medium 15 (L-15) supplemented with 0.26% of tryptose and 25 µg/mL gentamicin and added to C6/36 (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates) in duplicate. After 1h30 min, the inoculum was removed and a CMC overlay media (L-15 supplemented with 5% SFB, 0.26% tryptose, 25 µg/mL gentamicin, 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose) was added and plates incubated at 28 °C. The immunostaining was performed after seven days using the mouse monoclonal Flavivirus group-specific antibody 4G2, followed by goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), which was detected by adding a solution of NBT/BCIP (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as a substrate. Foci was counted and expressed as FFU
 <sub>C6/36</sub>/ml.
