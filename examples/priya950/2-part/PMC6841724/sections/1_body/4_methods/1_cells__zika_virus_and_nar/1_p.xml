 </sup>. Human A549 lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-185) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium consisting of an F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F-12), supplemented with 25 µg/mL of gentamicin and 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human gliobastoma cell line (A172; ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-1620
 <sup>TM</sup>) was grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 10% FBS. Human embryonic stem cell line (NKX2-5
 <sup>eGFP/w</sup>hESC) was seeded on matrigel-coated culture plates using the mTeSR
 <sup>TM</sup>1 medium (StemCell Technologies) and cultured as previously described

 <sup>eGFP/w</sup>hESC cells were kindly provided by Dr. David Elliot from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI), Australia. A549, A172, Huh7.5 and NKX2-5
 <sup>eGFP/w</sup>hESC were all cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, controlled 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hmdDCs) were generated from peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors as already described

 </sup>, however using 25 ng/mL of human recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) and 12.5 ng/mL of human recombinant GM-CSF (rGM-CSF) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, United States). The study with human cells from healthy donors was approved by Committee of Human Experimentation from Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) under the number CAAE: 60643816.6.0000.5248. All reagents, unless specified, were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Grand Island, New York, USA).
