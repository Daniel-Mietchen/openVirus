 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24 well plate) were submitted to different treatment regimens: (1) infected and left untreated (positive control of infection); (2) treated with NAR (125 μM) for 1.5 h prior to ZIKV infection; (3) treated with NAR during ZIKV infection; (4) treated with NAR during and after ZIKV infection; (5) treated with NAR after ZIKV infection; or (6) treated with IFN-α 2A (200 UI/ml) after ZIKV infection as a control of treatment (Fig.
