 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). The same experimental conditions were tested using IFN-α 2A (200 UI/ml) as a positive control for the antiviral treatment. The number of infected cells was determined by FACS, and the virus titers at cell culture supernatant was performed to evaluate the impact of NAR treatment at different time points on A549-infected cells.
