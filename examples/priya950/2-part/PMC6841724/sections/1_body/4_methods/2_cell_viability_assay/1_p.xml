<p id="Par28">A549 cell viability following NAR treatment was tested by Annexin-V/7-AAD (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) cell staining procedure. A549 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates) were incubated for 18 hours and treated with different concentrations of NAR (2,000, 1,000, 500, 250, 125 and 62.5 µM) or 1% DMSO (vehicle). The cells were maintained for 48 hours. After incubating, the cells were trypsinized, labelled with Annexin-V (FITC) and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS) (FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The viable A549 cells were defined as double-negative for Annexin-V
 <sup>−</sup>/7-AAD
 <sup>−</sup> and the resulting data were used to determine the maximal non-toxic concentration (MNTC) of NAR. Additionally, the concentration that inhibited viability in 50% of the cells (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained using nonlinear regression and a sigmoidal concentration-response curve (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA). The same protocol was used to determine the MNTC of NAR for Huh7.5, A172, NKX2-5
 <sup>eGFP/w</sup>hESC. For hmdDCs the expression of Annexin-V/7-AAD and the establishment of MNTC were performed after 24 h in culture. Finally, an immunofluorescence assay was performed to confirm that 125 μM of NAR did not affect A549 cells viability. Briefly, A549 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates) were treated with NAR (125 μM) in DMEM-F12 for 48 hours. The cells were than fixed and permeabilized with methanol:acetone (v/v) and cell nuclei was stained with DRAQ5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, New York, USA). The cell nuclei count after treatment with NAR were determined by an Operetta High-Content Imaging System using Harmony High Content Imaging and Analysis software (4 different fields and 20x magnification; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
