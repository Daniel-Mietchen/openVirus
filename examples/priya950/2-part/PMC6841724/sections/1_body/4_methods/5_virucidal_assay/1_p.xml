 <sup>6</sup> FFU
 <sub>C6/36</sub> of ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261) was incubated with NAR (125 μM) in the presence or absence of RNase A (150 μg/mL) (USB-Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 37 °C for 1 hour. Zika virus RNA samples that were treated with RNase or left untreated were used as controls. After incubation, the amplification of ZIKV envelope gene was performed based on a one-step RT-PCR assay previously described
