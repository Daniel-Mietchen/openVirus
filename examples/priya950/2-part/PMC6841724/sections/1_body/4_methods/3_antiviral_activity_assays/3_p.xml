 </sup>, interferon-α 2A (IFN-α 2A) (200 UI/ml; Blau Farmacêutica, Cotia, SP, Brazil) was used as a positive control for the antiviral treatment. Furthermore, concentration-response curves were obtained using a serial dilution starting from the MNTC of NAR. The concentration that inhibited 50% and 90% of the viral infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub>, respectively) was obtained using a nonlinear regression, followed by a sigmoidal concentration-response (variable slope; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Also, the selectivity index (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated.
