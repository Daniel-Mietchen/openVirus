<p id="Par29">The antiviral activity of NAR was assessed using immunofluorescence, FACS, one-step reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and foci-forming immunodetection assays. First, the A549 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates) were incubated for 18 hours. The cells were then infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 90 minutes, washed and the MNTC of NAR (125 μM) was added. After a 48 hours incubation, the cell culture supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C for virus titration in C6/36. Moreover, the cells were detached and stained for FACS using a 4G2-FITC monoclonal antibody (anti-E protein of flavivirus; ATCC® HB-112™) as previously described

 </sup>. A BD FACS Canto II was used to quantify the number of 4G2-positive cells. Additionally, RNA extracted from the cell pellet (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to quantify the ZIKV NS2B genes using a RT-qPCR

 </sup>. In brief, 5 µg of RNA was used to amplify the ZIKV NS2B gene using specific primers (10 pmol) and a probe (4 pmol). For normalization, an 18S gene amplification was performed using 10 pmol of the primers 18SF and 18SR. The final reaction volume was 20 μL. The gene modulation was determined by calculating the 2
