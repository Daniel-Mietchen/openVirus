<p id="Par7">Based on the previous data showing the anti-dengue virus activity of NAR

 </sup>, a set of experiments were performed to evaluate the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR. A549 cells were infected with ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261) and treated with different concentrations of NAR (15.6, 31.25, 62.5 and 125 µM) after inoculum removal. According to the literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> and kinetic experiments it was observed that 48 h was the best time point for immunostaining once at 72 h we observe cytopathic effect (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thus, to access antiviral activity of NAR, FACS and the foci-forming immunodetection assay were performed in cells and cell culture supernatant after 48 hours post-infection (hpi), respectively. Results demonstrate that the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR was concentration-dependent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A–C</xref>). Surprisingly, IFN-α 2A-treated cells presented more viable ZIKV particles in the cell culture supernatant than NAR-treated cells did (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). An analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of infected cells indicates that IFN-α 2A controls the number of infected cells; however, the production of the virus is not reduced to the same level compared to NAR-treated cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Additionally, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub> indexes were calculated as 58.79 and 154.37 µM, respectively, with confidence of interval of 95% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). The selective index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of NAR was 11.79.
