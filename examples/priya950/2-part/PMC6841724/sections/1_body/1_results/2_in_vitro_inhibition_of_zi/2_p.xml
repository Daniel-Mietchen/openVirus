<p id="Par8">Using an immunofluorescence assay (Operetta high-content imaging), NAR was shown to reduce the number of A549-infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). Additionally, RT-qPCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) demonstrated that NAR impairs ZIKV replication. Furthermore, results from two different assays indicate the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR was not due to a virucidal effect on the virus particles (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Virus particles treated with NAR (125 µM) did not affect viral infectivity, suggesting no effect on the viral structure (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Additionally, it was tested if NAR treatment (125 µM) of A549 cells could modulate cell autofluorescence. Using FACS it was demonstrated that NAR does not affected A549 cells autofluorescence compared to untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
