<p id="Par6">To determine the concentration of NAR to use for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we performed a viability assay. Results indicated that NAR is toxic for A549 cells at higher concentrations (from 500 to 2,000 μM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). After treatment of A549 cells with 500 μM of NAR 10% of cells become apoptotic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). Also, data demonstrated, using double-negative A549 cells (Annexin-V
 <sup>−</sup>/7-AAD
 <sup>−</sup>), that NAR could be safely used in the antiviral assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). Moreover, double-negative A549 cells were used to establish the cytotoxic concentration for 50% of the culture (CC
 <sub>50</sub>), which was calculated as 693.6 μM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Despite 250 μM NAR being non-toxic for A549 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>), it was defined 125 μM of NAR as the maximal non-toxic concentration (MNTC), to avoid residual toxicity and with the aim of using a lower concentration of NAR in the antiviral assays. Moreover, the cell nuclei count using Operetta high-content imaging show that NAR (125 μM) did not reduce the number of cells compared to untreated A549 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Altogether, results from different assays confirm that 125 μM of NAR was safe to use in A549 cells and did not show toxic effects.
