 </sup>. Once the experimental data indicated that NAR could act on the replication, maturation or assembly of viral particles, we employed molecular modeling to assess the hypothesis that NAR may act as a non-competitive inhibitor of the NS2B-NS3 viral protease. First, we validated a docking protocol using the available experimental data

 </sup>. For validation, two flavonoids known as non-competitive inhibitors of the ZIKV protease were chosen, namely myricetin, because of its high activity, and apigenin, due to its close structural similarity to NAR

 </sup>. Docking calculations show that NAR is able to interact with the ZIKV protease in a similar way as myricetin and apigenin (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Thus, we speculate that NAR is able to bind to the ZIKV protease and inhibit it via a non-competitive mechanism in the same way as other flavonoids. Experimental validation is needed to prove the interaction between NAR and ZIKV-protease.
