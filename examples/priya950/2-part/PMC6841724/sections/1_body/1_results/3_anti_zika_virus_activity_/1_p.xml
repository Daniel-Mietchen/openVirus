<p id="Par9">Using phylogenetic analyses it was demonstrated the existence of two main Zika virus lineages, the African- and Asian- lineages

 </sup> (Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that the African- and Asian-lineage of ZIKV present differences in virulence/pathogenicity

 </sup>. Thus, to exclude a lineage-specific anti-ZIKV activity of NAR against ZV BR 2015/15261, four additional ZIKV strains were tested, three from Asian-lineage (ZV BR 2016/16288, ZV BR 2015/15098, ZIKV PE243) and one from African-lineage (ZIKV MR766). Using FACS and the foci-forming immunodetection assay, it was possible to demonstrate that NAR impairs the A549-infection with both Asian- and African-lineages of ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, despite NAR was effective to reduce the infection with both ZIKV lineages, a higher effect was observed for Asian-lineage (~4 fold reduction of infection) when compared to African-lineage (~2 fold reduction of infection) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).
