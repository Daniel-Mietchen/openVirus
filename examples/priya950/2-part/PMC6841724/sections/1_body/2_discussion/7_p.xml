  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>

 </sup>. The results showed that the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR is lineage-independent, although a higher reduction of infection was observed for Asian-lineages of ZIKV when compared to the African-lineage. Intrinsic differences in the pathogenicity and virulence of African- and Asian-lineage of ZIKV were already demonstrated

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. While those differences could account for differences in clinical presentation needs to be better defined. However, Asian-lineage seems to infect cells at lower rate, produces less virus and trigger poor early cell death compared to the more virulent African-lineage
