<p id="Par21">An additional aspect of anti-ZIKV activity of NAR that should be taken into consideration is the cell line used in the experiments. Anti-ZIKV activity of NAR seems to be cell-line dependent, once ZIKV-infection of human embryonic stem cell line was not affected neither by NAR nor by IFN-Î± 2A. Otherwise, for three cell lines used and a primary human cell (hmdDCs) NAR seems to be able to impair ZIKV infection. It was demonstrated that the absorption and metabolism of the flavonoids would vary between cell lines

 </sup>. This associated with differential subcellular distribution and efficiency of NAR accumulation inside the cells might lead to differential cell-line responses observed
