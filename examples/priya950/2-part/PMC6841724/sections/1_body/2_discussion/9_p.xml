<p id="Par22">To determine the stage of the ZIKV life cycle that is affected by NAR, a time-of-drug-addition experiment was performed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. The data indicate that NAR acts between replication and virus assembly, as already shown for the dengue and Chikungunya viruses

 </sup>. In addition, the antiviral effect of NAR was evident even when NAR treatment was postponed for 24 hours after infection, and it was similar to IFN-α 2A. Similarly, treatment of ZIKV-infected Vero cells with 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (6MMPr) 72 hpi impairs viral RNA production and demonstrated the potential use as antiviral compound

 </sup>. Thus, the fact that NAR also inhibit acute inflammation and reduce pain, would represent an additional advantage of using NAR for treating ZIKV infected patients
