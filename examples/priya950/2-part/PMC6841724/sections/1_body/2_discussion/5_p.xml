<p id="Par18">Here, four different techniques showed that NAR was able to impair the ZIKV infection in A549 cells. Additionally, we observed that NAR performed better than IFN-α 2A in reducing the virus titer in the cell culture supernatant. Thus, it seems that IFN-α 2A reduces the number of ZIKV-infected A549 cells, despite having lower impact on the secretion of viable ZIKV particles. The same phenotype was observed for A172 and Huh7.5 cells treated with IFN-α 2A. Goebel

Finally, this effect seems to be specific for ZIKV infection, once IFN-α 2A was able to reduce the secretion of viable dengue virus particles in cell culture supernatants to the same extent as the percentage of Huh7.5-infected cells
