 </sup>. A reduction in the possible hydrogen bonds of apigenin, as shown by molecular docking with the viral NS2B-NS3 protease, is consistent with the experimental data. The concentration of apigenin necessary to inhibit half the maximum activity of the protease is 43 times higher than that of myricetin, which can establish more hydrogen bonds

 </sup>. According to the molecular modeling data, NAR is able to interact with the viral protease in the same way as other flavonoids, which are known allosteric inhibitors of this protein. Thus, we propose that the molecular target of NAR is the NS2B-NS3 protease. However, experimental validation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
