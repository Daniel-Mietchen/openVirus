<p>As with vector competence, effects of temperature on life-history traits have been found to be both species and population-dependent [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The variability in experimental results demonstrates that making broad conclusions regarding the potential effect of rising temperatures on vectorial capacity is difficult. One general trend that is apparent is that optimal temperatures for vector fitness (i.e., temperatures at which population size is maximized) are generally lower than optimal temperatures for pathogens (temperatures at which competence and extrinsic incubation rates are maximized). Studies modeling transmissibility need to consider the differential effects of temperature on all aspects of vectorial capacity. There are additional caveats to these experimental studies that need to be considered. First, experimental studies, even those that have utilized fluctuating temperatures, still fail to account for the range of fluctuation of temperature and numerous other potentially critical dynamic environmental factors. Additionally, a number of studies have demonstrated that enzootic arboviruses including WNV, Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and La Crosse Virus (LACV) can have significant impacts on mosquito longevity [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Whether or not such effects are variable at different temperatures or with different viral strains has not been well studied but is suggested [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Lastly, the extensive variability on both the individual and population level demonstrates that significant plasticity exists in response to changing temperatures that likely has a genetic basis. This suggests that studies with current populations may be inept representations of future populations, which theoretically could acquire increased fitness at higher temperatures as a result of adaptive evolution.
