<p>Thermal biology is emerging as a trait-based approach to studying temperature effects, especially for arboviruses [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two patterns in temperature relationships among arboviruses were revealed: in some viruses, a strong role of temperature was clear across the virus’ range, while for others, temperature was more important in setting the virus’ range, but not in governing dynamics within that range. For example, WNV frequently increased with increasing temperature, even in locations where it was endemic. In contrast, RVFV generally did not show strong temperature effects where the virus was endemic.
