<p>Temperature effects have also been detected in viruses where other factors have been shown to be the main determinants of viral dynamics. Rainfall and vegetation have been found to be most predictive of RVFV [
 <xref rid="B264-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>] and RVFV in south and east Africa was successfully predicted without consideration of land surface temperature [
 <xref rid="B265-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. However, a mechanistic model based on water temperature and surface area was used to examine a range of conditions theoretically expected to be favorable to RVFV persistence and outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] and in Kenya, minimum temperature was among the significant variables included in a RVFV early-warning system [
 <xref rid="B266-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. Temperature factored into a mechanistic model for RVFV in East Africa [
 <xref rid="B267-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Temperature and precipitation effects were also included in a SEIR model of RVFV in Tanzania, where an increased risk at low temperatures was found, despite an increase in overall risk under climate change ([
 <xref rid="B165-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], but see [
 <xref rid="B268-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>] where no effect of temperature was observed). Cooler-than-normal temperatures regionally (~30 °C compared to ~40 °C) and heavy rainfall were associated with RVFV in South Africa in 2010/2011 [
 <xref rid="B221-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>], but note that spatially, epidemic outbreaks were most likely to occur in regions with temperature &gt;32 °C, and increased risk from 25–32 °C relative to temperatures &lt;25 °C [
 <xref rid="B269-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. Temperature was also included in a discriminant analysis of RVFV in South Africa [
