<p>Despite the variety of environmental models used and the range of arboviruses examined, temperature effects have been relatively consistent. Within the main portion of the arboviruses’ range and along the cooler edge, an increase in temperature is typically associated with an increase in arboviral activity. For example, WNV infection rates north of 30° N, have been associated with increased temperatures [
