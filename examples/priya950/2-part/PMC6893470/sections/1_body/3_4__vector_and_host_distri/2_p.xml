<p>Temperature effects on mosquitoes are generally thought to be unimodal [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], although the location of the mode varies by species [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>,
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Cx annulirostris</italic>, a major vector for RRV, had increasing abundance with increasing temperature up to 32 °C (minimum ~10 °C), while 
 <italic>Cx. australis</italic>, another prevalent mosquito species in the same area, had peak abundance at lower temperatures (min 6 °C), but peak abundances were lower than for 
 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Similarly, while increased temperatures have been shown to increase 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, in some of the same regions, they have been shown to decrease populations of 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic>, involved in early-season amplification of WNV [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Vector distribution can also lead to non-intuitive patterns of disease outbreak. For example, seasonal activity of RRV in Australia for a given vector species is later as one progresses from north to south. However, seasonal activity begins earlier in some southern areas due to the presence of a vector species that is active at lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Therefore, the direction of temperature effects vary by species and by the specific study site within a species range (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]).
