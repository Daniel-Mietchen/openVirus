<p>Vector distributions have been explicitly modeled through species distribution modeling (SDM) (Reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] and Table S2 of [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The geographic scope of these models is highly variable, with the global distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> having been repeatedly studied [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> has also been studied globally [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Other species have global distributions (e.g., 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]), but to our knowledge have only been modeled within continents [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The capacity of vectors to adapt to local conditions have also been evaluated using a species distribution modeling (SDM) approach. The accuracy of SDMs has been evaluated using 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> distribution for each continent to predict its distribution on other continents [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Only moderate matches between the predicted and actual distribution were found, suggesting that SDMs do not capture all factors of relevance, which is consistent with critiques of these approaches [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Mathematical models have also been used to model vector population dynamics [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>].
