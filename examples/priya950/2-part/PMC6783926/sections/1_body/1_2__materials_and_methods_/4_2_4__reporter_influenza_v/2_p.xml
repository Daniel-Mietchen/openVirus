<p>The dynamic signal range of the Gluc reporter assay was assessed by infecting MDCK cells with varying quantities of the PR8-Gluc virus (multiplicities of infection [MOIs] of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1) and determining Gluc activity at various times post-infection (24 and 36 hr p.i.). The Gluc assay was performed using a Pierce 
 <italic>Guassia</italic> luciferase glow assay kit (Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Mock infected cells were used as a blank control.
