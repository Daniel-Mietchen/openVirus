<p>The library containing 891 natural products was purchased from MedChemExpress (MCE; Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). The compounds were arrayed in twelve 96-well plates (columns 2 to 11 on each plate) at a 10 mM concentration in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), leaving columns 1, and 12 with DMSO. The positive control drug for this assay, baloxavir acid (MCE, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), was solubilized at 10 mM in DMSO. The stock solution was diluted to a final concentration of 20 Î¼M for the screens.</p>
