<p>The quality of each screen was assessed by evaluating the signal-to-background (S/B) ratio, the coefficient of variation (CV), and the Z’ factors. In each plate, the parameters were calculated as follows: (1) S/B = mean signal of negative control / mean signal of positive control; (2) CV = SD of negative control / mean of negative control; (3) Z’ = 1 − 3 × (SD of positive control + SD of negative control) / (mean of negative control - mean of positive control). SD represents the standard deviation. A Z’ value between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered robust enough for an HTS assay, while CV reflects signal deviation within an assay and is recommended to be less than or equal to 20% [
