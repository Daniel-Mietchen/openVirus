<p>The RdRp assay was modified as previously described [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids for the expression of viral polymerase complex proteins (i.e., PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) and a firefly luciferase gene-encoding influenza viral minigenome using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. After incubation for 4 h (hrs), the cells were washed with PBS and re-suspended with fresh DMEM.
