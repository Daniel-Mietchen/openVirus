<p>For assay optimization, the transfected cells were seeded into white, flat-bottom, 96-well plates (CulturPlate; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at a density of 20,000 cells/well in a 100 µL assay medium. Cells expressing PB1, PA, NP, and viral minigenome, but no PB2, were used as the blank control. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-transfection (p.t.), respectively, 50 µL of neolite luciferase substrate (PerkinElmer) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 5 to 10 min. Luciferase activity was measured by a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).</p>
