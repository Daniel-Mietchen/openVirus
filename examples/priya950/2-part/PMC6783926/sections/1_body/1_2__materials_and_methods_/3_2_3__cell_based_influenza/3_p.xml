<p>To perform HTS, the transfected cells were seeded into white, flat-bottom, 96-well CulturPlates (PerkinElmer) at a density of 20,000 cells/well in an 80 µL assay medium, followed by the addition of each compound in a 20 µL assay medium per well, resulting in a final concentration of 20 µM (0.2% DMSO) for all compounds. In each 96-well plate, DMSO and baloxavir acid were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by luciferase activity measurement.</p>
