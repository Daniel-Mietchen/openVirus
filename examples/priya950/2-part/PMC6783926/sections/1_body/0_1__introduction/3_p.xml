<p>Different screening approaches, based on cells expressing the influenza virus RdRp complex, nucleoprotein (NP) and a viral mini-genomic RNA, have been recently developed for identifying inhibitors targeting influenza A viral RNA transcription/replication [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, these target-based screen approaches often have a high rate of false positives. In this study, we developed a parallel phenotypic versus target-based screen to improve the accuracy and efficacy of screen for influenza A virus RdRp inhibitors, and we demonstrated that this strategy is a powerful approach for inhibitor identification.
