<p>By using this parallel HTS strategy, a library consisting of 891 compounds derived from natural products was screened as a proof-of-concept HTS. Quality controls showed that the primary screen was robust and the data reliable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f004">Figure 4</xref>a–d). As a result, 57 “hits” shared by both screens were subjected to a second screening, where 55 of them failed at this stage. The dose-response analysis and titer reduction assay using wild-type IAV further validated JL-5001, one of the two hit candidates, as a potential IAV RdRp inhibitor, thereby providing a novel chemical scaffold for further optimization.
