<p>It is interesting to point out that the hits specific to the PR8-Gluc virus-based screen, but not to the RdRp-targeted screen, likely target steps other than RNA transcription/replication in the influenza A virus replication cycleâ€”steps such as virus entry, assembly, and release. These hits will be further studied in the near future.</p>
