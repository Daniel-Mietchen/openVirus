<p>Phenotypic screens and target-based approaches have been the two major screening paradigms for novel drug discovery in the past several decades. Target-based drug discovery has been limited by the small number of well-validated targets. In addition, leads identified through target-based screening often have off-target effects, contributing towards drug toxicity or inactivity in clinical trials [

In contrast, phenotypic assays are not limited to known targets, therebu greatly expanding drug target diversity and benefiting the drug discovery process. However, a drug discovery can be hampered due to the unknown modes of action of new lead compoundsâ€”for example, the unknown nature of the target made it difficult for lead compound optimization. Therefore, it is desirable to rapidly identify the targets of lead compounds developed through phenotypic screening [
