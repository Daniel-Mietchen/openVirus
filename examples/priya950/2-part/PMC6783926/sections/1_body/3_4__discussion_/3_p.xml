<p>In this study we report a parallel HTS strategy that combines a target (RdRp)-based screen and a phenotypic screen (using reporter influenza A PR8-Gluc virus). The RdRp-based and PR8-Gluc virus-based screening are carried out sequentially upon the same compound library, and only the hits selected by both screens are selected for further development. This strategy can avoid the pitfalls of the target (RdRp)-based screen, by significantly reducing the number of false-positives, and improve the accuracy and efficacy of the primary screen. Moreover, the target of the lead compounds is known as RdRp, and the process of lead compound optimization can be greatly facilitated.</p>
