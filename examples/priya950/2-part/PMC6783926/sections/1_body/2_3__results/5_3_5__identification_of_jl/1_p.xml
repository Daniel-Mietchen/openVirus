<p>To validate the antiviral activity of JL-5001 and JL-5002, a dose-response analysis was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As a result, JL-5001 showed an inhibitory effect against the influenza PR8-Gluc virus with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.8 μM, while the CC
 <sub>50</sub> of JL-5001 against MDCK cells was 42.1 μM, corresponding to a SI of 10.9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). Moreover, the in vitro cell-based influenza RdRp assay demonstrated that JL-5001 inhibited IAV RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.5 μM, which is comparable to that against PR8-Gluc virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). JL-5002 exhibited an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.7 μM against the influenza PR8-Gluc virus and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10.3 μM against MDCK cells, corresponding to an SI of 6.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), however, it showed no significant inhibitory effect on viral RdRp activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). As a positive control, baloxavir acid was determined to have an IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 3.1 nM and 3.6 nM against PR8-Gluc virus and RdRp activity respectively (
