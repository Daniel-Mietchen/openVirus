<p>The normalized signal distribution of each individual screen was bell-shaped, with the majority of the 891 compounds showing no significant effect on the luminescence signal (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f004">Figure 4</xref>e, the percent inhibition of each compound against RdRp activity was plotted against PR8-Gluc virus infectivity, and compounds exhibiting &gt;80% inhibition in both screen (57 shared “hits” in total) were considered as hit candidates and short-listed for second screening. It is interesting to note that the primary screen also identified 20 false positives specific to RdRp activity and 39 secondary hits specific to PR8-Gluc virus infectivity.
