<p>As outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f003">Figure 3</xref>a, the RdRp-targeted assay and the PR8-Gluc virus-based assay were used to evaluate the same library of compounds sequentially, and the effect of each compound on RdRp activity and influenza A virus infectivity was directly compared. Three classes of hits were identified: (1) hits specific to RdRp activity but not to influenza replication (putative “false positives”); (2) hits shared by both screens were potential RdRp inhibitors; and (3) hits that inhibit influenza A virus infectivity but not RdRp activity (“Secondary hits”; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). These secondary hits may potentially target other steps rather than RNA replication/transcription in the influenza virus replication cycle. Of note, cytotoxic compounds and luciferase inhibitors might also be initially identified as shared “hits”, where “toxic hits” can be excluded by a toxicity screening, while an orthogonal counterscreen using wild-type IAVs can exclude the small molecules that inhibit luciferase activity [
