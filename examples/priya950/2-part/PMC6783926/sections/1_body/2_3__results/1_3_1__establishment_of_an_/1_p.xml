<p>A cell-based RdRp assay was adapted for high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify inhibitors targeting IAV RNA transcription/replication. Briefly, plasmids expressing IAV NP, PA, PB2, PB1, and a mini-genomic RNA were co-transfected into 293T cells. In constructing the mini-genomic plasmid, the open reading frame of the influenza A/WSN/33 NP protein was replaced by firefly luciferase, and this RNA segment was inserted into a human RNA polymerase I promoter/terminator cassette in the reverse orientation and complementary sense. Transfected cells were re-suspended and seeded into 96-well plates followed by incubation and luciferase measurement.</p>
