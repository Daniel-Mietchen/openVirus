<p>In optimizing the screening assay, the luciferase signal was measured at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h p.t. respectively, and the accuracy was assessed using several statistical parameters, including the S/B ratio, CV, and Z’ factor. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the transfected cells at 24 h p.t. and thereafter produced a robust S/B ratio of &gt;600, which is sufficient for high-throughput screening assays. However, the CV and Z’ value varied among the three batches of data, and, at 24 h p.t., the Z’ value of the assay reached 0.75 with a CV 8.3%, which together meet the desirable requirements for HTS.
