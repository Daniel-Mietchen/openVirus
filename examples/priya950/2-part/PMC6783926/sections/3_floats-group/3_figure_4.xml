  <p>Pilot screen using the parallel high-throughput screen approach. A pilot screen was carried out with a library containing 891 natural products. The quality of primary screen was controlled by assessing the (
   <bold>a</bold>) S/B ratios, (
   <bold>b</bold>) CVs, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) Z’ factors of each plate. The range of the three parameters for each screen were presented by box-and-whisker plots. (
   <bold>d</bold>) The signal distribution of all 891 samples. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Primary hit identification strategy. The percent inhibition of each test compound against PR8-Gluc infection was plotted with that against RdRp activity. Compounds showing &gt;80% inhibition in both screens (shared “hits”) are shortlisted for a second screening. (
   <bold>f</bold>) Second screening. Shared hits identified by the primary screen were subjected to a second round of the parallel screen as well as a cytotoxicity screen. Toxic hits indicate the compounds that reduce cell viability by &gt;30%.
