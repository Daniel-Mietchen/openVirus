  <p>Experimental design of the parallel high-throughput screening strategy. (
   <bold>a</bold>) RdRp-targeted and PR8-Gluc virus-based screen were sequentially or simultaneously carried out to evaluate the same library of compounds, and the data of each screen were collected for comparison. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Upper panel: For each plate in both screens, columns 1 and 12 were treated with baloxavir acid and DMSO as positive and negative controls, respectively. Lower panel: A compound that shows an inhibition of &gt;80% in an assay plate is selected as hits (black). Hits shared by two screens are selected as putative RdRp inhibitors; hits specific to PR8-Gluc virus-based screen are secondary hits and not discussed in this study, while hits specific to RdRp-targeted screen are regarded as false positives.
