  <p>Establishment of a high-throughput screen system using the replication-competent recombinant influenza virus carrying 
   <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase, PR8-Gluc. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Signal range of the PR8-Gluc virus-based infection assay. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with the reporter influenza virus PR8-Gluc virus at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1, respectively. Gluc activities were measured at 24 and 36 hr post-infection (p.i.), and those of the mock-infected cells were regarded as background. Data are shown as the average ± standard deviation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Quality control of the PR8-Gluc virus-based screening system. MDCK cells growing in 96-well plates (24 replicates) were infected with a PR8-Gluc virus at an MOI of 0.01, at 36 hr p.i. Gluc activities were measured and the S/B ratio, CV, and Z’ factor were calculated. Mock infected cells were measured for Gluc activities as background.
