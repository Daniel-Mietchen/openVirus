<p>In summary the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays have a high sensitivity and specificity when using whole viral nucleic acids and intact viral particles. No cross reactivity was observed with a wide range of non-target organisms and the assay performed well, if not better than other assays used in laboratories worldwide when tested on confirmed reference materials and international standards (QCMD). The pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus, pan-dengue virus PCR works well in an outbreak situation and triple positive signals give extra confidence in results. NS1 and pan-flavivirus were in 100% concordance where data was available. Interestingly there was 1 triple positive, pan-flavivirus/pan-dengue/dengue-2 RT-PCR sample that was NS1 antigen negative possibly due to improved sensitivity of the 3base assay.</p>
