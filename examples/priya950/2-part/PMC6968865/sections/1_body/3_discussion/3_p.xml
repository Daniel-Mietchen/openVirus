<p>The main advantages of molecular testing include the lack of cross reactivity with closely related species and improved sensitivity of pathogen detection. RT-PCR assays can be designed to specifically target individual serotypes. However, very few assays are able to target all the members of complex groups such as flavivirus or alphavirus using a single primer and probe set, without producing PCR bias due to mismatches in the primer or probe sites. In such cases conventional PCR assays require the use of multiple primer and probe sets to detect each virus individually.</p>
