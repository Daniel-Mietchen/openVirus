<p>LLOD studies were conducted using whole intact viral particles that had been inactivated in order to render them non-infectious. The results shown demonstrate that when DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, ZIKV and CHIKV inactivated whole virus particles were pooled in a serum matrix, the sensitivity of each assay was around 1â€“2 copy per reaction for the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays. Using RNA spiked into serum the sensitivity was less possibly due to some degradation of the RNA in the matrix.</p>
