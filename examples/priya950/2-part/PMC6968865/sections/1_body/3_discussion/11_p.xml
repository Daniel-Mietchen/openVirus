Furthermore, there have been no Chickungunya and only one Zika case recorded on the islands (Kalkie Sero, personal communication). There are 2 main referral hospitals in the region; Port Vila Central Hospital situated in the capital Port Vila, and the Northern District Hospital, Luganville. Port Vila Central is the largest referral hospital in the region and was where molecular testing was performed.
