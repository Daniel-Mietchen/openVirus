<p>The results generated have shown that the 3base assay is able to sensitively and specifically detect the presence of flavivirus, alphavirus and dengue using synthetic constructs, whole viral RNA, whole viral particles, contrived clinical samples as well as validation panels. After initial assay validation the method was then used to test clinical samples obtained during the 2016/2017 dengue 2 outbreak on Vanuatu.</p>
