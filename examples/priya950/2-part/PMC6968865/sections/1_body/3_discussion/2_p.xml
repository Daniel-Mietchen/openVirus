<p>Traditional detection of flaviviruses and alphaviruses in clinical samples has largely relied on Enzyme Immuno Assays. It is well established that EIA assays for ZIKV virus show a high degree of cross reactivity with dengue positive samples [

Furthermore, conventional Enzyme Immuno Assays are unable to differentiate between the individual DENV serotypes and are generally less sensitive than molecular assays. Other methods of detecting unknown aetiological agents of disease include the use of microarrays fabricated with large numbers of oligonucleotides probes specific for individual pathogens. Hybridisation of clinical samples to such arrays can be used to detect the presence of viral genomes in infected individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0227550.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, these new methods are still more costly, time consuming and lack the sensitivity when compared to more established methods such as RT-PCR, which can generate positive signals in around 1 hour.
