<p>PCR was performed on a MIC real time PCR platform (Bio molecular systems, Sydney, Australia) with a footprint of 13cm x 15cm x 15cm. The MIC is a 48 well 4-colour instrument that takes around 2 hours to complete a run using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays. Thus 12 individual patient samples from the GS-mini can be processed in a single run using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue/DENV-2 assays.</p>
