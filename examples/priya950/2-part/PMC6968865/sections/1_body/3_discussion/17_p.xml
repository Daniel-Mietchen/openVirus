<p>In total, 187 patient samples with suspected DENV infection were processed using the system (
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Of these, 116 gave triple pan-flavivirus, pan-dengue virus and DENV-2 positive results (62%). There were 7 samples that were positive only for the pan-dengue assay however all these samples gave very weak PCR signals with Ct values greater than 40. Thus DENV RNA may have been present below the LLOD of the assay, and unable to be reliably detected in serum samples. Due to time constraints it was not possible to return to these samples for further confirmation.
