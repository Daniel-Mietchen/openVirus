<p>Methods such as real time RT–PCR or nested RT–PCR are widely used to detect DENV genes in acute-phase serum samples. This detection coincides with the viremia and the febrile phase of illness onset [
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. RT–PCR has the additional advantage in that dengue serotype information can be quickly determined, which can assist in patient management, especially in those who go on to develop severe dengue illness. In order to assess the utility of the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assay in an outbreak situation, a small footprint (60cm x 60cm x 60cm) cartridge based automated nucleic acid extraction platform (GS-mini, Genetic Signatures, Australia) was used. The GS-mini purification system can process up to 12 samples in a single run in just under 1 hour. The purification platform was simple to use and staff with no prior molecular experience were competent with the process after undergoing only minimal training.
