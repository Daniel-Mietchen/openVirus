<p>The pan-species assays have been shown to amplify any member of the groups using a single primer and probe set. Using synthetic constructs, the pan-alphavirus assay was able to detect CHIKV, WEEV, EEEV, VEEV, RRV, NV, BFV and NV with a linear range 1E9 to 100 and to at least 25 copies per reaction for CHIKV, EEEV, VEEV, RRV, NV, BFV and NV and down to 10 copies per reaction for most viruses (
