<p>From the 12
 <sup>th</sup> to 24
 <sup>th</sup> March 2017 samples from patients with suspected dengue infection were screened using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assay. The sample cohort included archived samples and fresh serum samples from patients attending Port Vila Central Hospital with suspected DENV infection. Prior to testing, a preliminary study was undertaken to determine if samples such as a mouth swab or urine could be used to detect the presence of DENV, instead of the more invasive blood test. In a small number of patients presenting with DENV-like symptoms (n = 4) matched mouth swabs, urine and serum or plasma samples were obtained and processed. Although DENV RNA could be detected in both urine and mouth swabs the levels were significantly reduced compared to the matched serum/plasma samples. Due to the increased sensitivity obtained using serum/plasma samples this sample type was used in all subsequent patient testing.
