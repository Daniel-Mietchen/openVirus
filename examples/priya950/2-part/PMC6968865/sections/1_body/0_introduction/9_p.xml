<p>The 3base protocol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g002">Fig 2</xref>) deaminates all cytosine residues in nucleic acids to a uracil intermediate [
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This process makes closely related species more similar at the genomic level. This novel method ultimately means that primers and probe sets can be designed that have fewer mismatches and are able to hybridise to previously heterogeneous target regions with higher efficiency, thus improving PCR amplification of species that contain large numbers of individual pathogens.
