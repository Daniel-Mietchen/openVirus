<p>The most accurate method to diagnose viral agents is real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Primer and probe sequences complementary to the viral RNA are designed and cycled through a series of steps with positive samples seen as amplification curves on a RT-PCR instrument. This process can be completed in less than 1 hour, which significantly assists in patient management.</p>
