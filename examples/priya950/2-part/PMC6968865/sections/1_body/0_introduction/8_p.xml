<p>In order to simplify and improve the detection of alphaviruses and flaviviruses in clinical samples, we developed a commercially available 3base assay that is able to detect the presence of the target alphavirus or flavivirus using a single primer and probe set for each type. 3base assays use chemical modification to reduce the complexity of genomes from 4 to 3 base, which enable screening primers and probes with fewer mismatches to be developed so that bias in amplification efficiency across species is greatly reduced.
