<p>A total of 187 samples were tested (
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) during the 2016â€“2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. The original testing algorithm consisted of screening each sample for pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue only. During the first day of testing, pan-flavivirus/pan-dengue positive samples were subsequently typed with dengue typing primers that showed the serotype responsible for the current outbreak was DENV-2. In order to provide a more rapid diagnostic, DENV-2 primers were included at the request of the hospital in the initial screening assay to negate the need to perform subsequent reflex testing on the samples but still having the ability to detect new viruses if they emerged.
