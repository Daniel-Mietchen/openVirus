<p>These DNAs consist of single stranded 110bp DNA sequences that contain the identical primer and probe binding sites that are present in the viral nucleic acids of the target virus. In addition, the size of the amplicons are the same as those amplified in the viral nucleic acids to ensure results generated are consistent with what would occur in the native virus.</p>
