<p>In order to maximise the concentration of potential cross-reacting viruses (
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in the sample eluate, 15 μL of Amplirun controls were extracted along with 5 μL of the EPC. A positive control (Vircell Amplirun DENV/ZIKV/CHIKV total run control) was included in the run to confirm all components of the assay were working optimally. The nucleic acids in the Amplirun control are provided at a concentration of between 10,000–20,000 copies per μL to give a total concentration in the eluate of 150,000–300,000 copies of viral nucleic acids. Nucleic acid conversion and extraction was carried out as above.
