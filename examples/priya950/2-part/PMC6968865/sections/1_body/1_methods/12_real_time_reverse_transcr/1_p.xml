<p>Following sample extraction and elution in 50 μL, 2–4 μL of converted nucleic acids material were added to the combined PCR mastermix and components using the 
 <italic>EasyScreen</italic> Flavivirus Dengue Alphavirus Detection Kit. (Genetic Signatures, Sydney, Australia). Thermocycling consisted of 1 cycle of reverse transcription at 42°C for 30 minutes, followed by Taq polymerase activation at 95°C for 15 minutes, then 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 2 seconds, 55°C for 15 seconds (data collection), 60°C for 15 seconds and 65°C for 15 seconds. PCR amplification was carried out using either the Biorad CFX96/384 (Biorad, Hercules, USA) or the MIC (Biomolecular Systems, Sydney, Australia) platforms.
