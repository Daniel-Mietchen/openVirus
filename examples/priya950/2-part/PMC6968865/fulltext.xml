Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal finding</title><p>Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10&#x02013;25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1&#x02013;2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016&#x02013;2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples. The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec004"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flavivirus is a genus of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> that contains a large number of viral agents capable of causing encephalitis and jaundice [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most flaviviruses are arboviruses and transmitted to the human population by a bite from infected mosquitoes or ticks. Flaviviruses typically contain a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 10-11kb in length. The genome encodes 3 structural proteins (Capsid, prM, and Envelope) and 8 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5 and NS5B) [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The viruses are enveloped with a diameter of around 50nm, and appear icosahedral or spherical when observed under the electron microscope [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Individual members such as dengue (DENV), yellow-fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.</p><p>DENV is a major public health concern on a global scale with an estimated 400 million infections and 100 million clinical cases in 2010. Most of these patients will carry the disease asymptomatically. However, around 5% of infected individuals will progress to severe dengue, an illness characterized by plasma leakage leading to hypovolemic shock, hemorrhage, and potentially death. The case-fatality rate for individuals with severe dengue can be as high as 10% if untreated, or 0.1% with appropriate clinical management [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Alphaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are classified as belonging to the group IV Togaviridae family of viruses [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are over thirty members in the alphavirus group that are able to infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans, rodents, fish, birds, and horses. At the genomic level alphaviruses consist of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome 11 to 12kb in length with a 5&#x02019; cap, and 3&#x02019; poly-A tail. Alphavirus particles are enveloped, have a size of around 70 nm in diameter under the electron microscope and appear to be spherical with a 40 nm isometric nucleocapsid. Like flaviviruses the main mode of transmission to the human population is via bites from infected mosquitoes. Notable viruses that infect the human population include chikungunya (CHIKV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], O'nyong'nyong

and severity of flavivirus and alphavirus infection requires accurate surveillance tools and timely diagnosis to ensure infected patients obtain the best medical treatment options and alert authorities to possible outbreaks of disease.</p><p>The most accurate method to diagnose viral agents is real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Primer and probe sequences complementary to the viral RNA are designed and cycled through a series of steps with positive samples seen as amplification curves on a RT-PCR instrument. This process can be completed in less than 1 hour, which significantly assists in patient management.</p><p>However, members of the flavivirus and alphavirus families are quite heterogeneous at the RNA level, therefore it can be difficult to design a single set of primers and probe sequences that can detect each of the families at the genus and species level. An example of this is DENV that contains four serotypes, each being quite diverse at the genomic level [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Like most current dengue RT-PCR assays, the CDC DENV-1-4 RT-PCR Assay detects serotypes 1&#x02013;4 using an individual primer pair and probe for each type [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Assays that can universally detect all DENV serotypes have been described but these assays still employ more than 2 primers to detect all subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In order to simplify and improve the detection of alphaviruses and flaviviruses in clinical samples, we developed a commercially available 3base assay that is able to detect the presence of the target alphavirus or flavivirus using a single primer and probe set for each type. 3base assays use chemical modification to reduce the complexity of genomes from 4 to 3 base, which enable screening primers and probes with fewer mismatches to be developed so that bias in amplification efficiency across species is greatly reduced.

After initial assay validation the method was then used to test clinical samples obtained during the 2016/2017 dengue 2 outbreak on Vanuatu.</p><p>Traditional detection of flaviviruses and alphaviruses in clinical samples has largely relied on Enzyme Immuno Assays. It is well established that EIA assays for ZIKV virus show a high degree of cross reactivity with dengue positive samples [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that dengue IgG and IgM assays can cross react with ZIKV-positive patient samples [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, conventional Enzyme Immuno Assays are unable to differentiate between the individual DENV serotypes and are generally less sensitive than molecular assays. Other methods of detecting unknown aetiological agents of disease include the use of microarrays fabricated with large numbers of oligonucleotides probes specific for individual pathogens. Hybridisation of clinical samples to such arrays can be used to detect the presence of viral genomes in infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, with the advent of next generation sequencing and the continuing reduction of costs associated with this technology it is now feasible to apply this method to viral discovery [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, these new methods are still more costly, time consuming and lack the sensitivity when compared to more established methods such as RT-PCR, which can generate positive signals in around 1 hour.</p><p>The main advantages of molecular testing include the lack of cross reactivity with closely related species and improved sensitivity of pathogen detection. RT-PCR assays can be designed to specifically target individual serotypes. However, very few assays are able to target all the members of complex groups such as flavivirus or alphavirus using a single primer and probe set, without producing PCR bias due to mismatches in the primer or probe sites. In such cases conventional PCR assays require the use of multiple primer and probe sets to detect each virus individually.</p><p>In addition, both flavivirus and alphaviruses show a different global distribution with viruses such as YFV endemic in Africa, TBEV endemic in Eurasia, JEV in Southeast Asia, MVEV in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and SLEV mainly found in the United States and more rarely in Canada and Mexico. Similar geographical patterns are also seen with alphaviruses. One advantage of the current pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue screening test is that the assays can be used in any global region to quickly detect the presence of an unknown viral infection. Once a viral family has been identified, individual typing reactions can be used to determine the pathogen responsible for disease. This simplifies and reduces the costs of broad screening approaches in disease outbreaks or during pathogen surveillance in humans or vectors.</p><p>The pan-species assays have been shown to amplify any member of the groups using a single primer and probe set. Using synthetic constructs, the pan-alphavirus assay was able to detect CHIKV, WEEV, EEEV, VEEV, RRV, NV, BFV and NV with a linear range 1E9 to 100 and to at least 25 copies per reaction for CHIKV, EEEV, VEEV, RRV, NV, BFV and NV and down to 10 copies per reaction for most viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The pan-flavivirus assay was able to detect DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, ZIKV, YFV, WNV and TBEV down to 13 copies per reaction, which was the lowest dilution tested using these constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Contrived clinical samples were prepared by spiking either serum or urine with whole virus particles and processing to determine if these sample types were detrimental to assay performance compared to processing viral particles in molecular grade water only. No significant difference was observed as determined by the Ct values of the EPC or the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays, indicating that the assays were compatible with the routine clinical sample types used for flavivirus and alphavirus molecular testing.</p><p>LLOD studies were conducted using whole intact viral particles that had been inactivated in order to render them non-infectious. The results shown demonstrate that when DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, ZIKV and CHIKV inactivated whole virus particles were pooled in a serum matrix, the sensitivity of each assay was around 1&#x02013;2 copy per reaction for the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays. Using RNA spiked into serum the sensitivity was less possibly due to some degradation of the RNA in the matrix.</p><p>No cross reactivity was observed with any component of the assays using a wide range of viral material including adenovirus, BK virus, coronavirus, CMV, enterovirus 68, enterovirus 71, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes Simplex virus 1, Herpes Simplex virus 2, HHV-6, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza B, parainfluenza-1, parainfluenza-2, parainfluenza-3, parainfluenza-4A, Respiratory Syncytial virus (subtype A), Respiratory Syncytial virus (subtype B), rhinovirus and Varicella Zoster virus. Positive and extraction controls gave the desired signals thus confirming the negative results.</p><p>QCMD panels for DENV, ZIKV virus and CHIKV from 2016&#x02013;2018 were obtained to monitor the performance of the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays using international standards and reference material. As can be seen from <xref rid="pone.0227550.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, results obtained using the pan-species assays and individual typing primers and probes demonstrated 100% concordance with the expected results after sample decoding. In addition, all &#x0201c;educational samples&#x0201d; that were detected by 52.9% to 86.1% of participating laboratories were positive when using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays. These results indicate that the assays are performing well, if not better than other molecular assays used worldwide.</p><p>The Pacific Islands suffer from a high burden of mosquito-borne disease. It was reported that between 2012 and 2014, dengue (serotypes 1&#x02013;4), CHIKV and ZIKV viruses were circulating in the region with over 120,000 people infected and that this number may be highly underreported. During that time 28 outbreaks of disease were reported. These numbers include 18 DENV (serotypes 1&#x02013;4), 7 CHIKV and 3 ZIKV outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These outbreaks result in a heavy toll on the islands&#x02019; health system. Thus rapid testing methods are required in the region to enhance surveillance and assist with critical response measures to limit the spread of disease.</p><p>Vanuatu is a Pacific Island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean with 83 islands, some of which are sparsely populated, that are home to a population of around 270,000 [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although a number of dengue outbreaks have occurred on the islands the case fatality from dengue has dropped from 6.62/100 in 2002 to 0/100 in 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This reduction is primarily due to increased public awareness for early detection and management. Furthermore, there have been no Chickungunya and only one Zika case recorded on the islands (Kalkie Sero, personal communication). There are 2 main referral hospitals in the region; Port Vila Central Hospital situated in the capital Port Vila, and the Northern District Hospital, Luganville. Port Vila Central is the largest referral hospital in the region and was where molecular testing was performed.</p><p>Although the Port Vila Central Hospital was equipped with molecular diagnostic facilities, at the time of this study it did not have access to molecular methods for the detection of flavivirus/alphavirus. Testing carried out included NS1 antigen testing, IgG and IgM serological tests. In order to confirm the presence of DENV samples had to be sent to New Zealand in order to type the strain responsible by molecular diagnostic techniques. This could result in a delay of 2 weeks to confirm the presence and serotype of dengue responsible for infection.</p><p>Methods such as real time RT&#x02013;PCR or nested RT&#x02013;PCR are widely used to detect DENV genes in acute-phase serum samples. This detection coincides with the viremia and the febrile phase of illness onset [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. RT&#x02013;PCR has the additional advantage in that dengue serotype information can be quickly determined, which can assist in patient management, especially in those who go on to develop severe dengue illness. In order to assess the utility of the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assay in an outbreak situation, a small footprint (60cm x 60cm x 60cm) cartridge based automated nucleic acid extraction platform (GS-mini, Genetic Signatures, Australia) was used. The GS-mini purification system can process up to 12 samples in a single run in just under 1 hour. The purification platform was simple to use and staff with no prior molecular experience were competent with the process after undergoing only minimal training.</p><p>PCR was performed on a MIC real time PCR platform (Bio molecular systems, Sydney, Australia) with a footprint of 13cm x 15cm x 15cm. The MIC is a 48 well 4-colour instrument that takes around 2 hours to complete a run using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays. Thus 12 individual patient samples from the GS-mini can be processed in a single run using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue/DENV-2 assays.</p><p>Total turn-around time from sample to result is in the order of 3 hours 30 minutes thus patients can be informed of the results within half a day. In addition, the testing algorithm inspires a high degree of confidence in that three markers are required for a positive result: pan-flavivirus positive; pan-dengue virus positive; and in the case of this particular outbreak, DENV-2 positive. Furthermore, no subsequent confirmation was required thus removing the lengthy process of sending samples to New Zealand for typing.</p><p>From the 12<sup>th</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> March 2017 samples from patients with suspected dengue infection were screened using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assay. The sample cohort included archived samples and fresh serum samples from patients attending Port Vila Central Hospital with suspected DENV infection. Prior to testing, a preliminary study was undertaken to determine if samples such as a mouth swab or urine could be used to detect the presence of DENV, instead of the more invasive blood test. In a small number of patients presenting with DENV-like symptoms (n = 4) matched mouth swabs, urine and serum or plasma samples were obtained and processed. Although DENV RNA could be detected in both urine and mouth swabs the levels were significantly reduced compared to the matched serum/plasma samples. Due to the increased sensitivity obtained using serum/plasma samples this sample type was used in all subsequent patient testing.</p><p>In total, 187 patient samples with suspected DENV infection were processed using the system (<xref rid="pone.0227550.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Of these, 116 gave triple pan-flavivirus, pan-dengue virus and DENV-2 positive results (62%). There were 7 samples that were positive only for the pan-dengue assay however all these samples gave very weak PCR signals with Ct values greater than 40. Thus DENV RNA may have been present below the LLOD of the assay, and unable to be reliably detected in serum samples. Due to time constraints it was not possible to return to these samples for further confirmation.</p><p>When looking at the patient demographics in more detail (where data was available) it was found that there were 61 female cases and 59 male cases of DENV infection in the patient cohort. Anker and Arima previously found an excess of males among reported DENV cases &#x02265; 15 years of age [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] however this was not supported in this limited study perhaps due to the small sample set.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the weekly prevalence of DENV infection from December 2016 to March 24<sup>th</sup> 2017. The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported in January 2017 with a decline in February. Interestingly, the number of cases of dengue infection then increased again in the month of March. March coincides with the start of routine testing of patients attending the Port Vila Central Hospital with DENV like symptoms using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue molecular assays. The increase of dengue cases seen in March may be attributed to an increase in sensitivity when using molecular methods compared to conventional EIA.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows age related DENV infections. As can be seen from the data the number of positive dengue cases mirrors the age demographics of the islands of Vanuatu [<xref rid="pone.0227550.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the number of DENV dengue cases by island of residence with the incidence per 1000 residents included. Efate has the largest population of Vanuatu with 86,250 residents and as would be expected also has the highest number of residents with confirmed DENV infection, with 26 cases over the period of testing. The remainder of the islands have a population of 46,078 to as low as 229 or less. In general, the number of positive DENV cases can be correlated with the island population, where for most islands, the incidence of DENV infection was not significantly different to the average national incidence (0.416 per 1000 people). However, the islands of Aniwa (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0035), Ambae (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001), Tongoa (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001), and Emae (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001) had a higher number of positive cases than would be expected from the number of residents alone. Interestingly the island of Santo, with a population of 46, 078, showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of dengue cases recorded (0.018 per 1000; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0016) compared to the national average. However, the most striking examples are the islands of Emae, Tongoa and Ambae. Ambae has a population of 11061 with 14 confirmed dengue cases while Tongoa and Emae had 2243 and 684 residents with a total of 5 and 6 cases respectively. Aniwa had 1 case of dengue and is home to only 229 inhabitants thus can be excluded as a reservoir of increased dengue infection due to the small population and only 1 case of infection. Although this study is relatively small with a total of 116 confirmed cases from the whole Vanuatu region, perhaps the islands Emae, Tongoa and Ambae had a higher number of mosquitoes harbouring DENV thus leading to the increased number of positive cases observed in residents of the island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0227550.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227550.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Dengue positive samples per 1000.</title><p>The figure shows the population of each island in Vanuatu with the number of cases per 1000 island population included.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227550.g007"/></fig><p>In summary the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays have a high sensitivity and specificity when using whole viral nucleic acids and intact viral particles. No cross reactivity was observed with a wide range of non-target organisms and the assay performed well, if not better than other assays used in laboratories worldwide when tested on confirmed reference materials and international standards (QCMD). The pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus, pan-dengue virus PCR works well in an outbreak situation and triple positive signals give extra confidence in results. NS1 and pan-flavivirus were in 100% concordance where data was available. Interestingly there was 1 triple positive, pan-flavivirus/pan-dengue/dengue-2 RT-PCR sample that was NS1 antigen negative possibly due to improved sensitivity of the 3base assay.</p><p>Results are obtained in just over 3 hours, enabling patients to receive results on the same day. The automated extraction platform and PCR instrument have a small footprint and the assay is easy to use even for staff with no formal molecular training making it ideal to use in situations with limited resources. Finally, the assays as described would be ideally suited as general screening tools or for vector surveillance studies, as any flavivirus or alphavirus can be quickly and sensitively detected regardless of the geographical region or viruses endemic in the region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227550.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>An example of data obtained from a matched patient urine/serum and swab sample.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227550.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the staff of the Vila Central Hospital for their support and help during the study period.
