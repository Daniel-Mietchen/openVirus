  <p>Lung histopathological stains reveal Cgp91ds‐TAT reduces airway inflammation in PR8‐infected mice. Histopathological analysis of lungs from WT C57Bl/6J mice treated daily via intranasal administration Cgp91ds‐TAT (0.2 mg/kg) or DMSO (2%; control) over a 4‐day period. Mice were infected with PR8 (500 PFU) or PBS control 1 day post initial drug treatment and analysed at Day 3 post‐infection. Representative H&amp;E images displaying the inflammation in lung sections following H&amp;E staining. Each sample was assigned a score of 0–5 for each individual mouse (higher numbers indicate increased disease severity), as assessed by two independent assessors. Sections were scored for alveolitis, inflammatory cell infiltrate and peribronchiolar inflammation. Magnifications of images are at ×1, ×3, ×6, ×10. The black arrows show peribronchial inflammation, red arrow perivascular inflammation and blue alveolitis. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM (control,

   <italic>n</italic> = 5; PR8, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 9; PR8 + Cgp91ds‐TAT, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Statistical analysis was conducted using one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparison tests. Statistical significance was taken where
