  <p>Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment suppressed BALF inflammation in mice infected with PR8 virus. Mice were treated daily with intranasal administration of Cgp91ds‐TAT (0.2 mg/kg) or DMSO (2%; control) over a 4‐day period. Mice were intranasally infected with PR8 (500 PFU) or PBS control 1 day post initial drug treatment. BALF inflammation was assessed via counting the total number of (A) live cells and differential cell counts of (B) macrophages, (C) neutrophils, (D) lymphocytes and (E) eosinophils. A total of 500 cells were counted from random fields by standard morphological criteria. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (control,
