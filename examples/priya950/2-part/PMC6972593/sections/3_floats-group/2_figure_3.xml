  <p>Cgp91ds‐TAT markedly reduces viral mRNA expression and ROS generation. WT C57Bl/6J mice (8–12 weeks) were treated daily via intranasal administration of Cgp91ds‐TAT (0.2 mg/kg) or DMSO (2%) control. Mice were intranasally infected with PR8 (500 PFU) or PBS control 1 day post initial drug treatment. (A) Quantitative PCR analysis in lung tissue of mRNA from the gene encoding polymerase of influenza virus strain PR8; results were presented relative to those of GAPDH mRNA. (B) BALF was collected for PDB (10
   <sup>−6</sup> M)‐stimulated ROS production that was quantified by L‐O12 enhanced chemiluminescence. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM (control,

   <italic>n</italic> = 5; PR8, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 9; PR8 + Cgp91ds‐TAT, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Statistical analysis was conducted using one‐way ANOVA test followed by Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparison. Statistical significance was taken where
