<p>The left lung lobe was incubated in 10% neutral buffered formalin at RT for 24–28 h prior to processing. After fixation, lung samples were embedded in paraffin wax and sections (3–4 μm thick) were cut (CM1850, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) longitudinally through the left lung lobe and placed on super frost slides (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were de‐waxed with xylene and a series of graded ethanol that were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) and imaged by light microscopy. Samples were analysed on an Imagescope (Leica Biosystems, USA) and blindly scored from 0 to 5 for (higher numbers indicate increased disease severity). The lung injury score was determined by a grading system that combined assessments of alveolitis, inflammatory cell infiltration and peribronchiolar inflammation, as determined by two independent assessors.
 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> A score of 0 was indicative of healthy lungs (no damage); 1 indicated very mild damage; 2 mild damage; 3 moderate damage; 4 severe damage; and 5 represented extremely severe histological changes.
