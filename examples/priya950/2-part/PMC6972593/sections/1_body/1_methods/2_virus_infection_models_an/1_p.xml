<p>Mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (2–5% isoflurane/95% oxygen air mixture) and then treated daily via intranasal administration with control DMSO (2%) or Cgp91ds‐TAT (0.2 mg/kg) 1 day prior to infections over a 4‐day period. We have previously shown that Cgp91ds‐TAT at 0.2 mg/kg/day abolished ROS production in the bronchoalveloar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory cells following infection with the H3N2 (Hk‐x‐31 strain of influenza

This dose of PR8 causes severe lung inflammation including widespread alveolitis, peribronchial inflammation and perivascular inflammation. At the end of each experiment, BALF was taken by a lavage technique and the left lung lobe was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological examination.
