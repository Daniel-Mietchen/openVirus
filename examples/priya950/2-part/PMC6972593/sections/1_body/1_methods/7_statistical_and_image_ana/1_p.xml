<p>Data for ROS generation, viral mRNA expression, total and differential cell counts were analysed using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Histological lung samples were analysed on Imagescope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and statistical comparisons were made using the non‐parametric Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by the Dunn's post hoc test. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Version 6.0, San Diego, CA, USA). A
