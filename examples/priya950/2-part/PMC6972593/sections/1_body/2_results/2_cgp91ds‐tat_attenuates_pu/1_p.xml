<p>To assess the pathological changes associated with IAV infection, H&amp;E staining and pathology scoring system was employed. The lung tissue of PR8‐infected mice displayed high amounts of peribronchiolar inflammation with extensive epithelial destruction compared to the lungs of uninfected control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There was also evidence of intense intra‐alveolar inflammatory cellular infiltrates and significant perivascular inflammation when compared to the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In comparison, Cgp91ds‐TAT‐treated mice displayed only relatively minor histological changes in response to PR8 infection. There was less alveolitis and epithelial denudation, and although there was still evidence of peribronchial inflammation, it did not appear to be as widespread (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There was also a reduction in perivascular inflammation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Furthermore, Cgp91ds‐TAT alone did not cause any apparent adverse inflammation and the lung histology was similar to those of the uninfected controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
