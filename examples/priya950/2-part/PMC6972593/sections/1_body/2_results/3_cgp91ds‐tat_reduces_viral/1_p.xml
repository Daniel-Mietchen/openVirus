<p>Viral polymerase mRNA was detected in lung tissue in the PR8‐infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Mice treated with Cgp91ds‐TAT displayed a significantly reduced amount of viral mRNA expression when compared to the virus control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Importantly, the viral PA expression in naïve control and naïve Cgp91ds‐TAT‐treated mice was below the detection limit (Fig.
