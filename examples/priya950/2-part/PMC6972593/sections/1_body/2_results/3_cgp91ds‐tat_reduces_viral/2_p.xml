<p>L‐012 enhanced chemiluminescence was used to measure ROS generation in cells from the BALF of mice. Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment of naïve‐uninfected inflammatory cells taken from mice did not alter the amount of ROS detected when compared to the uninfected control group. Cells from PR8‐infected mice exhibited a significant increase in the amount of ROS production when compared to the uninfected control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). BALF inflammatory cells taken from Cgp91ds‐TAT‐treated virus‐infected mice produced significantly lower amounts of ROS than the PR8‐infected control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).
