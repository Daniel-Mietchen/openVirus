<p>To assess airway inflammation, the total number of live cells in the BALF was measured. There was a substantial increase in cellular infiltration in the PR8‐infected mice compared to the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). This inflammatory response to PR8 infection was significantly less in mice treated with Cgp91ds‐TAT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Using differential cell counting, PR8 infection showed a significant increase in the number of BALF macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils when compared to the uninfected controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B–E). Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment attenuated the numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils by approximately 40–50% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, E); however, it did not alter macrophage or lymphocyte numbers following PR8 infection. Importantly, Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment of naïve‐uninfected mice had no effect on the cell populations examined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="resp13524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
