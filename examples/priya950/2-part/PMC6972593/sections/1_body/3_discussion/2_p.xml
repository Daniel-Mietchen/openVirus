<p>Neutrophil influx is a hallmark feature of the host innate immune response to influenza virus infections
 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>; however, there is conflicting evidence for what the ultimate role is for incoming neutrophils. For instance, neutrophil‐depleted mice exhibited exacerbated amounts of pulmonary inflammation and respiratory dysfunction during influenza virus infection,
 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> suggesting that these cells are critical for minimizing influenza virus‐induced pathology. By contrast, partial suppression of neutrophil infiltration was associated with a milder pathology and improved morbidity. Differences may also arise from different dose of virus used between studies, which may cause varied inflammatory responses. In this study, a high dose of PR8 virus resulted in a substantial increase in neutrophil influx into the airways of mice at Day 3 post‐infection. By contrast, Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment reduced airway inflammation, and it resulted in a partial ~50% reduction in neutrophil infiltration following PR8 infection. Although the role of neutrophils in influenza virus infections is debatable, our data suggest that a partial suppression of neutrophil infiltration combined with inhibition of ROS resulted in less overall lung pathology and also enhanced viral clearance. Importantly, Cgp91ds‐TAT had no effect on the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in the airways following PR8 infection. These preserved responses might be critical for containment and clearance of viral infection and for secondary bacterial superinfections and pneumonia.
