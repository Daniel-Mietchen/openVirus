<p>Intriguingly, our study raises an important question: How does IAV escape the potential deleterious effects of ROS production in the endosomal compartment? Given that inhibition of endosome NOX2 oxidase ROS with Cg91ds‐TAT or with genetic deletion of NOX2 decreases viral load in the lung,

 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> we hypothesize that ROS 
 <italic>per se</italic> do not directly cause oxidative damage to the virus to prevent it from escaping the endosome. In contrast, it suggests that influenza virus actually utilize NOX2‐derived ROS to promote their replication and survival. Indeed, we and others have shown that viruses hijack the endocytic compartment to drive a TLR7‐dependent NOX2 oxidase‐dependent ROS process that suppresses Type I IFN responses, which is one of the most important antiviral mechanisms that enable the immune system to clear a viral infection.
