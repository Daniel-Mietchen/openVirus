<p>ROS modulate a myriad of signalling networks in inflammatory cells such as macrophages to influence and shape the immune response to viruses such as influenza. We previously showed that endosomally generated ROS, most likely hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) by NOX2 oxidase, is a powerful negative regulator of Type I IFN production that was triggered by IAV as well as by activation of the TLR7 with imiquimod in isolated macrophages and in lung tissue in vivo.
 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> This suppressive effect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on TLR7‐dependent IFN production was abrogated when the highly conserved and unique cysteine 98 (C98) of TLR7 was mutated to alanine, suggesting that the molecular target of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> produced within the endosome is C98. Importantly and consistent with the spatial restrictions of ROS, C98 on TLR7 resides within the endosomal luminal side of the receptor and thus would be in the immediate vicinity of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Therefore, we suggest that inhibition of NOX2 oxidase by Cgp91ds‐TAT results in a larger Type I IFN production to IAV infection, leading to a stronger antiviral response against the virus to thereby reduce lung inflammation. Our findings are consistent with previous work that shows strong evidence for a reciprocal regulation of NOX2 and Type I IFN in humans and mice. In fact, an enhanced Type I IFN response signature that was accompanied by elevated autoantibody levels was identified in both mice and humans lacking functional NOX2 complex.
