<p>Influenza epidemics and pandemics result in significant global morbidity and mortality, and represent a major burden to healthcare systems. The current approaches to limit the pathogenesis associated with influenza virus infections are vaccines and antiviral drugs. Despite vaccines being relatively efficacious in containing the spread of influenza viruses in some years, the demand for mass production of vaccines in a timely manner and inaccuracies in predicting the antigenicity of seasonal circulating strains does reduce the effectiveness of the vaccination approach. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been used to interfere with newly formed virions to prevent the spread of the virus to neighbouring cells.

 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> This highlights the unmet need for the development of novel therapeutics that can be used against viruses irrespective of the strain and pathogenicity, and therefore be used to combat newly emerging strains of virus. This can potentially be achieved by targeting the over‚Äêexuberant inflammatory response that the virus evokes in the host, and which it uses to affect optimal replication/spread and causes the significant pathogenesis.
