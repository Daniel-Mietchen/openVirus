<p>Several reports suggest an increase in the incidence of dengue-complicated infections affecting different organ systems, such as gastrointestinal, hepatic, respiratory, cardiac, neurological, and renal [

 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, studies evaluating renal tissues from dengue fatal cases are scarce. Renal involvement in dengue can potentially be related to an increased mortality, possibly due to indirect effects of the host immunity [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, post-mortem studies on the kidney of dengue-infected individuals may provide important information on the disease immunopathology. In the present study, post-mortem investigations were performed in kidney tissues from DENV-4 fatal cases that occurred during dengue epidemics in Brazil, as the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the severe forms of the disease are still a challenge.
