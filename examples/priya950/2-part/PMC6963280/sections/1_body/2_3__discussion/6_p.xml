<p>In three DENV-3 fatal cases, PÃ³voa et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] described the presence of acute tubular necrosis, characterized by desquamation of necrotic cells and loss of the basal membrane, mainly in contorted proximal tubules but also, to a lesser extent, in the distal tubules, with mold formation of cellular debris, similarly to what has been observed in the DENV-4 cases analyzed here, suggesting that renal damage caused by DENV is not serotype-specific.
