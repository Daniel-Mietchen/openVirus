<p>Kidney damage can be induced by viral infection, in which a direct viral cytopathic effect may occur on glomerular and tubular cells. An immune-mediated in situ mechanism triggered by viral antigens in the glomeruli can cause tissue damage and deposition of immunocomplexes and antiviral antibodies, and the expression of inflammatory mediators are released in response to exacerbated inflammation in the intertubular vessels [
