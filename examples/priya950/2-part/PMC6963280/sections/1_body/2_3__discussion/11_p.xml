However, it is known that the present changes observed here cannot be analyzed isolated, as the changes in dengue are dynamic and the virus can be disseminated to all vital organs of the host. However, studies such as the one presented here may be useful as an alert so that the identification of renal injury parameters can be observed in dengue cases and so that proper management is performed.
