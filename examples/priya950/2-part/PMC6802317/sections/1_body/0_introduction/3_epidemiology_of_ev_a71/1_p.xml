<p id="Par23">The first EV-A71 isolate was identified in 1969 in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. During the 1970s, several outbreaks of EV-A71 with HFMD were reported in the USA, Australia, Japan, Hungary, Sweden, France, and Bulgaria [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the 1980s, outbreaks occurred in Asia, Brazil, Netherlands, and USA, but the viral activity reduced after these outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Starting from 1997, a large wave of EV-A71 activity appeared, causing HFMD around the Asia-Pacific region (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The first large HFMD and herpangina outbreak occurred in 1997 and further outbreaks appeared in 2000, 2003, and 2005 in Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In 1998, a large EV-A71 outbreak in Taiwan occurred, and increasing EV-A71 fatal cases were reported in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. HFMD outbreaks were reported in Japan in the years 1984, 1987, 1990, 1997, 2000, and 2003, with the largest outbreak in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Singapore had HFMD outbreaks in 2000, 2006, and 2008, with 2008 being the largest outbreak that Singapore had ever experienced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. China only had sporadic reported cases of EV-A71 before 2004. After 2004, EV-A71 began to spread to the middle and northern regions of China, leading to an outbreak of HFMD in 2008 and in 2012 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Large outbreaks of HFMD caused by EV-A71 were also reported in other countries such as Perth, Australia in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], Vietnam in 2005, 2010–2011, 2012–2013, and 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], Thailand in 2008–2009, 2011, and 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and the Netherlands in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These data suggest that the virus continued to circulate in the Asia-Pacific region, and had gradually spread to other countries.
