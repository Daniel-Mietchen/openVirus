<p id="Par26">Recombination of EV-A71 viruses is another common phenomenon. In poliovirus, high nucleotide sequence identities within a region, mainly seen in P2 and P3, of parental strains are in favor of homologous recombination via a ‘copy-choice’ mechanism, resulting in a possible combination that may favor survival during the natural selection process [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. According to a study done by Woodman 
 <italic>et. al.,</italic> recombination was found to be a replicative process that is RdRp-mediated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Both intra- and inter-typic recombination can be found in EV-A71 viruses. Complete EV-A71 genomes were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed via swapping through the regions of the whole genome in order to analyze recombination events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Recombination events were documented in countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and EV-A71 genotype C4 isolates with genotype C2 and CV-A16/G10-like viruses were evident [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Inter-typic recombination was also seen in EV-A71 genotype C2 which was the major genotype in the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan and Japan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. During the EV-A71 genotype C2 outbreak in 1998, using bootscan analysis the virus sequence showed recombination between EV-A71 genotype C2 and coxsackievirus A8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. From the 2000–2001 outbreak, the predominant EV-A71 genotype was B4, however, recombination analysis by Huang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> showed that the sequence resulted in a recombination of genotypes B3 and B2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For the outbreak in 2004–2005, the predominant C4 showed recombination between genotypes C and B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Within these three outbreaks, both intra- and inter-genic recombination can be seen. Inter- and intra-typic recombinations were observed in China in a 2008 outbreak caused by both EV-A71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Yip 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2010) had observed recombination events at the 2A-2B junction in EV-A71 genotypes B with genotype C, and EV-A71 genotype B with CV-A16 strain G-10 in the 3C region of EV-A71 viruses, while CV-A16 strains were found to possess recombination at the 2A-2B junction between CV-A16 strain G-10 and EV-A71 genotype A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Recombination of enteroviruses were also found in Central China in 2011–2012, where co-circulation of CV-A16 and EV-A71 genotype C4 was observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Woodman 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2019) had developed a cell-based assay in order to observe recombination events of EV-A71 and found that recombination events were highest in C2 genotype followed by C4 then B5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Chen 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2010) had previously reported on recombination breakpoints and recombination frequencies of EV-A71. Recombination breakpoint locations may vary depending on the strain and country, however, the 3D
