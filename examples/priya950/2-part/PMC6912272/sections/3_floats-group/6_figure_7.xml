  <p>A549 cells transiently expressing a ZIKV replicon are protected against cell death by apoptosis. A549 cells were transfected with ZIKV amplicons (Z genomic overlapping fragments) for production of REP BR15 (Z1, 2, 3 and 4) and REP NEG (Z2, 3 and 4) or with pEGFP-N1 (
   <bold>A</bold>). At 48 h after transfection A549 cells were treated with etoposide for 16 h (
   <bold>B</bold>) or UV at 400 mJ (
   <bold>C</bold>). The percentage of A549 cells immunostained with anti-BAX antibody or anti-cleaved CASP 3 was monitored. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukeyâ€™s test (*
