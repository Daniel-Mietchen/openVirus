  <p>Cell death during a Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with BR15
   <sup>MC</sup> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. LDH activity was measured in cell supernatant of mock infected cells, BR15 infected cells and in cells treated with triton X-100 as a positive control of total cell lysis value (grey bar) and was normalized to mock infected cells value (
   <bold>A</bold>), cell viability (MTT assay) (
   <bold>B</bold>) and caspase 3/7 activity (
   <bold>C</bold>) were measured at 24, 48 and 72 h post infection (hpi) and normalized to mock infected cells values. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukeyâ€™s test (*
