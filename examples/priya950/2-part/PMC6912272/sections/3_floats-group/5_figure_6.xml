  <p>ZIKV replicon-expressing cells are protected from apoptosis. HEK-293 cells stably expressing a ZIKV replicon (Rep ZIKV-GFP) are protected from intrinsically and extrinsically mediated apoptosis. HEK-293 cells with Rep ZIKV-GFP were treated with TNFα and CHX for 6 h, or treated with etoposide 10 µM or blasticidin 25 µg/mL
   <sup>−1</sup> for 16 h and analyzed for: caspase 3/7 activity (
   <bold>A</bold>), cell viability (MTT assay) (
   <bold>B</bold>) and released LDH activity (
   <bold>C</bold>). Values represent the mean and standard deviation obtained with three different clones of Rep ZIKV-GFP. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukey’s test (**
