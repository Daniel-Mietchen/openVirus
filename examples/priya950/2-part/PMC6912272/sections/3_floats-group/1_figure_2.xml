  <p>BR15
   <sup>MC</sup> does not cause significant activation of apoptosis until late in infection. A549 cells were infected with BR15
   <sup>MC</sup> at MOI of 1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cells were immunostained for active mitochondrial BAX, cytochrome c (Cyt c), ZIKV E and cleaved caspase 3 (CASP 3), 48 hpi. The white scale bar represents 10 µm. Right panel series show magnified details of selected cells from the ×200 microscopic field (white square). Arrows indicate (a): an infected cell (stained for ZIKV E) and (b): an infected and apoptotic cell (stained for ZIKV E and with mitochondrial localization of BAX or Cytosolic Cyt c or cleaved CASP3. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Percentage of A549 infected cells co-immunolabeled for ZIKV E and for active mitochondrial BAX, among the ZIKV E positive cells were determined at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Percentage of A549 infected cells co-immunolabeled for ZIKV E and for cytosolic Cyt c, among the ZIKV E positive cells were determined at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Percentage of A549 infected cells immunostained with anti-cleaved CASP 3 antibody among the ZIKV E positive cells were followed at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The infectious viral particles were collected from infected cell culture supernatants at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi and titrated. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments.
