  <p>Inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins abrogates the protection mediated by ZIKV. A549 cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI of 1. TNFα and CHX were added 2 h post infection for 6 h with or without ABT-737. A549 cells were immunostained with an anti-BAX antibody (representative images in panels on the right, white scale bar: 10µm) (
   <bold>A</bold>) and caspase 3/7 activity was followed after treatment (
   <bold>B</bold>). A549 cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI of 1 and level of Bcl-2 was followed by western blot 24 h post infection (
   <bold>C</bold>). Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukey’s test (*
