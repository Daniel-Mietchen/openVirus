<p>In this study we examined the time course of cellular death associated with ZIKV infection. We confirm that, in A549 cells infected with the epidemic strain from Asian lineage (BeH819015, BR15
 <sup>MC</sup>), apoptosis is quantitatively moderate and occurs late, after the maximum production of viral progeny. We investigated whether this delay was due to a protective effect of the virus itself. When intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis was induced within 2 h after infection, we could observe a significant decrease in cell death. As this protection was also obtained in cells expressing ZIKV “replicons”, we deduced that viral replication was efficient at inhibiting apoptosis. ABT-737, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, abrogates the protective effects provided by ZIKV. This implies that, with a subversion mechanism that remains to be elucidated, ZIKV is able to maintain an anti-apoptotic status in infected cells while it completes its viral cycle.
