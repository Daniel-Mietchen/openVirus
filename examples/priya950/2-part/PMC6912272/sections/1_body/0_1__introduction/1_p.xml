<p>Zika virus (ZIKV), which is a flavivirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, like Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) or West Nile virus (WNV), has become a major medical problem worldwide. The human disease known as Zika fever is characterized by mild flu-like symptoms including fever, maculopapular rash, headache and sometimes conjunctivitis, arthralgia and myalgia. Symptoms usually subside within a week [

Complications such as microcephaly in newborns or Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in adults were documented during the French Polynesia outbreak in 2013 and in Brazil in 2015 [

The ZIKV particle is composed of a single strand RNA molecule of about 11 kb, inside a nucleocapsid, surrounded by a host-derived membrane that contains two virus encoded proteins (E and M). Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences has identified two main virus lineages, African and Asian [

 <xref rid="B7-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Once ZIKV has entered the human body, it targets many types of cells such as epithelial cells, in order to replicate and produce a viral progeny. The life cycle of ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, leads to the release of its single-strand positive sense genomic RNA in the cell cytoplasm where it is translated into a single polyprotein, which is then cleaved by host and viral proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS; NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [
 <xref rid="B8-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The viral cycle continues with the replication process and the production and maturation of envelope proteins, encapsidation, budding and release of virions by exocytosis.
