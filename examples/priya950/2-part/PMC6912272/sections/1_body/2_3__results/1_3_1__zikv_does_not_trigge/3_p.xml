<p>To rule out that delayed apoptosis in infected cells was not a feature of the epithelial cell line A549 or Vero cells, we verified the respective courses of infection and cell death in other cell models. In the U251MG line of human brain glioblastoma-astrocytoma cells, infection kinetics was accompanied by a complete absence of apoptosis within the first 48 h of infection before the maximum of viral progeny production (

 <sup>MC</sup> viral molecular clone as for the Asian epidemic clinical isolate PF13 occurs late and is relatively moderate compared to the kinetics of induced viral death that can be observed in the case of infection by other arboviruses like alphaviruses (
