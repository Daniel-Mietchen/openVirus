<p>Conversely, if TNFα/CHX was added 2 h post infection, a drastic and significant drop in the percentage of cells engaged in apoptosis was observed. This drop was corroborated by the measure of caspase 3 activity (

It is worth recalling that in this lapse of time, virally induced apoptosis is undetectable and therefore is unlikely to interfere with the quantification of cell death induced by the action of TNFα/CHX. Moreover, in Western blots, detectable levels of the active form of caspase 3 in BR15
 <sup>MC</sup>-infected cells were seen to be reduced by around 75% after treatment with TNFα/CHX (
