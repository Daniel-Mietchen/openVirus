<p>Intrinsically induced apoptosis was stimulated by chemical DNA damage. To do this, we used the genotoxic agent etoposide, a topoisomerase-II inhibitor, which causes chromosome breaks during DNA replication. Overnight treatment with etoposide (16–18 h) resulted in a percentage of cells with a mitochondrial BAX among the remaining adherent cells that was between 7% and 12%, depending on the experiment (

Similar to the induction of cell death by TNFα/CHX, although the effects are slightly more modest, apoptosis produced in A549 cells after 16 h of etoposide treatment was significantly reduced in the case where ZIKV was added 2 h post-infection (
