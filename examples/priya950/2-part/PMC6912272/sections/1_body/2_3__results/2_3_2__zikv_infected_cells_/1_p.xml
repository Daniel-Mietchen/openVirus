<p>Apoptosis can be initiated by extrinsic or intrinsic pathways, the former being mediated by death receptors located on the cell surface, the latter being driven by various cellular stresses such as DNA damage. Activation of apoptosis-initiating caspases 8 or 9 results in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) via oligomerization and insertion of the proapoptotic factors BAX/BAK in the mitochondria of type II cells such as epithelial cells [
