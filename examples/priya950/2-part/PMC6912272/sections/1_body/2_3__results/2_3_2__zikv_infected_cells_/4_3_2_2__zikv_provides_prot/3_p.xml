<p>In order to ensure that the ZIKV mediated repression of apoptosis was conserved between ZIKV strains, we looked at the effect of apoptosis induction with etoposide after infection with the epidemic clinical isolate PF13 (ZIKV-PF13) but also with a molecular clone of historical strain from African lineage, MR766-NIID isolated in Uganda in 1947 (MR766
 <sup>MC</sup>;

Convergent measurements of several parameters that establish the death rate and degree of protection confirm that ZIKV interferes with the achievement of apoptosis in response to a death signal.
