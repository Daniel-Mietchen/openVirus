 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f006">Figure 6</xref>C) demonstrated that ZIKV replicon resulted in a significant reduction in the indicators of cell death. An inhibition of apoptosis was not observed in the case of the cell control, selected for GFP and puromycin resistance (HEK CT) as well as in untransfected HEK-293 cells (data not shown). It can be concluded that resistance to puromycin or the presence of a GFP encoding gene were not responsible for a protective effect.
