<p>Since both epidemic Asian (BR15
 <sup>MC</sup>) and historical African (MR766
 <sup>MC</sup>) strains of ZIKV were found to be able to control apoptosis, we investigated the role of viral replication in the mechanism of apoptosis repression using a previously established MR766 replicon system in HEK-293 cells [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Rep ZIKV-GFP cells have a self-replicating RNA encoding the viral NS proteins from MR766-NIID, a puromycin resistance gene to facilitate selection and GFP as a reporter. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding a GFP reporter gene and puromycin resistance without any viral material was used as a control (HEK CT;

We monitored apoptosis and in particular measured caspase 3/7 activity 6h post addition of TNFα/CHX or 16 h post addition of etoposide or blasticidin. We compared the values related to caspase 3/7 activity in Rep ZIKV-GFP with those obtained with the control cells (HEK CT;
