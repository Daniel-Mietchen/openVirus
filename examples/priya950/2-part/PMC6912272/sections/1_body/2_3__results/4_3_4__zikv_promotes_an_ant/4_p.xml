<p>As we used cycloheximide or blasticidin in our assays, we could therefore assume that the mechanism implemented by ZIKV did not involve a “de novo” synthesis of proteins. Based on these remarks, we formulated the hypothesis that ZIKV might allow stabilization of the Bcl-2 protein over time. We performed a western blot assay to measure Bcl-2 protein level upon ZIKV infection. Upon ZIKV infection, we observed an increase of Bcl-2 at the protein level (
