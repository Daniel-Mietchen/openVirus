<p>These observations suggest that ABT-737 has counteracted the protective effect acquired with the virus. It can legitimately be deduced that the viro-induced protective effect probably depends on the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 family proteins. When Bcl-2/Bcl-XL is inhibited, ZIKV no longer allows a quantitative reduction of apoptosis.</p>
