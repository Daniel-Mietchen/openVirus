<p>Cell lysates were performed in Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer). All subsequent steps of immunoblotting followed previous descriptions [

 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions. Anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were used as secondary antibody (dilution 1:2000). Blots were revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents using an Amersham Imager 680 (GE, Buc, France).
