<p>The production of A549 cells transiently expressing a ZIKV RNA replicon was based on the ISA method and four amplicons overlapping the sequences of BeH819015 isolated in Brazil in 2015 [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (Figure 7A). Cells were electroporated in the presence of the viral amplicons (Z1 to Z4 fragments) using the Gene pulser II apparatus according to supplierâ€™s instructions (Biorad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) and treated within 2 days with apoptotic inducers. Cell controls in these experiments were A549DUALtransfected with a plasmid encoding GFP (pEGFP-N1) and A549 transfected with the same amplicons as above but lacking the first segment (the Z1 amplicon) and named REP NEG (Figure 7A).
