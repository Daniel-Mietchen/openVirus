 <xref rid="B21-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) and HEK 293T (CRL-3216) were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere in MEM medium (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), supplemented with 5% or 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). A549-Dual™ cells (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France, a549d-nfis) designated hereafter as A549 cells were maintained in MEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. A549 cells were maintained in growth medium supplemented with 10 μg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> blasticidin and 100 μg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> zeocin (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France).
