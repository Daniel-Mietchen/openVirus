<p>To detect the ZIKV envelope E protein (ZIKV-E), we used the mouse anti-pan flavivirus envelope E protein mAb 4G2 produced by RD Biotech or the rabbit anti-ZIKV-E-DIII that was kindly provided by Dr. Valerie Choumet (Institut Pasteur). The rabbit anti-BAX (#2772) and anti-active caspase 3 (#9664) antibodies and the mouse anti-cytc 6H2.B4 (#12963) were purchased from Cell Signalling Technology (Ozyme, Saint-Cyr-l’École, France). The mouse anti-BAX clone 2D2 was from Invitrogen (Thermofisher, Les Ulis, France). The anti-mitochondria antibody MTC02-3298 was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 IgG antibodies were from Invitrogen (Thermofisher, Les Ulis, France). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (ab97051) and anti-mouse (ab6789) antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).</p>
