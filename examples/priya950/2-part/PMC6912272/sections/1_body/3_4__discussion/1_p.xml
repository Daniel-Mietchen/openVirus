<p>ZIKV has attracted tremendous attention in the field of medically important flaviviruses, which are responsible of world epidemics that are difficult to control [
 <xref rid="B29-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To date, there is no effective treatment against this emerging pathogen despite significant efforts made to succeed in providing an effective vaccine. The characterization of the interaction modalities between the pathogen and host cells are important in order to better understand the strategies adopted by the virus to be effective in its replication and dispersal of its progeny. Among the responses of infected cells, a high priority must be given to virally induced apoptosis since its completion can significantly interfere with the virusâ€™s multiplication cycle and hinder its spread [
 <xref rid="B30-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, crosstalk between innate immune signaling and cell death pathways and how the viruses are able to manipulate each other are essential for viral clearance or persistence and for the global outcomes of the infection. Many studies support that ZIKV infection induces apoptosis in vivo as well as in vitro [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] However, several of them also assert that ZIKV induced cell death could be delayed [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore wanted to define whether this capacity was specific to the strain of ZIKV responsible for the current epidemic and whether ZIKV was able to interfere with the induction of apoptosis.
