<p>Using a molecular clone of the BeH819015 from the Brazilian 2015 outbreak (BR15
 <sup>MC</sup>) and its comparison to the clinical isolate from the French Polynesian 2013 outbreak (PF13), our work has highlighted that ZIKV strains from the actual epidemic Asian lineage are particularly inclined to delay the onset of apoptosis in infected human epithelial cells (A549) as well as in human brain glioblastomaâ€“astrocytoma cells (U251 MG;

 <sup>MC</sup> was marked by a higher cytotoxicity over the duration of infection, with 10% of infected cells showing signs of entry into apoptosis as early as 24 h, whereas epidemic strains had no signs of mortality before 48 h. However, despite this behavior of MR766
 <sup>MC</sup>, which seems more aggressive, it must be admitted that the mortality rate among infected cells remained limited until 48 h post infection (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01338">Figure S4</xref>). We proposed from these results that both viruses had the ability to interfere with the onset of apoptosis even though faster and more effective viral growth in the early hours of infection for MR766
 <sup>MC</sup> than for BR15
 <sup>MC</sup> had resulted in faster and more cytopathic effects. In both cases, the maximum mortality was only recorded when the virion production had reached its highest titer. This observation suggests a manipulation of apoptosis orchestrated by ZIKV in order to give it enough time to complete its entire production cycle. This phenomenon has already been described for other flaviviruses such as DENV, JEV and WNV as they can delay apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt pathway [
