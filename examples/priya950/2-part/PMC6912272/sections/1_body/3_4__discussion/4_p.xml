<p>This discovery is rather unusual when one considers the literature mainly in favor of pro apoptotic functions for the NS proteins [
 <xref rid="B35-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, studies have also shown that some NS may help ZIKV to evade antiviral immunity and cell death. NS2B in particular was proposed to be responsible for blocking (RIG-I)-like receptors triggered apoptotic cell death [
 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A thorough identification of the viral protein responsible for an inhibitory effect needs to be confirmed and further investigated. While our work suggests a possible role for NS proteins in the control of apoptosis, we cannot rule out the possibility that structural proteins may also act. Anti-apoptotic activities have been previously reported in relation to the capsid [
 <xref rid="B16-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It should be noted that in the construct we used to generate the replicons, the polyprotein produced retains the first 33 amino acids of the capsid. It would be interesting to see if this part of the structural protein, released after the cleavage of the GFP has a role in protection. We could not also exclude a role of the viral RNA by itself. Recent work has also investigated the effects of viral RNAs, as flaviviruses are known to produce multiple small RNAs that may have interference activities in the cell physiology. It was recently described that recent epidemic Asian lineage display more negative-strand replicative intermediates than the historical African strain [
 <xref rid="B37-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This important production could be a key element in the search for which viral determinants are crucial in the control of apoptosis. We also know how important are the viral genomic 3′ UTR regions and the Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) produced, in the implementation of cellular responses to infection [
 <xref rid="B38-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It remains to be discovered which factor associated with the replication process of ZIKV viral RNA is involved in the protection mechanism. What we already know from our study is that this mechanism required the Bcl-2 family protein as ABT-737 abrogates the protection acquired against apoptosis by ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The anti-apoptotic capacity of the pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins is known to depend mainly on their ability to sequester pro-apoptotic proteins by binding their BH3 domains. A decrease in Bcl-2 leads to the disruption of associated pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and will promote apoptosis whereas overexpression of Bcl-2 will inhibit mitochondrial OMP [
 <xref rid="B39-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A control of the stability and degradation of Bcl-2 is therefore a key in the subtle balance that takes place between pro and anti-apoptotic suits to determine the cell’s fate [
 <xref rid="B40-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A previous study showed the importance of Bcl-xL for cells survival, in deficient Bcl-2 cells during ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B41-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but here we could not exclude a role for Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL protein as our model expressed these two anti-apoptotic proteins. Based on the fact that Bcl-2 family protein was involved in ZIKV infection with a Bcl-2 protein level quantitatively maintained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f008">Figure 8</xref>), we formulated the hypothesis that ZIKV might allow a stabilization of the Bcl-2 protein over time and inhibit MOMP formation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f009">Figure 9</xref>). The mechanism by which the virus allows the Bcl-2 stabilization and blocks apoptosis needs further investigation.
