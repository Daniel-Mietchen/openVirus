<p>Poliovirus, belonging to the enterovirus genus, has been eradicated in the US for 40 years. Its sequelae, poliomyelitis, is a syndrome characterized by fever, meningitis, and flaccid paralysis and is a rare entity in the Western world [

West Nile virus (WNV), belonging to the flavivirus genus, has recently been found to be a rare agent of fever, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, all symptoms that were associated with poliomyelitis. Acute neurological disorders due to the aforementioned viruses are important in a clinician’s differential diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis as serological confirmation can aid in early diagnosis and symptomatic management of its sequelae. While central nervous involvement presenting with meningitis and encephalitis is often found with these diseases [
 <xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is important to recognize that a minority of patients can also present without confusion or altered mental status. Management of the disease process is unclear and observation of complications that may arise, such as respiratory failure, is pertinent in the care of these patients. Prognostically, the outcomes are not always favorable for those who present with acute neurological disease. In this study, we discuss the case of a male who presented to the hospital with fever and acute flaccid paralysis with a subsequent brief review on the differential diagnosis of fever and acute flaccid paralysis of a viral origin.
