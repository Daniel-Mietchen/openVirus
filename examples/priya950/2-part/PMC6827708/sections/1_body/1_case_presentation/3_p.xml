<p>Because of the patient’s recent travel history, rash, and fever, he was started on empiric doxycycline therapy for presumed arthropod-related illness. Serology for tick-borne illness and mosquito-borne illness were performed. On the evening of the day of admission, the patient was noticed by the nurse to be retaining urine, without an urge to urinate. He was bladder-scanned for 1,000 cc of urine and was catheterized, eventually relieving 1,100 ml of urine. Overnight, the patient’s fever rose to a maximum of 104.2 F. Because he was unable to sleep, the patient attempted to get out of bed and subsequently suffered a fall. This was described as the result of a sudden loss of strength in his lower extremities. When re-evaluated in the morning, the patient appeared significantly weaker, though he continued to be alert and oriented. In light of the fall, he was immediately evaluated by a neurologist. The patient’s neurological exam revealed him being alert and oriented, upper extremities 5/5 in strength, and lower extremities 2/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left in strength. No sensory deficits were observed. Lower-extremity reflexes were hypoactive bilaterally with negative Babinski sign bilaterally. His strength exam was normal on admission. A lumbar puncture was immediately performed, and the patient was subsequently taken for an MRI of his thoracic and lumbar spine.</p>
