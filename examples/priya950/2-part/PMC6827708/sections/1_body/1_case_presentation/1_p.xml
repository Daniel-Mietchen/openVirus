<p>A 49-year-old male from Pennsylvania presented with complaints of fever and lethargy. One week prior to the presentation, he and his spouse had been traveling in the Pocono Mountains. A day into his travel, he had started to experience increased fatigue and a rise in temperature. This episode had seemingly self-resolved over the course of the day, and the patient had been back to normal the next day. However, he had continued to have intermittent symptoms of lethargy, fevers, and night sweats and had undergone a whole-day episode of loose stools even after his return from the mountains. Because of dysuria and urinary frequency, he had been seen at an urgent-care facility with an unremarkable urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Subsequently, he had started to develop a fine petechial rash, most noticeable on his chest and upper extremities. He continued to be febrile with increasing body aches, episodes of emesis, and inability to tolerate oral intake. For these symptoms, he presented to the emergency department (ED) for continued care. </p>
