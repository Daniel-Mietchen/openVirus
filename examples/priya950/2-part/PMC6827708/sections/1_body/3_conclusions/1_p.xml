<p>Though poliovirus is an entity thought to have been eradicated in the US, mimicry of poliomyelitis symptoms can still rarely occur from other viral illnesses. We presented a case of West Nile myelitis presenting with symptoms similar to poliomyelitis. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing such a motor-neuron disease from the vast spectrum of neurological diseases, and the need to have high clinical suspicion when presented with a case of fever with acute neurological signs or symptoms. Patients from regions with high mosquito burden would also have an increased risk as well. Recognition of these cases and their link to viral illnesses may decrease inappropriate diagnostic imaging and/or treatment. This case demonstrates the need for doctors to have clinical suspicion for WNV in patients presenting with fever and acute flaccid paralysis even without symptoms of encephalitis. </p>
