<p>In this case, the patient's physical therapy evaluations demonstrated significant improvement throughout his hospitalization. On the fourth day of admission, the patient had partial loss of balance and was only able to move from bed to chair with a rolling walker. The patient required moderate assistance, with at least 1-2 people needing to help him to move around. On the seventh day, the patient was able to walk 75 feet, with only one person assisting him. He continued to have very slow, but steady progress during his stay with the aid of our rehabilitation team.</p>
