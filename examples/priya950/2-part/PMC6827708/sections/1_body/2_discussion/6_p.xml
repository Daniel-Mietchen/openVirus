<p>The prognosis of neurological manifestations associated with WNV infections depends primarily on the type and location of the initial lesion. It is also dependent on the severity of the illness, including encephalitis, meningitis, or myelitis. It has been shown that patients with encephalitis and meningoencephalitis demonstrate at least a 95% recovery within a year after the onset of the disease. Importantly, no statistical difference has been observed between groups [
 <xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, upon discharge from the hospital, only one-third of patients suffering from encephalitis alone is reported to be fully functional. Notably, patients with meningitis alone have been shown to have a more favorable short-term prognosis [
 <xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, WNV-associated myelitis has been repeatedly demonstrated to have a poor functional recovery potential. In fact, most patients never fully recover. It has been suggested that only one-third of the patients experience near-complete recovery. The remaining two-thirds either have partial recovery or do not regain motor function at all. Interestingly, mental function, if impaired, is usually fully restored in patients with myelitis [
 <xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The degree of motor-neuron loss, absent motor responses, and absence of voluntary EMG activity are the factors known to be associated with poor prognosis [
 <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite relatively poor prognosis in patients with myelitis, the availability of the resources aimed at improving motor recovery in patients with WNV infection (physical therapy, occupation therapy) is crucial in providing care to affected individuals. Because of these outcomes, this case demonstrates the need to have clinical suspicion for WNV in patients presenting with fevers and acute flaccid paralysis, even without any symptoms of encephalitis.
