<p>Poliovirus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus within the enterovirus genus. This virus was responsible for the poliomyelitis epidemic in the 1800s and 1900s. It is a virus transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Poliomyelitis, known in the literature as “polio”, is a disease characterized by fever, meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Paralysis is the most feared complication of the triad and is seen in about 0.1-0.5% of infections [
