<p>Schmallenberg virus, a newly emerged arbovirus, was first reported in Central and Northwestern Europe in the fall of 2011. The initial source of introduction has not been identified to date. In addition, the mechanism by which the virus is maintained during the winter period when the vector population is low or absent remains unknown. Therefore, future studies should address the possibility of SBV introduction/re-introduction through infected midges imported from tropical or endemic regions where serological, molecular and vector prevalence of SBV has been reported. It is equally important to examine whether persistently infected, clinically healthy offspring born to infected domestic and wild ruminants exist and act as a constant source of SBV infection. Additional investigations of the competence of other arthropod vectors in the transmission of SBV, as well as for other viruses of the Simbu serogroup, are needed. Furthermore, studies on the cross-reactivity of current diagnostic tests and cross-protection between viruses from the Simbu serogroup need to be conducted. The major lesson learned from the emergence of SBV, is that maintaining vigilance and expertise is of great importance to be able to respond rapidly to new threats to animal and public health.</p>
