<p>Infections of Schmallenberg virus in naïve populations spread quickly but result in solid protective immunity. This was evident when, within a two-month period, many cattle herds in Germany became infected [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Studies indicate that in the majority of SBV-infected cattle and sheep, anti-SBV antibodies last for at least 38 and 48 months, respectively [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent report indicates that among 17 naturally infected cattle studied over a period of 6 years, three animals became seronegative, while the other 14 animals still had measurable anti-SBV antibodies after six years [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Most calves and lambs born to SBV-infected cows or ewes were shown to be protected from SBV infection for at least the first six and four months, respectively [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Under experimental conditions, anti-SBV antibodies are detected between 14 and 21 days post-infection in cows and sheep [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes seems insignificant during SBV infection as these cells are not detected after initial infection, implying that virus clearance is most likely independent of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, CD8+ T-cells may be involved in the protective immune response against the virus during secondary exposures. In addition, between 3–7 days post-infection, the number of CD4+ T helper cells decrease and SBV genomic markers are not detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes [
