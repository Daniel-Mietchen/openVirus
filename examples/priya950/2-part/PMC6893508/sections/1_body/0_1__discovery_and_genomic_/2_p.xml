<p>The newly discovered SBV has sequence similarities to other viruses in the 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, such as Akabane, Aino and Shamonda. Further sequence analysis also revealed high similarities with Sathuperi, and Douglas viruses [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SBV is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with three genomic segments: L (large), M (medium) and S (small) segments (

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is encoded by the L segment, whereas the M segment encodes a polyprotein that is further cleaved into the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc and the non-structural protein NSm (

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Like other viruses in the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, the NSs of SBV has been shown to be a major virulence factor that downregulates host-cell mRNA synthesis and type I interferon production in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing viral replication [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SBV is transmitted by culicoides midges [
