<p>The original source of SBV is still unclear; however, there are reports of SBV cross-reactive antibodies to other Simbu serogroup viruses found in African cattle, prior to and after the initial European outbreak [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A report from Jordan in 2013 indicated detection of antibodies against Aino virus, another Simbu serogroup virus, in ruminants on farms where similar clinical symptoms associated with SBV infections were observed [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Turkey reported detecting SBV RNA in aborted cattle and sheep fetuses a year after the initial outbreak in Europe, suggesting a spread of the virus from Northern Europe [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since the SBV ELISA has low specificity, the possibility of potentially detecting cross-reactive antibodies induced by other Simbu serogroup viruses cannot be ruled out. Remarkably, there have been multiple reports of fetal malformation in ruminants from the Mediterranean region, suggesting a possible circulation of Simbu serogroup viruses in this region [
