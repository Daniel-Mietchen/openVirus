<p>Multiple domestic and wild animal species have been shown to be susceptible to SBV infection under natural and experimental conditions. This was determined through direct and/or indirect detection of SBV in animals with clinical manifestations or subclinical infections [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Importantly, overt clinical manifestations of SBV infection have been seen exclusively in domestic ruminants [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas only indirect serological evidence of SBV infection has been reported for wild ruminants (e.g., alpaca, buffalo, deer, chamois, mouflon, bison), zoo animals (e.g., kudu, zebra, oryx), and some other mammalian species (e.g., horse, wild boar) [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, virological and serological evidence of SBV infection has been also reported in dogs [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Experimental infection of piglets with SBV resulted only in seroconversion, and no RT-PCR positivity was detected, suggesting the inability of the virus to efficiently replicate in this host species [
