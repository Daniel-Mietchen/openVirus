<p>Insect vectors such as mosquitoes and biting flies (
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp.) are often responsible for the transmission of bunyaviruses associated with human and animal diseases in Asia and Africa. Immediately after the discovery of SBV, it became evident that 
 <italic>Culicoides spp</italic>. play a role in its transmission [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. SBV genomic sequences were detected in biting flies, namely the 
 <italic>Culicoides obsoletus</italic> species group of the 
 <italic>Ceratopogonidae</italic> family, and it was shown that multiple 
 <italic>Culicoides spp.</italic> (
 <italic>Culicoides dewulfi</italic>, 
 <italic>Culicoides chiopterus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culicoides punctatus</italic>, etc) were positive for SBV genomic markers. Culicoides caught as early as summer and autumn of 2011 in Belgium [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Italy [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], The Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and Denmark [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were found positive for SBV genomic markers. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Culicoides sonorensis,</italic> a vector for BTV, was also shown to support the replication and dissemination of SBV under laboratory conditions [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The question of how the vector-borne SBV persists over winter has not been solved yet; however, one field study has demonstrated that the potential mechanism is transovarial transmission in the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vector [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
