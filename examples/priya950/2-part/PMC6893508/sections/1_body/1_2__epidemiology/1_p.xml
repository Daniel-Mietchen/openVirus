<p>Various virulent arboviruses, such as West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and Bluetongue virus (BTV), have emerged and caused epidemics in humans and/or animals in North and South America, the Arabian Peninsula or Europe. Their emergence has been partially attributed to the phenomenon of climate change [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the fall of 2011, Schmallenberg virus appeared in Northern Europe, where also BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) first appeared in 2006 [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Schmallenberg virus infection manifested itself as congenital defects in newborn calves, lambs and kids, as well as an arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly syndrome [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SBV quickly spread to the rest of the continent, with wind playing an important role in the transmission of the virus, as infected midges are easily carried on air currents [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The rate of spread of SBV is estimated to be in the range of 0.9 to 1.5 km/day [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite a high seroprevalence of up to 98% reported in outbreak regions in 2011 and 2012 [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], new infections occurred again in the summer of 2012 in the same regions. Both serological and genome detection methods revealed the re-emergence of SBV infection in Belgium in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It became evident that the cold winter season could not eradicate the virus since new cases were also observed in ruminants in Germany in June 2012 [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In late 2014, SBV outbreaks in cattle and sheep were once again detected in The Netherlands; and in 2016, an increase in SBV-specific antibody titers and prevalence in heifers was noted in The Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, the detection of SBV genomic sequences in aborted calves in Belgium in 2015 was a further indication of SBV circulation in the area at the time [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although there were several years of limited to no circulation of the virus in the UK and France, outbreaks of the disease occurred again in 2016 and 2017 [
