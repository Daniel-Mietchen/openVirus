<p>Infection of adult ruminants with SBV usually results in non-specific clinical signs. In cattle, SBV infection often manifests as a mild and transient disease, with anorexia, hyperthermia, and in some animals with diarrhea and reduced milk yield (up to 50%) [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, SBV infection in adult sheep and goats is mostly subclinical. Acute clinical cases of SBV are not common, but there are a few reports of clinical disease in adult animals (6% cattle, 3% sheep and 1% goats) [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Clinical signs of diarrhea and reduced milk yield have been reported at least once in goats [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Even though the causal relationship has not been clearly established, there have been reports of fever, diarrhea and reduced milk yield in sheep [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Under experimental conditions, in sheep and cattle, SBV infection exhibits a short viremic period of 5â€“7 days, which starts at day 2 or 3 post infection (pi) and peaks around day 4 pi [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A relationship between herd immunity and the birth of congenitally malformed newborns has been observed during SBV infection. A decline in herd immunity is followed by an increase in seroprevalence against SBV [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Common musculoskeletal deformities observed in fetuses during transplacental infection include arthrogryposis, lordosis, scoliosis, torticollis and brachygnathia inferior [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Sacral spina bifida and cleft palate are also observed in stillborn lambs. Meanwhile, musculoskeletal defects are not uniform in the case of twin gestation, in which case, one twin may present malformations, whereas the other is born healthy without any malformation or clinical signs [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A recent study revealed that experimental 
 <italic>in utero</italic> infection of bovine fetuses resulted in a very low incidence rate of fetal abortion/malformation; only one abortion and one malformed fetus out of 36 experimentally 
 <italic>in utero</italic> SBV-infected pregnant heifers were reported when the animals were infected between 60 and 150 days of gestation (first and second trimester) [
