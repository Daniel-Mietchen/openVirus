<p>Surveillance of the dynamics of competent vectors and vector infection rates seems to be the optimal strategy for predicting future SBV outbreaks. Furthermore, vaccination of replacement stocks and control of insect populations are the two most important methods for the prevention of SBV outbreaks [

Farmers in some countries, however, are unwilling to vaccinate their animals against SBV, claiming vector surveillance to be a more effective prevention strategy than vaccination. The re-emergence of SBV in Germany and The Netherlands in late 2014, and more recently in Belgium, France and the UK, is an indication that SBV is able to infect and disseminate in cattle and sheep flocks in the face of declining immunity [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. SBV re-emerging events should be a reminder for farmers to regularly implement SBV vaccination of their animals.
