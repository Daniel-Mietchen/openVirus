<p id="Par14">Next we compared the ability of two recent Asian lineage ZIKV isolates, the fetal brain isolate GWUH and HPF, a virus isolated from the serum specimen of an adult patient (ZIKV-H-PF-2013), to replicate and induce cytokine responses in human DCs and macrophages. Cells were infected at MOI of 2 for different time periods followed by isolation of total cellular RNA and qRT-PCR analysis to quantitate ZIKV RNA expression. Due to a considerable variability between the cells of different blood donors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>)

 </sup>, virus-infected cells of different donors were pooled for RNA analysis in order to get a more global and general view of the infection kinetics. In DCs, both Asian Zika virus strains appeared to replicate with a similar efficacy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). In ZIKV-infected macrophages, the expression of viral RNA was increased to some extent, but the levels remained much lower (one log) compared to viral RNA levels seen in DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). The data clearly shows that, albeit both ZIKV strains are able to infect both human DCs and macrophages, virus replication is better in DCs.
