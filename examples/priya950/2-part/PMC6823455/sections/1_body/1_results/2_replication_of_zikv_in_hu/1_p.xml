<p id="Par8">As human DCs and macrophages were found to be rather weakly permissive to ZIKV infection even with an extremely high doses of viruses, we systematically evaluated the replication efficiency of the Asian lineage fetal brain isolate GWUH strain and the low passage African lineage strain #976 in these cell types. At high MOI values of 75 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell, viral RNA and protein expression readily increased with peak values seen at 24–48 h p.i. in DCs and at 48–72 h p.i. in macrophages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,B</xref>). The Asian lineage GWUH Zika virus replicated better in DCs compared to that in macrophages, and strong viral protein expression was seen in infected DCs. Western blot analysis showed that the #976 virus replicated to some extent both in DCs and macrophages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Altogether, by comparing the ZIKV strains from African and Asian lineages, the data indicates that different ZIKV strains show clear differences in their replication and viral RNA and protein expression patterns in primary human leukocytes.
