<p id="Par12">Since both the Asian and African lineage Zika viruses induced cytokine gene expression in human DCs and also weakly in macrophages, we analyzed the level of phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT2 in response to ZIKV infection. In addition, the expression of IRF3, STAT2 and antiviral MxA proteins were also analysed. In Asian lineage GWUH virus-infected DCs, we could only detect a very weak signal corresponding to the phosphorylated form of IRF3 (P-IRF3), while in influenza A virus-infected cells (a positive control) P-IRF3 was readily detectable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Starting at 24 h after infection, we observed the appearance of phospho-STAT2 (P-STAT2) and an enhanced expression of STAT2, MxA and ZIKV NS5 proteins. In DCs the African #976 ZIKV strain was also able to induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 (P-STAT2) but no P-IRF3 was detectable. The expression of STAT2, MxA and ZIKV NS5 protein was enhanced starting at 24 h after infection with the #976 virus. As a whole, the observation is indicative of efficient type I and type III IFN secretion (IFN-α/β and IFN-λs, respectively), which are known to activate and phosphorylate STAT2 and enhance the expression of STAT2 and MxA, which are well-known IFN-inducible genes
