<p id="Par11">We also determined the amounts of secreted IFN-λ1 and IFN-α from virus-infected cells by cytokine-specific EIAs. GWUH induced clearly higher levels of secreted type I and type III IFNs in DCs as compared to those seen by the #976 virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). ZIKV-infected macrophages produced extremely low levels of IFNs into cell culture supernatants and they were found only in late time points of infection (data not shown). Altogether, the secreted levels of IFNs were in good agreement with Zika virus replication and virus-induced cytokine mRNA levels in different types of cells (Figs

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
