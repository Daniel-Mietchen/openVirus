 </sup>. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were fractionated by Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech) gradient centrifugation. For macrophage cultures, monocytes from the PBMC fraction were allowed to adhere onto cell culture plates and macrophages were differentiated by culturing the cells for 7 days in macrophage serum-free substitution medium (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.6 µg/ml penicillin and 60 µg/ml streptomycin in the presence of 10 ng/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Gibco Invitrogen). For DCs, PBMC fraction was subjected to an additional centrifugation on a Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and lymphocyte depletion with anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 magnetic beads (Dynal). DCs were differentiated by culturing monocytes in RPMI medium (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 0.6 µg/ml penicillin, 60 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 20 mM HEPES in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma Aldrich), 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (Gibco Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (GenScript) for 1 week. In all experiments cells from 4 different blood donors were used separately for virus infection and all experiments were repeated several times as indicated in figure legends.
