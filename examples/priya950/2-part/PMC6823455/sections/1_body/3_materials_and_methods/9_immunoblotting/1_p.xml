 </sup> and antibodies against ZIKV NS5 were prepared as described above. The staining was done in blocking buffer at RT for 1 h. Antibodies against phosphorylated IRF3 (P-IRF3, #4947), STAT2 (#72604), P-STAT2 (#88410) and GAPDH (#2118) were from Cell Signaling Technology, for β-Actin (SC-10731) from SantaCruz Biotechnology, and the stainings were done in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 5% BSA at +4 °C overnight. HRP-conjugated antibodies (Dako) were used in the secondary staining at RT for 1 h. Protein bands were visualized on HyperMax films using an ECL plus system (GE Healthcare).
