<p id="Par4">Innate immunity plays an important role in the early phases of microbial infections including viral infections. The key cell types regulating innate immunity include dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These cells reside in tissues where they are on alert for invading pathogens. DCs take up microbes, microbial components or they are infected by viruses, which leads to the activation of the cells, increased cytokine production and migration of activated DCs into the local lymph nodes where they present microbial antigens to T cells

 </sup>. DCs thus operate as an important cell type regulating both innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophages, instead, reside in tissues where they act mainly locally by taking up and destroying microbes as well as by secreting inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators
