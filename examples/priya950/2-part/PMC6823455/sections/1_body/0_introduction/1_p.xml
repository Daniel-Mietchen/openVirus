<p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, which is a large group of viruses including e.g. Dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis and many other important human pathogenic viruses. In most individuals ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease with fever, rash, arthritis, conjunctivitis, malaise and headache with perhaps 80% of infected individuals suffering from a very mild or a subclinical infection

 </sup>. Indeed, it was observed that maternal ZIKV infection can spread to the fetal brains causing the death of developing neurons, brain calcification and cortical displacement leading to reduced brain volume and development of microcephaly

 </sup>. Due to the rapid spread of ZIKV infections in the Americas and accumulating data on severe birth defects in children whose mothers had suffered a ZIKV infection during pregnancy, WHO declared ZIKV infection as a global health alert during the epidemic in 2015–2016
