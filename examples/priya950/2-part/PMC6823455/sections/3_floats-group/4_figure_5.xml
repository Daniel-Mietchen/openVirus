  <p>Expression of signaling molecules and antiviral proteins in ZIKV-infected human DCs and macrophages. Human primary (
   <bold>A</bold>) DCs and (
   <bold>B</bold>) macrophages were infected with GWUH or #976 ZIKV strains at a MOI of 75 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell and the cells from four individual blood donors were collected at different time points after infection, pooled and cellular protein samples were prepared for immunoblotting. Uninfected mock samples were used as negative control and influenza A virus-infected cells (MOI 1, 24 h infection) as positive control samples. The expression levels of phospho-IRF3 (P-IRF3), IRF3, phospho-STAT2 (P-STAT2), STAT2 and antiviral MxA proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. The expression of ZIKV NS5 protein was analyzed for visualizing the virus replication with ZIKV-infected DCs and macrophages. ZIKV infected (GWUH) Vero E6 cell lysate functioned as a positive control, and GAPDH and β-Actin were stained as loading controls. The data shown is a representative experiment out of two independent experiments (altogether n = 8).
