  <p>Differential induction of cytokine mRNA expression in human DCs and macrophages infected with Asian and African lineage ZIKV strains. Human monocyte-derived DCs or macrophages obtained from four different blood donors were separately infected with a fetal brain-isolated GWUH strain (Asian lineage) or with an African lineage #976 ZIKV strain at MOI of 75 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell. The cells were collected at different times after infection and total cellular RNA was isolated. The expression of IFN-λ1, IFN-β, CXCL10 and MxA mRNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels are presented as fold induction compared to the mock sample. The data (means +/− SEM) shown is a representative experiment out of two independent experiments.
