  <p>ZIKV is highly sensitive to the antiviral activity of type I IFNs. Monocyte-derived human (
   <bold>A</bold>) DCs or (
   <bold>B</bold>) macrophages from 4 individual blood donors were primed with different doses of IFN-β (0, 10 or 100 IU/ml) for 16 h followed by infection with the ZIKV GWUH strain (MOI 2). Cells were collected at different time points after infection and samples from different donors were pooled for isolation of total cellular RNA. Virus replication was analyzed by quantitating viral RNA by qRT-PCR. The results are presented as relative expression over the mock sample without cytokine stimulation or virus infection. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type mouse (IFNAR1 wt) and from IFN-α receptor chain 1 knock-out (
   <italic>Ifnar-1</italic>−/−; IFNAR1 KO) mouse were infected with GWUH or HPF strains of ZIKV at MOI of 2 and cells were harvested at different time points after infection followed by isolation of total cellular RNA. Viral RNA expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR, and results are shown as relative expression over the uninfected sample.
