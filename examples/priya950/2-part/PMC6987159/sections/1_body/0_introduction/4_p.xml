<p id="Par5">Much less is known on the putative infection of primary lymphoid organs, and more particularly in the thymus. This central lymphoid organ is responsible for the generation of T lymphocytes under the control of the thymic microenvironment, a three-dimensional cellular network mainly composed by thymic epithelial cells â€“ TEC

 </sup>. In this respect, it is interesting to note the thymus as a target organ for other RNA viruses, such as HIV

 </sup>. In fact, we showed that cultured human TEC can be infected by HTLV-1 and convey virus particles to lymphoblastic T cells

 </sup>. We thus hypothesized that the thymic epithelium might also be infected by the Zika virus. Herein we provide compelling evidence that ZIKV targets human TEC both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Data are provided showing that ZIKV-infection enhances keratinization of TEC, with a decrease in proliferation and increase in cell death. Moreover, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data revealed that the virus could modulate a high amount of coding and non-coding genes (including miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs), with upregulation of genes encoding various cell adhesion and cell migration-related proteins. Accordingly, infected TEC enhanced adhesion of lymphoblastic lymphoma-derived T cells and conveyed the virus to this same cell type. Lastly, alterations in the thymic microenvironment from babies prenatally infected by ZIKV were observed, as well as the presence of the viral envelope protein in the thymus. Taken together, our data reveal that the thymus is a target for the ZIKV and may function as a reservoir of the virus during congenital infection.
