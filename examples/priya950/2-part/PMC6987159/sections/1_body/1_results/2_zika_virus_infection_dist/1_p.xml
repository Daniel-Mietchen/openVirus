<p id="Par10">Considering that human TEC were sensitive to ZIKV infection, we wondered whether such an infection could also modulate the growth of these cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The TEC counting in infected versus uninfected cultures showed that ZIKV infection induced a progressive reduction in the numbers of growing TEC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Experiments aiming at defining whether such a diminution was due to a decrease in cell proliferation or increase in cell death, revealed a diminution in the proportion of dividing cells (defined by the high expression of the Ki67 marker) and an increase in the relative numbers of apoptotic (but not necrotic) cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>), as ascertained by PI and annexin-V double labeling. Differences in the proportion of apoptotic and dividing cells begin to appear 48 hours post-infection, although significant differences are only detected 72 hours post-infection. Of note, in addition to the small, but significant increase in the relative numbers of apoptotic cells, we observed increased amounts of cellular debris in ZIKV-infected TEC cultures when compared to controls (data not shown). It is interesting to note that such modulation of cell growth was not seen when we infected the same human TEC line by HTLV-1 neither in cell proliferation nor cell death
