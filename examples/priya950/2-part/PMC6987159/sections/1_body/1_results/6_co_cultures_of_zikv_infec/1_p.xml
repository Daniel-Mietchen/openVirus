<p id="Par21">Considering that the expression of cell adhesion related-genes was enhanced in ZIKV-infected TEC, and the fact that ICAM-1 as well as VCAM are adhesion molecules known to play a role in TEC thymocyte interaction

 </sup>, we investigated whether these proteins were upregulated in the membrane of ZIKV-infected TEC. We found enhanced numbers of TEC expressing ICAM-1 (CD54 – data not shown), as well as enhanced ICAM-1 in infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This was more clear-cut when we analyzed the cells expressing high amounts of ICAM-1 (5.2% (±1.2) of ZIKV infected cells and 2.6% (±0.5) for controls (p = 0.05). As regards the expression of VCAM-1 (CD106), we did find higher membrane expression levels in infected cultures, although the differences were not statistically significant (p-value = 0.1).
