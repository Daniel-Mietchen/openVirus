<p id="Par22">We searched for a functional change on the ability of infected TEC to bind to lymphoblastic T cells. For that, the CEM acute T-cell leukemia cell line, previously known to adhere to human TEC

 </sup>, was led to adhere to growing TEC 72 hours post-infection. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> shows that adhesion was significantly increased onto ZIKV-infected TEC cultures, as compared to controls. Importantly, we showed that 72 hours after TEC infection plus 24 hours of co-culture with CEM, a proportion (10.76% ± 1.98) of the T lymphoblasts were infected as revealed by immunolabeling with the 4G2 antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). At this time point (96 hours post-infection), 86% of the TEC present in the co-culture were infected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Interestingly enough, we could not directly infect CEM cells with ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) or with Zika virus-infected TEC supernatant (data not shown).
