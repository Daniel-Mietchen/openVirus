<p id="Par14">We also found upregulated genes that integrate extracellular matrix organization, interferon signaling, interleukin signaling, and integrin cell surface interaction, including ITGAM, VCAM1, ICAM1 in Reactome enrichment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The transcriptome results were coherent with the cell growth assay that results in progressive reduction in the numbers of growing TEC, reduced cell proliferation and cell division, with a slight increase of apoptosis after ZIKV infection (Supplemental Table
