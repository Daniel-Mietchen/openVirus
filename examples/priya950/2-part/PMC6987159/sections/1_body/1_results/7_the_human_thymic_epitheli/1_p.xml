<p id="Par23">We also studied sections of six thymuses from children that died in postnatal life born from mothers infected by ZIKV during pregnancy. The histological profile of these specimens varied from virtually normal cortico-medullary pattern to a severe disruption of the cortex in one thymus, with clear-cut decrease in thymocytes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Yet, in all cases, we observed an increase in the numbers of the Hassall’s corpuscles, indicating an over differentiation of the TEC network. This feature was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin detection (applied herein as a pan-marker of the whole TEC network) in TEC cultures, as seen in Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. In fact, cytokeratin immunostaining revealed, in some thymus samples, a complete loss of the cortical/medullary distinction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, case 2).
