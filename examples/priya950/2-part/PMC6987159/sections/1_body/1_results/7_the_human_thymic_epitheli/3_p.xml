<p id="Par25">We also searched for the presence of the viral envelope protein in the same thymuses, using the 4G2 antibody, which recognizes any Flavivirus family envelope protein. As compared to normal thymuses (that were completely negative for 4G2 labeling), we did find specific immunostaining in thymus sections from 5 out of 6 thymuses evaluated. The presence of the envelope viral protein was seen in scattered TEC, both in the cortex and medulla of the thymic lobules, as well as in Hassall’s corpuscles (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), although we were not able to detect the viral envelope protein in this case (case 4 – Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). None of the thymus preparations were positive for the presence of Dengue as well as Chikungunya viruses (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Secondary antibodies were used as negative controls and did not generate any significant labeling (Supplemental Fig.
