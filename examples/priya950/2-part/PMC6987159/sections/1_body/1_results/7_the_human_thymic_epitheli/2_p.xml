<p id="Par24">Considering the transcriptome data, we also performed histological evaluations for ECM-containing fibers and fibrils. In the thymuses from ZIKV-infected newborns, there was an important increase in the reticulin network, indicating thickness of basement membranes in the thymic microenvironment. Additionally, Masson’s trichrome staining revealed a higher density of type I collagen-containing fibers in the thymic
