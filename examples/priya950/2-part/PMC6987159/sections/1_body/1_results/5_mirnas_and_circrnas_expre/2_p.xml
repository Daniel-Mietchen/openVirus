<p id="Par18">The microRNA-target network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,c</xref>) revealed 13 upregulated microRNAs that can modulate the expression of 12 downregulated target transcripts, including the hsa-miR-3065-5p regulating HIST2H2BE and MYB, hsa-miR-155-5p regulating MYB and E2F2, hsa-miR-449a-5p regulating HIST1H4H and hsa-miR-215-5p regulating CDCA4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This analysis also showed 20 downregulated microRNAs, which target upregulated genes involved with immune system, viral response and extracellular matrix, as shown in hsa-miR-4458-5p that regulates the IL-6, CXCL8, C2, COL3A1, COL5A2, ITGB8, TNFSF9 genes, hsa-miR19b-5p targeting ITGB8 and CXCL8, hsa-miR-100-3p targeting CXCL8 and hsa-miR-222-5p regulating HLA-B and DDX58 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).
