<p id="Par19">The transcriptome analysis also revealed 562 upregulated and 91 downregulated circRNAs in ZIKV-infected TEC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In order to identify the possible role of microRNA sponge by circRNAs, we conducted a microRNA target prediction with miRanda tool, using the circRNAs as targets. This strategy revealed the upregulated hsa-miR-542-3p targeting 3 circRNAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and the downregulated hsa-miR-92a-1-5p, possibly regulated by 12 circRNAs (Fig.
