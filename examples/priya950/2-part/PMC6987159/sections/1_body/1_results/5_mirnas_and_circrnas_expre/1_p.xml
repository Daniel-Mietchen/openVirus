<p id="Par17">Small RNA-seq analysis revealed 67 miRNAs differentially expressed in ZIKV-infected TEC, resulting in 42 upregulated and 25 downregulated microRNAs (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The hsa-miR-7-3-3p was the most upregulated miRNA (log2 FC = 5.16) after ZIKV infection. The majority of miRNAs presented a slightly upregulation or downregulation with log2 FC &gt; |1| including hsa-miR-155-5p (1.55) and hsa-miR-203a-3p (1.19).
