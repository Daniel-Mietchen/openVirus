<p id="Par20">Taken together, the transcriptome and small RNA-seq analyses revealed complex molecular responses of TEC in response to ZIKV infection, showing an intricate regulatory network, including different layers of transcription regulation. In this context, ICAM-1 and VCAM appeared as a main hub connecting distinct clusters of genes whose expression was altered secondary to ZIKV infection.</p>
