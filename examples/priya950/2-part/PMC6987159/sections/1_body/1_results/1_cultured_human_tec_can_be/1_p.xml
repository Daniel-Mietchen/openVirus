<p id="Par6">We first investigated the infectivity and growth capacity in ZIKV-infected human TEC, evaluating the virus yield in cell monolayers. The human postnatal TEC line used was obtained by explant technique and limiting dilution cloning, being derived from fragments of a postnatal thymus from a child undergoing cardiac surgery

 </sup>. Functionally these cells are able to produce cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins, and can adhere to freshly-isolated thymocytes, as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia derived T cells

 </sup>. In the first group of experiments, we applied infection doses of 0.1 and 1.0 MOI, with the cells being then harvested 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection, and subjected to cytofluorometry or immunofluorescence with the 4G2 antibody for intracellular detection of the viral envelope protein. The mouse monoclonal 4G2 antibody recognizes an epitope on the envelope protein conserved in the flavivirus family, including Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus and Zika virus

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>, we found a progressive increase in the relative numbers of infected cells, as ascertained by the two applied viral doses. Yet, the use of 1.0 MOI was much more efficient in promoting infection, so that around 90% of the cells were 4G2-positive after 72 hours. Accordingly, all further experiments were done using this infection dose at 72 hours post-infection and MOCK cells were used as control, as the 4G2 antibody present a slight background in MOCK cells when compared to the isotype control. The same percentage of infection was detected by immunofluorescence on adhered cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref>), and the presence of the ZIKV envelope protein could be detected in the cytoplasm - especially around the nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).
