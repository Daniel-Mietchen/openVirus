<p id="Par9">Since human TEC could be infected by ZIKV, we searched for the membrane expression of well-known ZIKV receptors, namely TIM1, TIM4, TYRO3, and AXL. Actually, cultured human TEC constitutively expresses AXL, but not TIM1, TIM4, TYRO3 receptors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). Blocking the AXL receptor with the corresponding neutralizing antibody completely prevented TEC infection by ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j,k</xref>), showing that ZIKV uses the AXL receptor to invade human TEC.
