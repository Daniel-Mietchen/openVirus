<p id="Par31">Enhanced expression of some matrix metalloproteinase genes, such as MMP8 and MMP19 (both having collagenolytic activity) was also observed, suggesting that the ECM-related metabolism of TEC is altered by ZIKV. Moreover, ZIKV augmented the gene expression of various chemokines; some of which (CCL4, CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL10, for example) being involved in intrathymic T-cell migration
