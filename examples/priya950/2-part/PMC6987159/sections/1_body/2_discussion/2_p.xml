<p id="Par27">We first demonstrated that growing human TEC could indeed be infected, and that such infection occurred through the AXL receptor. Moreover, viral particles produced within TEC were infective. Interestingly, the human TEC line could also be infected with other RNA viruses, namely the retrovirus HTLV-1
