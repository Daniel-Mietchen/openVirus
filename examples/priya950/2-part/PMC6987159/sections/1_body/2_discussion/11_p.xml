<p id="Par36">In addition to extended 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing that human TEC is infected and respond to ZIKV, we evaluated the presence of the virus as well as the general thymus microarchitecture in histological sections obtained from children who died early in life, whose mothers were infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. Although the number of specimens was low, thymuses were widely affected, varying from massive loss of cortical thymocytes, to preservation of the cortex in some cases. Within the thymic lobules and septae, we could see an increase in ECM deposition, as revealed by histological staining of collagen-containing fibrils. Most importantly, there was an alteration in the thymic epithelial network with a clear-cut increase in the formation of Hassall’s corpuscles, denoting a higher degree of keratinization (corresponding to terminal epithelial cell differentiation). In the same vein, we observed an increase in keratin contents in ZIKV-infected TEC cultures. It is important to point out that such enhancement of Hassall’s corpuscles is also found in cases of glucocorticoid treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency
