<p id="Par30">It is known that adhesion of developing T-cells to the thymic epithelium is controlled by various cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, fibronectin, laminins, and their corresponding integrin receptors

 </sup>. We found a large number of upregulated genes related to extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Significant increase in the gene expression of various laminin alpha-chains as well as fibril forming collagen chains was seen in ZIKV-infected TEC, as well as higher levels of VCAM1 and ICAM-1 expression in TEC after ZIKV infection.
