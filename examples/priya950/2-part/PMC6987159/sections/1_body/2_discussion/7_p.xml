<p id="Par32">In keeping with the transcriptome data related to extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and cell migration, we demonstrated that infected TEC expressed higher levels of the ICAM-1 protein on their membranes. In keeping with the literature showing that ICAM-1 plays a major role in TEC adhesion to developing T-cells

 </sup>, we found that lymphoblastic T cells adhered more to ZIKV-infected TEC than to uninfected TEC cultures. We can thus hypothesize that enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines would facilitate the encounter of developing T-cells with ZIKV-infected TEC, favoring in one hand the transfer of the virus to lymphocytes, and on the other hand, the establishment of an immunological synapse between the two cell types. This should also be placed in the context of the control of HLA-B gene expression, which was upregulated (Fig.Â
