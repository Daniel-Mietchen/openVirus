<p id="Par29">Major changes in TEC growth were also found after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ZIKV infection, including a decrease in proliferation and increase in cell death, resulting in a reduction of total cell numbers after 3-day TEC cultures. RNA viruses such as ZIKV use strategies to modulate cell-cycle control and cell proliferation from the host and obtain cellular conditions favorable for their replication

 </sup>. Accordingly, the data from RNA sequencing revealed few downregulated genes associated with the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. These results are consistent with previous studies on ZIKV-infected human cell types, such as Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules, retinal pigment epithelium, neural progenitors, and astrocytes, which reported suppression of cell proliferation, as well as induction of antiviral defense pathways
