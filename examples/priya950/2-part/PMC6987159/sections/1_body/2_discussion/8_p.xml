<p id="Par33">The control of gene expression in ZIKV-infected human TEC was also evaluated through the analysis of different non-coding RNAs. In fact, our robust transcriptome and microRNA expression analyses in ZIKV-infected TEC highlighted the molecular response of protein-coding genes and non-coding genes (lncRNAs, circRNAs and miRNAs). We observed miRNAs acting as probable regulators of genes associated with immune response, such as hsa-miR-222-5p (DDX58 and HLA-B), hsa-miR-1303-5p (HLA-DOA), hsa-miR-193b-5p (IFIT2), hsa-miR-100-3p (IFIT1B). Some miRNAs also have shown response to Cytokine Signaling in Immune system such as hsa-miR-503-3p (TNFRSF9) and hsa-miR-4458-5p (TNFSF9). The chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL11 could also beÂ regulated by miRNAs in ZIKV-infected TEC. Taken together, these analyses indicate that miRNAs may play a relevant role in the intracellular control of antiviral immunity against ZIKV-infected TEC.</p>
