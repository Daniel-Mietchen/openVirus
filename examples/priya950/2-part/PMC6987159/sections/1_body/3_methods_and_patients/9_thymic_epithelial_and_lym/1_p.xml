<p id="Par55">TEC were seeded in T-25 flasks (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells) and 24 h later infected as described previously. Seventy-two hours post-infection, the medium was removed and CEM cells were added to the culture in a proportion of 25 CEM cells per TEC with fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 15% FBS. After 24 h of co-culture, non-adherent cells were removed by washing the flasks with PBS. Remaining adherent cells were recovered after addition of trypsin to the flasks. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were stained with 4G2 and anti-cytokeratin antibody by flow cytometry, as described previously. Anti-cytokeratin antibody was used for distinguishing CEM cells and TEC in adherent and non-adherent cells suspensions.
