<p id="Par56">TEC were seeded in T-25 flasks (10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) and 24 h later infected as described previously. Seventy-two hours post-infection, RNA extraction was performed with MOCK and ZIKV-infected TEC using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions for mRNA and small RNA extraction. Total RNA concentration and purity were determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was verified through Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
