<p id="Par57">The 12 transcriptome libraries were prepared from 500 ng of total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina). Additionally, the 12 small RNA libraries were prepared from 1 μg from the same total RNA of transcriptome analysis, using the TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). All the steps of the protocols were carried out without any modifications, with the exception of the cDNA construction purification step on the small RNA protocol, which was performed using 3% Agarose Gel Cassette for targets between 100 bp − 250 bp in a BluePippin system (Sage Science). The quality control of each library was performed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer System with the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). The libraries were quantified via qPCR using a KAPA Library Quantification Kits for Illumina platforms (KAPA Biosystems). The Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq. 500 sequencing system (Illumina), for the RNA-seq paired-end reads (2 × 75 bp) were obtained using NextSeq. 500/550 High Output v2 kit (150 cycles) and for the small RNA, single-end reads (1 × 50 bp) were obtained using a NextSeq. 500/550 High Output v2 kit (75 cycles).</p>
