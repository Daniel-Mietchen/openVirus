<p id="Par49">Cell death was analyzed by staining with Annexin-V-APC (Immunotools) and PI (Propidium iodide– Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were resuspended in 100 µL of 1x Annexin-V binding buffer (BD Biosciences) and incubated with Annexin-V-APC (1 µL) for 10 min at room temperature. PI (10 µg/mL) was added to the suspension prior acquisition on the flow cytometer.</p>
