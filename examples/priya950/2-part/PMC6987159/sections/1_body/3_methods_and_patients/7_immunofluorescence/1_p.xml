 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) Lab-Tek
 <sup>®</sup> Chamber Slide™ System and infected as described previously. After infection, the slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Slides were washed again and treated with permeabilization buffer (0.1% saponin and 1% BSA – bovine albumin serum) for 15 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, samples were incubated for 40 min with blocking solution (0.2% normal goat serum, 1% FBS, 1% BSA, 0.3% X-100 triton) and submitted to staining with primary antibody for 1 h and with secondary antibody for 30 min. After staining, the slides were washed twice with permeabilization buffer, stained with DAPI for 10 min, washed and mounted with Dako Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DAKO).
