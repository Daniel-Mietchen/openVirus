<p id="Par53">Immunostained samples were analyzed by an AxioImager A2 device using the AxioVision Rel 4.8 software (Zeiss) or by Leica TSC SP8 Confocal device using LAS-X Software (Leica Microsystems). Negative controls, in which the secondary antibody was used alone, did not generate any significant labeling. The percentage of infection was achieved by the number of 4G2
 <sup>+</sup> cells divided by the total number of cells per field. We analyzed 5 fields from 3 independent experiments and each experiment was performed in triplicate. The quantitative fluorescence analysis of cytokeratin expression was performed by transforming the specific staining into an eight-bit grey image for analysis of the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) through the ImageJ software (NIH). At least 50 cells per condition were analyzed CTCF is calculated by the integrated density minus the area of a given cell multiplies by the mean fluorescence of background readings. When necessary, brightness and contrast adjustments were performed in the entire images.
