  <p>Enrichment Analyses of upregulated and downregulated genes from transcriptome of Zika virus-infected TEC. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Top 10 significant terms from the Reactome Enrichment Analysis of the upregulated genes. Horizontal red bars indicate the p-adjusted values (−Log
   <sub>10</sub> scale) from the Reactome Enrichment Analysis. Numbers in the top of the red bars indicate the gene counting of each Reactome Term. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Cnetplot showing both upregulated genes and enriched Reactome terms. Pale yellow circles indicate the size of Reactome terms. The Log
   <sub>2</sub> Fold Changes are indicated by the dot colors. Warmer colors indicate those most upregulated genes. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Top 10 significant terms from the Reactome Enrichment Analysis of the downregulated genes. Horizontal blue bars indicate the p-adjusted values (−Log
   <sub>10</sub> scale) from the Reactome Enrichment Analysis. Numbers in the top of the blue bars indicates the gene counting of each Reactome Term. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Cnetplot showing both downregulated genes and enriched Reactome terms. Pale yellow circles indicate the size of the Reactome terms. The Log
   <sub>2</sub> Fold Changes are indicated by the dot colors. Greener colors indicate the most downregulated genes.
