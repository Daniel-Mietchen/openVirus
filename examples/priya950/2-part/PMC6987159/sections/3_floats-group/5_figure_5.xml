  <p>Zika virus infection in human cultured epithelial cells enhances cell adhesion and conveys the virus to lymphoblastic T cells. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Human TEC were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 1) and 72 hpi the expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) and VCAM-1 (CD106) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Graphs show the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of these molecules. MFI values were normalized by the mean of the control group (n = 3). Human TEC were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 1) and 72 hpi uninfected CEM acute T-cell leukemia cell line was added to the culture. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Association index between CEM and TEC after 1 h of co-culture (adhesion). Values in the upper panel represent mean ± SEM. Representative microscopic fields after Giemsa staining are shown in the lower panel (n = 4). Relative expression of 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells in (
   <bold>c</bold>) TEC and (
   <bold>d</bold>) CEM subpopulations were detected by flow cytometry after 24 h of co-culture. Values represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3, two experiments in duplicate). (
   <bold>e</bold>) CEM cells were not directly infected by ZIKV (MOI = 1). CEM cells were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 1) for 2 h and 72 hpi 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Values represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ****p &lt; 0.0001 (as determined by the unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test).
