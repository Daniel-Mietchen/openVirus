  <p>ZIKV envelope protein is found in human thymus of babies with congenital Zika virus infection. Representative images of immunofluorescence staining of 4G2 (viral protein, in red), cytokeratin (in green) and DAPI (nuclei, in blue) of paraffin-embedded human thymus sections (n = 2 for controls and n = 6 for congenital ZIKV infection). First column shows the merge of the three stainings. The last column shows the colocalization analysis for 4G2 and cytokeratin stainings; white points represent overlap between these two immunostainings. We could identify viral protein in five out of the six thymuses studied; most of cells labeled being epithelial. Arrows show some of the cells that were stained for both 4G2 and cytokeratin. Differences in bar sizes are due to the digital zoom used during image acquisition.</p>
