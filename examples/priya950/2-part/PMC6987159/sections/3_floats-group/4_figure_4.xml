  <p>Non-coding genes response in human TEC infected with the Zika virus. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Expression of Long non-coding genes related to Immune System, Apoptosis, Apoptosis and Proliferation, Proliferation, Cell Cycle Arrest and Cellular Adhesion. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Network formed by MicroRNA and respective target transcripts, showing upregulated microRNAs and down-regulated targets. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Network formed by MicroRNA and respective target transcripts, showing down regulated microRNAs and upregulated targets. The Log
   <sub>2</sub> Fold Changes were indicated by the continuous scaled colors. Warmer colors indicate upregulation, cooler colors indicate down regulation. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Expression analysis of Hsa-miR-542-3p and its putative circRNAs targets. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Expression analysis of Hsa-miR-92a-1-5p and its putative circRNAs targets. The data are expressed in Log2 Fold Change (Log2FC). Red and blue bars indicate up and downregulated genes, respectively.
