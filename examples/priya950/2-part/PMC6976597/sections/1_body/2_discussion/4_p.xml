<p id="Par21">Our results further show that these regions are immuno-dominant stressing their ability for induction of potential auto-immune reaction. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis, twenty-four of the conserved regions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) bound to HLA class II alleles, suggesting the possibility of calling in for T helper cell responses. Three conserved regions were predicted to be potential B cell epitopes by all the algorithms tested. Since majority of the antigenic epitopes have been shown to have high surface accessibility, we hypothesized that identical amino acids would give rise to similar structural features too. Therefore, we validated the antigenicity of chosen conserved regions at structural level. The root mean square deviation between the peptides is 0.86 Å which suggests that the two peptides bind to class II MHC in a similar orientation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Docking the conserved region (FPLANVTCM) from the structural polyprotein and its homologous sequence in the human proteome revealed similar interactions with HLA-DRB1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Plausible B cell epitope prediction analysis based on the structure of CHIKV structural polyprotein concurred with some of the conserved regions we identified. Thus, validation at both the amino acid and structural level affirmed the antigenic potential of conserved regions in the structural polyprotein. In addition, through the revelation of presence of significant conserved regions in the alphaviral proteins, we surmise that antibodies for differential diagnosis of alpha virus infections should be directed towards the non-conserved regions of the structural proteins for higher specificity. In summary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), our results computationally tease out a possible mechanism mediated through molecular mimicry leading to development of autoimmunity during alpha virus infections which could culminate in arthritis like conditions in infected individuals.
