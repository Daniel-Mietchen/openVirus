<p id="Par29">Further, to validate if the conserved regions act as potential linear B cell epitopes at the structural level, we employed ElliPro server

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup> to predict the regions on the structural polyprotein of the Chikungunya virus (PDB ID: 3J2W). ElliPro accepts a PDB structure as input and uses three different algorithms based on protrusion index of the residues, protein shape approximation and neighboring residues clustering to predict linear antibody-based epitopes. Default parameters of the ElliPro program were used for prediction analysis.
