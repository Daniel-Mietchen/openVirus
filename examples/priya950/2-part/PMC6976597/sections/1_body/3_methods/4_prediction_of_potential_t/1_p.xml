<p id="Par26">The shortlisted conserved regions in the structural polyprotein were explored for their ability to act as T cell epitopes. Peptides from these regions were subjected to HLA II binding analysis using ProPred II analysis tool

 </sup>. The server uses quantitative matrices for predicting binding of nonamers to HLA class II. Quantitative matrices are chosen for predictive binding because they provide a linear model and are easy to implement. Nonameric peptides generated from the conserved regions, which were predicted as potential binders for HLA class II alleles were selected for further analysis. A frequency distribution of the ability of these peptides to bind to multiple HLA class II alleles was generated.
