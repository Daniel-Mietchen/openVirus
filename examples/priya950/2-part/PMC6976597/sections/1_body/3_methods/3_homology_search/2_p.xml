 </sup> to identify if a given protein has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. The Open Targets Platform server is a repository of human proteins and their involvement in diseases at various levels. These proteins bearing the homologous sequences to conserved regions within the structural polyproteins were chosen for further investigation.
