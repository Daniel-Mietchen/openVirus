<p id="Par3">While there is a resurgence of alphavirus associated arthritis cases, the knowledge about the molecular level events during infections involved in these conditions and about the direct cause and effect of the phenomenon is very sparse. For instance, macrophages, natural killer cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes have been shown as the main components of the inflammatory cellular infiltrate in animal models of CHIKV and RRV infections

 </sup>. Production of a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN-α/β, and IFNγ) and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) post alpha viral infections has also been reported by
