<p id="Par2">Alphaviruses belonging to the group IV togoviridae family are positive sense, single stranded RNA viruses. These enveloped viruses are classified as old world and new world. While new world viruses are encephalitogenic, members of the old world are known to induce polyarthritis

 </sup>. The members of the old world viruses include Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV), Ross River Virus (RRV), Mayaro Virus (MAYV), O’nyong nyong virus (ONV), Semiliki Forest Virus (SFV) and the Barmah Forest Virus (BFV). These mosquito transmitted viruses are globally distributed and are known to cause acute febrile illnesses, malaise, maculopapular rashes, myalgia, and severe arthralgia in humans
