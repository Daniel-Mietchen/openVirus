 </sup> hypothesized that microbial antigens like pulD from Klebsiella sp., nuclear antigen-1 from Epstein-Barr virus and OSP-A from Borrelia sp. may have a possible association with autoimmune diseases like ankylosing spondylitis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Lyme arthritis, respectively. A significant sequence similarity between P2-C protein of Coxsackie virus and glutamate decarboxylase of humans has been proposed as a trigger for Type 1 diabetes
