<p id="Par5">Overarching goal of this study is to explore the possibility of existence of peptides in alphaviruses which may set off an autoimmune response resulting in rheumatoid arthritis like symptoms in alphavirus infected patients. Structural polyproteins of the alphaviruses were scanned for the presence of conserved stretches of amino acids that might share homology with sequences in human proteins implicated in rheumatoid arthritis. These conserved regions were validated 
 <italic>in silico</italic> both at sequence and structural level for their immunogenic potential in terms of their ability to act as T and B cell epitopes. Overall, our results posit that polyarthritis associated with alpha viral infections may also involve an autoimmune component due to cross reactivity between viral epitopes and host proteins.
