<p id="Par6">Arthritogenic alpha viruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross river virus (RRV), Semiliki forest virus (SFV), Mayaro virus, O’nyong-nyong virus (ONV) and Barmah forest virus (BFV) are generally associated with rheumatic diseases in humans, primarily characterized by polyarthralgia and polyarthritis. Although most patients recover within few weeks, the clinical conditions last for 6 months to more than 3 years

 </sup>. However, molecular mechanisms contributing to this pathology are not very well understood. In the present study, we show a possible role of autoimmune process mediated through molecular mimicry as a likely cause for arthritic like conditions post alphaviral infections. The overall workflow of the study is depicted in Fig.
