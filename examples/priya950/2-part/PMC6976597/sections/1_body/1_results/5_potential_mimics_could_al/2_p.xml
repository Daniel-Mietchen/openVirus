<p id="Par15">Out of the 24 conserved regions analyzed, 5 regions were predicted to be plausible B cell epitopes by all the three algorithms. 6 regions were predicted to be plausible B cell epitopes by at least 2 of the 3 algorithms tested. 12 regions were predicted to be B cell epitopes by only one of the algorithm. Only one out of the 24 conserved regions was not predicted as B cell epitope by all the three algorithms.</p>
