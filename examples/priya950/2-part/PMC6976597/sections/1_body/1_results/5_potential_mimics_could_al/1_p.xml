<p id="Par14">To further strengthen the case of alpha viral induced molecular mimicry, we have analyzed the 24 conserved regions for the presence of both linear and structural B cell epitopes which in turn is a measure of their ability to act as stimulators of B cells and generate an autoimmune reaction against its homologous region in the human protein leading to polyarthralgia. Linear B cell epitope prediction was performed using three different prediction algorithms namely Bepipred linear epitope prediction, Emini surface accessibility scale and Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale. Prediction results are summarized in TableÂ
