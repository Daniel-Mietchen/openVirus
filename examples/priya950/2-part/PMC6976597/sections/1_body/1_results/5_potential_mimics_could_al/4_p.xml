<p id="Par17">To further validate if the potential mimics could act as plausible B cell epitopes also at a conformational level, CHIKV structural polyprotein was used as a model to locate conformational B cell epitopes using Ellipro server from IEDB. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the parts of the peptides MKSDASKFTHEKPEGYYNWHHGAVQ and YSGGRFTIPTGAGKPGDSGRPIFDN (labelled A in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) present on the Capsid protein, the part of the peptide RKGKIHIPFPLANVTCMVPKA (labelled B), PTVTYGK (labelled C) and EGLEVTWGNN (labelled D) present on the p62 protein are exposed to the surface and predicted to be potential conformational B cell epitopes.
