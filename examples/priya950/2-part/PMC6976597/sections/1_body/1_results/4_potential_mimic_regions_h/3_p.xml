<p id="Par12">Since the quality of immune response elicited by the mimic peptide in humans should be similar to the one elicited by the viral peptide for an efficient autoimmune response to occur, the structure of the HLA DRII-peptide complex was analyzed. Molecular docking analysis was performed to assess the structural similarity in the binding patterns of the viral peptide and its homologous region in the human protein. The ability of one of the potential conserved regions, FPLANVTCM (viral derived) and its corresponding homologous region KPLANVTLM (human derived) to bind to a class II HLA allele was assessed by docking the peptides in the binding groove of HLA-DRB1, an allele known to predispose individuals to rheumatoid arthritis
