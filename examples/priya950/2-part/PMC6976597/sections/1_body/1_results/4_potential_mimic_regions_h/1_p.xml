<p id="Par10">Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is the most widely distributed molecule with high level of polymorphism and are the major governing factors in initiating cellular immune responses. It is thus important that immunogenic peptides bind to multiple HLA alleles to elicit a strong immune response. The 24 conserved regions of the structural polyprotein (refer Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were analyzed for HLA class II binding ability using propred II server. The nonameric peptides generated from each conserved region were scanned against 51 HLA alleles available in the ProPred II server. The number of nonameric peptides generated from each of 24 conserved regions and the number of peptides predicted to bind to different alleles is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Peptides generated from 19 of the conserved regions bound to at least one HLA allele, while the peptides from the remaining 5 of the conserved regions did not bind to any of the alleles.
