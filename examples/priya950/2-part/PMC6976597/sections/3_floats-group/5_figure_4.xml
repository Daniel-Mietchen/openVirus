 <caption>
  <p>A Structural representation of the peptide-MHC complex generated by docking of the peptide F
   <underline>PLANVT</underline>CM from the alpha virus structural polyproteins (cyan) and the peptide K
   <underline>PLANVT</underline>LM from the alpha 1-B glycoprotein of human (red) into the binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Both the peptides exhibit similar fit and interactions with the amino acids (yellow) in the binding pocket of HLA.
