<p>Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized innate immune pathway that rapidly clears a number of distinct alphavirus particles from the circulation. While liver KCs have been implicated as a critical innate defense against blood-borne bacterial pathogens (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Kubes and Jenne, 2018</xref>), this work expands their role to additionally serve as sentinels for circulating CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV. Mechanistically, this innate clearance pathway occurs independently of opsonization with natural antibody or fragments of C3, and instead is mediated by the scavenger receptor MARCO. While our data suggest that KCs in the liver are primarily responsible for clearance of these alphavirus particles from the circulation, MARCO is known to be expressed by other macrophage populations exposed to the blood, including MZM in the spleen (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Although we found that the spleen is not necessary for the clearance of circulating CHIKV particles, it remains possible that MZM contribute to the clearance of this group of alphaviruses in intact mice. Further work is needed to evaluate whether KCs are required for the clearance of circulating CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV particles, or whether other macrophage populations can compensate in their absence.
