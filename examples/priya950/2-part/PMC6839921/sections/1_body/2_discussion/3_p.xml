<p>SRs are expressed on a variety of tissue resident macrophage populations, including those in the liver and spleen that surveil the blood (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Kubes and Jenne, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). SRs mediate non-opsonic clearance of a variety of circulating self and non-self molecules due to their capacity to recognize a diverse range of ligands, including modified endogenous proteins or lipoproteins, as well as bacterial surface proteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipotechoic acid (LTA) (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Areschoug and Gordon, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Canton et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV particles was inhibited by pre-treatment of mice with the SR competitive inhibitors poly(I) and dextran sulfate (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>), supporting a role for SRs in clearance of these alphaviruses from the circulation. Poly(I) and dextran sulfate are known ligands for the class A scavenger receptors SR-A1 and MARCO (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>), both of which are transcriptionally expressed in liver KCs (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). SR-A1 and MARCO play a prominent role in host defense by functioning as phagocytic receptors for multiple bacterial pathogens. For example, mice deficient in SR-A1 are more susceptible to infection with

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice have enhanced sensitivity to infection with

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Areschoug and Gordon, 2009</xref>). However, less is known about the role of class A scavenger receptors during viral infections. SR-A1 has a protective role during systemic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of mice (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>), and HSV-1 can utilize MARCO for attachment and entry into epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, vaccinia virus (VacV) binding to MARCO on keratinocytes enhances infection of these cells in vitro (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al., 2015</xref>). MARCO also mediates transduction of macrophages by adenovirus in vitro, and appears to promote innate immune responses to the infection (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Maler et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that MARCO-virus interactions can regulate host cell responses to infection. Our studies in SR-A1
 <sup>-/-</sup> and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice identified critical roles for MARCO in the efficient clearance of circulating CHIKV particles and for limiting viral dissemination and the magnitude and duration of viremia, suggesting that MARCO may limit disease severity following CHIKV infection.
