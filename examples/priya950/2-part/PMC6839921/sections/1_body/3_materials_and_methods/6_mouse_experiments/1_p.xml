 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arredouani et al., 2004</xref>) were provided by Dawn Bowdish (McMaster University). All experiments were performed in 3–4 week-old mice, except those involving sham or splenectomized mice, which were 6 weeks-old at the time of virus inoculation. All WT mice used were male, with the exception of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, where five mice were female. WT mice were purchased commercially and were age-matched, and distributed randomly across groups. For mouse strains bred in house (μMT,

All experiments were performed under Biosafety level 2 or 3 conditions, as appropriate. Masking was not used. Phagocytic cell depletions were achieved by inoculating mice i.v. with 100 μl/10 g body weight of PBS- or clodronate-loaded liposomes (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Clodronateliposomes.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Clodronateliposomes.org</ext-link>) 42 hr prior to inoculation with virus. For clearance blockade experiments, mice were treated i.v. with 200 μg of poly(I) or poly(C) (Sigma 26936-41-4 and 26936-40-3) or 200 μg of dextran or dextran sulfate (Sigma 31392 and D6001) 5 min prior to inoculation with virus. For serum clearance experiments, mice were inoculated i.v. with a defined number of particles (CHIKV and RRV: 10
 <sup>7</sup> or 10
 <sup>8</sup> viral genomes depending on experiment; ONNV: 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU) diluted in a total volume of 100–200 μl of diluent (PBS with 1% FBS). Viral inoculum was reserved to quantify input genomes. At the time of termination, mice were euthanized through inhalation of isoflurane vapors, followed by thoracotomy, and serum was collected. In some experiments, mice were then perfused by intracardiac injection of PBS prior to collecting the indicated tissues in RPMI for flow cytometry or in TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) for RNA analysis. Tissues for RNA analysis were first homogenized with a MagNA Lyser (Roche). For viral dissemination experiments, mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 10 μl containing 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of virus diluted in PBS with 1% FBS. At 24 hpi, mice were euthanized and blood was collected. Mice were then perfused by intracardiac injection of PBS, and the indicated tissues were collected in in vitro diluent (PBS with 1% FBS, 1× Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, and 1× Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>) and homogenized with a MagNA Lyser (Roche) for analysis by focus formation assay or plaque assay.
