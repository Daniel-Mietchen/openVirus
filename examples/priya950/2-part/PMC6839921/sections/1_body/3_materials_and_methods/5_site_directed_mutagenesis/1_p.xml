<p>Viral point mutants were constructed through site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent #200517) of cDNA clones, using the primers provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. A sequence verified fragment containing the desired mutation was then subcloned into the unmutagenized parental plasmid. For AF15561 E2 K200 mutants, SL15649 E2 K200R, 99659 E2 K200R, and AF15561 glycosylation mutants, subcloning was performed using restriction sites XhoI and XmaI. 37997 E2 K200R was not subcloned, but the E2 gene was sequence verified to only contain the K200R mutation. For ONNV E2 K200R, BstBI and BamHI were used for subcloning. RRV DC6592 E2 K251R was subcloned using site PspOMI and XmaI. RRV T48 mutants E2 R251A, E2 R251D, E2 R251Q, and E2 R251S were not subcloned, but the E2 gene was sequence verified to only contain the specified E2 251 mutation.
