 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Mexico (Poza Rica [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Vera-Maloof et al., 2015</xref>], F18-20) were used for vector competence studies. Mosquitoes were fed citrated sheep blood for colony maintenance and provided with sugar and water ad libitum. Larvae and adults were reared and maintained under controlled conditions of 28°C temperature, 70% relative humidity and a 12:12 (L:D) diurnal light cycle. Mosquitoes were provided an infectious blood meal containing either CHIKV AF15561 WT or CHIKV AF15561 E2 K200R. Defibrinated calf blood was mixed 1:1 with DMEM containing 2.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL virus, resulting in a final blood meal titer of 1.1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL. On day 3 post-infection, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized and legs and wings were removed and placed into a 2 mL tube containing 250 µL mosquito diluent (1x PBS containing 20% FBS, antibiotics and antifungals) and a sterile stainless-steel bead. Mosquito saliva was then collected by placing the mosquito proboscis into a capillary tube filled with immersion oil to salivate for 30 min. Each capillary tube end containing saliva was broken off into a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL mosquito diluent, centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 x g and stored at −80°C. After salivation, mosquito bodies were also placed in a 2 mL tube containing 250 µL mosquito diluent and a sterile stainless-steel bead. Tissues (legs/wings and bodies) were homogenized using a Retsch Mixer Mill MM400 (Germany) at 24 cycles/second for 1 min, centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 3 min and stored at −80°C. To determine whether samples contained virus or not, Vero cells grown in 24-well plates were inoculated with 50 µL mosquito sample for 1 hr before a semi-solid overlay (0.6% Tragacanth gum in EMEM) was added. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet three dpi to visualize plaques. Samples found to be positive for virus were further evaluated by focus formation assay, as described above, to quantify the amount of infectious virus present in the sample.
