<p>To determine the sample size to be used, population variance from pre-existing sample sets were used in a power calculation (80% power, 0.05 type I error) to detect a 4–5-fold effect. The defined sample size (N) listed in each figure legend refers to biological replicates of individual mice, mosquitoes, or cell wells. Data are represented as mean ± SD. The statistical tests used for each data set are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Two-sided t-tests (parametric) or Mann Whitney tests (nonparametric) were used to compare two groups. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (nonparametric) were used to compare three or more groups, and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was used to compare two groups at multiple time points.</p>
