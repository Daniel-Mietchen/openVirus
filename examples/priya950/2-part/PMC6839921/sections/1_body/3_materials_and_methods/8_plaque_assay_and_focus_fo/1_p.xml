<p>In some experiments, infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay or focus formation assay, as described previously (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, for plaque assays, BHK-21 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of serum or tissue homogenate in in vitro diluent. Following a 1 hr adsorption, cells were overlayed with 1% immunodiffusion agarose (MP Biomedical) and incubated at 37
 <bold>°</bold>C for 40–44 hr before staining with neutral red stain to enumerate plaques. For focus formation assays, Vero cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and serial dilutions of serum or tissue homogenate were adsorbed to the cells for 2 hr, after which the inoculum was removed and an overlay of 0.5% methylcellulose in MEM-alpha with 10% FBS was added to the cells. Following an 18 hr incubation at 37
 <bold>°</bold>C, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and probed with CHK-11 monoclonal antibody at 500 ng/ml in Perm Wash (1x PBS, 0.1% saponin, 0.1% BSA), followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:2000 in Perm Wash. Foci were visualized with TrueBlue substrate (Fisher) and counted with a CTL Biospot analyzer using Biospot software (Cellular Technology).
