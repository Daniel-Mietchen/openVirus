<p>Cell lines were obtained directly from ATCC. Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-F-12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Lonza), 1x nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies), sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL10) were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Lonza), 10% tryptone phosphate broth, and penicillin-streptomycin. Human dermal fibroblasts (ATCC PCS-201–012) were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660) were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle’s salts (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza) and penicillin-streptomycin. All mammalian cells were cultured at 37°C, and C6/36 mosquito cells were incubated at 30°C. Cells tested negative for mycoplasma.</p>
