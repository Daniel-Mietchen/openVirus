<p>To test if the effects of the E2 K200R mutation were unique to the CHIKV strain tested (AF15561; Asian genotype) or functioned within broader viral genetic contexts, we introduced an E2 K200R mutation into the genome of CHIKV strains representative of all phylogenetic lineages: Asian-American (strain 99659; 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti and Valadere, 2014</xref>), East, Central, South African (strain SL15649; 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>), and West African (strain 37997; 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Tsetsarkin et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Vanlandingham et al., 2005a</xref>). In addition, we introduced an E2 K200R mutation into the genome of the SG650 strain of ONNV (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 1998</xref>). Similar to CHIKV AF15561, all WT strains of CHIKV and ONNV were cleared from the circulation at 45 min post-inoculation, whereas the levels of all E2 K200R mutant particles were substantially higher (
