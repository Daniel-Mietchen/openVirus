<p>The critical lysine at position E2 200 of CHIKV and ONNV is not conserved within RRV strains, which led us to investigate viral features that promote clearance of circulating RRV particles. In addition to RRV strain SN11 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a 2009 clinical isolate (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), we found that RRV strain DC5692 (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Jupille et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Lindsay, 1996</xref>) also was efficiently cleared from the circulation by phagocytic cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, RRV strain T48 (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Doherty and Whitehead, 1963</xref>) was resistant to clearance, and clearance was relatively unaffected by prior depletion of phagocytic cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Through chimeric virus analysis of DC5692 and T48 strains, we mapped the genetic determinant of RRV susceptibility to clearance to a region of the genome encoding a portion of capsid, E3 and E2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Within the E2 glycoprotein, the T48 and DC5692 RRV strains differ by only six amino acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Remarkably, mutating position E2 251 of T48 from arginine to lysine (R251K) was sufficient to make this strain more susceptible to clearance, while the corresponding K251R mutation in DC5692 conferred resistance to clearance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of a lysine at E2 251 in RRV strain SN11. The R251K mutation had no impact on the stability of RRV T48 in serum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, inoculation of purified viral particles generated in serum free media maintained the differential clearance of T48 and T48 E2 R251K, indicating that viral clearance is not mediated by factors in fetal bovine serum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that, in three independent alphaviruses, lysine to arginine mutations at distinct sites in the E2 glycoprotein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) allow for viral escape from phagocytic cell-mediated clearance.
