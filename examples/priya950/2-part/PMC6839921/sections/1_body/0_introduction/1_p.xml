<p>During the past several decades, multiple arboviruses, including dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, have re-emerged to cause widespread epidemics affecting millions of people (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Weaver, 2018</xref>). For example, DENVs are estimated to cause ~390 million infections per year resulting in ~500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome that can result in death (

 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Musso et al., 2018</xref>) in 2007 and 2013, respectively, before being introduced to the Americas (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Metsky et al., 2017</xref>). Here, ZIKV caused nearly one million confirmed and suspected cases and became recognized as a cause of congenital neurodevelopmental defects (
