<p>As outlined above, we performed new experiments to address these reviewer concerns. We found that WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice have a similar number of F4/80
 <sup>+</sup> KCs in the liver and that KCs are efficiently depleted by CLL, which requires functional phagocytic processes, in both strains of mice. These new data are displayed in new Figure 3H and 3I.
