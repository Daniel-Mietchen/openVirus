<p>To address these reviewer concerns, we i.v. pretreated WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with PLL or CLL. At 42 hours post-treatment, mice were i.v. inoculated with CHIKV. At 45 min post virus inoculation the following analyses were performed: (1) viral RNA in the serum was quantified by RT-qPCR, (2) viral RNA accumulation in the liver was assessed by in situ hybridization, and (3) F4/80
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the liver were visualized by immunohistochemistry and quantified by counting the number of F4/80
 <sup>+</sup> cells per field. These new analyses demonstrated that pretreatment with CLL blocked clearance of circulating CHIKV particles in WT mice, but had no effect on the level of CHIKV in the circulation of MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3G). Furthermore, CHIKV RNA was detectable by in situ hybridization in the liver of PLL-treated WT mice, but not in the liver of PLL-treated MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice or CLL-treated WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3H). In addition, despite the virological differences in the circulation and liver of PLL-treated WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, these mice had a similar number of KCs in the liver (new Figure 3I). Finally, both WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> KCs were efficiently depleted by CLL (new Figure 3H and 3I), indicating that MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> KCs retain the capacity to phagocytose liposomes. Thus, these new experiments support the conclusions that MARCO is required for clearance of circulating CHIKV particles and that MARCO is required for accumulation of CHIKV in the liver following i.v. inoculation of viral particles. In addition, these experiments address concerns raised in point #2 below. That is, the new data show that WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice have a similar number of F4/80
 <sup>+</sup> KCs in the liver and that in both strains of mice these cells are efficiently depleted by CLL, which requires functional phagocytic processes.
