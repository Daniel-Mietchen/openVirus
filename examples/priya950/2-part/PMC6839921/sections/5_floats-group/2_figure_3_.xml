   <sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.v. with the indicated virus, and viral genomes in the inoculum (input) and serum at 45 min post-inoculation were determined by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 6–8, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; p&gt;0.05. (
   <bold>B</bold>) WT or μMT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.v. with the indicated virus, and analyzed as in (
   <bold>A</bold>). Mean ± SD. N = 7–8, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; p&gt;0.05. (
   <bold>C</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were treated i.v. with 200 μg of poly(I) or poly(C) 5 min prior to inoculation with the indicated virus. Viral genomes in the serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 6–7, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test or Two-tailed unpaired t-test; **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001. (
   <bold>D</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were treated i.v. with 200 μg of dextran or dextran sulfate 5 min prior to inoculation with the indicated virus, and analyzed as in (
   <bold>C</bold>). Mean ± SD. N = 7–8, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test or Two-tailed unpaired t-test; ***p&lt;0.001. (
   <bold>E</bold>) SR-A1
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated, incoculated, and evaluated as in (

   <bold>F</bold>) WT or MARCO
   <sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice were inoculated and evaluated as in (
   <bold>A</bold>). Mean ± SD. N = 8–11, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; ****p&lt;0.0001. (
   <bold>G–I</bold>) WT and MARCO
   <sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice were treated i.v. with PBS- (PLL) or clodronate-loaded liposomes (CLL). At 42 hr post-treatment, mice were inoculated i.v. with CHIKV. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Viral genomes in the inoculum (input) and serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 3–4. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ****p&lt;0.0001. (
   <bold>H</bold>) Livers were collected at 45 min post-inoculation, and RNA Scope in situ hybridization or IHC were performed to visualize viral RNA localization or F4/80
   <sup>+</sup> macrophages, respectively. Brown staining is indicative of viral RNA or F4/80
   <sup>+</sup> macrophages. (
   <bold>I</bold>) F4/80 positive cells in 10 randomly selected high power fields (HPF) per section were counted in a blinded manner and used to calculate the average number of F4/80 positive cells per field. Mean ± SD. N = 3–4. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; ****p&lt;0.0001.

     <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), which FACS sorted single liver cells into a 384-well plate, evaluated cellular RNA by Illumina sequencing, and aligned reads to the mm10plus genome.
