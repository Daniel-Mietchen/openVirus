<p>A phylogenetic tree for the P gene for a selected range of viruses is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00944-f001">Figure 1</xref>. In line with a high conservation of the P gene there is 95% identity across all CDV strains. The Serengeti viruses form a closely-related and genetically distinct group, and not surprisingly have high identity with Serengeti isolates sequenced in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. There is 100% identity of the P sequence for the bat-eared fox with viruses isolated from wild dogs in the Serengeti in 2007, suggesting that this strain has continued to circulate.
