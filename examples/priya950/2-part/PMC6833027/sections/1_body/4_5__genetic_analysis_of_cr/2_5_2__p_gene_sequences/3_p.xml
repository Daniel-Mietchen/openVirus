<p>These changes are also confirmed in the Serengeti isolates reported here (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00944">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). We have also observed a change at site K117Q in the C protein for all of the Serengeti isolates which encodes a glutamine, whereas all other viruses have a lysine. In common with a German fox, Hyena 1 shows a change to valine from the consensus glutamic acid at residue 115. Both the dog and lion isolates have a leucine at this site, while the bat-eared fox has an alanine (
