<p>We have also noted two changes that occur in the P protein between CDV disease-causing (including monkey) and vaccine strains at sites (D56V, T135A) with the latter residue in each case being associated with disease. However, at both these sites Vaccine X (Vaccine D, Vanguard) has the ‘disease-associated amino acid’ and the seal Kazakhstan and Shuskiy mink CDV viruses as well as PDV stains have the ‘vaccine amino acid’ (
