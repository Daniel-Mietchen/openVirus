<p>Sequence comparison was made to all available CDV strains in GenBank, including the sequences of Serengeti isolates described by Nikolin [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], monkey isolates and vaccine strains. Materials and Methods are given in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00944">Supplementary information file</xref>. Based upon available sequences, there are five synapomorphic base changes (three silent) in the H gene, and five in the P gene (three silent) which distinguish all the Serengeti isolates from all other viruses in GenBank (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00944-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Phylogenetic trees for the P and H genes were produced for the five Serengeti isolates and selected CDV sequences available in GenBank using Neighbor Joining and Fast Minimum Evolution programs. Total P gene data was only available for some of the viruses used.
