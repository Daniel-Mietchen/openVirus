<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length H gene showed that Monkey CYN07-dV [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and Monkey-BJ01-DV were highly related to other CDV strains obtained from species of the 
 <italic>Canidae</italic> family in China during this time period. The monkey CDV strains (Monkey-BJ01-DV, CYN07-dV, Monkey-KM-01) possess a number of amino acid-specific substitutions (E276V, Q392R and D435Y) compared to the H protein of CDV occurring in other animals for the same period [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. An additional change from I542F in these monkey strains is also noted from our current analysis. As expected there are many substitutions for PDV compared to CDV strains. Alignment of selected strains including monkey and PDV isolates is shown in
