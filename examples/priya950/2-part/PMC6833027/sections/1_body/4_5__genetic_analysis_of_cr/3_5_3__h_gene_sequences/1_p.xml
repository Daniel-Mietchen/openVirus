<p>The H gene is much more variable than the P gene, with only 91% identity across CDV strains. A phylogenetic tree for selected isolates is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00944-f002">Figure 2</xref>. H amino acid changes were compared for selected strains. The substitutions P327L, K375Q, A/359/S, Q/402/P and I527V in the H protein distinguish most Serengeti isolates (ours and those of Nikolin et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) from all other CDV strains. However, Hyena 1 (MN335912) does not have the I527V substitution, while a V at this site also occurs in PDV/USA. The dog (MN335909) and bat-eared fox (MN335908) isolates also have a unique D307M substitution. Two substitutions I541P and P52I are unique to the bat-eared fox. Hyena 2, which was the earliest isolate, shares a Y549H change with Lion 1 and the lion and hyena isolates from the study by Nikolin et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This change to histidine is also shared by the Ondersteport and Convac vaccine strains, as well as the Caspian PDV isolate. Sites 530 and 549 were suggested to be associated with the spread to non-canine hosts by McCarthy et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].
