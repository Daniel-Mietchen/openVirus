<p>Based on P gene analysis, the majority of vaccine viruses including Onderstepoort, Rockborn and our sequence for Duramine vaccine (MN400967, confirmed to be based on the Onderstepoort vaccine strain) form a distinct cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00944-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The exception to this is Vaccine X (EU072201.1, alternative names Vaccine D, Vanguard vaccine). From our analysis the Vaccine X P gene shares 100% identity with the Hungarian vaccine, as well as panda and dog isolates from vaccinated animals with distemper, including USA dog isolate (AY964113.1) [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Further isolates from vaccinated dogs with clinical signs have high identity with Vaccine X. These include a virus isolated in Japan from the lymph node (AB212727.1) of a vaccinated dog with distemper [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. These common P sequences include the D56V and T135A substitutions, suggested in our current analysis to be associated with disease.
