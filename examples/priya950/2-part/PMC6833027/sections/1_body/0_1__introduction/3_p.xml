<p>PDV is thought to be derived from CDV through contact between terrestrial carnivores and seals. PDV can infect many species of seal and terrestrial carnivores as well, and is evidenced by the transmission of the disease to mink in the immediate vicinity of diseased seals in 1998 in Denmark [

 <italic>P. caspica</italic>) since the late 1980s [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PDV has caused extensive mortality in Atlantic seals, and more recently has spread to the North Pacific Ocean, and there is also serological evidence of morbillivirus infection in seals in Antarctica. In this article we review both the global occurrence of CDV and PDV, and present both historical and genetic information on these viruses crossing species barriers.
