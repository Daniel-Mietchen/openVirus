<p>Canine distemper virus (CDV) and phocine distemper (PDV) are closely-related members of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>morbillivirus</italic>, in the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>. Other members of the genus include the measles virus, the now eradicated virus of cattle, rinderpest, peste des petits ruminant virus of sheep and goats, and the cetacean morbilliviruses. Both CDV and PDV spread in bodily secretions, and transmission is largely through respiratory routes. CDV is highly contagious among susceptible host species, occurs worldwide, and despite vaccination efforts, the number of cases has increased in recent decades [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CDV has a broad host range among carnivores, with the infection of species in the family 
 <italic>canidae</italic>; dog, wolf, jackal, coyote, fox, dingo, as well as black-footed ferrets.
