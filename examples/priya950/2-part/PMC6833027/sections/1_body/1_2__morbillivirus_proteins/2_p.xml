<p>The haemaglutinin protein (H) and the fusion protein (F) are incorporated in the virion envelope [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The F protein mediates the fusion between the virus envelope and the cell membrane to allow the entry of the nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm. The H protein mediates virus attachment to the cell receptor, and its sequence is highly variable, with often single amino acid changes altering the ability of this virus to infect cells from different species [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CDV and PDV, like the measles virus and the other veterinary morbilliviruses, use both the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) and nectin-4 as receptors [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although evidence is not available for all morbilliviruses, it has been shown in mice and primate models of MeV infection that alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells expressing SLAM are initially infected on virus entry through the respiratory track. Nectin-4 is an epithelial cell basal receptor important for virus release from tissues including the lungs [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The viral P protein is much less variable, but has proven useful in morbillivirus phylogenetic studies. In addition to the P protein, the P gene also encodes two non-structural proteins V and C which modulate the immune response. The V protein has been shown to inhibit the interferon (IFN) system by blocking the Jak/Stat signaling pathway while the C protein acts as a regulator of viral RNA synthesis, thereby acting indirectly to suppress IFN induction.
