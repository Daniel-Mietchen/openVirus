<p>Morbilliviruses encode six structural and two non-structural proteins. The RNA genome is within the internal helical nucleocapsid, which incorporates the structural proteins nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L). This forms a ribonucleoprotein complex together with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The L protein activates the RdRp through its interactions with the P and N proteins. The RdRp is responsible for the transcription and replication of the virus genome, and also carries out modifications of the mRNAs post-transcriptionally. The lack of proof-reading ability of the RdRp accounts for the high mutation rate associated with RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The virus is enveloped by a lipid bilayer which is derived from the host cell when budding from the plasma membrane. The matrix (M) protein presents a boundary between the nucleocapsid and the envelope, and plays a role in the transcription and budding of the virus [
