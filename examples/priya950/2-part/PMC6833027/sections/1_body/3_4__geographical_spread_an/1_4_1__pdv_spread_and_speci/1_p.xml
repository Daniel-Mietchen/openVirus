<p>Phocine distemper virus was first characterized by us and others as an important pathogen of seals in 1988 when an outbreak caused mass mortality among European harbor seals (

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Differences between the 1988 and 2002 PDV isolates identified through phylogenetic analysis supported the introduction of a new virus. We previously determined that a PDV isolate from a harbor seal infected during a 2006 outbreak on the US Atlantic coast showed more similarity (99.3% across the genome, to the 1988 isolate, suggesting the possibility of multiple viral lineages circulating in Arctic and Atlantic seal populations [

Atlantic harbor seals were highly susceptible to these three strains of PDV, and suffered large population losses associated with infection [
