<p>A second high-mortality CDV epidemic struck the nearby Ngorongoro Crater lion population in 2001. Serological analyses has indicated that at least five ‘‘silent’’ CDV epidemics swept through the same two lion populations between 1976 and 2006 without clinical signs or measurable mortality [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The high density of the domestic dog population to the west of the Serengeti National Park is thought to have allowed CDV to be maintained as a stable infection in this area. Spill over from this population is considered to have resulted in the infection of animals in the Park [
