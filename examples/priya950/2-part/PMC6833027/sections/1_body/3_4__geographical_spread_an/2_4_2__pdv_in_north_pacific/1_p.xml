 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], posing the question of whether reductions in sea ice believed to be due to global warming could increase contact between arctic and subarctic marine mammals and lead to viral transmission across the Arctic Ocean. We have recently examined this question using serological and PCR data from samples obtained in the NPO between 2001â€“2016; Findings will be reported elsewhere [
