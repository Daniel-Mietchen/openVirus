<p>Four outbreaks of CDV in non-human primates have been reported in the last 30 years. A case of encephalitis in a Japanese macaque (snow monkey) (
 <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>) was reported in 1989, and 22 such monkeys in the same group as the diseased monkey had relatively high titers of neutralizing antibody to CDV. The pattern of the antibody titers to CDV and MV closely resembled that of cynomolgus monkeys experimentally inoculated with CDV [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but probably due to secondary transmission, two to three years later, an outbreak of CDV in hand-feeding Rhesus monkeys (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) was reported in Beijing, with 20 monkeys presenting with respiratory and neurological symptoms. They displayed anorexia, acute fever, thickening of the footpad and facial rashes. Twelve animals died, which suggested a high virulence of this CDV strain for monkeys. Gross pathological examination showed lesions in the lungs consistent with pneumonia, and diffuse hemorrhage in the CNS consistent with distemper infection. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the monkey-adapted CDV belonged to the clade of epidemic CDV types circulating in China [

Forty six monkeys died from severe pneumonia during a quarantine period. Phylogenic analysis also showed that the isolate from this outbreak, CYN07-dV, was closely related to the CDV outbreaks in China, suggesting continuing chains of CDV infection in monkeys [
