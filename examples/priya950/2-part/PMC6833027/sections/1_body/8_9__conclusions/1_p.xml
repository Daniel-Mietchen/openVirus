<p>It is speculated that CDV may have originated by the infection of dogs by MV during human epidemics in the New World. It is generally considered that CDV gave rise to the emergence of PDV in seals and other marine mammals while retaining the ability to cause disease in these species without adaptation being necessary. Both CDV and PDV have spread globally, with CDV crossing into many species, including felines and non-human primates. These species jumps have been facilitated particularly by mutations in the virus H protein at the SLAM receptor binding site. However, no study has identified H protein mutations that contributed to CDV infection to non-human primates, suggesting that they may not be required.</p>
