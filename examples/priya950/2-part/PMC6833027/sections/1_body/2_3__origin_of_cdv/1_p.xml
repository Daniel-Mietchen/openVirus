<p>European dogs were first introduced to the New World by Christopher Columbus (1451â€“1506) in 1493, but epidemics of unusual mortality in either the European or native dog populations did not occur at this time. Widespread epidemic measles in the Americas closely preceded the first descriptions of CDV-like epizootic outbreaks of disease in dogs, suggesting infection of canines by MeV. Dogs were regularly exposed to measles-ridden human flesh from the Native American population in the New World. However, this origin of CDV from MV cannot be proven. The first reliable report of canine distemper was in Ecuador and Peru, and the earliest definitive reports of canine distemper epidemics in Europe occur after the disease was first described in South America.</p>
