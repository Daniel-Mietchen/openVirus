<p>The monkey-derived CDV was also found to use Nectin-4, and so makes use of immune and epithelial receptors of humans, monkey and canines [

It is also speculated that CDV may have previously infected humans, as a CUB analysis carried out of proteins of modern CDV strains revealed that the relative adaptiveness of codon usage is uniformly highest for the human pattern. Retention of the CUB pattern in a new species suggests that the selection pressure to adapt to the new species is low. The significance of the human pattern could also indicate that CDV previously infected humans [
