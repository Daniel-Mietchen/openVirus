<p>This suggests a similar sensitivity to CDV among animals in this group [

 <italic>Felidae</italic> to 
 <italic>Canidae</italic>, several residue differences were identified that ultimately led to electric charge differences in the SLAM interface of feline species [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. CDV strains that are well adapted to bind to dog SLAM receptors may therefore be less adapted to bind to SLAM receptors from non-canine hosts. Changes at these sites were observed in our hyena 1, lion and bat-eared fox isolates, while the earlier isolate, hyena 2, maintained the residues associated with CDV infection in dogs (
