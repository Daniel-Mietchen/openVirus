<p id="JVEv5-para-0126">Predictably, there has been a plethora of articles describing the use of CRISPR/Cas to mutate cccDNA (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). Many of the studies have demonstrated inhibition of HBV replication in cultured cells, but compelling evidence for direct targeting of cccDNA has not always been present. Using CRISPR/Cas technology to inactivate cccDNA following systemic administration of vectors encoding antiviral gene editors may also be complicated by pre-existing immunity to the Cas9 proteins of commensal 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>
 <italic>aureus</italic> bacteria 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">[37,38]</xref>. Because systemic 
 <italic>in</italic>
 <italic>vivo</italic> administration of vectors encoding gene editors is required for HBV therapy, immunity to the Cas9 proteins may attenuate antiviral activity. This problem is not as significant for HIV-1 gene editing approaches that entail 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation.
