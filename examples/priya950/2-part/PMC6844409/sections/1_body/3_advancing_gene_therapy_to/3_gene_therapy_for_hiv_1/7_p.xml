<p id="JVEv5-para-0121">Promising results from preclinical evaluation of using CRSIPR/Cas to target HIV-1 proviral sequences directly, together with ARVs 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, were also presented. The procedure entailed sequential administration of long-acting slow-effective release antiviral therapy (LASER ART) followed by delivery of 
 <italic>LTR</italic>- and 
 <italic>gag</italic>-targeting CRISPR/Cas using recombinant serotype 9 adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs). Proviral sequences appeared to be completely removed from some of the HIV-1-infected humanised mice, as rigorous analysis failed to demonstrate viable HIV-1 in tissue from the animals showing a good response. This observation is important as it provides a proof of principle that gene editing may inactivate HIV-1 reservoirs and augurs well for gene editing as an approach to curing HIV-1 infection.
