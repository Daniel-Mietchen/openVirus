<p id="JVEv5-para-0113">The other options presented were inhibitors of HBsAg release or HBV gene silencers aimed at suppressing HBsAg expression or cccDNA transcription. A ‘shock and degrade’ strategy for HBV cure similar to the ‘shock and kill’ approach in HIV-1 cure strategies is also being explored, although it may be limited by the infection burden in hepatocytes. Agents would be initially used to reactivate the virus and followed by the administration of cytokines and other small molecules to induce degradation of cccDNA and other viral DNA. This has parallels to the approaches under investigation in HIV-1, but will require a thorough assessment as HBV infection in hepatocytes may be substantially higher than in HIV-1 latently infected T cells.</p>
