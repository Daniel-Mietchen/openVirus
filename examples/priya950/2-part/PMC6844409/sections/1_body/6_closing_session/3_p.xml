<p id="JVEv5-para-0196">Targeting the HBV capsid with small molecules called capsid assembly effectors (CAEs) is a promising strategy towards HBV elimination as the capsid is key to several steps of viral replication. These include packaging of pregenomic viral RNA, viral particle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum and maintaining the all-important cccDNA. The CAEs thus potentially disrupt many steps in HBV replication. More than 175 compounds have been synthesised and tested in various models of HBV replication. Lead compounds were selected from those that most effectively inhibited production of markers of HBV replication in cultured cells and led to the identification of GLP-26. Secretion of HBeAg, a surrogate marker for cccDNA function, was also reduced in cultured HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Moreover, a cccDNA decreased concentration confirmed that the compound had an effect on this replication intermediate. Evaluation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that GLP-26 was bioavailable after oral administration with a long half-life. Good efficacy was also demonstrated using the model of HBV-infected immunocompromised mice that had been xenografted with human hepatocytes. Combination with entecavir (ETV) showed synergistic action with delayed viral rebound, ranging from 3 to 9 weeks, following cessation of treatment. These promising results have prompted clinical evaluation, which is anticipated during mid-2020.
