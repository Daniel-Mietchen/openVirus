<p id="JVEv5-para-0100">The loss of HBsAg is currently the best indicator of HBV cure, although this marker may be unreliable for several reasons. First, a patient may eliminate cccDNA but produce HBsAg from integrated viral DNA. Second, HBsAg tests are not sensitive enough to detect trace levels of cccDNA. Finally, despite HBsAg loss, replication may be reactivated from residual cccDNA, if viral immunity is not established or weakened by immunosuppression.</p>
