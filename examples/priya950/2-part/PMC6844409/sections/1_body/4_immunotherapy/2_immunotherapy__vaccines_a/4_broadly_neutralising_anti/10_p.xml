<p id="JVEv5-para-0140">An example of such bNAbs (BilA-SG) was the subject of the talk presented by Dr Mengyue Niu (University of Hong Kong, HK). Previous work of this group has shown that as an engineered tandem bi-specific bNAb, it displayed substantially improved breadth and potency. When administered using an AAV vector, it showed complete viremic control and elimination of infected cells in a humanised murine model 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Dr Niu presented new unpublished data showing that BilA-SG fully protects Chinese rhesus macaques from a lethal dose of SHIV. A single, early therapeutic administration can prevent rapid disease progression and leads to sustained virological control in the presence of strong humoral and CD8 T cellular responses. Although further studies addressing the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and antibody development of this new class of molecules will need to be carried out 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, their performance in human clinical trial settings is awaited with great interest.
