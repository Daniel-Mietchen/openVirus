<p id="JVEv5-para-0148">The generation of a complex repertoire of virus-specific B and T cells with helper or cytotoxic effects during HBV infection is considered of paramount importance and ultimately determines the outcome of infection 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, CHB can be viewed as an immunological disorder 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, which leads to multiple humoral and cellular immunity defects. Dr Maini illustrated how studies have shown that in individuals with CHB a subset of regulatory B cells mediates anti-HBV CD8 T cell response suppression through IL-10 secretion 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Also, although HBsAg-specific B cells have been found to persist in blood and liver, they were found to have defective antibody production in patients with CHB
