<p id="JVEv5-para-0161">Earlier studies on healthy volunteers had demonstrated the safety of the agent at doses ranging up to 12 mg with detectable induction of interferon-stimulated genes at doses above 2 mg 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. The current study enrolled 48 HIV-1 positive individuals who were randomised to receive vesatolimod at escalating doses (peak of 10mg x 3 plus 12mg x 7). There were no grade 3 or above adverse events related to the study drug or drug discontinuations as a result of adverse events. Vesatolimod induced CD69 expression on NK cells along with increases in interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and circulating cytokines (interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10], interferon-inducible T cell-Î± chemoattractant [ITAC], and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]) in some participants at doses above 6 mg. There were no consistent increases in plasma viral load above 20 copies/mL or evidence of changes in HIV-1 RNA by single copy assay or in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA and HIV-1 RNA. Further studies will be necessary to define the reasons for the differences between these results and the NHP studies. The authors reported that ongoing trials are evaluating the efficacy of vesatolimod alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents.
