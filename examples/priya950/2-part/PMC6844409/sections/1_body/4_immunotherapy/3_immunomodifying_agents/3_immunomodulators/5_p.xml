<p id="JVEv5-para-0159">The features of immune dysfunction in CHB provide distinct challenges. Dr Garg from Gilead Sciences offered a broad overview of challenges facing immunomodulatory therapy. Specifically, current treatments block viral replication in CHB but do not inhibit HBV surface antigen production. As discussed elsewhere in this article, numerous features of the immune response are dysfunctional in CHB with a low frequency of antigen specific T cells, high rate of exhaustion of HBV-specific T cell responses and dysfunctional B cell responses. Some of these features are likely to be directly linked to chronic exposure to high antigen levels and specific tolerogenic liver environment 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0075" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. While ImmTAV offers one type of approach to addressing these issues, another possibility to consider is immunomodulation directed at boosting endogenous responses. In order to do so, Dr. Garg presented data on the use of an agonist of the innate immune sensor, TLR8. This immune sensor has a broad distribution of expression and is found in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and regulatory T cells. Stimulation induces IL-12p70 but not IFNγ and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies shows induction of IFNγ, reduced PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells and lower levels of regulatory T cells. These observations suggest a profile of increased effector capacity in response to TLR8 activation. Small animal models are limited as TLR8 is nonfunctional in mice and rats, but testing in the woodchuck hepatitis model achieved lower levels of HBV surface antigen associated with IL-12 induction, without a type-1 IFN response. Direct TLR stimulation to enhance immune responses has also targeted TLR7 in the past. Data at the meeting supported this approach in HIV-1 cure efforts.
