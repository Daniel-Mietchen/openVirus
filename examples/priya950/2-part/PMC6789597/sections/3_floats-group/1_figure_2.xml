  <p>Zika virus life cycle. ZIKV, an enveloped RNA virus, enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuses its membranes by an acidic-pH-triggered mechanism in the endosome (via cell surface receptors such as AXL, Tyro3, DC-SIGN and TIM-1) to release the viral RNA. The ssRNA is then translated, and the resulting polyprotein is further cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins (C, prM, E and NS proteins). Replication takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface. Transcription and replication of the dsDNA results in the formation of new viral mRNA and ssRNA, respectively. Virus assembly takes place in the ER membrane and leads to the formation of immature virions, which are transported through the exocytic pathway. The prM protein is cleaved and the virus is rendered mature. Finally, the mature virus exits the cell via exocytosis.</p>
