<p>The replicative cycle of ZIKV is similar to other known flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00101-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Briefly, the E proteins are involved in the attachment of the virus to receptors on the host membrane, then the virus is internalized via endocytosis [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] mediated by a clathrin protein in a low pH environment. Several cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor AXL, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, and TIM-1, facilitate ZIKV viral entry [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The viral genome is released into the host cytoplasm where it is translated, and the resulting polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved into various proteins, the structural and non-structural proteins (C, prM, E and NS proteins) as mentioned above [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The newly-synthetized (+) RNAs can be either recruited for further rounds of translation/replication or incorporated into the virions, which also initiates their assembly on ER membranes. Assembled virions enter and then travel through the secretory pathway, undergoing maturation along the way, until their final release into the extracellular space.
