 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] enzymatic activities. NS3 is well conserved among the Flaviviruses, with amino acid sequence identity of about 65% between ZIKV, WNV, JEV, and YFV. The NS3 protein contains two domains, an N-terminal protease domain and a C-terminal helicase domain, which are connected via a short linker. Due to the multiple roles played by the NS3 protein in virus life cycle, this protein is an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. NS5 encodes methyl- and guanylyltransferase (MTase and GTase) enzymatic activities as well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, 2K, and NS4B are transmembrane proteins located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some regions of NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B also interact with NS3 and thus anchor the replication complex formed by NS3 and NS5 to the ER membrane [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, NS2B serves as an essential cofactor for the NS3 protease and NS4B blocks interferon α/β signaling [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. NS4A induces ER membrane rearrangements that are involved in forming the viral replication compartments [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] while NS1 is thought to be involved in genome replication by associating with the luminal side of replication compartment and immune evasion through modulation of host defense mechanism [
