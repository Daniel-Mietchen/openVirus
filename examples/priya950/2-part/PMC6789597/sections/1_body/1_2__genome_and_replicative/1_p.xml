<p>The genome of ZIKV (strain MR 766) comprises a 10.8-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule that contains approximately a 100-nucleotide 5’ untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF) of 10 kb, and approximately 420 nucleotides in the 3’ UTR (

The ORF codes for a large polyprotein precursor of 3423 amino acids that is later co- and post-translationally cleaved into three structural (C, prM, and E) and eight nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, S4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) proteins (
