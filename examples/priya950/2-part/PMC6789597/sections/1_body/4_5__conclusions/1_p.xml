<p>In the last few years, researchers have invested efforts in the development of a vaccine and antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infections. However, there is still no approved vaccine or drug available for this emerging pathogen. Different approaches and methodologies have been used, from testing specific drugs with known antiviral activity for other viruses, to testing libraries composed of hundreds or thousands of bioactive compounds that have already gone through several steps of drug approval by regulatory agencies (repurposing drugs). Most antiviral candidates have been evaluated in vitro and some of them have also been tested in animal models. However, few candidates have advanced into clinical trials. Further development of novel compounds as well as combination therapies may open new avenues for the treatment of ZIKV-related diseases. </p>
