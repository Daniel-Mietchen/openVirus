 <xref rid="B100-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This drug has shown antiviral activity against several viruses, through the inhibition of pH-dependent steps of viral replication, including anti-ZIKV activity in Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), and human neural stem cells (NSCs) with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 9.82, 14.2, and 12.36 Î¼M, respectively. In addition, chloroquine was able to partially reverse morphological changes induced by ZIKV in mouse neurospheres [
