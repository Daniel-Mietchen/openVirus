<p>Retallack et al. performed the screening of 2177 clinically approved compounds by monitoring inhibition of virus-dependent cell death at 72 h post-infection (hpi) in Vero cells. The screening identified several compounds that rescued cell viability, including antibiotics and inhibitors of nucleotide and protein synthesis with many that showed toxicity in Vero or U87 cells or were contraindicated during pregnancy. However, they identified the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, which rescued ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect in glial cells with low toxicity and reduced ZIKV infection of U87 cells at an EC
