<p>Studies from Costa et al. showed that ZIKV has tropism for the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates preferentially in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and ophthalmologic disorders [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Neurodegeneration in ZIKV disease possibly occurs due to the excitotoxicity of glutamate. FDA-approved 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonistic drugs to treat Alzheimer disease such as memantine, MK-801, agmatine, and ifenprodil were found to prevent neuronal cell death caused by ZIKV under in vitro conditions without reducing viral titers [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Blocking hyperactivation of NMDAR would therefore reduce rates of Zika virus-induced cell death and help ameliorate neuronal symptoms during infection. Costa et al. showed that memantine was very effective at preventing ZIKV-induced neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration in IFN-α/βR
 <sup>−/−</sup>mice [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Importantly, memantine is also listed in pregnancy category B drugs by the FDA. Therefore, it could be used safely to reduce neurological complications associated with ZIKV infection.
