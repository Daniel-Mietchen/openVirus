<p>The prodrug sofosbuvir is a nucleoside analog that is a RdRp inhibitor commercially available for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The sofosbuvir phosphoramidate prodrug is converted to its triphosphate analog in the cellular environment to become active. The active metabolite, 2’-fluoro-2-C-methyl-UTP, binds to the active site of NS5 [

 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.4–5 μM as well as in human fetal-derived hindbrain and cerebral cortex neuronal stem cells (NSCs) with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of about 32 μM [

 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, it did not exhibit anti-ZIKV inhibitory activity in Vero cells. Therefore, the inhibitory activity of sofosbuvir varied among different cell types [

 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] suggesting that, besides its inhibitory effect, the drug also increases the incorporation of mutations in the viral genome, increasing error-prone replication [

 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], therapeutic oral administration of sofosbuvir with a physiologically relevant dose of 33 mg/kg/day for seven days, protected the animals against ZIKV-induced weight loss and death in 50% of the treated mice. However, higher concentrations of the drug were not effective and resulted in toxicity [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Importantly, in clinical phase II and III studies, sofosbuvir was found to be clinically safe and efficacious in patients treated for HCV infection [
