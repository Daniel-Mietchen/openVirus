<p>NS3 helicases display adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activities. NS3 inhibitors can be used to impede ZIKV infection. Suramin, an anti-parasitic drug used to treat trypanosomal human sleeping sickness, is available for prophylactic and therapeutic use in children. This drug was also shown to inhibit multiple DNA and RNA viruses including DENV, herpes simplex virus type 1, cytomegaloviruses human hepatitis B, hepatitis D, hepatitis C, bunyaviruses, enterovirus 71, and others [

 <sub>50</sub> of 39.8 Î¼M, by interfering with viral attachment and the release of infectious progeny from ZIKV-infected cells [

When treatment was initiated post-entry, viral RNA synthesis was unaffected but both the release of genomes and the infectivity of ZIKV were reduced, suggesting that this drug also affects virus biogenesis probably by interfering with glycosylation and maturation of ZIKV during traffic through the secretory pathway [
