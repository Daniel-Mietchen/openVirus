<p>Virus-directed drugs are those acting against the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NS5) catalytic domain, including nucleoside analogs and polymerase inhibitors. They target the methyltransferase catalytic domain of the NS5, responsible for transferring the mRNA cap; the NS2B-NS3 trypsin-like serine protease needed for proper processing of the viral polyprotein; and the NS3 helicase.</p>
