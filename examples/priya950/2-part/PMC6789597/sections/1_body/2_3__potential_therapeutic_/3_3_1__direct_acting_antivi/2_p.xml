<p>Nucleoside analogs/derivates, which target viral (not cellular polymerases) to terminate viral RNA replication after incorporation into the viral nascent RNA chain, are safe for use in humans [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], because virus-encoded gene products required for RNA replication can significantly differ in substrate specificity from RNA polymerases involved in host cell replication. Consequently, they have been extensively evaluated against ZIKV in cell culture and in animal models. Eyer et al. tested 29 nucleoside analogues at a concentration of 50 µM for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects (CPE) of ZIKV on Vero cells. They found that five of these compounds (7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine (7-deaza-2-CMA), 2’-C-methyladenosine (2-CMA), 2’-C-methylcythydine (2-CMC), 2’-C-methylguanisine (2-CMG), and 2’-C-methyluridine (2-CMU), significantly reduced cell death compared to non-treated ZIKV infected cells with 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 5.3 to 45.5 µM [

 <sub>50</sub> = 9.6 µM), decreasing viremia and delaying morbidity and mortality of ZIKV-infected AG129 (interferon (IFN)-α/β and IFN-γ receptor knockout) mice treated once a day with 50 mg/kg/day of the drug [

 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], this compound could still be suitable and safe for short-term therapy of acute flaviviral diseases, including WNV [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and thus represents one of the most promising candidates for the treatment of flaviviral infections to date. Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide), originally known as T-705, is a novel antiviral compound that selectively and potently inhibits the RdRp of flavi-, orthomyxo-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, calici-, noro-viruses, and other RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of the interaction of favipiravir with the RdRp molecule has not been fully elucidated, it is hypothesized that favipiravir may be misincorporated in a nascent viral RNA, or it may act by binding to conserved polymerase domains, thus preventing incorporation of nucleotides for viral RNA replication and transcription. Our group and others have demonstrated the ability of favipiravir to inhibit several geographically and temporally different ZIKV strains in in vitro assays [

 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The genetic barrier of resistance against favipiravir has been shown to be high for several viruses. In clinical trials of healthy volunteers and in influenza virus-infected patients, favipiravir has been well tolerated. However, caution is needed because of the teratogenic risks of this molecule [
