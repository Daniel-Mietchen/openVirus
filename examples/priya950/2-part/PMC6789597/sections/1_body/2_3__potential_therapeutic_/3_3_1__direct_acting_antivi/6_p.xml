<p>The methyltransferase catalytic domain of the NS5 is responsible for capping the 5’ end of viral genomic RNA. The metal binding pocket of RdRp and SAH/SAM (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine/S-adenosyl-L-methionine) binding pocket of MTase are classically used in drug screening. Our group has performed virtual screening with a library of 28,341 compounds using a hydrophobic site close to the SAM pocket and identified 10 candidates showing decisive contacts with the MTase. Plaque reduction assay revealed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 4.8–17.6 µM. However, their in vivo efficacy has not yet been evaluated [
