<p>Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are crucial for the innate immune response against viruses and other pathogens. DCs express high levels of PRRs, which allows them to efficiently sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon sensing, DCs get activated and efficiently produce proinflammatory cytokines, IFNs, and chemokines, inducing an antiviral response in neighboring cells. Also, since they are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they can process the antigens and present them by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to the T cells, inducing the initiation of long-term adaptive immunity. We have previously shown that the NS1 protein from IAV counteracts the production of type I IFN and the activation of human DCs (

Due to the intrinsic variability of the NS1 proteins among different strains, we hypothesized that the modulation of the innate immune responses in DCs by NS1 during IAV infection is strain specific. Using recombinant IAVs expressing NS1 proteins of different origins (human or avian IAV) in an isogenic backbone, we found that infection with viruses expressing NS1 from a human or avian IAV results in different patterns of innate immune responses and expression of viral mRNA in DCs and in human primary epithelial cells. Furthermore, imaging flow cytometry experiments suggest that these differences could be associated with differential cellular localization dynamics of the NS1 proteins from different hosts.
