<p>Viruses need to evade innate immunity in order to successfully replicate, establish infection, and ultimately be transmitted to other hosts. The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV is a multifunctional protein able to antagonize host immune responses. It is highly expressed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected cells and interacts with many cellular and viral proteins counteracting cellular defenses, especially the IFN responses of the host (

NS1 has two distinct functional domains: an N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD) (residues 1 to 73) and a C-terminal effector domain (ED) (from residue 85 to the end), separated by a short linker region. The last amino acids (from residue 207 to the end) form a disordered and flexible tail, which is one of the most variable regions among different NS1 proteins (
