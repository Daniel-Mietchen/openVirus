<p>The successful recovery from viral infection largely depends on efficient activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The activation of the innate immune response, especially interferon (IFN) responses, is an important mechanism for controlling virus replication and represents an early barrier against viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV). Mammalian cells have developed sophisticated antiviral mechanisms based on sensing viral products and triggering of signaling cascades leading to secretion of type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β), type III IFN (IFN-λs), and proinflammatory cytokines that inhibit viral replication and contribute to the initiation of more specific adaptive immune responses (
