<p>Another major function of NS1 is to block activation of protein kinase R (PKR) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), a critical component of the cellular antiviral system. It has been shown that the inhibition of PKR activation by Udorn NS1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> requires a specific amino acid sequence between positions 123 and 127 of the NS1 since mutants with alanine residues at positions 123 and 124 or at positions 126 and 127 fail in this inhibition (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In our selected NS1 proteins, amino acids at residue 127 are different between hNS1 and aNS1, which could potentially result in differences in their abilities to block PKR activation.
