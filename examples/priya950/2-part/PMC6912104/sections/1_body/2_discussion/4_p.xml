<p>The alignment of the eight different NS1 proteins used in this study allowed the identification of residues that might be involved in the different innate immune responses. We identified amino acids at the following positions: 21, 22, 59, 70, and 71 in the RNA-binding domain; 95, 112, 114, 118, 127, 196, and 198 in the effector domain; and 207, 209, 212, and 215 in the C terminus or tail. Differences in specific amino acids can have implications during infection. For example, some amino acids can modify the structure of NS1, which could impact the interactions of the NS1 protein with other proteins. In our selected viruses only avian NS1 proteins (with the exception of the allele B) have an R in position 59. It is known that this amino acid is involved together with Q63 of the RNA binding domain and G168 and T170 of the effector domain in the formation of a hydrogen bond that interconnects the two domains, which stabilize the structure (

In addition to these four amino acids, the residue composition at position 71 (that is also different between hNS1 and aNS1) gives a different degree of flexibility/plasticity to the NS1 dimer, a fact that could influence the interactions of NS1 with some other proteins (
