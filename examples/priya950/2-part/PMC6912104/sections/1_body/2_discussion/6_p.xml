<p>A report by Kuo and collaborators (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) demonstrated that a variation at amino acid position 196 (K or E) of the NS1 protein determines its ability to block the activation of IRF3 and IFN-β transcription. Specifically, the investigators observed that NS1 proteins from H3N2, H2N2, and some H1N1 IAVs do not block the activation of IRF3 or IFN-β transcription and that all contained a K196 residue, whereas the NS1 proteins from H5N1 and some H1N1 viruses, that are able to block these activations, contained E196 instead. Our results concur with this observation since H1N1 (with the exception of A/California/07/2009) and H3N2 viruses bearing hNS1 have K at position 196 and induce higher levels of expression of IFN mRNAs during DC infection than H5N1, H7N2, and H7N9 aNS1-bearing viruses, which have an E at position 196 (
