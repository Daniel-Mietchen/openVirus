<p>The IAV NS1 protein is a multifunctional protein capable of inhibiting innate immune responses to IAV infection, and this inhibition is needed in order for the virus to successfully spread in the infected organs and eventually get transmitted to new hosts (

As NS1 proteins are highly variable among different strains, we hypothesized that there is a strain-specific effect of NS1 in the modulation of the innate immune responses in human primary cells during IAV infection. Human infections by avian IAV often result in severe disease, characterized by high levels of cytokines and increased immunopathology (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The high virulence of avian IAV in humans involves multiple factors, including the NS1 protein (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Interestingly, we found that infection of human DCs and NHBE cells with viruses expressing NS1 from human or avian IAV results in different patterns of innate immune responses. These data suggest that avian influenza viruses might be more efficient at antagonizing innate immune responses in human primary cells since infection with aNS1-bearing viruses induced lower levels of type I and III IFNs than infection with hNS1-bearing viruses, supporting the hypothesis that intrinsic characteristics of the avian NS1 proteins contribute to the increased virulence of avian IAV in humans.
