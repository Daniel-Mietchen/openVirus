<p>Since it has been suggested that subcellular trafficking of NS1 is a determinant of host adaptation (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), we also evaluated the cellular localization dynamics for these different NS1 proteins in human DCs during the infection. We found that viruses bearing hNS1 have different localization kinetics from viruses with aNS1. Specifically, hNS1 exits from the nucleus at a higher rate than aNS1. Multiple NS1 functions occur in the nucleus and cytoplasm during influenza infection (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>); therefore, its intracellular localization dynamics need to be highly regulated (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Given these results, we propose that there is an association between the differential immune phenotype observed in human DCs, the intracellular localization dynamics of NS1, and the expression of M1. Previous studies have reported that NS1 can bind M1 mRNA and regulate M1 mRNA splicing (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).
