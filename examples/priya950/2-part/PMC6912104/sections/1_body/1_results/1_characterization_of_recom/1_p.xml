<p>To assess the impact of the expression of the NS1 from different strains on the innate immune responses induced by IAV in human DCs, we used a panel of recombinant viruses expressing different NS1 proteins in the same backbone (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, or PR8) (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Recombinant viruses were engineered to express the NS1 and nuclear export protein (NEP) from two different, nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) to ensure that there were no changes in NEP (see the Materials and Methods section). The criteria for the selection of the NS1 proteins were the following: (i) host (human or avian), (ii) subtype of IAV (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, or H7N2), (iii) ability to interact with CPSF30, therefore inhibiting mRNA maturation of host RNA, and (iv) allele A or B (
