<p>In summary, we found that the different NS1 proteins expressed in the same backbone virus (PR8) present clear differences in their dynamics of cellular localization in infected DCs depending on their host origin. Specifically, NS1 proteins from human IAVs are mobilized faster from the nucleus to the cytoplasm than NS1 proteins from avian viruses. Given that NS1 has multiple and different functions in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, the different immune response profiles found between hNS1 and aNS1 are likely associated with these distinct localization pattern kinetics (
