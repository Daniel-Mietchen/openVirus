<p>To identify sequence variations that could account for the different innate immune profiles induced by viruses expressing hNS1 or aNS1, we performed an alignment of the eight NS1 amino acid sequences and searched for amino acids differentially conserved between both groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Specifically, we considered residues (i) that are conserved in at least three of the four NS1 proteins within each group and (ii) that were different between the two groups. We observed that in the C-terminal region there were few positions (positions 196, 198, 207, 209, and 215) with striking differences between aNS1 and hNS1, which could affect the nuclear localization sequence NLS2. Because NS1 exerts multiple functions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, the cellular localization of this protein could have important consequences during infection. Previous studies have shown that NS1 is early localized predominantly in the nucleus and that it is translocated into the cytoplasm at late stages of infection. These intracellular localization patterns vary depending on virus strain, expression levels of NS1, cell type, cell polarity, and time postinfection (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Therefore, we next hypothesized that hNS1 and aNS1 could have different nuclear localization dynamics, which could be associated with the differential innate immune responses induced during infection. To address this, we analyzed the localization dynamics of NS1 for our eight different NS1-expressing recombinant viruses during infection in DCs using imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream Mark II; Amnis). Cells were infected during 6, 9, and 12 h, fixed, and stained for NS1 and M1/M2 proteins and with DRAQ5 for nuclear staining. Infected cells were selected for subsequent analysis by gating in M1/M2-expressing cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>). Then, a nuclear localization score for NS1 was calculated based on the colocalization of NS1 expression and nuclear signal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Based on this score, we determined the percentage of cells with a predominantly nuclear signal (highly nuclear) and the percentage of cells with a predominantly cytoplasmic signal (highly cytoplasmic) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>) for samples infected with each of the viruses. As expected, we found a decrease in the nuclear localization over time for all of the NS1 proteins. However, the dynamics of this reduction in nuclear localization were clearly different between hNS1 and aNS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D</xref>). hNS1 localization was readily reduced at 9 h, while the decay in the case of aNS1 was more pronounced from 9 to 12 hpi. When we grouped hNS1 and aNS1 for comparison, we found a significantly higher number of cells with nuclear localization in aNS1 by 9 hpi than in hNS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9E</xref>) as a consequence of their different dynamics. We also evaluated the percentage of cells with higher cytoplasmic localization. Similarly, these data indicated that hNS1 was translocated to the cytoplasm earlier than aNS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9F</xref>), which resulted in a higher number of cells expressing NS1 in the cytoplasm by 9 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9G</xref>). Consistently, when we compared the rate of export to the cytoplasm during the two different time intervals, we found significantly faster and earlier kinetics for hNS1 from 6 hpi to 9 hpi, while aNS1 showed a faster decrease in the following time period, from 9 to 12 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9H</xref>).
