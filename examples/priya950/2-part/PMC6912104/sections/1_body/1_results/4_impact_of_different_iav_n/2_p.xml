<p>We infected the apical surface of the NHBE cells with our eight different IAV recombinant viruses at an MOI of 0.2. At 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi, samples were collected to analyze the innate immune profile (by qRT-PCR in cell lysates and cytokine release to the medium in the bottom chamber by multiplex ELISA) and the viral replication kinetics (washes from the apical chamber by plaque assay) (
