<p>We also analyzed by qRT-PCR the expression of two chemokines, IP-10 and RANTES (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), which showed a similar expression pattern, with increased levels in cells infected with viruses expressing hNS1 over levels in those expressing aNS1. This pattern was also observed in the levels of IP-10 measured by multiplex ELISA at 48 hpi. In line with the data in DCs, for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-Î±, levels of expression were independent of the virus used to infect the NHBE cells (
