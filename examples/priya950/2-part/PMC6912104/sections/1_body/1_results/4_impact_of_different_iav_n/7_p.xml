<p>Altogether, we found that recombinant IAVs expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian IAV origin induced a differential immune response in both DCs and in NHBE cells. The immune response was characterized by higher levels of expression of IFNs and ISGs in cells infected with hNS1-bearing viruses than in aNS1-bearing viruses. In addition, in infected NHBE cells, higher levels of viral mRNAs were detected after infection with hNS1-bearing viruses than with aNS1-bearing viruses although these differences did not result in increased viral particle release.</p>
