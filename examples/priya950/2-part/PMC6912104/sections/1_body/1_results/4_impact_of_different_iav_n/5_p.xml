<p>NHBE cells produce human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease that allows IAV multicycle replication, with the consequent release of new viral particles from the apical side of the cells (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, all viruses have the ability to perform multicycle replication in NHBE cells, but no major differences were observed across viruses.
