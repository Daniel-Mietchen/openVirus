<p>To study the innate immune responses induced by our panel of recombinant viruses and their replication in respiratory epithelial cells, we used differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell cultures. These cells form a polarized pseudostratified epithelium with different epithelial cell types when cultured in an air-liquid interface, which recapitulates the respiratory physiological environment (
