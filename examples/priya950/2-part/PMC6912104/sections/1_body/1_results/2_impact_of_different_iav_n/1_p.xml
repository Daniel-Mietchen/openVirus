<p>We along with others have previously shown that IAV can infect human DCs and that the NS1 can counteract the innate immune response in those cells (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). As mentioned above, not all NS1 proteins have the same functions present. Therefore, we hypothesized that infection with IAV expressing NS1 proteins from different strains might result in distinct innate immune profiles in human DCs. DCs were infected with the different recombinant viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 6 and 12 h postinfection (hpi), supernatants and cells were collected to analyze their innate immune profile by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, DCs infected by recombinant viruses with human NS1 (hNS1; H1N1 and H3N2 isolates) showed higher levels of type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ1) IFNs than those expressing avian NS1 proteins (aNS1; H5N1, H7N9, and H7N2 isolates) in the supernatants of infected cells at 12 hpi. Similar results were observed when we analyzed the expression of type I and III IFNs by qRT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, A/California/07/2009 virus induced higher levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ1 to IFN-λ3 than the rest of the human NS1-bearing viruses, as determined by qRT-PCR at 12 hpi, a finding which might be associated with the lack of the CPSF30 binding function. However, these differences were not detected at the protein level in the supernatants. Among the different IFNs measured in these experiments, we found that IFN-λ1 showed the most robust expression in DCs.
