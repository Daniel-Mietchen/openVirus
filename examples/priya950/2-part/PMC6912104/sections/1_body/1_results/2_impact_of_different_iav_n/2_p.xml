<p>We also analyzed the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β, three proinflammatory cytokines associated with DC activation under NF-κB transcription factor regulation (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Similar levels of IL-6 were detected in the supernatant of DCs infected with the different viruses as determined by multiplex ELISA at 12 hpi (

In the case of TNF-α and IL-1β, we observed that cells infected with hNS1-expressing viruses tended to produce higher levels than those infected by aNS1-expressing viruses. However, this differential pattern between hNS1 and aNS1 was not detected at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR at either 6 or 12 hpi (
