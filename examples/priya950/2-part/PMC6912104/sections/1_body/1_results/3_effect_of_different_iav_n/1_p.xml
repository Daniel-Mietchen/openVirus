<p>During infection, viral RNA detection by sensors such as RIG-I or Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) results in the induction of type I or type III IFNs as well as of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, to study whether the differences in the induction of the IFN response are explained by differences in levels of intracellular replication, we measured the levels of nucleoprotein (NP) viral RNA (vRNA) by qRT-PCR specifically for the negative RNA strand of the segment in DCs after infection with our panel of recombinant viruses. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, no significant differences were found at 6 hpi among the different viruses. At 12 hpi, A/Udorn/1972 showed statistically significant higher levels of replication than the rest of the viruses. Despite the fact that the differences among the remaining seven viruses are not statistically significant, viruses with hNS1 tended to show slightly higher levels of intracellular replication than viruses with aNS1. For a better understanding of the relationship between intracellular viral replication and IFN induction, we performed a correlation analysis of these variables. A low level of correlation was observed globally between vRNA levels and IFN-α, IFN-β, or IFN-λ1, as indicated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficients (

We also studied the vRNA-IFN correlation in detail for the separate viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Using this method, we still did not find statistically significant correlations, with the exception of A/California/07/2009 for IFN-λ1 or A/Udorn/1972 for IFN-α and IFN-β at 12 hpi. Remarkably, at 6 h we found an interesting and distinct negative trend between vRNA and all of the IFNs for hNS1-bearing viruses, while a positive trend was observed for aNS1-expressing viruses, suggesting that hNS1 and aNS1 could be affecting this relationship differently.
