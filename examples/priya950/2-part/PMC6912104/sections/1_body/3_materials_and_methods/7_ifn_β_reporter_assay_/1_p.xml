<p>293T cells in 24-well plates were cotransfected using TransIT-Lt1 transfection reagent (Mirus), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with 50 ng of IFN-β promoter expressing a firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) reporter plasmid (p125-FFLuc), 25 ng of 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Ren-Luc) expression plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega), and 1, 5, or 25 ng of each pDZ-NS1 plasmid. Total plasmid DNA was kept constant with an empty expression vector. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with a defective interfering (DI) particle-rich stock of Sendai virus (SeV) for 16 h to stimulate the IFN-β promoter activity.
