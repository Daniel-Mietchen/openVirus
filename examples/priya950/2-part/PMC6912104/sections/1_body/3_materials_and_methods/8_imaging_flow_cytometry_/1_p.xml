<p>Human infected DCs were fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science) for 10 min at 37°C, permeabilized with methanol (Sigma) for 10 min at 4°C, washed in PBS, and stained with mouse anti-M1/2 E10 PR8, rabbit anti-1-73NS1TX/98 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and DRAQ5 (Biostatus Limited) to label nuclei. Antibodies were conjugated with a Zenon antibody labeling kit to Alexa Fluor 405 (AF405) and AF488, (Z-25103 and Z-25302, respectively; Thermo Fisher Scientific) before staining. Following staining, single-cell images of each cell were acquired at a magnification of ×60 on an ImageStream Mark II flow cytometer (Amnis; EMD Millipore) and analyzed with IDEAS analysis software. Single-color controls were used for the creation of a compensation matrix that was applied to all files to correct for spectral cross talk. The “bright detail similarity” (BDS) feature of IDEAS was then used for measurement of the spatial correlation between the fluorescent signal emanating from Alexa Fluor 488-labeled NS1 and that of the nucleus and to obtain an NS1 nuclear localization score. The BDS score is the log-transformed Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the localized bright spots with a radius of three pixels or less within the masked area in the two input images (BDS score = ln[(1 + ρ)(1 − ρ)]). The higher the BDS score is, the higher is the level of colocalization. BDS scores of &gt;0 were considered highly nuclear (
