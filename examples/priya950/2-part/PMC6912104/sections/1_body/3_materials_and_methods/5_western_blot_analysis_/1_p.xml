<p>At 6 and 12 hpi cells were lysed using 6 M urea buffer, and the total protein concentration was evaluated using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The same amount of protein per sample was run using Laemmli loading buffer (Bio-Rad) in 4% to 20% SDS-polyacrylamide MiniPROTEAN TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) (PBS-T) containing 5% fat-free milk, washed 3 times with PBS-T, and incubated overnight (ON) at 4°C with the following antibodies diluted in PBS-T–5% fat-free milk: rabbit anti-PB2 (GTX125926; Genetex), rabbit anti-NP (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), rabbit anti-1-73NS1TX/98 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The blots were washed and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG, or donkey anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare). Antibody-protein complexes were detected using a Western Lighting chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific).
