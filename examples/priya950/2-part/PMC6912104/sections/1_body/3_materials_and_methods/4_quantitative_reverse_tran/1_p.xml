<p>RNA from DCs and NHBE cells was extracted using an Agencourt RNAdvance Cell kit (version 2; Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For infected DCs, expression of cellular and viral genes was quantified using iScript reverse transcription supermix (Bio-Rad) with oligo(dT) primers for the RT step and iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad) for the qPCR step, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR set up conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10s and 60°C for 30s, followed by a melting curve. We used RPS11 as a housekeeping gene, and primers (forward and reverse) used for the quantification of the expression of each gene are summarized in

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All the reactions were performed in duplicates. The efficiencies of the primers were approximately 100%. For vRNA detection, we used specific primers for the negative strand of NP according to a previously described method, with some modifications (

Briefly, cDNA was obtained using a SuperScript IV first-strand synthesis system (Life Technologies) and a primer complementary to the negative strand of IAV with a non-IAV specific tail (5′-GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAATATCGGAACTTCTGGAGGGGT-3′). PCR was carried out using iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad), and the following primers for detection: 5′-GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAAT-3′ (forward; with the same sequence that the tail added during the RT reaction to improve specificity) and 5′-CTCAATATGAGTGCAGACCGTGCT-3′ (reverse) for vRNA. The relative mRNA expression level was calculated by the Δ
