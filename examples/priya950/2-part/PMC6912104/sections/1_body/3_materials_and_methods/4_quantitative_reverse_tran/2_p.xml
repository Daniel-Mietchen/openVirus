<p>To measure gene expression levels in NHBE cells, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with AffinityScript Multi-Temp RT (Agilent Technologies). PCR Platinum Taq DNA polymerase and a buffer containing SYBR green (Life Technologies) were used for the PCR, which was performed in a thermocycler (ABI7900HT; Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping genes RPS11, TUBA1B, and ACTB were used as internal controls. All samples were run in triplicates and normalized to the median

  <sub>T</sub>
