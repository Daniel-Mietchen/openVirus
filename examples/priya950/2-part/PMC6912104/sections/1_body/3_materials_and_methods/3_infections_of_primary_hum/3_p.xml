<p>For NHBE cells, cells were washed 10 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to infection in order to remove mucins. An MOI of 0.2 was used, and the virus inoculum was prepared in PBS. After 45 min, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed one more time with PBS, and the PBS was removed so that the infection progressed in an air-liquid interphase. At the time points specified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, 200 μl of PBS was added over the infected cells and removed after a 15-min incubation at 37°C for subsequent replication assessment by plaque assay. Cells were lysed and kept at −80°C for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis; also medium from the bottom chamber was collected and kept at −20°C to perform multiplex ELISAs. All of the NHBE cell infections were done in triplicates.
