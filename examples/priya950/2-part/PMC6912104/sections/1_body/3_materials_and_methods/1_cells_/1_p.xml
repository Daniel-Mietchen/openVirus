<p>Human primary DCs were generated from CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells isolated from buffy coats of healthy human donors (New York Blood Center) as described previously (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque; Sigma-Aldrich), and CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells were purified using CD14 antibody-labeled magnetic beads and iron-based MiniMACS liquid separation columns (Miltenyi Biotech). CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells were cultured at a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml for 5 days at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen) (Complete DC medium) and were supplemented with 500 U/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) and 1,000 U/ml human interleukin-4 (hIL-4) (PeproTech).
