<p>Primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were sourced from Lonza (NHBE CC-2540s; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM; Lonza, Walkersville MD) for an initial propagation. Cells were seeded at ∼500,000 cells/T75 flask and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Once cells reached 70 to 80% confluence, they were dissociated and subcultured again by seeding 3,500 cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> into T75 flasks. Once cells had reached 70 to 80% confluence, they were dissociated and seeded on 12-mm Transwells (Corning, Fisher Scientific) coated with 0.3 mg/ml collagen I from rat tail (Corning, Fisher Scientific). NHBE cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/Transwell, and Gray’s medium was used to feed cells during 4 to 5 days or until 100% confluence was reached. When cells reached confluence, the apical medium was removed, and the basal medium was replaced with Gray’s medium supplement with retinoic acid (Sigma) for a final concentration of 15 ng/ml. Medium was changed every second day. NHBE cells were grown for 5 weeks, air lifted (37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>), until they fully differentiated in a polarized pseudostratified epithelium.
