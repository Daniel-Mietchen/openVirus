<p>Recombinant IAVs were generated by reverse genetics techniques as previously described (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Briefly, these viruses were rescued in the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) background and contain a modified split NS segment where the splice acceptor site of NS1 has been mutated, thus allowing in-frame transcription of both NS1 and NEP transcripts (
