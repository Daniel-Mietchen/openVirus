<p>Viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (SPAFAS; Charles River Laboratories) and were titrated by plaque assay on MDCK cells by following standard procedures. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed with same amount of each virus calculated by the plaque assay titer in order to avoid some misleading titrations. Results from both assays showed equal virus amounts for all preparations.</p>
