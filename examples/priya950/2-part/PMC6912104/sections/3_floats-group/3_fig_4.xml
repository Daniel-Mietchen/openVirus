  <p>Characterization of recombinant IAVs expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian viruses in primary human DCs. (A) Expression of vRNA levels for NP at 6 and 12 hpi by qRT-PCR. (B) Analysis of the correlation between levels of intracellular vRNA and IFN induction across all the samples from 5 donors (individual viruses are indicated with differently colored data points). The blue line indicates the linear regression model fit to the observed data, and the shadow indicates the 95% confidence interval for predictions from that linear model. Pearson’s coefficient (
   <italic>r</italic>) and the 
   <italic>P</italic> value for the correlation (
   <italic>P</italic>) are shown in each plot. (C) Heat maps showing the correlation between vRNA levels and IFN induction for samples from different infected donors. Color scale indicates the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (
   <italic>r</italic>), and labels in the heat map cells indicate the 
   <italic>P</italic> value for that correlation. (D) Analysis of the expression of mRNA levels for NP, M1, HA, and NEP at 6 and 12 hpi by qRT-PCR. (E) Expression of viral PB2, NP, and NS1 protein levels and β-actin in infected DCs at 6 and 12 hpi by Western blotting of samples from one representative donor of three independent experiments with different donors. (F) MFIs for NS1 proteins in infected DCs at 6 and 12 hpi are shown. Bars represent means ± standard deviations of four different donors. Statistical significance (A, D, and F) was determined using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are as indicated follows: ****, &lt;0.0001; ***, &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
