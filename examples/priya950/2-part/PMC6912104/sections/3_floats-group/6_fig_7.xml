  <p>Characterization of recombinant IAVs expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian viruses in primary NHBE cells. (A) Analysis of multicycle replication kinetics of the recombinant viruses in NHBE cells infected at an MOI of 0.2 with the indicated virus as measured by plaque assay. Data points show mean values of 3 biological replicates, and error bars represent standard errors of the means. (B) Expression levels of mRNAs for NP, M1, NEP, and HA in infected NHBE cells at different time points by qRT-PCR. Data were grouped as human or avian depending the origin of the NS1 proteins carried by the viruses. Each column represents the mean of the group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) with the corresponding standard error of the means. Statistical significance was determined using a 
   <italic>t</italic> test. 
   <italic>P</italic> values are indicated as follows: ****, &lt;0.001; ***, &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
