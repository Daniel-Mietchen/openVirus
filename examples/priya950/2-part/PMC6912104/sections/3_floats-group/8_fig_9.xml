  <p>hNS1 and aNS1 have different kinetics of nuclear export during primary human DC infection. (A) Infectivity in DCs measured as the percentage of M1/2-positive cells (MOI of 1 PFU/cell). Cells were stained, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with M1/2 E10-PacBlue, NS1-AF488, and a nuclear marker (DRAQ5). Images were obtained using an ImageStream instrument (Amnis). In order to quantify the localization of NS1-AF488 in the nucleus for each cell, a bright detail similarity (BDS) score was calculated between the images (NS1 nuclear localization score; see Materials and Methods). (B) Representative images of cells in which NS1 is localized mainly in the nucleus (highly nuclear) or in the cytoplasm (highly cytoplasmic). (C) Representative histograms. (D to G) Percentage of infected cells with highly nuclear or cytoplasmic localization per virus (D and F) or per time point (E and G), grouped by avian or human strains. (H) Rate of export to the cytoplasm (percent change per hour) for human and avian strains from 6 to 9 hpi and for 9 to 12 hpi. *,
