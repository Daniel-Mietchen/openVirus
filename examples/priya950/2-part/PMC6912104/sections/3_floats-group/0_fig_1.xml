  <p>Generation and selection of PR8 recombinant viruses expressing different NS1 proteins. (A) Schematic representation of PR8 recombinant viruses (7:1) bearing NS1 proteins from different origins (PR8-NS1) and representation of the wild-type (WT) segments of eight of influenza A vRNAs which encode two proteins (NS1 and NEP) and modified segment eight encoding separated reading frames (PR8-Split). (B) Selection of PR8-NS1 viruses of interest. (C) Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of a selection of 58 NS1 amino acid sequences representative of the global diversity of NS1 proteins from influenza A viruses. Sequences used in this study are shown in red. (D) Multicycle replication kinetics of PR8-Split and PR8-WT or PR8-Split and PR8-NS1 viruses in A549 cells. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with the indicated virus, and supernatants were harvested at various time points for plaque assay titration. Data points show mean values (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3), and error bars represent standard deviations. (E) Impact of hNS1 and aNS1 proteins on IFN-β induction in human cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with pDZ plasmid encoding the indicated NS1 protein (or empty vector), together with a firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) IFN-β promoter reporter plasmid (p125Luc) and a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter-driven 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Ren-Luc) plasmid. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with a DI-rich SeV preparation for 16 h. Relative FF-Luc activity was normalized to the level of the empty vector plus SeV (set to 100%).
