  <p>Chemokines and proinflammatory responses induced by recombinant viruses expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian IAVs in primary NHBE cells. (A and B) Analysis of the mRNA expression levels for chemokines IP-10 and RANTES and proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-Î±, as indicated, at different time points, normalized to the level of a housekeeping gene by qRT-PCR. (C) Levels of IP-10 protein detected in bottom chambers of infected NHBE cells by multiplex ELISA at 48 hpi. Data were grouped as human or avian depending the origin of the NS1 protein carried by the virus. Data from 3 biological replicates for each virus are shown (dots); each column represents the mean of the group with the corresponding standard error of the means. Statistical significance was determined using the 
   <italic>t</italic> test. 
   <italic>P</italic> values are indicated as follows: ****, &lt;0.0001; ***, &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
