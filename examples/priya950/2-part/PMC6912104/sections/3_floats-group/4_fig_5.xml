  <p>Differential immune responses induced by recombinant viruses expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian IAVs in primary NHBE cells. (A) Experimental design created with Biorender. (B) Analysis of the expression of mRNA levels for type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3). (C) ISG IRF7 and IFIT1 levels at different time points by qRT-PCR. (D) Levels of type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ1) protein detected in bottom chambers of infected cells by multiplex ELISA at 48 hpi. Data were grouped as human or avian depending the origin of the NS1 proteins carried by the viruses. Data from 3 biological replicates for each virus are shown (dots); each column represents the mean of the group with the corresponding standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was determined using a 
   <italic>t</italic> test. 
   <italic>P</italic> values are as indicated follows: ****, &lt;0.0001; ***. &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
