  <p>Differential IFN responses induced by recombinant viruses expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian IAVs in primary human DCs. (A) Experimental design created with BioRender. WB, Western blotting. (B) Levels of type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ1) protein detected in supernatants of infected cells by multiplex ELISA at 12 hpi. (C) Analysis of the expression levels of mRNAs for type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3) at 6 and 12 hpi, normalized to the level of the housekeeping gene (RPS11) by qRT-PCR. DCs were infected at an MOI of 1 independently with 8 different recombinant viruses. Data from 6 to 8 infected donors are shown. Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are indicated as follows: ****, &lt;0.0001; ***, &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
