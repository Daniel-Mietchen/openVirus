  <p>Multiple sequence alignment of full-length NS1 proteins from IAVs. (A) Schematic representation of an NS1 monomer with the two functionally different domains, the N-terminal RNA binding domain and the C-terminal the effector domain, separated by a short linker region. The last residues of the C terminus form a tail. The NS1 protein is 218 to 237 amino acids long depending upon the strain. (B) Amino acid sequence alignment of the NS1 proteins from IAVs included in this study: A/Memphis/19/1983 (H1N1), A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Peru271/2011 (H3N2), A/Udorn/1972 (H3N2), A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 (H5N1), A/Vietnam/277/2007 (H5N1), A/duck/Tasmania/277/2007 (H7N2), and A/Shanghai/02/2003 (H7N9). Identity (Â·) and amino acid changes between strains are indicated. Blue shading highlights NLS1, green shading indicates the NES, and pink shading indicates NLS2. Black boxes indicate residues that are different between human and avian proteins and common in at least 3 out of 4 sequences.</p>
