<p>Linear regression analysis was used to examine the determinants associated with adoption of BPBs and PPBs. The nine items for BPBs and seven items for PPBs were each standardized by summing the scores for the items making up each factor, subtracting the mean value, and dividing by the standard deviation. The standardized BPB and PPB scores were then used as dependent variables in the regression analyses, with socio–economic variables and risk perception characteristics used as independent variables. The criterion for statistical significance was
