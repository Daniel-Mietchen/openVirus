<p>The second part of the survey contained questions to measure farmers’ risk perception regarding human infection with A/H7N9 and poultry infection with A/H5N1. We measured risk perception characteristics using a framework of familiarity and controllability, based on Slovic’s study of risk perception [

Specific risk events examined included route of transmission and infectivity, reason for occurrence, prevention measures taken, cure rate, death rate, and overall feelings about human infection with A/H7N9 and poultry infection with A/H5N1. For each risk perception characteristic, respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with corresponding statements for familiarity and controllability on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from “1 = totally unfamiliar” or “totally out of control” to “5 = very familiar” or “completely under control”). Farmers’ perceived risk regarding human infection with A/H7N9 and poultry infection with A/H5N1 was measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from “1 = no perceived risk whatsoever” to “5 = very high perceived risk”.
