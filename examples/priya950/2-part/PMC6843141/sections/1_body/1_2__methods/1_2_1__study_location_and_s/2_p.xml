<p>Potential study participants were identified using mixed stratified sampling and random sampling. First, at the prefectural level, three cities in each province were randomly selected (Changzhou, Suqian, and Nantong in Jiangsu province, and Hefei, Wuhu, and Anqing in Anhui province, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03832-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Second, two county-level units were randomly selected within each of these cities. Third, two districts were randomly selected within each county-level unit. Fourth, two villages were randomly selected from each selected district. Finally, 7â€“10 chicken farmers within each selected village were randomly selected from the lists of names provided by local veterinary bureaus. Six research assistants underwent training designed to minimize bias and then conducted face-to-face interviews with the selected chicken farmers using a standardized questionnaire. Of 450 farmers invited to participate in the study, a total of 426 completed interviews, resulting in a response rate of 94.7%. Only 24 farmers declined to participate, citing lack of time or other unstated reasons.
