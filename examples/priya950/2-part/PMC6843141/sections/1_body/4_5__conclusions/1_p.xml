<p>In this study comparing Chinese poultry farmers’ risk perception regarding AI virus infection in poultry and humans with their coping behaviors, we found that farmers’ perceived risk of poultry infection with A/H5N1 was significantly higher than that for human infection with A/H7N9, and that the total frequency of reported BPBs against A/H5N1 was significantly higher than the frequency of PPBs against A/H7N9. Moreover, farmers were less familiar with human infection with A/H7N9 compared to poultry infection with A/H5N1, likely because they were unfamiliar with the A/H7N9 virus. Nevertheless, farmers felt a greater sense of control about human AI infection, presumably because the closure of LPMs greatly reduced or eliminated AI transmission in China. Accordingly, knowledge translation (for example, specially organized training, distribution of brochures) regarding human AI infection is needed in this population.</p>
