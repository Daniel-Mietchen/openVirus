<p>The size of poultry farming operations was associated with BPBs and PPBs. A larger farm size usually implies greater overall economic losses if poultry are infected, forcing larger-scale farmers to improve their poultry management standards [

This suggests that larger farm size is conducive to poultry farmersâ€™ adoption of actual BPBs and PPBs, whereas a smaller farm size may increase the risk of human infection with A/H7N9 and poultry infection with A/H5N1 in China. Thus, a policy incentive to encourage large-scale poultry farming could be effective in improving the implementation of both BPBs and PPBs, thereby reducing infection rates.
