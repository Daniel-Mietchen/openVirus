<p>Survey respondents’ sense of control regarding transmission and infectivity, death rate, and overall feelings about human infection were significantly higher than their sense of control regarding poultry infection. Existing research shows that live poultry purchasing practices currently employed in China increase the risk of exposure to A/H7N9 virus-contaminated environments [
