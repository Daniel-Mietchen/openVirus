<p>Consistent with our previous surveys on adoption of BPBs [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] among Chinese poultry farmers, the present study further clarified the frequency of adopting different BPBs and PPBs from “never adopted” to “adopted all the time”. Consistent with previous research among Chinese poultry and broiler farmers [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], those who manage larger farms and those with more years of experience raising poultry were likely to report greater adoption of BPBs and PPBs. The present study found that farmers who had experience with poultry infection were less likely to report adopting BPBs and PPBs. This pattern may be related to the length of time since the poultry infection, as over time farmers may have forgotten the experience of infection and the effect it had on their livelihood and livestock. However, the factors underlying these patterns require further study.
