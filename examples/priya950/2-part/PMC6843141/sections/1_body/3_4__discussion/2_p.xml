<p>A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 are among the most important AI viruses responsible for recent outbreaks in China. A/H5N1 is pathogenic in poultry, while A/H7N9 is not; both viruses have caused disease in humans, but the number of human A/H7N9 cases far exceeds that for A/H5N1 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The A/H5N1 virus has infected poultry in mainland China since 2004 [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, only after China changed its infectious disease policy in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was information on human infection with A/H7N9 made routinely available to the public [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, A/H7N9 was a previously unknown virus for Chinese poultry farmers, but the long-term practice of combatting the infection of poultry with A/H5N1 and the substantial economic losses previously suffered have made Chinese poultry farmers more familiar with that virus. However, genomic analysis suggests that the A/H7N9 virus is of avian origin and is mainly transmitted through exposure to infected poultry [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; thus, poultry farmers are at an elevated risk of contracting the AI virus [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been reported that some poultry workers have been infected with A/H7N9 [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is important that knowledge of human AI infection be disseminated among poultry farmers.
