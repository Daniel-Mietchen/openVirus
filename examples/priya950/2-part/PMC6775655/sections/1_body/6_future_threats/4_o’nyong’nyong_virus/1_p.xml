 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>), the agent of o’nyong’nyong fever, is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and was first isolated during an epidemic in Uganda in 1959 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. It is unique among mosquito borne alphaviruses as it is transmitted by night-feeding African anopheline mosquitoes (

 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>). The vertebrate host in the enzootic cycle is unknown; however, mandrills in Gabon (4/25; 16%) have been found seropositive to ONNV by PRNT [
