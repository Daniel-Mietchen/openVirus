<p id="Par91">Lumbo virus (LUMV) (bunyavirus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] was isolated from 
 <italic>Aedes pembaensis</italic> in Mozambique 1959 and 1960 during investigations into arboviruses in people. Although people have been found to have neutralizing antibodies against the virus, it is not known to cause clinical disease. Experimental infections of three individual NHPs, a vervet monkey (
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus</italic>), yellow baboon (
 <italic>Papio cynocephalus</italic>) and bush baby (
 <italic>Galago crassicaudatus</italic>), resulted in seroconversion and significantly viraemia in the vervet monkey, but no clinical illness [
