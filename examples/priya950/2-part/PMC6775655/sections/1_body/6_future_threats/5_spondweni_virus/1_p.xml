<p id="Par90">Spondweni virus (SPONV) (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) is closely related to ZIKV and is the agent of Spondweni fever in people in Africa, which is readily confused with Zika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. It has been isolated from several species of mosquito, most significantly from the African forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Aedes circumluteolus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], but the vertebrate host is unknown. Although previously not thought to exist outside of Africa, SPONV was recently isolated from 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes collected in Haiti in 2016 [
