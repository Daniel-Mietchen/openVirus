<p id="Par88">Oropouche virus (OROV) (
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>) causes Oropouche fever in people and has been responsible for large epidemics (second only to dengue) in Brazil, Peru, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago where it was initially isolated from a forest worker in 1955 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. The OROV exists in a sylvatic cycle reportedly involving the mosquito species 
 <italic>Coquillettidia venezuelensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes serratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus serratus</italic> and midges of the genus 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>. A vertebrate host has not been established, but there is a single report of isolation of OROV from a marmoset in Brazil (
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] and a sloth (
 <italic>Bradypus tridactylus</italic>) in a 1960 report. A few free-living and captive NHPs in Brazil have been found seropositive [

 <italic>Sapajus</italic> spp.), black-and-gold howler monkeys (
 <italic>A. caraya</italic>), black-tufted marmosets (
 <italic>Callithrix penicillata</italic>) and other vertebrates including pale-throated three-toed sloths (
 <italic>Bradypus tridactylus</italic>), rodents (
 <italic>Proechimys</italic> spp.), and birds (Fringillidae, Thaurapidae, Columbidae) [
