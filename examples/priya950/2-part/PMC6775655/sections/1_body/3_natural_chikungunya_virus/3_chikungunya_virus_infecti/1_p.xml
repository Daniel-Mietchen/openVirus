<p id="Par66">High seroprevalences have been recorded in multiple species of NHPs in Senegal, which have sometimes been associated with outbreaks in people (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Of note, immediately after an outbreak of CHIKV in people in the region from 2010 to 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], high seropositivities were found in NHPs, especially juveniles. This was considered to indicate the presence of high herd immunity and that ongoing CHIKV circulation in a sylvatic cycle would be unlikely. There was thus the possibility that NHPs were not the only vertebrate hosts involved and alternate reservoirs of CHIKV were possible [
