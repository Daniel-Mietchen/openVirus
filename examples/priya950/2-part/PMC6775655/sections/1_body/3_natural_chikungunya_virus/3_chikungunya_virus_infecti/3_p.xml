<p id="Par68">Off the coast of Africa, during the 2006 chikungunya epidemic on the French islands of La Réunion, Mayotte and Mauritius, approximately 266,000 people out of a total of 785,000 individuals were infected in La Réunion alone, but there was little serological evidence of infections in NHPs with only a few brown lemurs (
 <italic>Eulemur fulvus</italic>) and crab-eating macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) found seropositive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The brown lemurs (
 <italic>E. fulvus</italic>) were negative for CHIKV by PCR and it was thought the seropositive animals resulted from ‘spillback’ infections from people rather than as a result of the presence of a sylvatic cycle.
