<p id="Par51">Later serosurveys in Southeast Asia described seropositivity in NHPs from Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], but not in NHPs originating from Japan (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although mosquitoes were not studied, the data were regarded as suggesting sylvatic cycles might be widespread in Southeast Asia. Later, IgG, IgM, neutralising antibody and DENV RNA were demonstrated in cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) in the Philippines, further suggesting natural cycling of infection in the region (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, sequence analysis of the genes coding for the DENV non-structural protein (NS1) and envelope (E) in isolates from two of the macaques showed they were the same as the circulating human/urban DENV strain. Infections were, then, most likely part of the urban cycle (‘spillback’ or ‘reverse zoonosis’) with NHPs having the potential to act as a reservoir of infection for epidemic/urban strains of the virus. The reverse event, ‘spillover’, was demonstrated to be possible in 2008 in Malaysia when the virus isolated from a man who contracted severe dengue after visiting Rudnick’s field sites grouped into the same clade as Rudnick’s original NHP isolates from 40 years previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Seropositive NHPs have been found in Thailand suggesting sylvatic cycles might occur there also (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] although there have been no sylvatic mosquito or viral characterisation studies.
