<p id="Par59">In a survey in Argentina in 2010 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], only a few free-ranging howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta caraya</italic>) were seropositive solely to DENV-1 and 3. This low level of infection was thought to result from ‘spillback’ from human infections rather than being evidence of a sylvatic cycle. Many other NHPs in the study had low magnitude seropositivity to DENV-1 and 3, which was thought to be due to multiple closely related flaviviruses infecting NHPs in a sylvatic environment. In the Bahia Atlantic Forest Reserve of Brazil between 2006 and 2014, low seropositivity to DENVs was found in free-living golden-headed lion tamarins (
 <italic>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</italic>) that were proximate to agricultural workers thereby raising the possibility of ‘spillback infection’ (Table
