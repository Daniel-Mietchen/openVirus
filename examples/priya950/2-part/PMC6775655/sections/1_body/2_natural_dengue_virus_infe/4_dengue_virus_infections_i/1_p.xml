<p id="Par53">Early evidence of a DENV sylvatic cycle in Africa can be found in a review of French publications resulting from work at the Institut Français de Recherche Scientifique pour le Développement en Coopération between 1972 and 1982 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. They reported isolating DENV-2 from a forest-dwelling mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes luteocephalus</italic>, in eastern Senegal in 1972 and because this mosquito was discovered far from human habitation, it was suggested that there might also be a sylvatic cycle of DENV in Africa.
