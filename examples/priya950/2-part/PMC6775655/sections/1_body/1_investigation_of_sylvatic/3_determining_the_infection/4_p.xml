<p id="Par33">Confirming the above criteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and establishing with certainty that sylvatic cycles are present is often difficult in practice. Some studies, principally the early ones, established the existence of sylvatic cycles using the above criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other studies have relied more on investigating viral presence in either sylvatic mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or NHPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
