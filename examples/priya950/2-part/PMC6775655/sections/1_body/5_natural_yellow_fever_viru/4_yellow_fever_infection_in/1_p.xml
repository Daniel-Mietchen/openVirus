<p id="Par85">Yellow fever is notably absent from Asia despite there being large numbers of susceptible people, mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, and native NHPs that have been found to be highly susceptible to experimental infections with YFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Possible reasons for the absence of observed disease in people have been reviewed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and include the lack of opportunity for the YFV to spread with the lack of major trade routes between West Africa and Asia and the fact that YFV has not been documented in nearby East Africa. It might also result from lack of surveillance and the similar clinical presentation of yellow fever and dengue, which is a very common disease in Asia. Additionally, DENV antibodies in NHP hosts and people might provide cross-protection against the YFV and there might be direct viral competition between the viruses in mosquitoes. There is also the unlikely possibility that Asian 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. cannot transmit YFV.
