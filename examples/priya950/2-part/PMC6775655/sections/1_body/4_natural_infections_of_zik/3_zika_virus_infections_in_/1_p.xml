<p id="Par75">Subsequent investigations of mosquitoes in forests and forest canopies have identified further species naturally infected with ZIKV: 
 <italic>Ae. opok</italic> in the Central African Republic; 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> in Nigeria; and 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> in the Ivory Coast and Senegal [
