<p>Similar kinds of existentialist angst and pessimism over social values in connection with the Black Death were later famously exploited by Ingmar Bergman in 
 <italic>The Seventh Seal</italic> (1957), Lars von Trier in 
 <italic>Epidemic</italic> (1987), Luis Puenzo in 
 <italic>The Plague</italic> (1992), and Christopher Smith in 
 <italic>The Black Death</italic> (2010). Those 4 films focus especially on intolerance in the form of scapegoating and persecution of women as witches, but visualization of dread had already appeared earlier in lesser known films, such as 
 <italic>Singoalla</italic> (1949, Christian-Jaque), 
 <italic>HÃ¤xan</italic> (1922, Benjamin Christensen), and 
 <italic>Skeleton on Horseback</italic> (1937, Hugo Haas). In the film 
 <italic>Trollsyn </italic>(1994, Ola Solum), set in Norway, the initial stage of the Black Death outbreak is presented as mass hysteria among the villagers: crying and shouting, desperate prayers, suicides, and frantic searching for buboes and panicked movements. Also, in reference to social decline, one scene shows simultaneously the aggressive inquisition of a female scapegoat while amid the chaos a couple are having sex and others have taken off their clothes and are rolling down a grassy hill.
