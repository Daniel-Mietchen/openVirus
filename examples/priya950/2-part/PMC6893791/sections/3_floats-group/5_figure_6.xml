  <p>MeV F heptad repeats at the C terminal domain (HRC)-derived peptide. Following its engagement with any MeV receptor, H triggers F which inserts its fusion peptide in the host membrane (
   <bold>A</bold>). Then, F undergoes serial conformational changes to reach its post fusion state, bringing the two membranes close enough to form a fusion pore (
   <bold>B</bold>). MeV F HRC-derived peptides interact with MeV F HRN and catch the intermediate states of MeV F to block the fusion, regardless of the insertion of the fusion peptide in the host membrane (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>).
