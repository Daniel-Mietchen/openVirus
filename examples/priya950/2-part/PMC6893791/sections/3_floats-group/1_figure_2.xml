  <p>Course of MeV infection leading to measles encephalitis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Initially, MeV infects myeloid cells in the respiratory tract. Then, MeV-infected lymphocytes disseminate the infection via the lymphatic and vascular systems. As a consequence of transient immunosuppression or autoimmunity, patients can develop acute post-infectious measles encephalitis (APME) shortly after exposure without systematic central nervous system (CNS) infection. However, measles inclusion-body encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) are associated with MeV infection of the CNS. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The occurrence of MeV encephalitis may range from one day to 15 years following initial infection.
