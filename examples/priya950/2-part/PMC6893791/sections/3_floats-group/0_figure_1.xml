  <p>Measles Virus (MeV) replication cycle. (
   <bold>A</bold>) In order to infect a susceptible and permissive cell, MeV binds to its entry receptors on the cell surface (1) and initiates the virus-cell membrane fusion (2), as described in detail in (
   <bold>B</bold>). Virus and cell membranes fusion leads to genome delivery into the cytoplasm (3). Viral RNA is transcribed in mRNA (4) that is further translated into viral proteins (5). Viral glycoproteins maturate during their transport to the cell surface (6). The replication of positive stranded anti-genomic RNA starts in the cytoplasm (7) and serves as a template for synthesis of new negative stranded genomic RNA (8). Viral proteins assemble at the cell surface, leading either to budding of new virions (9) or cell-to-cell fusion (10). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The haemagglutinin (H) protein binds to the MeV receptor at the cell surface, allowing the triggering of fusion (F) which reaches a metastable conformation. Then, F protein anchors its fusion peptide in the target cell membrane, F undergoes serial conformational changes bringing the two membranes close enough to merge and form a pore throughout which the viral ribonucleocapsid (RNP) is delivered to the cytoplasm.
