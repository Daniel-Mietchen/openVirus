<p>For MeV, the hypothesis that single or combination of mutations would be sufficient to confer adaptation in brain tissues for invasion without the engagement of any receptor is also relevant. Indeed, highly unstable F mutants such as L454W, observed in MIBE cases, do not need any communication with the H for triggering and fusion and thus cell-to-cell dissemination [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Alternatively, there is no proof that such a virus would be able to attach to any cell in absence of H and thus go through the first event allowing the entry in the CNS. Additionally, other hyperfusogenic mutants more stable and also observed in encephalitis cases were shown to conserve there dependence on H for F triggering [
