<p>Meninges infection has been observed following intracranial MeV inoculation in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>] and hamsters [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>], as well as following intranasal infection of SLAM transgenic mice [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, MeV strains and mutants used in these studies were all known as hyperfusogenic. However, meninges infection has not been reported in humans yet.
