<p>In the CNS, MeV infection occurs mainly in neurons but also in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia [

 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Infected oligodendrocytes are often located near infected neurons, suggesting oligodendrocytes infection as a secondary infection from axons. The infection of oligodendrocytes is highly related to their demyelination. The authors suggest that MeV induces demyelination that could be a hallmark of SSPE (
