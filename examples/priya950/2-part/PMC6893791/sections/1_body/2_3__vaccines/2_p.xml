<p>Different MeV strains have been used for vaccine purpose starting with the Edmonston strain isolated in 1954 that was very reactogenic. Five vaccines were derived from Edmonston: Edmonston-Zagreb, AIK-C, Moraten, Schwarz, and Edmonston-B [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Some of them such as Edmonston-B remained too reactogenic. The Edmonston vaccine was replaced by the more attenuated Schwarz vaccine strain in early 60s and Moraten vaccine strains in 1968. Years later, studies have shown that Schwarz and Moraten were in fact the same virus [

Leningrad strain (isolated in 1957) attenuation successively led to Leningrad 4 and more recently to the Chinese vaccine Changchung-47. Shanghai isolate (1960) attenuation allowed production of shanghai-191 vaccine while Cam-70 which was currently produced and used in Indonesia and Japan, derived from the Tanabe (Japan, 1968) strain. All vaccines strains belong to the measles virus genotype A [

Measles vaccine is usually combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, known as MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine, or with mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, called MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella) vaccine. MMR is a live-attenuated measles virus [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. MMR vaccination is given in a two-dose schedule, with a first dose generally administered to 12â€“15 months old children, and a second one three to five years later [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While MMR vaccine cannot be used in immunocompromised patients (with low CD4+ cell count, or severely immunedepressed), the WHO strongly recommends the vaccination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients without severe immunosuppression [
