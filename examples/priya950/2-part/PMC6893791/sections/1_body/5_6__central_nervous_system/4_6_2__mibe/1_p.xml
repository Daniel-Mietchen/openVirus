<p>MIBE occurs in immunosuppressed patients ranging from three weeks to six months following wild-type MeV infection or in some rare cases after inappropriate vaccination with former vaccine strains [

 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. MIBE is characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion bodies composed of nucleocapsids, mainly in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes [

At a molecular level, mutations have sometimes been observed in the intracytoplasmic domain of MeV F protein and lead to the expression of hyperfusogenic viral phenotypes. Some mutations similar to those observed in SSPE have also been detected in the N gene and it has been hypothesized that MIBE and SSPE might be very similar, apart from the more rapid development of MIBE in immunocompromised subjects [

 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Notably, the mutation L454W in the HRC domain of the F protein emerged in two patients that contracted MIBE in South Africa. This mutation confers the ability of entry without the presence of known receptor even at 25 Â°C. The mutation L454W leads to a highly unstable F protein potentially due to a lower interaction with the H protein which loses its protection role from random triggering of the fusion protein. This finding suggests that hyperfusogenicity of these neurotropic variants allows better viral dissemination, without the need of H binding to a high affinity receptor [
