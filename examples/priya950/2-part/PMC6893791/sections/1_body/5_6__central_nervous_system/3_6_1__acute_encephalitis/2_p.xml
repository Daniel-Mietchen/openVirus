<p>APME is associated with 20% mortality and severe neurological sequelae, mainly in adults. Symptoms include fever, headaches, seizures, and consciousness alterations. APME is a complication associated with MeV infection that seems to be related to an auto-immune reaction against the myelin basic protein mainly expressed by oligodendrocytes [

Note that there is a total lack of evidence of the virus presence in the brain parenchyma compared to that in the blood circulation. Based on the absence of virus detection in certain cases, multiple groups have suggested that the encephalitis could be caused by an autoimmune-like response [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. While the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggests autoimmune-mediated encephalitis, oligodendrocytes viability and neurons myelination have not been explored yet [
