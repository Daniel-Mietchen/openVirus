<p>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) cases occur in 6.5 to 11 cases per 100,000 [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] in immunocompetent patients that contracted measles in their childhood, with a mortality rate close to 100%. Within children infected by MeV before the age of 12 months, the incidence for SSPE rises to 1/609, while reaching 1/1367 for children under five years old [

 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In addition, because of the non-specificity of the first symptoms, SSPE diagnosis is generally delayed [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In most of the cases, patients do not survive more than 1â€“3 years following appearance of the symptoms associated with important neurological signs and dementia. Patients are developing severe physical and mental impairments but also a loss of motor control that tends to evolve in myoclonic jerks and spasms, seizures, and coma. Patients that underwent primary infection below the age of two are more at risk of developing SSPE. It was suggested that an immature immune system before two years old could contribute to persistent brain infection [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. A dual viral hit was suggested to play a role in SSPE development. In this model, authors proposed that during classical first exposure to MeV immunocompetent patients do not develop encephalitis. However, a first exposure to a virus different from MeV, but capable of inducing an immunosuppression, which is followed with MeV infection later in the life, may favor development of CNS disease such as SSPE, as shown in the model of transgenic mice susceptible to MeV infection [

SSPE is characterized by an excessive intrathecal synthesis of MeV specific antibodies. Most of the time, in the brain of SSPE patients, the genes that are encoding for MeV matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), and attachment protein (H) are mutated [
