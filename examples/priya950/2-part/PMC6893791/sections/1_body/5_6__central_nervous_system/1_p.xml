<p>How the virus enters the CNS remains unclear since the known MeV receptors are not expressed. While its expression in the CNS seems to be only transient, nectin-4 has also been suggested to play a crucial role in MeV neuroinvasion based on observations made on closely related canine distemper virus whose neurotropism directly depends on nectin-4 specific patterns of expression [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In this context, viral RNP could transit from nectin-4 positive cells in nasal turbinate or meninges to neural cells expressing nectin-1 in olfactory bulb or brain parenchyma, respectively. The following key elements involved in the neural cell-to-cell dissemination and successful CNS invasion remain to be investigated (
