<p>During the acute phase of MeV infection, the patients develop several symptoms, including fever, cough, nasal congestion, characteristic erythematous maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, and pathognomonic Koplik spots on oral mucosa. Diarrhea and vomiting are often observed in infected children during the disease [
