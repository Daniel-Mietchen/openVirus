<p>In SSPE cases, some mutations have also been found in N, P, and L proteins but most of the recent studies focused on F and M proteins. Some P genes from SSPE cases exhibit an impaired editing system that lead to less V protein production. Most of the time, the viral cycle does not seem compromised but the lower expression level of V could contribute to the viral persistence by reduced inhibition of interferon (IFN) response [
