<p>The H protein of SSPE strains is often mutated as well and contributes to neurovirulence [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In a recent study, three mutations were found in the H gene of South African SSPE strain, in the cytoplasmic tail, the stalk domain, and Î²5 blade of the head domain, associated with substitutions R7Q, R62Q, and D530E, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The residue D530 is necessary for cell entry through SLAM, so the mutation D530E could compromise the use of infection through SLAM [
