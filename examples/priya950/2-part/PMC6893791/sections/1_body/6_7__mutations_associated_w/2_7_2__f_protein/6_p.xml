<p>As discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6dot2-viruses-11-01017">Section 6.2</xref>. the hyperfusogenicity correlates with a lower thermal stability of the pre-fusion state of F [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. As an example, the L454W F is highly unstable and this characteristic could be sufficient to trigger F in a postfusion state by itself, allowing the fusion to occur without any receptor engagement. In the context of a circulating viral particle outside the brain, that property might not be an advantage for the virus, which could explain why any hyperfusogenic form of MeV has never been found in circulating viruses.
