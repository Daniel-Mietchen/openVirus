<p>Mutations can occur in the HRC domain (T461I, A440P, N462S, N465S, and L454W), in the HRN domain (G168R/E170G), in between HRC and HRN domains (S262G), in the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) (R520C, L550P), and in the F2 subunit of F protein. Among the mutations found in the F-SSPE sequence from South African patient (G168R/E170G/S262G/A440P/R520C/L550P and X551G), only the mutation S262G (position already associated to hyperfusogenicity with a mutation S262R) located at the interface of three protomers, involved in fusion activation, may independently confer an hyperfusogenic phenotype to F without needing any other mutation. The functional analysis of MeV_IC323 virus carrying this F-SSPE with all seven mutations confirmed the finding that an SSPE strain can disseminate via cell-to-cell spreading in Vero cells, in the absence of known receptors [
