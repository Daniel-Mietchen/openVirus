<p>The recently developed three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid model has a high potential in order to investigate viral dissemination and evolution in the brain. The 3D brain organoids are generated from human pluripotent stem cells or human embryonic stem cells. This more ethical model offers a unique opportunity in generating relevant data that could be transposed faithfully to brain infection in humans [

However, to date, this model can be very useful in combination with ex vivo models, especially to test the efficacy of inhibitors in the context of brain infection, to follow viral dissemination and highlight the emergence of mutations.
