<p>It is suggested that MeV dissemination can be mediated by the microfusion at synaptic membranes [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01017-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). This interaction would lead to the formation of a fusion micropore, allowing viral RNP to pass disseminate through neurons without the need of neither budding nor other receptor engagement. This could also explain the lack of syncytia formation in human primary neurons following infection with hyperfusogenic MeV forms. It has also been hypothesized that some supporting cells of myelinated nerves could block cell-to-cell contact between neurons and trans-synaptic spread in the brain could be the only way to allow viral dissemination [
