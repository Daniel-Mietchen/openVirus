<p>Non-human primates represent faithful models of measles since they are fully susceptible to wild-type MeV infection [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Thus, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques or squirrel monkey are often used mainly for studies focusing on the acute pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B150-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. These studies highlighted numerous similarities between measles pathogenesis in humans and primates. Particularly, they allowed confirming the essential role of nectin-4 for the shedding and inter-human transmission of MeV, but symptoms related to CNS infection have not been reported so far. Accidental transmission of the circulating MeV strain from human to primate have occurred notably causing five deaths out of 21 cases in rhesus monkey [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In this study CNS infection was not investigated and all deaths were due to secondary infection related to MeV-induced immunosuppression. In 1999, another natural outbreak led to the death of 12 Japanese macaques out of 53 cases. In the brain, demyelination was observed in one monkey and two monkeys showed neuronal inclusions with measles antigens [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] but no infectious viral particle has been isolated. In order to better characterize the CNS infection, rhesus monkeys were infected intracerebrally with a SSPE derived virus but animals did not develop any visible symptom and the virus was not detectable after three weeks, suggesting the resolution of the infection [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Another study reported that rhesus monkeys infected intracerebrally with hamster-brain-adapted strain developed encephalitis with morphological characteristics similar to those observed in the brain of human SSPE cases. However, as already observed in rodent, these brain infections induced by the hamster-brain-adapted strain evolved during the acute phase of infection and do not reflect the slow progression observed in the SSPE [
 <xref rid="B154-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. MeV CNS infection still has to be characterized in this model.
