<p>Humans are the only natural reservoir for MeV. Thus, the choice of the best animal model remains a challenge and depends on the type of scientific questions asked, to be faithfully representative of the CNS infection in humans. A summary of the most used small animal models and their related application is presented in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01017-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Several genetically modified mice have been used, mainly to study tropism, dissemination, and to develop new treatments. Historically, the Lewis rat was commonly used to study viral tropism and dissemination through the CNS [

More recently, the Golden Hamsters are preferred to study MeV neurovirulence because of the similarities in the brain lesions observed by MeV in this model compared to human cases of SSPE. Moreover, unlike mice, suckling hamsters are naturally susceptible to MeV infection, especially in the brain, despite the lack of expression of any known receptors as reported in human [

 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01017-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Numerous studies have been done using neurotropic strains obtained following multiple passages in Hamster brains. Nowadays, these strains, supposed to mimic persistent infection in the brain, are not used anymore. Indeed, the strains CAM/RB or HNT were highly virulent in mice, rat and hamster but the induced infection was not representative of a persistent MeV infection in the brain. These hypermutated neuro-adapted strains led to an acute infection in the brain that was not representative of the slow and progressive infection seen in SSPE [
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Such type of infection cannot be representative of an APME or MIBE since there is no CNS infection in the first case, and there are very distinctive inclusion bodies in the brains in the second one. Nevertheless, it may allow a better understanding of the behavior of MeV once these mutations have emerged in the CNS.
