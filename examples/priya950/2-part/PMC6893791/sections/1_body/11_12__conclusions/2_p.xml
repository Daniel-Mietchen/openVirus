<p>To date, the emergence of the mutations observed in the brain of SSPE or MIBE patients is still poorly understood. These mutations could have emerged through an adaptation to the brain, leading to SSPE or MIBE, or through a selection of pre-existing mutations as a polymorphism among the circulating strains. Since MIBE only concerns immunocompromised patients and occurs usually very shortly after the primary MeV infection, one could speculate that it is more likely that a minor population of MeV, bearing the mutations that allow the virus grow in a neural context, gets selected and take the advantage of this immunological status for further propagation in the brain. Regardless of the type of encephalitis or MeV variant invading the brain, the high mortality rate associated to measles virus CNS complication highlight the requirement to validate antiviral molecules against these variants.</p>
