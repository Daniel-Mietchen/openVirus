<p>Transcription by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) starts from a single promoter resulting in a transcriptional gradient from the most abundant mRNA for N to the least abundant mRNA for L in order to allow efficient viral cycles. These mRNAs are then translated into viral proteins. The accumulation of N and P leads to viral genome replication into positive stranded RNA anti-genome that will allow further synthesis of negative sense RNA strands that will be encapsidated by newly synthesized N, P, and L proteins [
