<p>MeV belongs to the Morbillivirus genus within the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family and 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> order. This enveloped virus produces pleiomorphic viral particles with an average size ranging from 150 to 300 nm and up to 900 nm [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Its genome is a negative-sense, single stranded RNA of 15,894 nucleotides that encodes six structural proteins: The nucleocapsid (N) protein, the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix (M) protein, the fusion (F) protein, the haemagglutinin (H) protein, and the polymerase (large, L) protein. Two non-structural proteins, V and C are produced from the P gene [
