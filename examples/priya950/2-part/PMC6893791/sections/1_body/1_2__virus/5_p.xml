<p>The viral RNA is encapsidated by the protein N and forms the helical nucleocapsid [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Together, the proteins L and P form the viral RdRp. That polymerase interacts with the nucleocapsid to progress on the viral RNA: Altogether they form the RNP.
