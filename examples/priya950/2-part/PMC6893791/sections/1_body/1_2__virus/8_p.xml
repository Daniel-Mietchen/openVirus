<p>Based on bioinformatic tools the HRN domain encompasses residues 116/138 to residue 190 and the HRC domain is included between residues 438 and 488/489. The current crystal structure however shows the region between 438 and 458 as disorganized while a canonical heptad repeat is shown after residue 458 [
