<p>Wild type MeV strains use signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 1 (SLAMF1, also called SLAM or CD150) and nectin-4 receptors to infect target cells [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, MeV entry may also occur by endocytosis mediated by SLAM in B-lymphoblastoid cells or A549-SLAM cells [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and through a nectin-4-mediated macropinocytosis pathway, in breast and colon cancer cell lines (MCF7, HTB-20, and DLD-1) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was also suggested that MeV Edmonston or Hall√© strains could use a macropinocytosis-like pathway in non-lymphoid and lymphoid cells when SLAM and CD46 are engaged but this remains poorly documented [
