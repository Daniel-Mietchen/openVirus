<p>To initiate the infection of the main target cells, the MeV H protein binds to entry receptor on the surface. This attachment triggers the F protein and leads to exposure of its hydrophobic fusion peptide that then inserts into the host cell membrane. The F protein undergoes serial conformational changes allowing the merge of the host and viral membranes creating a fusion pore allowing the ribonucleocapsid (RNP) delivery in the cytoplasm (
