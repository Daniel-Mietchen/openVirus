<p>In order to inhibit the MeV growth, a strategy is to silence mRNAs encoding one of the key polymerase complex, namely N, P or L using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or shRNAs, as synthetic oligonucleotides, encoded by plasmids, or transduced using lentiviral vectors. siRNAs targeting the mRNA of either L [

However, MeV finally escapes the silencing even in cells that constitutively express the siRNAs without acquiring any mutation even those that could disrupt the siRNA target sequence [
