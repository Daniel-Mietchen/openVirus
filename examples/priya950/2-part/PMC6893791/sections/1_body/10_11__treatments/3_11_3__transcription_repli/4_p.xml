<p>Finally, the compound 16677 (1-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-5-pyrazolecarboxylic acid) has been described as a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex activity [
 <xref rid="B248-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. The way this compound interacts with the replication machinery as well as the emergence of resistant variants remain poorly documented. Nevertheless, when tested in combination with an entry inhibitor increasing the stability of the fusion protein, the use of such replication inhibitor offered a high potential as a specific treatment against MeV. More recently, the same group has shown that compound AS-136A, analog to 16677, was able to block viral RNA synthesis by targeting L protein. This compound has also been associated to three candidatesâ€™ hotspots of mutation increasing the knowledge of L sequence adaptation [

In order to face its poor solubility in water, known to influence the antiviral activity, structure-activity relationship investigations were driven to discover analogs which could be used in vivo and resulted in the generation of orally bioavailable compound 2O (ERDRP-00519) more potent and aqueous soluble than former generation [
 <xref rid="B250-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>]. As the former candidates, this antiviral remains quite cytotoxic but could be particularly efficient in combination with fusion inhibitors or antiviral immune response activators.
