<p>Nucleoside analogs such as Remdesivir (GS-5734) and R1479 exhibit a broad spectrum activity against 
 <italic>paramyxoviruses</italic> infections, including MeV [
 <xref rid="B245-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Briefly, in cells, Remdesivir is metabolically converted to active nucleoside triphosphate. Obtained metabolite specifically inhibits several polymerases from different 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> such as Filoviruses and Henipaviruses, but not host polymerases. Recently, Remdesivir has been shown to inhibit Nipah virus polymerase activity by delaying the chain termination synthesis, notably in vivo in the African green monkey model [

 <xref rid="B246-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. Based on the huge conservation of the polymerases among 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, there is a high probability that Remdesivir may also inhibit measles virus polymerase activity. Interestingly, pharmakokinetic studies performed in non-human primates showed high and persistent levels of the active metabolite in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) mainly targeted by wt MeV during the early stages of the pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B247-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. Additionally, Remdesivir and subsequent active nucleoside seem to be able to reach the brain and may thus also inhibit CNS adapted variants of MeV observed in MIBE and SSPE cases.
