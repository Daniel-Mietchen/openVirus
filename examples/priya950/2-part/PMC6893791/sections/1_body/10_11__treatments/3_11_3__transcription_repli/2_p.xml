<p>As mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-viruses-11-01017">Section 2</xref>, MeV P interacts with L protein. Although this interaction is independent of heat shock proteins such as the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), both MeV P and HSP90 are necessary to fold and stabilize functional MeV L proteins able to enter the polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="B243-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. This transient requirement of HSP90 constitutes a potential target for transcription inhibition. Indeed, Geldanamycin and derivates such as 17-DMAG blocking HSP90 chaperon activity by entering its ATP pocket. These compounds showed the ability to block the viral transcription in preventive and post infection treatment in vitro and ex vivo in organotypic brain cultures [

 <xref rid="B244-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. While already used in cancer treatment, antivirals directly targeting the chaperon activity of HSP90 might be too toxic for human application. Nevertheless, molecules interfering between HSP90 and L and thus its functional folding are of interest for antiviral cure development.
