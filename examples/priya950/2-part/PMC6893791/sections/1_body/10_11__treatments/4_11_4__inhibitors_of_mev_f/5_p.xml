<p>In contrast, HRC-derived peptides, aim at blocking the fusion by capturing the F protein in the post-triggering state and freezing the fusion process at an early stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01017-f006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ€“D). The so-called HRC4 peptide is a MeV F HRC-derived dimeric peptide that interacts with the HRN domain during the structural transition of F (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01017-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D). Briefly, HRC4 peptide is a dimer constituted of the HRC derived peptide linked with two chains of PEG that acts as a spacer each conjugated with a molecule of cholesterol. The cholesterol allows the fusion peptide to anchor into the host membrane and thus increases the antiviral potency of the HRC-derived peptide by two logs [

 <xref rid="B146-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Notably, dissemination of viruses bearing the L454W mutation in F can be efficiently blocked in vitro and in vivo by F HRC-derived fusion inhibitors, regardless of the presence of SLAM [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To date, these fusion inhibitors are the only system already tested against both the wt and hyperfusogenic variants observed in CNS infection, and figure thus among the priority candidates for preclinical studies, to test alone and in combination with treatments targeting other viral functions.
