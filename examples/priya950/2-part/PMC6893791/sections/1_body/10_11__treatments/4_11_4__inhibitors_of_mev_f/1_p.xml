<p>As mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-viruses-11-01017">Section 2</xref>, the first step of the infection relies on entry of the virus into its target cell. Briefly, H protein engages entry receptor and triggers F protein. F exposes its highly hydrophobic fusion peptide which inserts into host cell plasma membrane. This transient intermediate stage is highly unstable. Consequently, F undergoes serial conformational changes leading to the interaction between the two heptad repeat domains that brings the two membranes close enough to merge and form the fusion pore. The viral RNP can thus enter in the cell host cytoplasm. In order to prevent viral entry, the main target is to block fusion of the virus. Blocking the interaction with the receptor or F serial conformational changes are the two mainly considered possibilities.
