<p>The receptor binding site of MeV H is considered as a potential neutralizing target. Indeed, the insertion of any compound in the H pocket responsible for the binding to the receptor could either prevent from the virus attachment to the host cell or pre-trigger the F protein leading to fusion dead viral particles. Several neutralizing antibodies targeting the H protein have been proposed mainly resulting in the emergence of resistant mutants not anymore able to bind either SLAM or nectin-4 [

While this loss of function should not exist in the wild, the question of the ability of such variants to invade the CNS which does not express SLAM or nectin-4 receptor under this selective pressure still needs to be investigated. More recently, neutralizing antibody-derived molecules such as single chain variable fragments targeting the H protein represent a major advance in the field of therapeutics design [

As for the corresponding neutralizing antibodies, the ability of such molecules to penetrate the brain parenchyma and to block hyperfusogenic variants depending less on the receptor engagement as those commonly observed in CNS infection has never been tested.
