<p>The antiviral response is mediated by the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that lead to the cell-intrinsic immunity. Recently, the overexpression of the bone marrow stromal antigen 2 proteins, also called BST2, Tetherin, or CD317, have been shown to inhibit Morbilliviruses cell to cell fusion in vitro by targeting the H protein [
