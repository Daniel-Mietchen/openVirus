  <p>Viral RNA copy numbers in the lungs and oropharynges of infected mice. At day five post-infection, the lungs and oropharyngeal swabs of the infected mice (n = 3) were obtained. The viral RNA was then extracted, reverse transcribed, and quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Higher viral RNA copy numbers (10-fold) were detected in the lungs of the mice immunized with NvC relative to those immunized with NvC-M2ex3 after being challenged with H1N1 or H3N2. These results demonstrate the potential of NvC-M2ex3 in limiting virus replication. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Detection of the viral RNA of H1N1 or H3N2 in the oropharynges of the mice suggests viral shedding and possible transmission between animals. All the NvC-M2ex3-immunized mice exhibited a reduced viral shedding in both lethal H1N1 and H3N2 infections. The differences between treatment groups are significant with
