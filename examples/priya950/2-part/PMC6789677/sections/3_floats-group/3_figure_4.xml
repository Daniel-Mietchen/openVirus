  <p>Concentration of cytokines in the lungs of mice (n = 3) infected by H1N1 and H3N2. The mice vaccinated with NvC-M2ex3 demonstrated different cytokine profiles after being challenged with H1N1 and H3N2. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A higher level of IFN-γ and IL-12 was detected in the lungs of the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 compared to the control group after being challenged with H1N1. (
   <bold>B</bold>) On the contrary, when the mice were challenged with H3N2, they exhibited lower concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-6, although a higher level of IL-12 was observed. The asterisks (*
