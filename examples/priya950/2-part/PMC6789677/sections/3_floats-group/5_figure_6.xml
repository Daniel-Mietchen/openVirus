  <p>Lung inflammatory scores of the mice (n = 3) challenged with influenza A virus. A lower lung inflammatory score was observed in the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 after being challenged with (
   <bold>A</bold>) H1N1 or (
   <bold>B</bold>) H3N2. All mice immunized with NvC experienced a higher lung inflammatory score which corresponded well with increased morbidity and reduced survival. The differences between the treatment groups are significant with
