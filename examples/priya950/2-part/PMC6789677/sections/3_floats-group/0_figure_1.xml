  <p>Immunogenicity of the chimeric protein in BALB/c mice. Serum samples of BALB/c mice immunized with NvC or NvC-M2ex3 were collected at three weeks after the primary injection, three weeks after the first booster, and one week after the second booster by submandibular bleeding. Serum samples (1:2000 dilution) from mice (n = 8) of respective groups were pooled and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The microtiter plate wells were coated with the M2e synthetic peptide and the anti-M2e antibody reacted with the peptide was detected with the anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. a, b, and c indicate statistical significance (
