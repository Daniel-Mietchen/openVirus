  <p>Mortality and morbidity of BALB/c mice after lethal influenza A virus infections. Survival rate of mice infected with (
   <bold>A</bold>) H1N1 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) H3N2. Solid and dashed lines indicate the survival rates of the mice immunized with NvC and NvC-M2ex3, respectively. Percentage of body weight of mice infected with (
   <bold>C</bold>) H1N1 and (
   <bold>D</bold>) H3N2. Dashed lines indicate endpoint of the animals. Morbidity of mice infected with (
   <bold>E</bold>) H1N1 and (
   <bold>F</bold>) H3N2. A complete protection against H1N1 or H3N2 infection was observed in the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3. After infection with mouse-adapted H3N2, the mice vaccinated with NvC-M2ex3 did not demonstrate significant weight loss and morbidity. On the contrary, all mice immunized with NvC succumbed to the infections. (●) and (■) indicate the percentage of body weight and morbidity of the mice immunized with NvC and NvC-M2ex3, respectively. The asterisks (* 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) indicate statistical significance of the results between different treatment groups.
