<p>IAV is an enveloped virus with a genome composed of eight segmented, negative-sense RNAs encoding a total of 14 viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two most prominent surface glycoproteins of IAV, and are commonly used as the primary immunogenic components of current influenza vaccines [

 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During a natural infection, HA binds to the sialic acid receptors on the surface of host cells, and subsequently triggers membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the other hand, NA is responsible for the release of virus progenies by cleaving the sialic acid from the infected cells [

 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most antiviral medications against IAV infections, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, target NA [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, exceptionally high mutation rates of HA and NA reduce the efficacy of these antiviral drugs. Thus, influenza A vaccines have to be reformulated annually to counter the rapidly mutating seasonal IAV [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The protective efficacy of current influenza A vaccines varies between 60% to 90% depending on the similarity between the immunogenic components recruited in an annual vaccine formulation and those of the circulating strains [
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the event of an unanticipated pandemic caused by genetic reassortments, seasonal influenza vaccines become less effective, in addition to the considerable amount of time and resources required for a hasty mass production of the pandemic vaccines [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Current prophylactic measures of IAV infections are impeded by rapidly mutating HA and NA. Therefore, employing a viral protein that is conserved across IAV strains is urgently needed for the development of a universal influenza A vaccine.
