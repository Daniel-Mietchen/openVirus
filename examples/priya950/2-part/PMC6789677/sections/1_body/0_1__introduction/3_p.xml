<p>The matrix 2 (M2) protein of IAV is a homotetrameric proton channel responsible for the release of the viral RNAs, and budding of the virus progenies [

 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The M2 protein consists of 97 amino acid residues which can be divided into three segments: (i) an extracellular N-terminal segment, (ii) a transmembrane segment, and (iii) an intracellular C-terminal segment. The extracellular matrix 2 domain (M2e) is composed of 23 amino acid residues which are highly conserved across all human IAV strains, representing a potential candidate for the development of a universal influenza A vaccine [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unlike HA and NA, the M2e is poorly immunogenic, and presents at a very low copy number on the surface of the virion. Even under natural IAV infection, or vaccination with the whole inactivated or live attenuated influenza A vaccine, no notable M2e-specific antibody titer could be detected [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In order to enhance the immunogenicity of M2e, various virus-like particles (VLPs) such as those of hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papilloma virus (HPV), papaya mosaic virus (PMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and T7 bacteriophage were genetically engineered to display M2e on the surface of these VLPs. Some of these chimeric VLPs were shown to induce protective immunity in mice against different IAV challenges [

 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Certain VLPs, such as those of RNA-phages QÎ² and AP205, were shown to induce carrier-induced epitopic suppression (CIES) in mice, a condition that is characterized by the suppression of humoral immune responses directed against the target antigen conjugated to an immunogenic carrier due to pre-existing immunity against the carrier [

 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A similar concern emerged during the development of a human IAV vaccine using the HBV VLP as an antigen carrier [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, CIES in humans could be overcome by using VLPs derived from non-human infecting viruses such as the capsid of nodavirus [
