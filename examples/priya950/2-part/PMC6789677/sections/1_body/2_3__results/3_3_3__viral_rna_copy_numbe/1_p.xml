<p>Viral RNA copy number in the lungs and oropharynges of the infected mice was determined by qPCR using primers specifically targeting the 
 <italic>matrix</italic> gene of IAV. The viral RNA copy number was calculated using Equation (1). The mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 exhibited a 10-fold reduction of viral RNA copy number in the lungs compared to the control group after being challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 (

This result demonstrates the infection-permissive nature of NvC-M2ex3 which allows limited virus replication instead of total inhibition. The oropharynges of the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 also showed a 10-fold reduction in the viral RNA copy number compared to the control group immunized with NvC (
