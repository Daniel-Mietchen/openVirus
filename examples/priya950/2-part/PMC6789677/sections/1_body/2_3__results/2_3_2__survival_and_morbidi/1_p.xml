<p>Three weeks after the last booster, the mice (n = 8) were infected intranasally with 4x LD
 <sub>50</sub> of mouse-adapted H1N1 or H3N2. The infected mice were monitored for survival, weight loss, and morbidity up to 14 days post-infection. All mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 survived the lethal challenges with H1N1 and H3N2, whereas mice treated with NvC succumbed to the infections and died at day six or seven post-infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00091-f002">Figure 2</xref>D,F). The onset of symptoms of H1N1 and H3N2 infections began at day three and four respectively, and peaked at day seven post-infections. The mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 started to convalesce from the infection at day nine and resolved completely at day-12 post-challenged with H1N1. On the other hand, the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 and challenged with H3N2 fully recovered a day after the peak of infection (day eight post-infection) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00091-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F). All mice immunized with NvC exhibited significant weight loss, severe morbidity, and inevitable death following the infections with lethal H1N1 or H3N2. These results demonstrate the protective efficacy of NvC-M2ex3 against IAV H1N1 and H3N2 infections.
