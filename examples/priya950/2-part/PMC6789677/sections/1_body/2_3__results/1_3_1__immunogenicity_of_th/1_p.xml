<p>BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with NvC or NvC-M2ex3. Serum samples of the mice were collected three weeks after the primary administration, three weeks after the first booster, and one week after the second booster. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00091-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the anti-M2e antibody titer in the immunized mice. After the primary injection, no apparent difference was observed in the anti-M2e antibody titer between the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 and the control group injected with NvC. Nevertheless, a distinct spike in the anti-M2e antibody titer was detected in the group immunized with NvC-M2ex3 three weeks after the first booster, and a further increase in the antibody level was observed upon administration of the second booster. Conversely, the control groups immunized with NvC lacking the M2e epitopes did not show any significant increase in the anti-M2e antibody titer. In general, the result reveals that NvC-M2ex3 is highly immunogenic in BALB/c mice, and the anti-M2e antibody titer increased with the number of injections.
