<p>In summary, this study demonstrated a 100% protective efficacy of NvC-M2ex3 against lethal H1N1 and H3N2 infections in BALB/c mice by eliciting M2e specific humoral immune responses while suppressing the replication of IAV. Activation of antiviral cytokines could also potentially contribute to early protection against influenza infections. Recommendations for future studies include investigation of the mechanisms of protection, passive serum transfer, long-term protection, and challenges with different strains of influenza A viruses.</p>
