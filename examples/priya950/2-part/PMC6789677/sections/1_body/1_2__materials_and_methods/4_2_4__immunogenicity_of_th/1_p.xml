<p>The anti-M2e antibody titers in serum samples were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A synthetic peptide of M2e (amino acid sequence: KSLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCNDSSD) was chemically synthesized (Genemed Synthesis Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA); dissolved in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl; pH 7.4), coated (2 µg/mL; 100 µL) on U-bottom 96-well microtiter plate wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were rinsed once with TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.05% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) Tween-20; pH 7.4) and blocked with milk diluent (200 µL; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, the wells were rinsed once with TBST. Serum samples (1:2000 dilution in TBS; 100 µL) were then added into the wells and incubated for 2 h with shaking followed by washing 3 times with TBST. Anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000 dilution in TBS; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added into the wells and incubated for one hour. After washing the wells 3 times with TBST, p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (100 µL) was added, and further incubated for 20 min in the dark. Absorbance at wavelength 405 nm was measured using a VersaMax™ ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).
