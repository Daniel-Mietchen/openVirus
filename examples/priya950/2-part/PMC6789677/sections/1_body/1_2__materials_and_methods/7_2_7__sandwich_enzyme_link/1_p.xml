<p>Quantification of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lung supernatants of mice was performed using the DuoSet
 <sup>®</sup> ELISA Development Systems following the manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-cytokine antibodies (100 µL) were first coated on a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate overnight at room temperature. After washing 3 times with washing buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 8 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.05% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Tween-20; pH 7.4), the wells were blocked with 300 µL of PBS-bovine serum albumin (BSA) (137 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 8 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) BSA; pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed 3 times with the same washing buffer followed by the addition of cytokine standards and the lung supernatants. Following 2 h of incubation at room temperature, unbound cytokine standards or lung supernatant were removed by washing the wells with washing buffer. Antibodies for cytokine detection were then added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the wells were washed again as described above, and the streptavidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme (100 µL) was added to the wells followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Following another washing step, substrate solution (1:1 mixture of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and tetramethylbenzidine; 100 µL) was added to the wells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Lastly, sulphuric acid (1 M; 50 µL) was added to the wells to terminate the reaction and the absorbance at wavelength 450 nm was measured with the VersaMax
 <sup>TM</sup> ELISA Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).
