<p>At three weeks after the last injection, all mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 or NvC were challenged intranasally with 4× median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of mouse-adapted H1N1 or H3N2. LD
 <sub>50</sub> [expressed in 50% egg infective dose (EID
 <sub>50</sub>)] of mouse-adapted H1N1 and H3N2 were 4.94 log
 <sub>10</sub> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL ± 0.08 and 6.68 log
 <sub>10</sub> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL ± 0.17, respectively. Survival rate, body weight loss and morbidity of the infected mice were monitored for 14 days. Mice with body weight loss more than 25% were euthanized by cervical dislocation according to IACUC guidelines. Morbidity of the mice was assessed based on the 4-point scale sickness score which evaluated ruffled fur (1 point), hunched back posture (1 point), and activity of mice (reduced: 1 point, severely reduced: 2 points) (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-07-00091">supplemental file</xref>). The sum of the score of each parameter is the total sickness score where the maximum score is 4 and 0 indicates healthy [
