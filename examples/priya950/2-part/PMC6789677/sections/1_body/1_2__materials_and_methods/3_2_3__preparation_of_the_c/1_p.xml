<p>Expression and purification of NvC and NvC-M2ex3 were carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Groups of female BALB/c mice (n = 8) aged about 6 to 7 weeks were acclimatized for at least a week before being immunized subcutaneously with purified NvC-M2ex3 (0.34 mg/mL; 100 µL) 3 times at 3-week intervals. As a negative control, purified NvC (0.34 mg/mL; 100 µL) was also administered subcutaneously to the mice following the same immunization schedule. The blood of the mice was collected via submandibular bleeding before the first and second boosters and one week after the last booster. The collected blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the sera were collected after two consecutive centrifugations at 1000×
