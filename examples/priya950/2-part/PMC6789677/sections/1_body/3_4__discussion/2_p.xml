<p>Three weeks after the last booster, all mice were challenged with lethal doses of mouse-adapted H1N1 or H3N2. Remarkably, all mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 were 100% protected against both H1N1 and H3N2 challenges compared to the control groups with 100% mortality. Intriguingly, the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 were shown to be more resistant to H3N2 than H1N1 infection, suggesting the protective mechanisms induced by NvC-M2ex3 were more effective against H3N2 than H1N1. Variation in the mechanism of pathogenicity of different strains of IAV may have contributed to different severity in the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3. Previous studies indicated that it is not uncommon for M2e-based vaccines to have different protective efficacies against different strains of IAV [

No apparent weight loss or physical sign of illness was observed in mice vaccinated with NvC-M2ex3 after H3N2 challenges despite slight histological changes being observed in the lungs. Nevertheless, a notable amount of viral RNA was detected in the lungs of all mice challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 with a viral RNA copy number approximately 10-fold lower in the group immunized with NvC-M2ex3 compared to the control groups. As this was a relatively conservative reduction of viral RNA copy number, it is believed that the immune responses triggered by NvC-M2ex3 suppress but do not inhibit virus replication. This result suggests the infection-permissive nature of NvC-M2ex3 which allows controlled virus replication, which is in good agreement with Schotsaert et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who demonstrated similar limited virus replication in the lungs of the mice vaccinated with an M2e-based vaccine. The infection-permissive nature of an M2e-based vaccine is believed to allow natural infection of the host by IAV with reduced morbidity and induction of a more effective T-cell response directed against conserved internal viral proteins. Each new infection exposes the host to new viral antigens, which enables natural update of the host immune responses against different epitopes, inducing a natural heterosubtypic protection in the long run [
