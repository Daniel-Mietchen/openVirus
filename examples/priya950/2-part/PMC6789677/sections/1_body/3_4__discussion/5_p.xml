<p>In comparison to conventional egg-based vaccine production, the approach used in this study is faster, less laborious, and more cost-effective. Apart from the universal antibody-based protective immunity elicited by NvC-M2ex3, its infection-permissive nature can potentially induce the development of natural heterosubtypic protection, contrary to the current licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which was reported to hamper the cross-protectivity of T-cell immunity upon subsequent infection [

 <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic> nodavirus, a virus that only infects the giant freshwater prawn, thereby eliminating the risk of CIES in humans [

Although suppressed viral shedding was detected in the oropharynges of the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3, this may not reflect the risk of virus transmission in mice because influenza A virus does not spread effectively in mice and was reported to be highly dependent on the virus strains and mouse models [
