Despite their abundance in the lungs during RSV infection of both mice and man, the role of neutrophils in viral control and in immune pathology is not clear. Here, antibody mediated neutrophil depletion was used to investigate the degree to which neutrophils impact the lung immune environment, the control of viral replication and the peak severity of disease after RSV infection of mice. Neutrophil depletion did not substantially affect the levels of inflammatory mediators such as type I interferons, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; in response to RSV. In addition, the lack of neutrophils did not change the viral load during RSV infection. Neither neutrophil depletion nor the enhancement of lung neutrophils by administration of the chemoattractant CXCL1 during RSV infection affected disease severity as measured by weight loss. Therefore, in this model of RSV infection, lung neutrophils do not offer obvious benefits to the host in terms of increasing anti-viral inflammatory responses or restricting viral replication and neutrophils do not contribute to disease severity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral infection</kwd><kwd>Acute inflammation</kwd><kwd>Mucosal immunology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust (Wellcome)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109058/Z/15/Z</award-id><award-id>109058/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirsebom</surname><given-names>Freja</given-names></name><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000833</institution-id><institution>Rosetrees Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M37-F1</award-id><award-id>M370-F1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michalaki</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major global pathogen that causes annual epidemics worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. RSV typically infects the upper respiratory tract causing mild disease in healthy adults. However, certain vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, the elderly and infants, are susceptible to RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Severe RSV disease occurs most commonly in infants and RSV infection is the single greatest cause of infant hospitalizations in the developed world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines against RSV and treatment consists of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. RSV infection has major consequences for respiratory health in both early and later life as infants who overcome RSV induced LRTIs are more susceptible to wheeze<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. There is therefore a need for a better understanding of the factors that drive severe RSV disease.</p><p id="Par3">It is well established that the host immune response to RSV is a major determinant of disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The presence of increased number of neutrophils in the lung is a hallmark of severe RSV disease in both mouse and man<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and neutrophils can constitute &#x0003e;90% of the cellular compartment of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during RSV-induced bronchiolitis in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that can be activated to degranulate and secrete a multitude of pre-stored proteolytic enzymes and anti-microbial peptides, undergo oxidative burst and even secrete their own chromatin in a unique form of cell death to form pathogen-trapping, web-like structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The recruitment and activation of neutrophils must be tightly regulated to minimize bystander damage, a cause of immunopathology during both infectious disease and sterile inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Neutrophils are particularly important in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> but their contribution to host defense during viral infections is less clear as the intracellular nature of viruses inherently make them less vulnerable to extracellular methods of attack. However, circulating neutrophils are a predictor of pneumonia risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and, in a mouse model of allergic airway hypersensitivity, rhinovirus can trigger NETosis, inducing type 2 airway responses and lung pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, antibody mediated neutrophil depletion has been used to demonstrate that neutrophils can be both beneficial and detrimental during influenza virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) infection suggesting that the role of neutrophils is complex and may display mouse and virus strain-specific differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Studies of infants with severe RSV disease have implicated neutrophils in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In a&#x000a0;transcriptomic analysis of blood from children with RSV-induced bronchiolitis, transcripts related to neutrophil function were in the top ten over-represented genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, airway IL-8, a neutrophil chemoattractant, correlates with the duration of hospital stay of infants with bronchiolitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and the concentration of neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme stored in azurophilic granules and secreted during activation, is elevated in both the serum and nasal lavage of children with confirmed RSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Finally, a genetic polymorphism in the region upstream of the IL-8 gene, associated with increased IL-8 production, has been found to be more prevalent in infants hospitalized with RSV-induced bronchiolitis compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To study the contribution of neutrophils to anti-viral immunity and pathology, we manipulated the cells <italic>in vivo</italic> during acute RSV infection.

Using a mouse model, we found that neutrophils do not act as major contributors to the pro-inflammatory environment or drive disease severity, despite their abundance in the lung following RSV infection. Furthermore, neutrophils do not appear to be an essential component of the host defense response as they do not restrict viral replication in the lungs. Overall, these data suggest that neutrophils are not exerting a beneficially anti-viral role during RSV infection.</p><p id="Par14">We found that neutrophils do not impair the establishment of an anti-viral, inflammatory immune environment, which is dominated by the production of type I IFNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The induction of type I IFNs by alveolar macrophages (AMs) in response to RSV initiates the upregulation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding anti-viral mediators. This includes CCL2 which recruits anti-viral monocytes to the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Neutrophil depletion did not impair the recruitment of monocytes early during RSV infection; in fact, neutrophil depletion increased the total number of monocytes in the lung during RSV. This has also been observed in a house dust mite model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, neutrophil depletion did not significantly inhibit the levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; as detected in the airways (in BAL fluid) confirming that neutrophils are not a major source of these mediators in the lung during RSV infection. AMs are a known source of these cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, so these data also suggest that AM function during RSV infection does not depend on cross-talk with neutrophils. Recently, it was found that the release of mature IL-1&#x003b2; from AMs during influenza infection requires a neutrophil-derived peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

The disparity between the two studies could suggest that the neutrophil response during RSV infection may differ depending on the mouse or viral strain used and the type of lung sample used for protein detection.</p><p id="Par16">Most RSV studies using antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion do not include untreated, infected controls (e.g. references<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>). Notably, we found that the isotype control antibody seemed to have some off-target effects as it affected the cellular composition of the blood. We also found that RSV-infected, isotype control treated mice produced less IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-6 than the RSV only group. This should be taken into consideration when &#x003b1;-Ly6G is used to deplete neutrophils in other viral lung infections as well as during fungal and bacterial infections and during sterile inflammation. It is known that neutrophils regulate their own recruitment into tissues via a positive feedback loop by secreting MMP-9, a proteolytic enzyme which can degrade the chemoattractant CXCL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. This was reflected in our data by our finding that neutrophil depletion resulted in increased production of CXCL1 in the airways of RSV infected mice.</p><p id="Par17">Neutrophil depletion also demonstrated that neutrophils do not restrict viral replication during RSV infection of C57BL/6 mice <italic>in vivo</italic>.

As neutrophil defense mechanisms are largely extracellular or involve phagocytosis, it is not immediately clear how neutrophils would directly be anti-viral against RSV, especially as the virus is able to spread through the formation of syncytia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that RSV can replicate in neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

Weight loss is considered a readout of disease severity in mice and it is largely driven by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Neutrophil depletion did not affect the recruitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell to the lung, nor was the formation of antigen-specific T cells in the lung altered. In light of this, it is perhaps not surprising that neutrophil depletion did not reduce weight loss in RSV infected mice. During influenza infection, neutrophils have been shown to guide the recruitment of T cells into the lung by leaving trails of the chemokine CXCL12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and neutrophil depletion reduces the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers in the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, infants present with masses of neutrophils during the peak of symptomatic disease while neutrophils are largely absent during the peak of disease severity in mice. Compensating for this by enhancing neutrophil numbers (using rCXCL1) in mice to frequencies comparable to those observed during severe disease in infants did not change the timing or severity of RSV-induced weight loss. Although surprising, these findings challenge the notion that neutrophils are, by default, destructive and demonstrate that even in an extremely delicate tissue such as the lung, the presence of large numbers of airway neutrophils can be tolerated without causing disease. This should also be considered in the context of fungal and bacterial infections which induce infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs. Increasingly, there is evidence to suggest that neutrophils interact with the adaptive immune system and may influence memory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Neutrophil depletion throughout the primary infection did not have a major effect on the generation of memory T cell or T<sub>RM</sub> cell&#x000a0;responses detected during RSV re-challenge. Although we observed a slight decrease in the T<sub>RM</sub> cell frequency in the airways of neutrophil depleted mice after RSV re-challenge, there was no change in the total number of airway T<sub>RM</sub> cells.</p><p id="Par20">While neutrophils are an important line of defense during many inflammatory conditions, their recruitment and activation must be tightly regulated to prevent bystander damage on host tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In a previous study we have shown that the inflammatory environment in the lung induced during RSV infection drives neutrophil activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, we could not detect any major differences in weight loss after neutrophil depletion during RSV infection. In addition, we could not detect any differences in mucus production after neutrophil depletion, although, in a study using a different RSV strain (2&#x02013;20), neutrophil depletion decreased mucin production at day 8 p.i<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It remains possible that neutrophils contribute to lung pathology during RSV infection that does not translate into weight loss. Indeed, neutrophils contribute to disease severity during infection with numerous influenza virus strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, not all studies on influenza virus infection after neutrophil depletion are in agreement on whether neutrophils are beneficial (anti-viral) or detrimental (causing lung damage)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. These discrepancies may be due to the viral strain or dose used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that lung pathology and mucin production are influenced by neutrophils in slightly different ways dependent on which mouse and infection models and type of viral strains used.</p><p id="Par21">As an approach, neutrophil depletion is relatively crude and has the limitation that it removes all the effects of neutrophils, some of which may be beneficial and some detrimental to disease. This might mean that subtle anti-viral effects exerted by neutrophils are not observed in this system. Our data suggest that neutrophil infiltration is not essential for control of viral replication by the host during RSV nor that neutrophil recruitment drives weight loss during RSV infection of mice. These data exclude a beneficial anti-viral role for neutrophils in RSV infection, yet we remain uncertain as to whether neutrophils can cause lung pathology or impact the resolution phase.
