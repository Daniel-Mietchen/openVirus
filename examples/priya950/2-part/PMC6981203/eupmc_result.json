    "Lung and airway neutrophils are a hallmark of severe disease in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lower respiratory tract infections. Despite their abundance in the lungs during RSV infection of both mice and man, the role of neutrophils in viral control and in immune pathology is not clear. Here, antibody mediated neutrophil depletion was used to investigate the degree to which neutrophils impact the lung immune environment, the control of viral replication and the peak severity of disease after RSV infection of mice. Neutrophil depletion did not substantially affect the levels of inflammatory mediators such as type I interferons, IL-6, TNF-α or IL-1β in response to RSV. In addition, the lack of neutrophils did not change the viral load during RSV infection. Neither neutrophil depletion nor the enhancement of lung neutrophils by administration of the chemoattractant CXCL1 during RSV infection affected disease severity as measured by weight loss. Therefore, in this model of RSV infection, lung neutrophils do not offer obvious benefits to the host in terms of increasing anti-viral inflammatory responses or restricting viral replication and neutrophils do not contribute to disease severity."
