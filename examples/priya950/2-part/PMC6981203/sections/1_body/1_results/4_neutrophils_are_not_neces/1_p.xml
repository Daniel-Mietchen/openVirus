<p id="Par12">Finally, we wanted to assess whether neutrophils influence the T cell memory response to RSV, as there is increasing evidence that neutrophils can influence adaptive and memory responses in other infectious disease scenarios

 </sup>. To investigate whether neutrophils influence the generation of lung T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells, mice were treated with α-Ly6G to abrogate neutrophil recruitment throughout the primary RSV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Mice were then re-challenged with RSV i.n. at 21 days p.i. and memory T cell responses were evaluated 4 days post re-challenge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Mice treated with α-Ly6G during the primary RSV infection had comparable recruitment of CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells to the lungs as compared to both untreated, infected mice and to isotype control treated, infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The frequencies of these cell populations were also unchanged between neutrophil depleted and isotype control treated, RSV infected groups (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To assess T cell functionality in RSV infected mice, lung cells were stimulated with the RSV M peptide and cytokine production was assessed by intracellular flow cytometry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). There was no difference in the ability of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells to produce IFN-γ or GzmB following stimulation, suggesting that neutrophil depletion does not affect the functionality of this memory T cell subset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In the airways, there was no significant difference in the total number of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in neutrophil depleted mice as compared to both untreated and isotype control treated RSV infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d,e</xref>). However, the frequency of airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells was significantly reduced in neutrophil-depleted mice as compared to untreated and isotype control treated RSV infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that neutrophils are not majorly influencing the T cell responses during RSV infection.
