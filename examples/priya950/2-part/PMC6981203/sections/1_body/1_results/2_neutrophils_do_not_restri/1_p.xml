 </sup>. To investigate if neutrophils contribute to host defense by restricting RSV replication in the lungs, viral load in the lungs 18 h, 4 and 8 days p.i. was assessed by quantifying RSV L gene by RT-qPCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For antibody mediated neutrophil depletion, mice were treated with α-Ly6G or isotype control one day pre-infection as well as every second day after the infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For these experiments a lower dose of the α-Ly6G and isotype antibodies was used (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>). There was no difference in RSV L gene copy number between the RSV only group, the RSV-infected isotype treated mice or neutrophil depleted mice at any of the time points studied (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). As quantifying RSV L gene by RT-qPCR does not accurately quantify the number of replication-competent RSV particles, we also assessed viral load by immunoplaque assay at day 4 p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), the peak of viral load in the mouse model

 </sup>. There was no significant difference in the number of replication-competent RSV particles quantified in the lungs of isotype control treated and α-Ly6G treated RSV infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), confirming that neutrophils do not contribute to viral control during RSV infection.
