<p id="Par6">To investigate the role of neutrophils during RSV infection, antibody-mediated (α-Ly6G) neutrophil depletion was used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). At 24 h pre-infection, mice were either treated with isotype control antibody or with neutrophil depleting (α-Ly6G) antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), an established strategy that depletes neutrophils for two days
