 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes were increased in α-Ly6G treated mice compared to isotype control treated mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Next, we assessed how neutrophil depletion affects the production of pro-inflammatory immune mediators in the airways in response to RSV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Neutrophil depletion did not affect the levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators IFN-α, IL-6, TNF-α or IL-1β in the airways at 18 h p.i. when compared to RSV infected, isotype control treated mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Isotype control treated, RSV infected mice did accumulate less IFN-α and IL-6 in the airways compared to untreated, infected mice suggesting that the isotype control antibody treatment may have some unspecific effects. Interestingly, concentrations of CXCL1 (and 
 <italic>Cxcl1</italic> mRNA), a major neutrophil chemoattractant
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>, were significantly increased in the airways of RSV infected, α-Ly6G treated mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). We also assessed the expression of transcripts encoding inflammatory mediators such as 
 <italic>Cxcl2, Cxcl12, Il1a</italic> and 
 <italic>Il1b</italic>, which again showed that it was unaffected by neutrophil depletion (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a,b</xref>). Finally, neutrophil depletion during RSV infection did not affect the induction of 
 <italic>Il33, Areg</italic> and 
 <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, representing alarmins and mediators associated with tissue repair (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>), and did not impact expression of genes associated with mucus production (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>).
