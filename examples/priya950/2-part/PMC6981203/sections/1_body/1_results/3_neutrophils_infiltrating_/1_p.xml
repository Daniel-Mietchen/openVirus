<p id="Par9">As neutrophil recruitment did not appear to be beneficial to the host by limiting RSV replication, we next wanted to assess whether it was detrimental by driving or enhancing disease severity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Neutrophil recruitment to the lung is very transient; recruitment peaks early at 18 h p.i. and neutrophils are largely absent by 36 h p.i

 </sup>. Therefore, mice were treated with α-Ly6G one day pre-infection as well as one day p.i. to ensure adequate depletion up to 72 h p.i. (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). To quantify disease severity, weight loss was measured throughout as this is a well-established readout of severity of RSV infection

 </sup>. Neutrophil depletion early during RSV infection of C57BL/6 mice did not impact weight loss throughout the infection (Supp. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). We confirmed this finding by repeating the experiment in BALB/c mice, a strain more susceptible to RSV than C57BL/6 mice
