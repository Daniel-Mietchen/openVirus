<p id="Par10">Although the peak of lung neutrophils occurs early during RSV infection, neutrophils are also recruited into the lung during disease on days 5–7 p.i. concurrently with T cells, which are the primary cause of weight loss

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. To confirm that neither the early neutrophil influx nor the T cell associated neutrophil influx contribute to weight loss during RSV infection, neutrophils were depleted throughout the infection by treatment with α-Ly6G every other day, starting at day -1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). There was no difference in weight loss between α-Ly6G treated and isotype control treated mice during the infection even if untreated RSV infected mice lost more weight on days 7 and 8 p.i. than either isotype control or α-Ly6G treated RSV infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Neither the frequency nor total number of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was affected by neutrophil depletion during RSV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,c</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophil depletion did not influence the frequency or total number of RSV-specific (tetramer
 <sup>+</sup>) CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells on day 8 p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,c</xref>).
