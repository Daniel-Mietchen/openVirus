 </sup>. One ml PBS supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA was used to flush the lungs three times. The BAL was centrifuged, and supernatant stored at −80 °C. The cells were incubated 2 min in ACK buffer (0.15 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl, 1.0 mM KHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA) to lyse red blood cells (RBCs) and the cell number was determined by Trypan Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) exclusion of dead cells. Cells obtained from the BAL were termed airway cells throughout. Airway cells were either stained for flow cytometry or the cellular composition was determined by spinning 1–2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells onto a microscope slide (Thermo Scientific) at 450 rpm for 5 min using Cytospin 4 Cytocentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slides were H&amp;E stained using Reastain Quick-Diff kit (Gentaur), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Neutrophils were imaged using a light microscope and determined by nuclear morphology.
