<p id="Par29">Lungs were homogenized using a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen) and total RNA was extracted from the lung tissue supernatant using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). 2 µg of RNA was converted to cDNA using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR was performed with Quantitect Probe PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). RSV L gene mRNA was quantified as previously described

 </sup>. For exact quantification, copy numbers were calculated from a plasmid DNA standard curve and normalized to 
 <italic>Gapdh</italic> (encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). For mRNA analysis of

 <italic>Muc5ac</italic> gene specific primers and probes were used (all Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR was performed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). To quantify relative mRNA expression the mean ΔCT was calculated for each target gene relative to 
 <italic>Gapdh</italic> and expressed as 2
