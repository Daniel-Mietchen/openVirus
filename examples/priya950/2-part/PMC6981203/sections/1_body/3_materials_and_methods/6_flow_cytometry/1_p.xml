<p id="Par28">For flow cytometry staining, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> lung, airway or blood cells were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with a purified rat IgG2b α–mouse CD16/CD32 receptor antibody (BD) to block Fc binding in FACS buffer. For surface staining, cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD45 (30-F11, BV605/APC eFluor 780), CD11b (M1/70, AF700), CD64 (X54-5/7.1, FITC), Ly6G (1A8, BV570/FITC), CD3 (17A2, AF700), Ly6C (HK1.4, eFluor450), CD19 (6D5, FITC), CD69 (H1.2F3, BUV737), CD62L (MEL-14, BV421), CD11c (HL3, PE-CF594), CD4 (GK1.5, PE), CD8 (53–6.7, eFluor 780), CD103 (2E7, PerCP-Cy5.5), GzmB (GB11, PE-CF594), IFN-γ (XMG1.2, BV711) for 25 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with fixable live-dead Aqua dye (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cells were fixed by incubation with 100 µl 1% paraformaldehyde or Cytofix™ Fixation Buffer (BD) for 20 min at 4 °C and stored in FACS buffer. For RSV M Tetramer staining, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated M
 <sub>187–195</sub> tetramers (H-2Db/NAITNAKII) were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA). Tetramer staining was performed following Fc-block and prior to surface staining for 30 min in PBS containing 1% BSA and 5 mM EDTA. For intracellular staining the cells were re-stimulated with 5 μg/ml RSV M
 <sub>187–195</sub> peptide for 1 h at 37 °C. After addition of Golgi Plug (BD Biosciences) the samples were incubated for another 3 h, stained for surface marker expression as described above and fixed in fixation buffer (Biolegend). Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against granzyme B (GB11, PE-CF594) and IFN-γ (XMG1.2, BV711) in the presence of purified rat IgG2b anti-mouse CD16/CD32 receptor antibody in permeabilization buffer (Biolegend) for 1 h. Analysis was performed on a BD LSR Fortessa. Acquisition was set to 250,000 single, live, CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells. All antibodies were purchased from BD, BioLegend, or eBioscience. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Total cell populations were quantified as the whole lung count x (%population of CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells) x (%CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cell of live cells) x (proportion of lung tissue sampled).
