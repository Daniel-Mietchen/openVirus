<p id="Par5">To study the contribution of neutrophils to anti-viral immunity and pathology, we manipulated the cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> during acute RSV infection. Neutrophil depletion did not affect the overall early inflammatory landscape in the lungs, viral replication or the timing or severity of disease. Similarly, increasing the number of neutrophils by administration of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 either early during the infection or later at the peak of disease did not contribute to disease severity as measured by weight loss. Our findings support recent literature

 </sup> that in many inflammatory contexts the potentially pathogenic bystander effects of neutrophils can be controlled and tolerated, even by a structurally delicate tissue such as the lung.
