 </sup> and the concentration of neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme stored in azurophilic granules and secreted during activation, is elevated in both the serum and nasal lavage of children with confirmed RSV

 </sup>. Finally, a genetic polymorphism in the region upstream of the IL-8 gene, associated with increased IL-8 production, has been found to be more prevalent in infants hospitalized with RSV-induced bronchiolitis compared to controls
