 </sup>. RSV typically infects the upper respiratory tract causing mild disease in healthy adults. However, certain vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, the elderly and infants, are susceptible to RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Severe RSV disease occurs most commonly in infants and RSV infection is the single greatest cause of infant hospitalizations in the developed world

 </sup>. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines against RSV and treatment consists of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units
