<p id="Par3">It is well established that the host immune response to RSV is a major determinant of disease severity

 </sup>. The presence of increased number of neutrophils in the lung is a hallmark of severe RSV disease in both mouse and man
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> and neutrophils can constitute &gt;90% of the cellular compartment of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during RSV-induced bronchiolitis in infants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that can be activated to degranulate and secrete a multitude of pre-stored proteolytic enzymes and anti-microbial peptides, undergo oxidative burst and even secrete their own chromatin in a unique form of cell death to form pathogen-trapping, web-like structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. The recruitment and activation of neutrophils must be tightly regulated to minimize bystander damage, a cause of immunopathology during both infectious disease and sterile inflammation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Neutrophils are particularly important in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> but their contribution to host defense during viral infections is less clear as the intracellular nature of viruses inherently make them less vulnerable to extracellular methods of attack. However, circulating neutrophils are a predictor of pneumonia risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> and, in a mouse model of allergic airway hypersensitivity, rhinovirus can trigger NETosis, inducing type 2 airway responses and lung pathology
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, antibody mediated neutrophil depletion has been used to demonstrate that neutrophils can be both beneficial and detrimental during influenza virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) infection suggesting that the role of neutrophils is complex and may display mouse and virus strain-specific differences
