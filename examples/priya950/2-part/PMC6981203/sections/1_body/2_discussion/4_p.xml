<p id="Par16">Most RSV studies using antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion do not include untreated, infected controls (e.g. references

 </sup>). Notably, we found that the isotype control antibody seemed to have some off-target effects as it affected the cellular composition of the blood. We also found that RSV-infected, isotype control treated mice produced less IFN-α and IL-6 than the RSV only group. This should be taken into consideration when α-Ly6G is used to deplete neutrophils in other viral lung infections as well as during fungal and bacterial infections and during sterile inflammation. It is known that neutrophils regulate their own recruitment into tissues via a positive feedback loop by secreting MMP-9, a proteolytic enzyme which can degrade the chemoattractant CXCL1

 </sup>. This was reflected in our data by our finding that neutrophil depletion resulted in increased production of CXCL1 in the airways of RSV infected mice.
