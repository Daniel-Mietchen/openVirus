<p id="Par21">As an approach, neutrophil depletion is relatively crude and has the limitation that it removes all the effects of neutrophils, some of which may be beneficial and some detrimental to disease. This might mean that subtle anti-viral effects exerted by neutrophils are not observed in this system. Our data suggest that neutrophil infiltration is not essential for control of viral replication by the host during RSV nor that neutrophil recruitment drives weight loss during RSV infection of mice. These data exclude a beneficial anti-viral role for neutrophils in RSV infection, yet we remain uncertain as to whether neutrophils can cause lung pathology or impact the resolution phase. RSV infection induces neutrophil activation and degranulation, causing the secretion of proteolytic enzymes into the lung
