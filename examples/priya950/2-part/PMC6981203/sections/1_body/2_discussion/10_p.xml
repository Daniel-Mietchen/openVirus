<p id="Par22">Our findings suggest that neutrophils are not required for the induction of an anti-viral inflammatory environment and do not appear important for the control of viral replication in the lungs during RSV infection of C57BL/6 mice. Most surprisingly, we did not find that removal or exacerbation of the number of airway neutrophils had consequences on either the timing or severity of RSV induced disease measured by weight loss. Overall, our data suggest that the potentially pathogenic bystander effects of neutrophils can be controlled and tolerated in the lung during RSV infection.</p>
