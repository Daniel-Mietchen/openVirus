 </sup>. Furthermore, infants present with masses of neutrophils during the peak of symptomatic disease while neutrophils are largely absent during the peak of disease severity in mice. Compensating for this by enhancing neutrophil numbers (using rCXCL1) in mice to frequencies comparable to those observed during severe disease in infants did not change the timing or severity of RSV-induced weight loss. Although surprising, these findings challenge the notion that neutrophils are, by default, destructive and demonstrate that even in an extremely delicate tissue such as the lung, the presence of large numbers of airway neutrophils can be tolerated without causing disease. This should also be considered in the context of fungal and bacterial infections which induce infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs. Increasingly, there is evidence to suggest that neutrophils interact with the adaptive immune system and may influence memory responses

 </sup>. Neutrophil depletion throughout the primary infection did not have a major effect on the generation of memory T cell or T
 <sub>RM</sub> cellÂ responses detected during RSV re-challenge. Although we observed a slight decrease in the T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell frequency in the airways of neutrophil depleted mice after RSV re-challenge, there was no change in the total number of airway T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells.
