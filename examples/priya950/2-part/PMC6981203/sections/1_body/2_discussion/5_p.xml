<p id="Par17">Neutrophil depletion also demonstrated that neutrophils do not restrict viral replication during RSV infection of C57BL/6 mice

 </sup>. As neutrophil defense mechanisms are largely extracellular or involve phagocytosis, it is not immediately clear how neutrophils would directly be anti-viral against RSV, especially as the virus is able to spread through the formation of syncytia
