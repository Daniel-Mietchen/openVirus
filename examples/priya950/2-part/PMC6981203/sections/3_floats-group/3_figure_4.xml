  <p>Neutrophils do not influence the recruitment of T cells to the lung on day 8 post RSV infection. C57BL/6 mice were mock (PBS) or RSV infected. To deplete neutrophils, 150 µg i.p. α-Ly6G or isotype control antibody was administered on day −1 and on every second day throughout the infection. (

   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for gating strategy). Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of 5 individual mice per group from one experiment. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. Only the statistical significances between RSV infected groups are shown. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01.
