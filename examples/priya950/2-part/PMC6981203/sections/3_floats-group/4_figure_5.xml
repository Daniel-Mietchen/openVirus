  <p>Accumulation of lung neutrophils during RSV infection does not affect weight loss. C57BL/6 or wt mice were mock (PBS) or RSV infected. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Lung neutrophils were increased by treatment with 10 µg CXCL1 i.n. 6 h p.i. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Frequency and total number of airway neutrophils 18 h p.i. (Supp. Figure 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for full gating strategy). (
   <bold>c</bold>) Weight loss as percentage of original weight. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Lung neutrophils were increased by treatment with 5 µg CXCL1 i.n. day 4, 5, 6 and 7 p.i. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Weight loss as percentage of original weight. Data from (
   <bold>b)</bold> are presented as mean ± SEM of 3 individual mice per group from one experiment. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Data from (
   <bold>c)</bold> are presented as mean ± SEM of 4 (PBS and RSV/CXCL1) and 7 (RSV/PBS) individual mice from one experiment. Data from (
   <bold>e)</bold> are presented as mean ± SEM of 4 (RSV/CXCL1) or 5 (RSV/PBS) individual mice from one experiment. For (
   <bold>b)</bold>, statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. For (
   <bold>c</bold>,
   <bold>e</bold>) statistical significance of differences was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test. Only the statistical significances between RSV infected groups are shown. ***P ≤ 0.001.
