  <p>Neutrophils do not restrict viral replication during RSV infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) C57BL/6 or wt mice were mock (PBS) or RSV infected for 18 h, 4 and 8 days. To deplete neutrophils, 150 µg i.p. α-Ly6G or isotype control antibody was administered on days −1, 1, 3, 5 and 7. (
   <bold>b</bold>) RSV L gene copy number was quantified in lung tissue by RT-qPCR. Copy numbers were determined using a plasmid standard and the results were normalized to 
   <italic>Gapdh</italic> levels. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Infectious viral particles in the lung on day 4 were quantified by immunoplaque assay. Data from (
   <bold>b)</bold> are presented as the mean ± SEM from 25 PBS (pooled from each time point) and 8–12 RSV (18 h and day 4) pooled from two independent experiments or 4–5 individual mice from one (day 8) experiment. Statistical significance of differences was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test. Data from (
   <bold>c)</bold> are presented as the mean ± SEM of 9 (PBS) or 10 (RSV isotype/α-Ly6G) individual mice pooled from two independent experiments. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
