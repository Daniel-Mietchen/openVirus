  <p>Antibody mediated (α-Ly6G) neutrophil depletion does not impair monocyte recruitment 18 h post RSV infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Wt mice were mock (PBS) or RSV infected for 18 h. Mice were given 200 µg i.n. and 500 µg i.p. α-Ly6G or isotype control antibody day −1. (

   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for gating strategy). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM from 5 (PBS), 3 (RSV) or 8–12 (RSV+ antibody treatment) individual mice pooled from two or three independent experiments. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. Only the statistical significances between RSV infected groups are shown. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
