  <p>Neutrophils do not contribute to the induction of a pro-inflammatory immune environment in the lungs 18 h post RSV infection. Wt mice were mock (PBS) or RSV infected for 18 h. To deplete neutrophils, RSV infected mice were given 200 µg i.n. and 500 µg i.p. α-Ly6G or isotype control antibody day −1. (
   <bold>a</bold>) IFN-α, IL-6 and TNF-α. (
   <bold>b</bold>) IL-1β and (
   <bold>c</bold>) CXCL1 were quantified in the BAL by ELISA. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM from 5 (PBS) or 8–12 (RSV) individual mice pooled from two or three independent experiments. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. The dotted line in (
   <bold>b</bold>) represents the detection limit. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. Only the statistical significances between RSV infected groups are shown. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
