<p> We thank the reviewer for their useful suggestions. We agree that the timeframe of the review does not capture many earlier studies in the entomological literature pertaining to arbovirus vectors, and have therefore reframed our scoping reviewâ€™s questions to focus more specifically on identifying and characterizing the literature related to vector species composition and arbovirus transmission dynamics in a region of recent arbovirus introduction and ongoing co-circulation. This justification for including studies from 2013 is now stated in the Introduction on lines 5-9 of page 5. </p>
