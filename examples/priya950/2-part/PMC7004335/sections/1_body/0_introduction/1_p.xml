<p>Arboviruses, or arthropod-borne viruses, comprise a diverse group of viruses mostly transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, including globally spreading viruses causing human disease, such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. The term arbovirus does not encompass a taxonomically distinct group, but these viruses have similar life-history and transmission patterns that make information gleaned from one virus potentially useful to the understanding, and therefore prevention and control, of the others.</p>
