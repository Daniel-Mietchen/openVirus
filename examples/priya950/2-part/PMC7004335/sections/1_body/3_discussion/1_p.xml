<p>Our scoping review included studies focused on vector species composition and arbovirus transmission dynamics of Zika, dengue and/or chikungunya in the Americas. We observed a steady increase in number of publications, from 2013 to 2018, with half of all studies published from January 2017 to March 2018. Sightly less than half of all studies included in this review were specifically pertaining to virus transmission dynamics. Around a third of all studies addressed vector species composition. The remainder treated aspects of both sections. Most studies focused on 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> as the vector species of interest, had an exclusively laboratory-based or modelling-based study framework, and focused exclusively on either Zika or dengue. One limitation of our study is the use of a single search engine, PubMed, which may have reduced the number of included publications in our scoping review. However, given the focus of our scoping review, we believe this search engine should have captured almost all, if not all, relevant studies.
