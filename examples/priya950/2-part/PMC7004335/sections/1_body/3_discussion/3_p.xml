<p>Based on the internationally recognized urgency of Zika virus infection as a public health concern, and potential increase in the importance of this and other emerging arboviruses in the future, further research on Zika virus transmission dynamics is of pressing need. Also, given the ongoing co-circulation of these three globally spreading arboviruses in the Americas, and the resulting complexity of their transmission dynamics, more integrative studies are needed that investigate a combination of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses and use a variety of approaches to answer questions relating to the risk posed by these arboviruses.</p>
