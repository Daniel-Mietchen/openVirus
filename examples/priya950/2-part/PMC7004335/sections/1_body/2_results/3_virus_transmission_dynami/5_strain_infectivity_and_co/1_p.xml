<p>Six studies examined the infectivity of different dengue viral strains, and the impact of co-infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Muturi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found that infection with DENV-4 rendered 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> significantly less susceptible to secondary infection with DENV-2. Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] modelled interactions between dengue viral serotypes. Quiner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] studied the infectivity of different isolates of DENV-2, and found NI-2B to have a replicative advantage over NI-1 until 12 days following infection, after which the advantage had dissipated. Quintero-Gil et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] found that the DENV-2 serotype performed with a thousand-fold greater efficiency than the DENV-3 serotype, upon co-infection. In parallel, Serrato-Salas et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] found that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were significantly less susceptible to secondary dengue infection, after having been challenged with an inactive version of the virus. Vazeille et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] found that DENV-4 outperformed DENV-1 in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> upon co-infection. Nuckols et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] artificially infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> with chikungunya and DENV-2 simultaneously, separately, and in reverse order. Simultaneous dissemination was detected in all groups upon co-infection, and co-transmission occurred at low rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Rückert et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that the co-infection of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> with Zika, chikungunya and dengue viruses minimally affected vector competence, and that vectors were able to transmit each viral pair, as well as three viruses simultaneously. Alto et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] found 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> to be susceptible to Indian Ocean and Asian chikungunya virus genotypes.
