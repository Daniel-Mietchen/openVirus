<p>Three studies examined the effects of larval competition on dengue vector competence [

 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Bara et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] found that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larval competition resulted in significantly longer development times, lower emergence rates, and smaller adults, but did not significantly affect the extrinsic incubation period of DENV-2 virus. Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] found that larval-stage crowding and nutritional limitation led to lower survival rates until pupation, lower blood feeding success, slower development, smaller adult body size, and lower susceptibility to DENV-2 infection. Four studies examined a variety of blood meal characteristics on arboviral infection rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Fresh Zika-infected blood meal was associated with significantly higher infection rates than frozen Zika-infected blood meal [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, Zika-infected whole blood meal was associated with significantly higher infection rates than Zika-infected protein meal [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hill et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] studied the impact of antibiotics on dengue infection rate and mosquito fertility, and found no significant association in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Mosquitoes exposed to DENV-2 were more likely to re-feed than those that were unexposed [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Sylvestre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] studied the impact of DENV-2 infection on 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> life history traits, and found that it significantly affected feeding behaviour, survival, fecundity, and oviposition success.
