<p>Articles were selected if they were related to vector species composition and/or virus transmission dynamics, if they were related to Zika, dengue and/or chikungunya arboviruses, and if they were related to the ongoing virus circulation in the Americas. Other inclusion criteria included availability of an English language version and investigation of primary data. Studies that specifically examined the impacts of vector control measures, or studies that were unrelated to vector-borne aspects of disease, vector competence or entomological measures, were excluded due to the degree of scope expansion that would be caused by their inclusion.</p>
