<p id="Par39">In Thailand, the distribution of EV-A71 subgenogroups varied by year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Since 2001, enteroviruses monitoring in Thailand indicated the circulation of subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, C4, and C5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. During 2001 to 2004, molecularly confirmed EV-A71 belonged to subgenogroup C1, with subgenogroup B4 detected only rarely. However, notably, compared with the other subgenogroups, B5 first appeared in Thailand in 2006 and became the predominant subgenogroup beginning in 2010 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. During the EV-A71 B5 outbreak in 2017, two patients with subgenogroup C4 were also detected in the northern part, indicating the co-circulation of B5 and C4 in Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Subsequent subgenotypic replacement events of EV-A71 in Thailand have been observed in a different context. For instance, the prevalence of subgenogroup C4b displaced C4a in 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. These observations provide evidence for the role of natural selection pressure in the replacement of the latter subgenogroups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. The existence of recombination within genome regions of subgenogroup B5 and C4 in Thailand was also demonstrated through comparison the results of similarity plot and bootscan analyses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>].
