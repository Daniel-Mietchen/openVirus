<p id="Par33">Based on phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene, EV-A71 is currently classified into four genotypes designated A, B, C and D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Genotypes B and C are individually sub-classified into B1-B5 and C1-C5. New genotypes (E, F, and G) were recently proposed, most of which were detected in central Africa, Madagascar, and India, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Genotype A was last isolated from an encephalitis case 50 years ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], no representative virus had been detected until 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>].
