<p id="Par42">Currently, the availability of EV-A71 vaccine approved for use in some Asian countries may offer a partial solution in blunting disease transmission, but the lack of convincing evidence for the induction of cross-protection among the diversity of subgenogroups in circulation throughout the region and globally, including CV-A6 and CV-A16 associated with HFMD, remains to be addressed. In addition, it remains unclear what the optimal target age group and schedule for vaccination should be. Furthermore, the potential of the widespread use of the vaccine affecting the landscape of other EV-A71 subgenotypes in circulation remains another concern. Ongoing development of multivalent vaccines demonstrating cross-protection against EV-A71/CV-A6/CV-A16 could provide additional benefits towards the reduction of HFMD outbreaks. Additional strategies in preventing EV-related diseases burden, including the establishment of a regional HFMD disease network, transnational co-operation in vaccine research and evaluation, and standardized diagnostic methodologies with defined clinical characterization on a disease severity scale may assist in a more accurate capture of disease impact in this highly dynamic and culturally diverse region.</p>
