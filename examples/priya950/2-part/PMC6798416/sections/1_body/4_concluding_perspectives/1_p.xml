<p id="Par41">An upsurge in HFMD outbreaks associated with EV-A71 occurred during the last decade. The changing epidemiology of EV-A71 in Asia-Pacific countries has seen patterns of recurring outbreaks every 2–3 years with varying frequency and clinical severity. Outbreaks in Asia have shaped the development of fast and reliable multiplex real-time RT-PCR specific towards the most prevalent viruses associated with HFMD, namely EV-A71, CV-A6, and CV-A16. As other EV types emerge, which could potentially replace the current viral circulation, new methods may be required to identify them with increasing accuracy. We have already seen that outbreaks in mainland China cause predominantly by the subgenotype C4 resulted in its inclusion in the vaccine. With new EV-A71 outbreaks, researchers gained additional genetic sequence information and clinicians identify additional range of symptoms, which assist in establishing patterns in disease progression and clinical outcome so valuable in the management of symptoms. Increased awareness of EV-A71 infection in the communities can potentially stem widespread transmission seen in past outbreaks, and fatalities associated with EV-A71 outbreaks appear to be on the decline, at least for now.</p>
