<p id="Par25">As a well-developed city-state with good public health and medical system, Singapore has long required reporting of many infectious diseases including HFMD. Reports of HFMD epidemics in Singapore have been reported in 1972 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] and in 1981 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Since then, occurrence of HFMD and aseptic meningitis associated with EV-A71 was reported in 1987 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Most enterovirus infections occurred in children &lt; 4 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Monitoring of enterovirus reports showed that CV-A16 (40%) and EV-A71 (30%) predominated at several children centers, kindergartens, and schools between 2001 and 2007 [
