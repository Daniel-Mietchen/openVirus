 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. National surveillance of HFMD has since been carried out by Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases in approximately 3000 pediatric medical sentinel sites by July 1981 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. HFMD in Japan has an epidemiological pattern with outbreaks averaging every 3 years, several of which occurred in last decade. During the summer of 2011, Japan had the largest epidemic of HFMD on record. A total of 347,362 cases were reported, with most cases occurring in children younger than 3 years of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. CV-A6 infection was responsible in the majority of cases, with co-circulation of CV-A16 and EV-A71 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Nationwide epidemics ensued in 2013, 2015 and 2017 with 1515 cases, 1590 cases and 1900 cases, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The outbreak in Japan has particular relevance because of the active circulation of CV-A6 since 2011, while EV-A71 was less predominantly observed in the epidemics of 2010 and 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Thereafter, EV-A71 was sporadically detected from October 2014 onward, but its increase activity began at the end of 2017 when it became the predominant serotype in 2018 with approximately 70,000 reported cases [
