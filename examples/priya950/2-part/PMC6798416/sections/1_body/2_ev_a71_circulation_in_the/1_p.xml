 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Since 1997, an unprecedented increase in the number of EV-A71 infection has primarily been attributed to the circulation of two genotypes, B and C. Here, we compile reports of EV-A71 outbreaks in different countries of the Pacific region during the last two decades.
