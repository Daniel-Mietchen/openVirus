<p id="Par15">Historically, EV-A71 was first isolated from the feces of a female encephalitis patient in 1969 in California [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A retrospective analysis by a group in The Netherlands suggests that it could have emerged there as early as 1963 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], consistent with records of probable epidemic of EV-A71 in the late nineteenth century in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Between 1972 and 1990, EV-A71 outbreaks were reported in New York (1972 and 1977) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Sweden (1973) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Bulgaria (1975) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Hungary (1978) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], The Netherlands (1986) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and Brazil (1988â€“1990) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More recently, EV-A71 and other enterovirus A infections are recognized as a major public health concern, especially after yearly HFMD outbreaks in several Asia-Pacific countries. Clinical manifestation and severity of EV-A71 and other enterovirus infections are very similar, but their genetic background and pathogenic potential are notably different. As such, early and effective diagnostic techniques are required to differentiate these enteroviruses necessary for appropriate clinical management. Virus isolation has been the traditional diagnostic method to detect EV-A71, which involves taking clinical samples from patients and culturing in a variety of cell lines of human (RD, HEK293, HEp-2, HeLa cells) or other primate origin (Vero and COS-7 cells) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, this method has gradually been replaced by more sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostics. Work pioneered by Oberste et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] utilizes reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to examine the VP1 region, which combined with nucleotide sequencing could reveal the viral serotypes. Nowadays, most diagnostic laboratories follow three basic techniques to definitively identify EV-A71, primarily isolation using tissue cultures, conventional immunological methods (indirect immunofluorescence and/or neutralization assay) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and nucleotide sequences from gene amplification using conventional and/or real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The evolving methodologies used to diagnose and identify EV-A71 over the past decades have therefore confound the comparison of regional and temporal prevalence of EV-A71. In addition, variation in the detection methods used in different countries and settings may also influence the effectiveness of disease surveillance and ultimately mortality and morbidity rate reported in the literatures.
