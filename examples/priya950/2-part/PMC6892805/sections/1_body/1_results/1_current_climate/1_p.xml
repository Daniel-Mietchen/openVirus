<p id="Par6">Spatial order is observed in the timing of onset of the RSV epidemic and the dynamic patterns of incidence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, e</xref>). Mid-western and northern counties in the United States have biennial cycles which alternate between high and low incidence years (Fig.

 </sup>. Coastal and southern US locations exhibit annual cycles of incidence where cases peak seasonally and then disappear in the off-season. Counties in Florida and most Mexican states also experience annual cycles of incidence, although the epidemic in these locations persists throughout the year resulting in a shallow-trough cycle. The earliest onset of the epidemic occurs in the summer months simultaneously in Miami, Florida, and the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Onset timing then follows a latitudinal gradient northward such that onset occurs last in the northern US in late December (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The timing of school semesters is unlikely to drive this gradient: while US school start dates vary by state, in Mexico the first day of the school year is more broadly standardized across the country
