<p id="Par9">The constructed dataset of empirical transmission rates is included in a panel regression model, where log transmission is the dependent variable and climate variables are the independent variables. Our main regression specification includes a suite of controls: specifically, county-by-month dummies to remove potential confounding from location-specific seasonal aggregation such as school semesters, and county-by-year dummies to remove confounding from location-specific episodic events. As in the descriptive analysis, we include both precipitation and specific humidity in our baseline regression model. Results for temperature are included in Supplementary Fig.Â
