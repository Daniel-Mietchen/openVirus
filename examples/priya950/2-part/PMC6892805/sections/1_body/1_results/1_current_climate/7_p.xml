<p id="Par12">Many Mexican states show a similar result to Miami. However, for some states such as Sinaloa our model predicts two optimal times for transmission within a year, one driven by low humidity and the other driven by increasing rainfall. These two peaks are visible in the Sinaloa incidence time series (Fig.

 </sup>, our results provide evidence for the climatic variation driving these observed dynamics. Across the dataset we find that locations with biennial dynamics experienced larger seasonal changes in predicted transmission than locations with shallow-trough dynamics (Fig.
