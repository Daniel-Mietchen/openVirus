<p id="Par15">The uncertainty in the size of simulated epidemics depends on the relative role of precipitation in driving the transmission cycle in a particular location. For instance, the seasonal cycle of RSV in Sonora is mostly driven by changes to humidityÂ (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), meaning that deviations from mean precipitation do not alter cycle dynamics. However, in Oaxaca, where humidity remains constant throughout the year, differences in future rainfall across CMIP5 models result in divergent cycle dynamics. High precipitation results in a bifurcation, leading to biennial outbreak cycles.
