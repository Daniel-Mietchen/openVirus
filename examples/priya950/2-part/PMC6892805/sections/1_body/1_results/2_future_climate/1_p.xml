<p id="Par13">In our historical analysis we made the conservative assumption of removing local seasonal variation and local year-to-year mean variation with the inclusion of dummy variables, essentially looking at the effect of climate anomalies on transmission. These dummy variables subsume both annual climate variations and social drivers of transmission. In future projections we refit the model without these dummy variables to explore the maximum likely effect of climate on future transmission (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>, using a common seasonal effect across locations to capture schooling generates similar results: Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). We run simulations varying the mean transmission rate and the amplitude of the seasonal change in transmission, holding birth rates and population constant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a left). As the amplitude increases, cycles tend to become more biennial and eventually chaotic

 </sup>. We find that increases to specific humidity, driven by higher temperatures, result in reduced transmission and a lower amplitude of seasonal transmission, with locations in our dataset no longer experiencing the very dry conditions that drive larger seasonal transmission changes. This results in cycles becoming more annual and shallower on average: a northward latitudinal shift in the types of dynamic patterns observed.
