<p id="Par16">We evaluate the CMIP5 model uncertainty by calculating differences between individual 2100 model projections and 2010 estimates of the seasonal change in transmission across all locations in the dataset (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). For many locations in the United States, model differences in rainfall projections do not alter the mean decline in seasonal transmission change. In these locations the RSV cycle is driven primarily by changes to humidity. However, for Mexico, Florida, and coastal parts of the western US, there is a large divergence across models and extreme rainfall increases the seasonal transmission change in multiple scenarios. In these locations, the future dynamics of RSV will hinge on future rainfall, and reducing uncertainty across climate models will help better predict and prepare for potential changes to RSV epidemic intensity.
