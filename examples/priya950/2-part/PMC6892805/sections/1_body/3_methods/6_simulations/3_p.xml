<p id="Par36">We run simulations over the parameter space of mean transmission and seasonal change in transmission values with the aim of evaluating (1) the location of bifurcations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a left plot) and (2) the difference between present and 2100 future projected dynamics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a right plot). In order to smoothly vary the seasonal change in transmission across the parameter space we use a cosine function to represent seasonality in humidity. Simulations are run for 50 years to remove the effect of transients and only the last 10 years are analyzed. To keep other factors constant, demographics in these simulations are based on Kings County, New York. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a (right), we plot an arrow for each location within our dataset where the base of the arrow represents the estimated present parameter values and the point of the arrow represents the projected future parameter values.
