<p id="Par37">To produce Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b we run simulations this time allowing seasonal climate variations to fully specify the seasonal and mean transmission rate, removing the cosine structure. We take output from all 23 climate models included in the CMIP5 mean. For each model we calculate the ratio of the week-of-year average rainfall at the end of the century to the start of the century (using a 5-year average anomaly in each case). We then apply this ratio to the observed precipitation in our dataset also averaged over a 5-year period to minimize bias from comparing model output to observational data. We apply the same method to the model-mean specific humidity. Projected precipitation and humidity are input into Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="">7</xref>) to calculate a seasonally varying transmission rate. Forward simulations are run for 50 years to remove transients with only the last 5 years shown in Fig.
