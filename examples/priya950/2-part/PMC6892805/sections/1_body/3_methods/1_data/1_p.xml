<p id="Par21">The US county-level RSV dataset comes from hospitalizations data originally obtained from the State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). HCUP SIDs data represents on average 96% of community hospital inpatient discharges for reporting states, though not all states participate in data collection. There are some fluctuations in the number of community hospitals reporting over time, depending on the state. The standard deviation in percentage reporting in 2% on average. Hospitalization records that included the International Classification of Diseases 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for RSV (079.6, 466.11, 480.1) within the 15 discharge diagnoses were included. Hospitalization data were made available at the weekly level. Hospitalization data are available from 1989, however, a change in reporting codes in 1996 results in a large increase in cases at this time. To avoid potential bias from the switch in reporting, we take all county-level observations from 1997 onward. The longest time series spans 1997â€“2011. We remove counties with very sparse observations (max incidence &lt;10 cases) and we also remove series of zero observations from the start of the time series. We remove any counties that have &lt;5 years of consecutive observations due to potential erroneous model-fitting over this shorter time series, though these counties are retained when plotting spatial averages.</p>
