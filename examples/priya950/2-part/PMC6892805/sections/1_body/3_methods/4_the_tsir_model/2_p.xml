 </inline-formula> of the TSIR fit is &lt;0.5 (101 counties). These locations tend to be in counties with very low population numbers where low-level stochastic variability in cases becomes proportional to the size of seasonal variation. Our results are robust to using the full dataset and a population-based cut off (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The time series in the Mexican dataset are noisier than the United States, even for larger population states, which we hypothesize is due to the stochastic nature of rainfall drivers that dominate in this region and also due to sampling issues such as a higher threshold for hospitalization. In Mexico, we remove data from two states where the TSIR model does not provide a good fit due to very sparse data (under 10 cases at maximum in the time series): Colima and Queretaro. Our final dataset to which we fit the main regression model has 214 locations and a total of 119,802 location-by-week observations. Model results are robust to including data from all US counties and Mexico (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).
