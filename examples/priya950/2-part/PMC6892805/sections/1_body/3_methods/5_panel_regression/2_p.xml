<p id="Par33">Nonparametric binned models and general additive models are also fitted to test the accuracy of the fitted functional form of the specific humidity and precipitation relationship (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Lagged precipitation and humdity, in the week prior to transmission, are tested but not found to be significant (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).
