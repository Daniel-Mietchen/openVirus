 </sup>. Recent work by Pitzer et al., using state-level data from the United States, showed broad-scale correlations between several annually-averaged climate variables and the amplitude of the periodic forcing of the modeled RSV cycle, suggesting that climate may play a crucial role in driving epidemics

 </sup>. However, the results did not address the distinct seasonality of RSV in tropical locations, nor the earlier timing of epidemic onset in Florida. Higher resolution data over a wider spatial scale is required to disentangle the specific climatic drivers governing the dynamics and timing of RSV epidemics and to unite predictions for both temperate and tropical locations.
