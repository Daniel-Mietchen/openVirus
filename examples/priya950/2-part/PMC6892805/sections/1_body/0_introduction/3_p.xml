<p id="Par5">Here, we leverage a county-level dataset of weekly RSV hospitalizations from over 300 locations in the United States and combine these observations with weekly bronchiolitis hospitalization data from all 32 states in Mexico. The temporal range of our dataset spans 5–15 years depending on location (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The spatial extent of our dataset covers a diverse set of climatologies including tropical, humid locations in southern Mexico and temperate climates in the US, where locations in northern latitudes experience large seasonal variation in climate conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We combine our RSV case data with high resolution climate data (precipitation, specific humidity, and temperature) in order to investigate spatial patterns in dynamics, evaluate the drivers of transmission, and project future RSV cycles under climate change scenarios.
