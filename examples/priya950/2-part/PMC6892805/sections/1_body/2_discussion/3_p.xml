<p id="Par19">The public health implications of changes to future RSV epidemic dynamics will depend on location-specific climatic changes. Precipitation-driven increases to epidemic intensity, caused by climate change or other large-scale climatic events such as the El-Nino-Southern Oscillation, will require increased surge capacity in locations that typically observe more uniformly distributed cases

 </sup>. Humidity-driven reductions to the seasonal change in transmission in other locations will result in persistent epidemics, meaning cases will occur outside of the typical “RSV season” requiring changes to the temporal allocation of resources. Changing dynamics can also alter the age of infection

 </sup>. This consideration is important given that early RSV infections have been implicated in the later life development of asthma
