<p id="Par18">There are important caveats to our results. We made the decision to remove dummy variables in future projections so that annual variation in forced climate could flexibly determine transmission. However, this means our simulations do not account for non-climatic factors that may also structure transmission. We crudely tested this by using a common seasonal fixed effect which gave qualitatively similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our assumption. Developing a richer understanding of the mechanisms connecting climate to transmission would help validate our results further. Our model also does not take into account genetic sub-type of RSV

 </sup> due to data limitations in the US and Mexico. We also do not consider age structure or potential secondary infections: secondary RSV infections are less severe
