<p id="Par20">Understanding the impact of climate change on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is critical for predicting and preparing for future outbreaks and the optimal deployment of future vaccines. Our results highlight the nonlinear impact of climate on RSV dynamics, across a wide range of climatic conditions. Shifts in the timing and magnitude of RSV outbreaks will be location-specific, depending on the realized climatic change. In regions where transmission is dominated by humidity, we can be relatively confident in our projections. However, in regions where precipitation dominates transmission, the future dynamics of RSV are more uncertain. Efforts to better resolve precipitation projections across climate models will improve the precision of these results. These findings also have potential implications for other airborne pathogens and future research efforts should be directed towards understanding the various processes through which climate affects airborne transmission. More broadly, our preliminary comparison between RSV and influenza reveals the potential for comparative studies to elucidate the mechanisms of climatic forcing for major respiratory infections.</p>
