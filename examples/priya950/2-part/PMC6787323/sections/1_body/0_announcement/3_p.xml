<p>For HB67652 and HB741570, the lengths of the whole-genome sequences were 11,818 and 11,714 nucleotides, with average coverages of 3,221× and 1,933× and GC contents of 48.1% and 51.6, respectively. The coding sequence lengths of HB67652 were 7,542 and 3,744 nucleotides for the 1st and 2nd open reading frame (ORF), respectively. The coding sequence lengths of HB741570 were 7,548 and 3,738 nucleotides for the 1st and 2nd ORF, respectively. Of note, a leaky stop codon near the nsP3 gene 3′ end is present in HB741570, unlike in HB67652. HB67652 and HB741570 share &gt;99% nucleic acid identity with the only 2 other complete genomes of Igbo-Ora and Babanki viruses currently available in GenBank (accession numbers
