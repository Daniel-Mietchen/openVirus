<p id="Par56">For the models and their performance, we first noted that OneR mainly selected sites in HA and NA for its single site models, and the OneR models could give significantly better average accuracies than the zero rule model (in which the accuracy is calculated by assigning all records to the class label that has the most observations). Among the sites, some have known functions while some others are not yet characterized. For example, site 188 in HA is known to be located at the helix 190 that surrounds the receptor-binding site and thus it affects host specificity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], while site 142 in HA has not yet been well studied even though it was frequently selected as the top OneR classifier. On the other hand, JRip and PART generated multiple site models and while JRip usually did not outperform OneR, PART almost always outperformed OneR and JRip. Of interest, PART also outperformed RF in about 50% of the tested cases. Moreover, a higher accuracy generally could be achieved by PART when considering either the concatenated protein alignments or individual protein alignments. These results demonstrate a synergistic between sites within a single protein and sites in different proteins (in other words, the polygenic nature of IAV virulence in mice). This is consistent with the observations from various experimental studies, such as the ones that demonstrate intra-protein synergy in PB2 [
