<p id="Par58">The critical role of PB2 in determining virulence in mice have been indeed highlighted for various strains, including H3N2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], H5N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], H5N8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], H7N9 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], H9N2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and H10N8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Among the top 20 sites in PB2 for PART models, sites 627 and 701 have been repeatedly shown to affect IAV virulence in mammals including mice. Site 627 is considered critical for efficient replication, while site 701 influences polymerase activity via its interaction with the nuclear import factor importin α that mediates the transport of proteins into nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Other top sites in PB2 are also known to contribute to virulence. For examples, site 714 (top 20 for the two-class IV dataset) influences replication efficiency and IAV virulence in mice in combination with site 701 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; site 66 (top 20 for the three-class IV dataset) sets a prerequisite for acquiring virulence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; and site 158 (top 20 for the two-class and three-class IV dataset; specifically, top one for the three-class) strongly influences the virulence of both pandemic H1N1 and H5 influenza viruses in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Experimental evidence for the contribution of other top sites in PB2 to virulence, e.g., sites 80, 110 and 153, are still none to our knowledge. On the other hand, some other sites not in the top list have been shown to play a role in dictating virulence, e.g., sites 147, 339 and 588 that can synergize to give rise a higher level of virulence [
