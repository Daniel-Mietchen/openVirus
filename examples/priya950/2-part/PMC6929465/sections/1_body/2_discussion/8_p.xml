<p id="Par61">In terms of their accuracy, PART models achieved moderate performance for various datasets being learned. The average accuracy over 100 models ranged between 65.0 and 84.4% (15.0–34.4% above baseline) for the two-class datasets that utilized all IAV proteins, and between 54.0 and 66.6% (20.7–33.3% above baseline) for the three-class datasets (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Learning from subsets of specific mouse or IAV strains revealed that some strains were easier while others were harder to learn. Of interest, while the average accuracies were relatively the same for the two-class datasets regardless the host information was included or not, a significant improvement (3.9% in increase of accuracy) was observed when incorporating host information for the three-class dataset. Thus, using learning approaches that further incorporate host information shall be encouraged, especially since several laboratory experiments have demonstrated the importance of host genetic backgrounds in determining IAV virulence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In particular, with the availability of genomes and proteomes of various mouse strains, sophisticated methods that are based on host-pathogen protein-protein interactions might be of interest. If successful, an implementation of such methods may be translated to human cases and other diseases to improve our understanding about disease mechanisms, establish a foundation for future personalized medicine, and provide a better surveillance. Nevertheless, the development of the approaches will be more fruitful if there is a significant increase in the number of influenza experiments carried out with mouse and IAV strains that are still limited in their number of studies.
