<p id="Par59">Next, the synergistic graph for the two-class virulence models interestingly presented a clustering of two subgraphs for sites in PART virulence models, with sites PB2–714, PA-97 and NS1–42 act as a bottleneck (a node with high betweenness centrality, i.e., having many shortest paths going through it) connecting the two subgraphs. For the three-class models, the synergistic graph containing top site pairs concentrated and expanded in the subnetwork that included sites PB2–80, PB2–110, PB2–153, PB2–297, NA-300, NS1–42, and M1–215. This may indicate a greater role of these sites in sensitizing the virulence level of IAV infections. For example, site 42 within the RNA-binding domain of NS1 influences the capability of the protein in binding double-stranded RNA and it determines the degree of pathogenicity in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This site also influences the activation of IRF3 and regulation of host interferon response, which subsequently influences the efficiency of viral replication [
