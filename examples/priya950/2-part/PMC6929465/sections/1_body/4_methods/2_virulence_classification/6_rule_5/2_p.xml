<p id="Par82">The above procedure created the initial dataset for IAV infections in mice with virulence information for this study (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S1). Following this, multiple records of infections involving specific IAV and mouse strains were reduced into a single record (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S2) by the following procedure (termed as 
 <bold>RULE 6</bold>): 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>(i)</label>
   <p id="Par83">Specify the majority class of the three-class virulence assignment for those records; when no majority, consider the class that is more or the most virulent.</p>

   <label>(ii)</label>
   <p id="Par84">Select the record with:

      <p id="Par85">the highest lower bound of MLD50 value when only the lower bound of MLD50 values is presented;</p>

      <p id="Par86">the lowest exact or upper bound of MLD50 value when they are available; but when the highest lower bound of MLD50 value is lower than this value, then calculate the average of those two values and assign the virulence class as described previously.</p>
