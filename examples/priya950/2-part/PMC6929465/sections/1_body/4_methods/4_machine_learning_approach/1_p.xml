<p id="Par89">Three rule-based machine learning approaches, i.e., OneR, JRip and PART that are available in RWeka version 0.4.39 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and random forest (RF) that is available in randomForest package version 4.6.14 for R software (R version 3.5.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] was used for all statistical and computational works in this study) were explored to develop predictive models for IAV virulence. Various input datasets were considered (see the first section of results), but in general, the input datasets consisted of IAV proteins that have been aligned with muscle package version 3.8.425 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and their target virulence class. The datasets included either the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins or individual alignment of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2 or NS2 proteins. Each column in the alignment that contained more than one symbol was considered as a single feature vector â€“ H3 and N2 numberings were used to label the position in the alignments of HA and NA, respectively. Input datasets that incorporated the host strain information, where each amino acid in the alignments was tagged with a symbol indicating associated host strain, were also considered. For each input dataset, each learning algorithm and each of the two-class and three-class datasets, rule-based and RF models were learned independently 100 times. In each iteration, the dataset was balanced by reducing the size of the bigger (biggest) class to the size of the smaller (smallest) class through sampling without replacement. Unless stated otherwise, 60% of the records (rows of the alignment) from each virulent class were used as training data for learning a model, while the rest were used as test data. Performance metrics that included accuracy, (macro-average) precision and (macro-average) recall were calculated to evaluate the models.
