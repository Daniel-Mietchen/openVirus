<p id="Par90">The concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins were visualized in 3D Cartesian coordinates. For this, a matrix of pairwise distances from the concatenated protein alignments was computed using Fitch similarity matrix and then the Kruskalâ€™s non-metric multidimensional scaling available in MASS package version 7.3.50 [
