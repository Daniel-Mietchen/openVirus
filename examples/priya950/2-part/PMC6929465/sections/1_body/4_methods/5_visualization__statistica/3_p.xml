<p id="Par92">For each of the two-class and three-class datasets, a three-way ANOVA model (with interactions) was built to identify factors that influence the accuracy of the virulence models. The factors included the dataset (with 7 levels: MIV, IV, BALB/C, C57BL/6, H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1), protein alignment (with 13 levels: all proteins, PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2 and NS2) and machine learning algorithm (with 3 levels: OneR, JRip and PART). The Tukeyâ€™s HSD post hoc test was then carried out to identify pairs of groups (virulence models) that were significantly different. The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test was also used to test the null hypothesis that the median of the accuracy of PART model learned from any dataset containing the concatenated protein alignments is greater than that of the corresponding RF model. The p-values of the tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni method.</p>
