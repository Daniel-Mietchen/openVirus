<p id="Par63">Journal publications containing virulence information of IAV infections in non-transgenic and non-knock-out inbred mice – which were searched using Google or PubMed search engines (with keywords that included influenza, infection, mouse, virulence, virus and LD50), found in the citations of retrieved articles, or recommended automatically by ScienceDirect – were collected. Each unique infection involving specific IAV strain and specific mouse strain and with known value of MLD50 was recorded. Infections without MLD50 values but whose weight loss and/or survival data of infected mice per infection dose could be estimated from the relevant figures, were also recorded and used to estimate the lower or upper bound of MLD50; few of them were used to estimate the exact MLD50 using the Reed and Muench method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Various MLD50 units, which included the plaque forming unit (PFU), focus forming unit (FFU), egg infectious dose (EID50), tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), and cell culture infectious dose (CCID50), were assumed to measure the same quantity.
