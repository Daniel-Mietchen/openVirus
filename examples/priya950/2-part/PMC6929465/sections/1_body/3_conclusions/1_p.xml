<p id="Par62">In summary, we have developed benchmark datasets and explored rule-based and RF approaches for modelling IAV virulence. To our knowledge, the datasets are currently the biggest aggregation of IAV infections in mice, and the number of the infection records can still grow. The creation of these benchmark datasets will be beneficial for further understanding the molecular principles underlying influenza mechanisms since mice have been a major animal model for influenza. In this study, we utilized the datasets to assess the predictability of IAV virulence for specific and across mouse and IAV strains, and to identify top proteins sites and synergy between protein sites that contribute to IAV virulence. Overall, our study confirmed the polygenic nature of IAV virulence, with several sites in PB2 playing more dominant roles. Not only sites that are well known as IAV virulence markers, e.g. 627, 701 and 714, but also some other sites in PB2 not yet known influencing virulence were identified. Nonetheless, modelling virulence is a very challenging problem due to the nature of complex interactions that underlie the phenotype, which involve not only viral factors, but also host factors. Hence, future works shall incorporate more host information, especially the host proteomic data that are now widely available for various mouse strains. Applying different machine learning approaches and protein features, and posing virulence modelling as a regression problem that predicts MLD50 shall also be considered.</p>
