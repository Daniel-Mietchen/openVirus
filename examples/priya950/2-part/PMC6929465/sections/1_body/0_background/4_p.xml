<p id="Par40">In contrast, the influence of variations in viral genes to IAV virulence have been investigated in a number of ways. These included the generation of mouse-adapted IAVs through serial lung-to-lung passaging and recombinant IAVs harboring specific mutations using plasmid-based reverse genetic techniques combined with mutagenesis approaches. The application of these techniques has provided various insights about viral mutations involved in IAV virulence. For example, the increased virulence of IAV during its adaptation in mice has been associated with mutations in the region 190-helix, 220-loop and 130-loop, which surround the receptor-binding site in the HA protein (reviewed in [

Mutations in multiple sites of a specific viral protein and mutations in multiple genes have also been shown to have a synergistic effect on IAV virulence in mice. For example, synergistic effect of dual mutations S224P and N383D in PA led to increased polymerase activity and has been considered as a hallmark for natural adaptation of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses to mammals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, the HA N-linked glycosylation is known to affect viral virulence by impacting the host immune response (reviewed in [
