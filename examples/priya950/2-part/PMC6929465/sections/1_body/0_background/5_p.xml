<p id="Par41">The confidence of contribution of viral protein sites to the virulence of influenza infections could be better investigated through a meta-analysis approach, which is a systematic amalgamation of results from individual studies. Such approach, to our knowledge, has only been carried out using a Bayesian graphical model to investigate the viral protein sites important for virulence of influenza H5N1 in mammals [

In this paper we present a meta-analysis of viral protein sites that determine the virulence of infections with any subtype of IAV; however, instead of any mammal, we focus on the infections in mice. Our meta-analysis approach utilized rule-based machine learnings and random forest to predict IAV virulence from datasets we created. The creation of the datasets involved: (

 <italic>iii</italic>) collection and alignments of the corresponding IAV protein sequences. For learning IAV virulence models, each column of the alignments was considered as a feature vector and the virulence levels as a target vector. When host information was considered, the amino acids in the columns were tagged with a symbol representing the corresponding mouse strain. The models were developed using either all records in the datasets or records for a specific mouse strain or influenza subtype, and using the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins or individual alignment of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2, or NS2 proteins. Top protein sites and synergy between protein sites were then examined for some biological interpretations.
