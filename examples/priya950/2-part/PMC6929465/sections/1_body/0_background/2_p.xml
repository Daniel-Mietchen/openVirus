<p id="Par38">The HA and NA determine the subtype of IAV. To date, 18 HA (H1-H18) and 11 NA (N1-N11) have been identified. The H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes have been responsible for five pandemics of severe human respiratory diseases in the last 100 years, i.e., the 1918 Spanish Influenza (H1N1), 1957 Asian Influenza (H2N2), 1968 Hong Kong (H3N2), 1977 Russian Influenza (H1N1), and 2009 Swine-Origin Influenza (H1N1). The H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes also cause recurrent, seasonal epidemics. In the last few years, the seasonal human IAVs were mainly dominated by the 1968’s H3N2 and 2009’s H1N1 strains. In addition to epidemic and pandemic strains, several IAV subtypes have also infected humans, including the H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 avian influenza viruses [
