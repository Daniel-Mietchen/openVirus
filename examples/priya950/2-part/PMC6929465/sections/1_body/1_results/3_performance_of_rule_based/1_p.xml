<p id="Par46">Here we focus on the application of OneR, JRip and PART algorithms for developing rule-based models for IAV virulence from various datasets we created. Examples of the virulence models generated using the machine learning algorithms for the two-class and three-class MIV, IV, BALB/C, C57BL/6, H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments are provided in Tables S9-S15 (Additional files

For each of the two-class and three-class datasets, containing either the concatenated protein alignments or individual protein alignment, 100 virulence models were generated for performance evaluation in this section and model characterization in the next section. Specifically, a three-way ANOVA (with interactions) model was built for each two-class and three-class dataset collection to evaluate the difference in accuracy between models. It revealed that the accuracy of the virulence models in both collections were influenced by the dataset, protein alignment, machine learning algorithm, as well as interactions among them. Following this, the Tukeyâ€™s HSD post hoc tests for multiple comparisons between pairs of models were carried out and some results are discussed here.
