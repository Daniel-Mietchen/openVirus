<p id="Par49">The distributions of the accuracies of the 100 OneR/JRip/PART models learned from the two-class and three-class MIV and IV datasets containing either the concatenated protein alignments or an individual protein alignment are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and those learned from the BALB/C, C57BL/6, H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets are shown in (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The results of the Tukey’s HSD post hoc test for multiple comparisons between pairs of models that appear in each plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 are given in Figures S3 and S4 (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), respectively. Once again, PART usually outperformed OneR and JRip, but it was not unusual that OneR outperformed JRip. Of interest, PART models that were built on the datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments almost always achieved the highest average accuracy, except for the three-class H3N2. The average accuracy was usually significantly higher than the accuracy of other competing models. In many cases, PART model that is based on PB2 or HA alignment could compete against PART model that is based on the concatenated protein alignments (no significant difference between their average accuracy; see Figure S3 and S4 (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>)).
