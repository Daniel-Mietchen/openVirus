 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> also shows that incorporating host information improved the accuracy of the three-class virulence classification but not for the two-class virulence classification – the average accuracies of PART models on the three-class MIV and IV datasets were 60.2 and 56.3% (Tukey’s HSD adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value for the difference was &lt; 0.05), respectively, but they were about the same for the two-class virulence classification, i.e., 71.8% for MIV dataset and 72.4% for IV dataset (Tukey’s HSD adjusted p-value for the difference was close to 1). Furthermore, when consindering the host strains, the rule-based models were more accurate for the C57BL/6 datasets than the BALB/C datasets (statistically significant (Tukey’s HSD adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) for the three-class problem but not two-class problem); and when considering the IAV subtypes, the rule-based models were more accurate for the H3N2 datasets than the H1N1 and H5N1 datasets (statistically significant for all cases). However, it ought to be noted that the standard deviations for the C57BL/6 and H3N2 datasets were higher than the rest, and that aggregating all mouse and/or virus strains gave the smallest standard deviation while keeping accuracy competitive.
