 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> highlights the performance of OneR, JRip and PART on the two-class and three-class datasets containing the concatenated IAV protein alignments. Overall, in terms of their average accuracy, precision and recall, PART models always outperformed OneR and JRip, while JRip were almost always better than OneR (the only case OneR consistently outperformed JRip was on the three-class H3N2 classification). However, statistical significant differences were mainly observed between PART and OneR/JRip models, and less frequently observed between OneR and JRip models mentioned (please inspect (Additional file

For example, PART had on average 10.67 and 46.97 rules per model for the two-class and three-class IV dataset, respectively; while JRip had on average 3.89 and 4.55 rules, respectively, and OneR always had 1 rule.
