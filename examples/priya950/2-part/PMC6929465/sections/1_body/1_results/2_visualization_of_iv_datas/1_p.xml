<p id="Par44">For an initial view of the IAV sequences being used for virulence prediction, the 3D multidimensional scaling plot that visualizes the level of similarity between the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins in the IV dataset is presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. While the clusters of dominant IAV subtypes can be easily observed in the plot, separation between virulence classes is lack and this illustrates the challenge in the prediction.
