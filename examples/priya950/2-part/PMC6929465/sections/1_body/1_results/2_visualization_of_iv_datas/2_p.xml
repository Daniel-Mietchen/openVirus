<p id="Par45">In addition, the correlation between each site and the target virulence class in the IV dataset was also measured using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of the chi-square test of independence. The line plots showing the –log (BH adjusted p-value) over the alignment sites of each IAV protein for the two-class and three-class datasets are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Overall, HA had many more sites that had a significant correlation with the target virulence (BH adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05), i.e., 72 and 283 sites for the two-class and three-class datasets, respectively. On the other hand, M2 had the least numbers of significant sites, i.e., 1 and 4 for the two-class and three-class datasets, respectively. The numbers of significant sites for other proteins and for the two-class and three-class datasets, respectively, are as follows: 26 and 44 for PB2, 6 and 30 for PB1, 14 and 33 for PA, 19 and 40 for NP, 19 and 167 for NA, 4 and 10 for M1, 18 and 32 for NS1, 3 and 30 for PB1-F2, 6 and 26 for PA-X, and 3 and 5 for NS2. Interestingly, while PB2, PA, NP, M1, NS1 and NS2 had their number of significant sites for the three-class dataset about twice the number of significant sites for the two-class dataset, the PB1, HA, NA, PB1-F2 and PA-X had a much higher fold increase in the number of significant sites.
