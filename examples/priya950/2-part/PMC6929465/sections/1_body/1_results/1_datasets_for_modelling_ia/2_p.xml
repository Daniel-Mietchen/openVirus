<p id="Par43">The MIVir and IVir datasets were then inner joined with another dataset containing the 12 IAV proteins whose amino acids in their aligned position (named as the IAV Proteins (IP) dataset), producing the MIVir ×
 <sub>I</sub> IP and IVir ×
 <sub>I</sub> IP datasets, respectively. The keys for joining the dataset were the IAV strains listed in the MIVir or IVir dataset. Once again, note that some virus strains were represented by multiple records in the IP dataset and some proteins were generated from extrapolated genomes. The breakdowns of the two joined datasets are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and a more detailed breakdown of the MIVir ×
 <sub>I</sub> IP is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As shown in the figure and table, the final datasets were mainly dominated by experiments involving BALB/C and C57BL/6 mice and H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses. Much fewer 129S1/SvImJ, 129S1/SvPasCrlVr, A/J, C3H, CAST/EiJ, CBA/J, CD-1, DBA/2, FVB/NJ, ICR, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, PWK/PhJ, SJL/JOrlCrl, and WSB/EiJ mice and H1N2, H3N8, H5N2, H5N5, H5N6, H5N8, H6N1, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses were in the datasets. Subsets of the MIVir ×
 <sub>I</sub> IP dataset used in this study included the dataset containing all records (named as the MIV dataset) and datasets containing records of infections in BALB/C and C57BL/6 mice (the BALB/C and C57BL/6 datasets, respectively); while subsets of the IVir ×
 <sub>I</sub> IP dataset used in this study included the dataset containing all records (the IV dataset) and datasets containing infections with H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses (the H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets, respectively). For virulence modelling, we further considered the subsets of the MIV, IV, BALB/C, C57BL/6, H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets, whether they contained the concatenated IAV protein alignments or individual alignment of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2 or NS2 proteins.
