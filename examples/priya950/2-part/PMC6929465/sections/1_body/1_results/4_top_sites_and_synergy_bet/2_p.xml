<p id="Par52">Overall, for the top sites in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, OneR and JRip preferred sites in HA and NA, PART had a high preference towards sites in PB2, and RF pointed out more sites in PB2 and HA were important. In terms of their consistency in selecting sites for the two-class and three-class virulence models, RF was the most consistent (15 shared sites), followed by PART (10 shared sites), JRip (8 shared sites) and finally OneR (only 4 sites). Furthermore, no site was shared by all four learners for either the two-class or three-class virulence models; but there were few sites shared by three learners: PB2–627, PB2–701, PA-97 and NA-46 for the two-class models, and PB2–627, PA-97 and NS1–42 for the three-class models.
