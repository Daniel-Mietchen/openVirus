<p id="Par51">As the performance of the models generated by a specific learning algorithm varied from one independent learning to another, the models themselves tended to vary a lot. This demonstrated the influence of selected training data. Hence, rather than inspecting the model one by one, it is more interesting to investigate individual sites that were frequently included in learned models or considered to have more impacts in the models. For this, the OneR’s single site model and RF’s site importance ranking naturally suit the purpose. For JRip and PART, we calculated the average contribution of each site to the accuracy of learned models. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarizes the sites selected by OneR (ordered by their frequency; sites that were selected once are not shown), top 20 sites by JRip and PART (ordered by their average contribution to the accuracy of learned models), and top 20 influential sites by RF (ordered by the average mean decrease in accuracy) following 100 independent learnings from the two-class and three-class IV datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments.
