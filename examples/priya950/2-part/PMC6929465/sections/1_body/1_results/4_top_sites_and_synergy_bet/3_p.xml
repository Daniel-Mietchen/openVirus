<p id="Par53">In addition to analyzing individual sites, it is also interesting to investigate the synergy between sites that determine IAV virulence. The rule-based models given by JRip and PART serve this purpose, but here we limit to PART models that usually gave the highest average accuracy. For this, in similar way to the identification of top individual sites, we extracted the average contribution of each pair of sites appearing in each rule in PART models to the overall accuracy. The synergistic networks arising from top 50 site pairs in PART models learned from the two-class and three-class IV datasets containing concatenated protein alignments are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A and B</xref>, respectively. As shown, the sites in both cases were interestingly fully connected and mainly involved sites in PB2. Top 4 sites that had high degree (number of connections) for the two-class virulence models included PB2–714 (degree = 14), PA-97 (13), NS1–42 (10) and PB2–701 (7), and interestingly, the pairing between top two sites PB2–714 and PA-97 had the highest contribution to accuracy. On the other hand, sites that had high degree for the three-class virulence models included PB2–110 (15), PB2–158 (13), NS1–42 (10) and PB2–153 (9), and the pairing between PB2–153 and NS1–42 had the highest contribution to accuracy.
