 <caption>
  <p>Line plots showing the correlations between sites in the IAV protein alignments and IAV virulence class in the two-class (on the left; subplots A-L) and three-class (on the right; subplots M-X) IV datasets. The correlations are measured using the negative log of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted 
   <italic>p</italic>-values of the chi-square tests for independence between sites and IAV virulence. The red dashed horizontal line in each plot indicates the critical adjusted p-value based on the significance level of 0.05
