 <caption>
  <p>Synergistic graphs between IAV protein sites in determining virulence based on 100 PART models learned from the (A) two-class and (B) three-class IV datasets containing the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins. Each node in the graphs represents an IAV protein site â€“ the type of the protein is encoded by color and the site number is written above the node. Two sites are connected by an edge if they appear in the top 50 site pairs contributing to the accuracy of the corresponding PART models. The thickness of an edge indicates the level of contribution of the corresponding site pair to the accuracy</p>
