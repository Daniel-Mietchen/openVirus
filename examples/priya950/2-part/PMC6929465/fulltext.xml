Many individual studies have been carried out in mice to uncover the viral factors responsible for the virulence of IAV infections. Nonetheless, a single study may not provide enough confident about virulence factors, hence combining several studies for a meta-analysis is desired to provide better views. For this, we documented more than 500 records of IAV infections in mice, whose viral proteins could be retrieved and the mouse lethal dose 50 or alternatively, weight loss and/or survival data, was/were available for virulence classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">IAV virulence models were learned from various datasets containing aligned IAV proteins and the corresponding two virulence classes (avirulent and virulent) or three virulence classes (low, intermediate and high virulence). Three proven rule-based learning approaches, i.e., OneR, JRip and PART, and additionally random forest were used for modelling. PART models achieved the best performance, with moderate average model accuracies ranged from 65.0 to 84.4% and from 54.0 to 66.6% for the two-class and three-class problems, respectively. PART models were comparable to or even better than random forest models and should be preferred based on the Occam&#x02019;s razor principle. Interestingly, the average accuracy of the models was improved when host information was taken into account. For model interpretation, we observed that although many sites in HA were highly correlated with virulence, PART models based on sites in PB2 could compete against and were often better than PART models based on sites in HA. Moreover, PART had a high preference to include sites in PB2 when models were learned from datasets containing the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins. Several sites with a known contribution to virulence were found as the top protein sites, and site pairs that may synergistically influence virulence were also uncovered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Modelling IAV virulence is a challenging problem. Rule-based models generated using viral proteins are useful for its advantage in interpretation, but only achieve moderate performance.

The genome of the virus consists of 8 single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA segments encoding at least 12 proteins that make up its proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Segment 1 encodes for the basic RNA polymerase 2 (PB2); segment 2 encodes for the basic RNA polymerase 1 (PB1) and non-essential PB1-F2 protein; segment 3 encodes for the acidic RNA polymerase (PA) and non-essential PA-X protein; segment 4 encodes for the hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein; segment 5 encodes for the nucleocapsid protein (NP); segment 6 encodes for the neuraminidase (NA) membrane glycoprotein; segment 7 encodes for the matrix protein 1 (M1) and matrix protein 2 (M2; also referred to as ion channel protein); and segment 8 encodes for the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2; also referred to as nuclear export protein).</p><p id="Par38">The HA and NA determine the subtype of IAV. To date, 18 HA (H1-H18) and 11 NA (N1-N11) have been identified. The H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes have been responsible for five pandemics of severe human respiratory diseases in the last 100&#x02009;years, i.e., the 1918 Spanish Influenza (H1N1), 1957 Asian Influenza (H2N2), 1968 Hong Kong (H3N2), 1977 Russian Influenza (H1N1), and 2009 Swine-Origin Influenza (H1N1). The H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes also cause recurrent, seasonal epidemics. In the last few years, the seasonal human IAVs were mainly dominated by the 1968&#x02019;s H3N2 and 2009&#x02019;s H1N1 strains. In addition to epidemic and pandemic strains, several IAV subtypes have also infected humans, including the H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 avian influenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among them, the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes have raised a major public health concern due to their ability to cause outbreaks with high fatality rate (about 60% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int">www.who.int</ext-link>) and 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], respectively). Overall, IAV poses a threat to human health and life, and therefore further understanding about the virus is needed for a better surveillance and counteractive measures against it.</p><p id="Par39">Many aspects of IAV and the disease it causes have been investigated in mice since the animals are not only cost-effective and easy to handle, but also available in various inbred, transgenic, and knockout strains. Moreover, the genomes of various inbred mice have been recently available. Mice have also allowed us to uncover host and viral molecular determinants of IAV virulence. Early outcome of IAV study in mice was the revelation of the protective role of interferon-induced gene Mx1 against the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, the gene has been shown to inhibit the assembly of functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex of IAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the last 50&#x02009;years, the importance of many more host genes in influenza pathogenesis has been discovered through experiments in mice, including RIG-I, IFITM3, TNF and IL-1R genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Nonetheless, one limitation of the existing approaches in investigating host molecular determinants involved in IAV virulence is that it has not yet taken into account the contribution of allelic variation to differential host responses.</p><p id="Par40">In contrast, the influence of variations in viral genes to IAV virulence have been investigated in a number of ways. These included the generation of mouse-adapted IAVs through serial lung-to-lung passaging and recombinant IAVs harboring specific mutations using plasmid-based reverse genetic techniques combined with mutagenesis approaches. The application of these techniques has provided various insights about viral mutations involved in IAV virulence. For example, the increased virulence of IAV during its adaptation in mice has been associated with mutations in the region 190-helix, 220-loop and 130-loop, which surround the receptor-binding site in the HA protein (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Mutations in PB2 have also been considered to play a significant role in the increased IAV virulence in mice, which include mutations E627K and D701N that are considered as general markers for IAV virulence in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, a single mutation N66S in the accessory protein PB1-F2 could also contribute to increased virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Mutations in multiple sites of a specific viral protein and mutations in multiple genes have also been shown to have a synergistic effect on IAV virulence in mice. For example, synergistic effect of dual mutations S224P and N383D in PA led to increased polymerase activity and has been considered as a hallmark for natural adaptation of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Another example is the synergistic action of two mutations D222G and K163E in HA and one mutation F35&#x02009;L in PA of pandemic 2009 influenza H1N1 virus that causes lethality in the infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, virulence may not only be encoded at protein level, but also at nucleotide and post-translational level. In a very recent study, synonymous codons were interestingly able to give rise different virulence levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, the HA N-linked glycosylation is known to affect viral virulence by impacting the host immune response (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]).</p><p id="Par41">The confidence of contribution of viral protein sites to the virulence of influenza infections could be better investigated through a meta-analysis approach, which is a systematic amalgamation of results from individual studies. Such approach, to our knowledge, has only been carried out using a Bayesian graphical model to investigate the viral protein sites important for virulence of influenza H5N1 in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis approach using Naive Bayes approach at viral nucleotide level has recently been carried out to demonstrate the contribution of synonymous nucleotide mutations to IAV virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this paper we present a meta-analysis of viral protein sites that determine the virulence of infections with any subtype of IAV; however, instead of any mammal, we focus on the infections in mice. Our meta-analysis approach utilized rule-based machine learnings and random forest to predict IAV virulence from datasets we created. The creation of the datasets involved: (<italic>i</italic>) documentation of the virulence of infections involving particular IAV and mouse strains, (<italic>ii</italic>) classification of virulence levels, and (<italic>iii</italic>) collection and alignments of the corresponding IAV protein sequences. For learning IAV virulence models, each column of the alignments was considered as a feature vector and the virulence levels as a target vector. When host information was considered, the amino acids in the columns were tagged with a symbol representing the corresponding mouse strain. The models were developed using either all records in the datasets or records for a specific mouse strain or influenza subtype, and using the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins or individual alignment of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2, or NS2 proteins. Top protein sites and synergy between protein sites were then examined for some biological interpretations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Datasets for modelling IAV virulence</title><p id="Par42">The steps in creating benchmark datasets for modeling IAV virulence is summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Initially, a dataset containing 637 records of IAV infections in mice &#x02013; of which the full or incomplete genomes of the IAVs could be retrieved from public sequence databases and the virulence class of the infection could be identified - was created according to information available in 84 journal publications (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S1). Of those records, 502 records have their MLD50 provided in the literature.

This produced a new dataset containing 555 records and named as the Mouse-IAV Virulence (MIVir) dataset.

Of interest, PART models that were built on the datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments almost always achieved the highest average accuracy, except for the three-class H3N2. The average accuracy was usually significantly higher than the accuracy of other competing models. In many cases, PART model that is based on PB2 or HA alignment could compete against PART model that is based on the concatenated protein alignments (no significant difference between their average accuracy; see Figure S3 and S4 (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>)).

On the other hand, sites that had high degree for the three-class virulence models included PB2&#x02013;110 (15), PB2&#x02013;158 (13), NS1&#x02013;42 (10) and PB2&#x02013;153 (9), and the pairing between PB2&#x02013;153 and NS1&#x02013;42 had the highest contribution to accuracy.

Furthermore, we proposed a number of procedures to tackle various missing data. For virulence, the MLD50 value is the ultimate information we looked for; but in its absence, weight loss and/or survival data of infected mice were utilized to infer the lower or upper bound of MLD50 and subsequently, to label the virulence class. For IAV genomes, when the genomes were incomplete or contained partial sequences, extrapolation was performed using the closest genome relative identified with BLAST. These pre-processing works were done manually and ambiguity occasionally occurred. Hence, caution must be taken when dealing with the datasets and improvement in the pre-processing approach may be considered for future works. Alternatively, efforts in improving the current practice of storing IAV virulence information by research community such that it eases its reusability ought to be encouraged, e.g., by creating an online database that accepts submissions of IAV virulence related data and is able to generate high quality tables or figures of the input data (which then can be added into related manuscript).</p><p id="Par55">Despite the limitations of the datasets due to the ways in handling missing MLD50, partial sequences and incomplete genomes, and also a recent critic of using LD50 as a virulence measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the models learned from the datasets could provide insights about IAV virulence across mouse and virus strains. Rule-based models were chosen since their output can be easily interpreted and are congruent with the current practice in investigating IAV virulence experimentally. Three rule-based learning approaches were employed: OneR, JRip and PART. OneR approach outputs a single site model that gives the highest accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; JRip and PART considers multiple sites and they construct a set of decision rules using different strategy. While JRip mainly uses separate-and-conquer algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], PART combines separate-and-conquer strategy and partial decision trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For a comparison in the performance, we also explored the RF approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in modelling IAV virulence.</p><p id="Par56">For the models and their performance, we first noted that OneR mainly selected sites in HA and NA for its single site models, and the OneR models could give significantly better average accuracies than the zero rule model (in which the accuracy is calculated by assigning all records to the class label that has the most observations). Among the sites, some have known functions while some others are not yet characterized. For example, site 188 in HA is known to be located at the helix 190 that surrounds the receptor-binding site and thus it affects host specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], while site 142 in HA has not yet been well studied even though it was frequently selected as the top OneR classifier. On the other hand, JRip and PART generated multiple site models and while JRip usually did not outperform OneR, PART almost always outperformed OneR and JRip. Of interest, PART also outperformed RF in about 50% of the tested cases. Moreover, a higher accuracy generally could be achieved by PART when considering either the concatenated protein alignments or individual protein alignments. These results demonstrate a synergistic between sites within a single protein and sites in different proteins (in other words, the polygenic nature of IAV virulence in mice). This is consistent with the observations from various experimental studies, such as the ones that demonstrate intra-protein synergy in PB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and NS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and inter-protein synergy that involves combinations of PB2, PB1, PA, HA or NA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Further inspection on PART models across different IAV strains using IV dataset revealed that although HA had many more sites correlated with virulence, PB2 seemed to play more important role in determining IAV virulence. This was in agreement with the RF&#x02019;s site importance ranking. In terms of their accuracy, PART models based on PB2 alone were usually as good as or even better than PART models based on HA; except when modelling the virulence of two-class H1N1, PART models based on HA were more superior (see (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2)). Moreover, PART models based on the concatenated IAV protein alignments had a high preference towards sites in PB2, and many sites in PB2 were also considered as the most important features for RF models (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> that shows synergistic graphs for the two-class and three-class virulence models further clearly demonstrate this. Investigations on MIV dataset and datasets for specific IAV or mouse strain also revealed the dominance of PB2 in most of the cases (data not shown). When sites in PB2 did not dominate, the sites in HA dominated, such as in the case for the two-class H1N1 dataset.</p><p id="Par58">The critical role of PB2 in determining virulence in mice have been indeed highlighted for various strains, including H3N2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], H5N1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], H5N8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], H7N9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], H9N2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and H10N8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Among the top 20 sites in PB2 for PART models, sites 627 and 701 have been repeatedly shown to affect IAV virulence in mammals including mice. Site 627 is considered critical for efficient replication, while site 701 influences polymerase activity via its interaction with the nuclear import factor importin &#x003b1; that mediates the transport of proteins into nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Other top sites in PB2 are also known to contribute to virulence. For examples, site 714 (top 20 for the two-class IV dataset) influences replication efficiency and IAV virulence in mice in combination with site 701 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; site 66 (top 20 for the three-class IV dataset) sets a prerequisite for acquiring virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; and site 158 (top 20 for the two-class and three-class IV dataset; specifically, top one for the three-class) strongly influences the virulence of both pandemic H1N1 and H5 influenza viruses in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Experimental evidence for the contribution of other top sites in PB2 to virulence, e.g., sites 80, 110 and 153, are still none to our knowledge. On the other hand, some other sites not in the top list have been shown to play a role in dictating virulence, e.g., sites 147, 339 and 588 that can synergize to give rise a higher level of virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Next, the synergistic graph for the two-class virulence models interestingly presented a clustering of two subgraphs for sites in PART virulence models, with sites PB2&#x02013;714, PA-97 and NS1&#x02013;42 act as a bottleneck (a node with high betweenness centrality, i.e., having many shortest paths going through it) connecting the two subgraphs. For the three-class models, the synergistic graph containing top site pairs concentrated and expanded in the subnetwork that included sites PB2&#x02013;80, PB2&#x02013;110, PB2&#x02013;153, PB2&#x02013;297, NA-300, NS1&#x02013;42, and M1&#x02013;215. This may indicate a greater role of these sites in sensitizing the virulence level of IAV infections. For example, site 42 within the RNA-binding domain of NS1 influences the capability of the protein in binding double-stranded RNA and it determines the degree of pathogenicity in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This site also influences the activation of IRF3 and regulation of host interferon response, which subsequently influences the efficiency of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Another site that has been experimentally explored is site 215 in M1, which also contributes to the degree of IAV virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Overall, PART, with its approach that combines separate-and-conquer strategy and partial decision tree, has been a suitable method to generate sequence-based virulence models that are not only considerably good in performance, but also provides interpretable information. But here, rather than relying on a single model developed from a single training dataset, the information was extracted from 100 models learned independently from different training datasets. While bias due to imbalanced classes were resolved by under-sampling to obtain balanced classes, the iterations might help reducing bias due to over-sampling of a particular mouse or IAV strain. Furthermore, we also noted from the confusion matrix that PART models tended to misclassify the avirulent (or less virulent) strains as virulent (or more virulent) ones rather than misclassify the virulent (more virulent) strains as avirulent (or less virulent) ones. In practice, this is preferred since classifying the virulent strains as avirulent ones is a worse decision that can cost lives. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of increasing the training size for learning PART models (data not shown). Using the two-class and three-class IV datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments, the mean accuracy of PART models based on the training size of 80% or 90% of the total records was about 2&#x02013;3% higher than the mean accuracy of PART models based on the training size of 60%, but it came at the cost of higher standard deviation (about 1.3&#x02013;3.3% higher) and average number of rules (3&#x02013;6 rules more for two-class and 12&#x02013;20 rules more for three-class; in other words, more complex models). Increasing the training size up to 99% of the total records led not only to much higher variance, but also a drop in the mean accuracy. Thus, with additional consideration that there were high overlaps between top sites from PART models trained on 80% or 90% datasets and top sites trained on 60% datasets, and we observed that the top sites for models trained on 80 and 90% datasets were still dominated by sites in PB2, presenting results from models trained on 60% of datasets is justifiable.</p><p id="Par61">In terms of their accuracy, PART models achieved moderate performance for various datasets being learned. The average accuracy over 100 models ranged between 65.0 and 84.4% (15.0&#x02013;34.4% above baseline) for the two-class datasets that utilized all IAV proteins, and between 54.0 and 66.6% (20.7&#x02013;33.3% above baseline) for the three-class datasets (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Learning from subsets of specific mouse or IAV strains revealed that some strains were easier while others were harder to learn. Of interest, while the average accuracies were relatively the same for the two-class datasets regardless the host information was included or not, a significant improvement (3.9% in increase of accuracy) was observed when incorporating host information for the three-class dataset. Thus, using learning approaches that further incorporate host information shall be encouraged, especially since several laboratory experiments have demonstrated the importance of host genetic backgrounds in determining IAV virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], even at a substrain level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In particular, with the availability of genomes and proteomes of various mouse strains, sophisticated methods that are based on host-pathogen protein-protein interactions might be of interest. If successful, an implementation of such methods may be translated to human cases and other diseases to improve our understanding about disease mechanisms, establish a foundation for future personalized medicine, and provide a better surveillance. Nevertheless, the development of the approaches will be more fruitful if there is a significant increase in the number of influenza experiments carried out with mouse and IAV strains that are still limited in their number of studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">In summary, we have developed benchmark datasets and explored rule-based and RF approaches for modelling IAV virulence. To our knowledge, the datasets are currently the biggest aggregation of IAV infections in mice, and the number of the infection records can still grow. The creation of these benchmark datasets will be beneficial for further understanding the molecular principles underlying influenza mechanisms since mice have been a major animal model for influenza. In this study, we utilized the datasets to assess the predictability of IAV virulence for specific and across mouse and IAV strains, and to identify top proteins sites and synergy between protein sites that contribute to IAV virulence. Overall, our study confirmed the polygenic nature of IAV virulence, with several sites in PB2 playing more dominant roles. Not only sites that are well known as IAV virulence markers, e.g. 627, 701 and 714, but also some other sites in PB2 not yet known influencing virulence were identified. Nonetheless, modelling virulence is a very challenging problem due to the nature of complex interactions that underlie the phenotype, which involve not only viral factors, but also host factors. Hence, future works shall incorporate more host information, especially the host proteomic data that are now widely available for various mouse strains. Applying different machine learning approaches and protein features, and posing virulence modelling as a regression problem that predicts MLD50 shall also be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Collection of IAV infections in mice with virulence information</title><p id="Par63">Journal publications containing virulence information of IAV infections in non-transgenic and non-knock-out inbred mice &#x02013; which were searched using Google or PubMed search engines (with keywords that included influenza, infection, mouse, virulence, virus and LD50), found in the citations of retrieved articles, or recommended automatically by ScienceDirect &#x02013; were collected. Each unique infection involving specific IAV strain and specific mouse strain and with known value of MLD50 was recorded. Infections without MLD50 values but whose weight loss and/or survival data of infected mice per infection dose could be estimated from the relevant figures, were also recorded and used to estimate the lower or upper bound of MLD50; few of them were used to estimate the exact MLD50 using the Reed and Muench method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Various MLD50 units, which included the plaque forming unit (PFU), focus forming unit (FFU), egg infectious dose (EID50), tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), and cell culture infectious dose (CCID50), were assumed to measure the same quantity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Virulence classification</title><p id="Par64">In addition to the assumption on the equality of various MLD50 units, the MLD50 thresholds of 10<sup>3.0</sup> and 10<sup>6.0</sup> were used for virulence classification.

The factors included the dataset (with 7 levels: MIV, IV, BALB/C, C57BL/6, H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1), protein alignment (with 13 levels: all proteins, PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, NS1, PB1-F2, PA-X, M2 and NS2) and machine learning algorithm (with 3 levels: OneR, JRip and PART). The Tukey&#x02019;s HSD post hoc test was then carried out to identify pairs of groups (virulence models) that were significantly different. The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test was also used to test the null hypothesis that the median of the accuracy of PART model learned from any dataset containing the concatenated protein alignments is greater than that of the corresponding RF model. The p-values of the tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni method.</p><p id="Par93">Following 100 independent learnings from the two-class and three-class IV datasets, the protein sites from models learned using each algorithm were ranked. For OneR, the sites were ranked according to their frequency of being selected for the models; for JRip and PART, the sites were ranked according to their average contribution to the accuracy of learned models; and for RF, the sites were ranked according to their contribution to the average mean decrease in accuracy. For PART models, we also ranked the site pairs according to their average contribution to the accuracy of learned models and visualized the synergistic graph arises from the top 50 site pairs using igraph package version 1.2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] for R software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
