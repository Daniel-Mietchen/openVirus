<p id="Par17">The rate of microcephaly in neonates per 10,000 live births per week by Brazilian macroregions is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The increase of microcephaly rate beginning at the end of 2015 is observed in all regions. However, in the NE region, by August/2015 the rate had surpassed 30 cases per 10,000 live births, while in other regions it was never higher than 20/10,000 live births. In the SE and CW regions, a second peak occurred at the end of 2016. Comparing the incidence rates of dengue fever (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) in the SE and CW regions, three epidemic years (2010, 2013 and 2015) are present, while in the NE region, in the same period, we observed just a seasonal pattern with no outbreaks.
