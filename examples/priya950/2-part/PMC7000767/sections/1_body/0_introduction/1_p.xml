<p id="Par2">One of the reasons that made it possible for researchers to associate the microcephaly epidemic in the Northeast (NE) region of Brazil with the Zika virus (ZIKV) was the high rate of dispersion of the virus and the large number of babies born with similar characteristics in the same maternity wards, in the same week, and sometimes even in the same day. This repeatedly happened in different cities of the region in a short time

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Despite all the research done on the first epidemics of ZIKV in Yap Islands and later in French Polynesia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, it was only after the Brazilian epidemic that Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) was described
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. This could be due to the small population in the previously affected areas and to the large number of births concentrated in the same hospitals of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Even so, a robust analysis using secondary databases estimated a peak of 49.9 microcephaly cases per 10,000 live births in the NE region, whereas for the other regions the peak did not surpass 10 cases per 10,000 live births
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. So far, microcephaly ratios as high as in the Brazilian NE region have not been described in any other region in the world that had undergone a Zika epidemic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Several reasons for this discrepancy were suggested – poor data quality
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, the unreliability of secondary data sources
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, virus genetic variation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, socioeconomic factors
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, dengue immunity profile of the population
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
