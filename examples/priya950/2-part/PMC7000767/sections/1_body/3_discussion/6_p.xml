<p id="Par28">In the easternmost area of the NE region there was an excess of two standard deviations over the number of microcephalic neonates predicted by the model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In this area, the involvement among researchers and clinicians that led to the early discovery of the causal link between Zika and microcephaly may have generated a hyper-awareness of the problem. The more strict head circumference measurements counterbalanced the usual under-reporting

 </sup>. It should be noted that the main surveillance system for neonatal congenital malformation (Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations – ECLAMC) did not detect the microcephaly epidemic in the early stages
