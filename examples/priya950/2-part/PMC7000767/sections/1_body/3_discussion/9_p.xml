<p id="Par31">The main limitations of this study, in addition to not controlling for Zika incidence, are well known: accuracy of microcephaly classification and completeness of dengue fever notification. We recognize the potential inaccuracy on the measurement of neonatesâ€™ cephalic perimeter. Considering 10% fewer neonates classified as microcephalic in the NE and 10% more in other regions, the difference would be fourfold, instead of five. As for the under notification of dengue fever, we have no reason to believe there was a trend over the years that would affect our results.</p>
