<p>The study, however, had some limitations. One, some of the data used (especially those collected in 2001) were clinical records that had not been subjected to laboratory screening. Most of the data collected after 2002 were however screened using anti-dengue virus IgM ELISA as mentioned earlier. Despite this limitation, dengue surveillance data are often used for mapping given that in many countries, a small proportion of cases are confirmed through laboratory analysis. A similar challenge has been reported by Johansson et al. [
