<p>The second limitation was that the model used climatic and environmental factors to predict dengue incidence, but it could not capture potential differences in the distribution of the various serotypes of the dengue virus or host immunity and hence the ADE effect. Serotype-specific immunity, and hence the circulating dengue virus serotypes, is expected to fluctuate in a community overtime, and some of the cyclic epidemics observed might be attributable to these dynamic processes. Primary infection confers life-long protective immunity to an infective serotype, but an introduction of a new serotype 2â€“3 months later would cause an infection [

The third limitation was our inability to include socio-economic variables such as migration patterns, or ability to afford medical care or preventative services, since these actions are expected to influence dengue exposure. These were not available at the spatial scale considered. Areas that require further work include (i) determination of the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical case definition (such as those for), (ii) investigation of the distribution of the DENV serotypes in relation to population immunity, (iii) capacity building on dengue surveillance so that a majority of suspected dengue cases are screened using standard laboratory tests, and (iv) validation of LC through the country.
