<p>Analyses of the temporal dynamics of the disease revealed regular seasonal epidemics that were interrupted by major fluctuations that occurred in 3-year cycles as reported previously in southern Vietnam [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Regular dengue epidemics have been attributed to extrinsic factors due to climate variability while the multi-annual fluctuations (observed at 3-year intervals in this case) are thought to be caused by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection due to the introduction of new DENV into a sub-population or an area with cross-reactive antibodies from previous infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We believe the ADE effects cause an increase in hospitalization rates and hence registration of increased dengue cases in the surveillance system. Infection dynamics associated with ADE effects are, however, beyond the scope of this paper. More work is needed though to identify how new DENV are introduced to new areas or sub-populations of exposed individuals.
