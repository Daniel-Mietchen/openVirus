<p>There has been an unprecedented expansion of the geographical range of the disease globally since the 1950s [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Until 1970, severe dengue epidemics were reported in less than 10 countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, it is thought that the disease is endemic in more than 100 countries, with a third of the world population living in areas with heightened dengue risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The spatial expansion of the disease mostly occurred between 1980 and 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Factors that could be attributed to this trend include urbanization, tourism and migration, and climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Migration and tourism are believed to play a critical role in the spread of the disease if infected travellers successfully transfer the virus to new environments. Environmental factors such as human settlements, presence of water bodies, mixed agriculture, open land and neglected grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], determine DENV persistence, while factors which influence vectorial competence of DENV vectors (such as emergence rate, gonotrophic cycle, survival rate, etc.) have important effects on the incidence of the disease [
