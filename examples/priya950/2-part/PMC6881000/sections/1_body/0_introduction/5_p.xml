<p>This study used a spatiotemporal hierarchical Bayesian model to analyse surveillance data from the National Dengue Control Programme (NDCP) in Vietnam. Bayesian models were preferred because they provide a rigorous framework that can account for spatial-temporal autocorrelation and are increasingly being used for disease mapping [

The study aimed to develop a statistical model that can be used for developing dengue risk maps and forecasting dengue incidence at monthly intervals while at the same time accounting for spatiotemporal autocorrelations. Risk maps and incidence forecasting tools would enable policy makers to deploy risk-based interventions. The availability of 12 years surveillance records from a dengue dedicated project, meteorological data, and high-resolution geographical data provided a unique opportunity for the development of these tools.
