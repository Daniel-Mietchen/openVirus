<p>We extracted all these LC types except unvegetated areas using the province shapefile and determined the area of a province covered by each of the LC type. The MCD12Q1 data are stored in degree unit with a resolution of approximately 0.08° and were available in annual intervals; we downloaded those relevant for the target period 2001–2012. The data were downloaded in TIFF format, clipped using the Vietnam shapefile and converted into a vector layer in ArcGIS using the Asia South Albers Equal Area Conic. A new field for recording area (in square Kilometers) was created in its data attribute table. The geometry calculation table was then used to estimate the area of each LC cover type and expressed as a percentage of the total area of a province.</p>
