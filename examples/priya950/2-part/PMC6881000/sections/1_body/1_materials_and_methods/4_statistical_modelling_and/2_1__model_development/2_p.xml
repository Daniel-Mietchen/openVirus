<p>A combination of backward and forward variable selection process was employed to build a parsimonious multivariable model. For continuous variables, linearity assumption was evaluated by fitting respective quadratic terms. Eleven dummy variables representing month were also fitted in the model to account for the seasonal effects. The spatial effect was accounted for using the CAR model; this captures the neighborhood structure of the assessment units, which in this case were provinces. Alternative CAR models with varying correlation matrix specifications for the implied spatial design have been developed and reviewed extensively in literature. Three CAR models including intrinsic conditional autoregressive model, proper CAR (or Cressie model), and convolution model are available in RINLA as

 <italic>besagproper</italic> and 
 <italic>Besag-York-Mollie</italic> (BYM), respectively [
