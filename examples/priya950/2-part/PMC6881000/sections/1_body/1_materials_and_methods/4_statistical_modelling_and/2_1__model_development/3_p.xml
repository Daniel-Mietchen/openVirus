<p>We used the province shapefile to specify the BYM adjacency matrix. Each data point, 
 <italic>y</italic>
 <sub>i</sub>, was deemed to be based in a spatial region, 
 <italic>s</italic>, which was part of a population of sites, 
 <italic>s</italic> ∈ 
 <italic>S</italic> = (0, ⋯·, 
 <italic>S</italic> − 1). Two sites that shared a common provincial border were therefore considered to be neighbors. The spatial effect: 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>), i.e., 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> = (
 <italic>f</italic>(0), 
 <italic>f</italic>(1), ⋯, 
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>S</italic> − 1)) was modelled as an intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF), which is considered as an alternative but deterministic model for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model [
