<p>We used principal component analysis to identify key meteorological variables for multivariable analysis. The selected variables had to cover at least 80% of the variance cumulatively to be considered as being good predictors. Each variable was normalized (i.e., their means set to zero) to standardize their scales. A standard biplot graph involving principal components 1 and 2 was then generated to identify the most orthogonal variables. The graph clustered variables into distinct categories of highly correlated predictors. Within each cluster, those variables that were far removed from the center of the graph were considered to represent most of the variation of the outcome than the others in that cluster. Rainfall, minimum temperature and evaporation met this selection criterion (
