<p>Two hundred μL of plasma was inactivated by heating at 56°C for 30 min, then diluted 1 in 10 in serum-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). This solution was mixed with an equal volume of virus stock diluted to contain between 50 and 60 plaque forming units (pfu) and added to cell monolayers at 37°C for 2 h to enable non-neutralised virus to adsorb to cells. Two mL of 0.75% w/v carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich)/RPMI 1640 was then added and the plates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% v/v CO
 <sub>2</sub>/air for an additional 2–4 days, depending on the virus being employed, i.e., 2 days for alphaviruses and 4 days for flaviviruses. The CMC medium was then removed and the cell monolayers were fixed and stained with 0.05% w/v crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in formaldehyde (1% v/v) and methanol (1% v/v). Plasma samples that reduced virus plaque numbers by ≥ 50% were recorded as reactive.
