<p>The prevalence of antibodies against each virus was plotted against the age of the donors and the line of best fit was determined by linear regression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The annual infection rate was calculated from the slope of the line of best fit. Given previous reports of cross-reactivity between flaviviruses by polyclonal antisera (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">De Madrid and Porterfield, 1974</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Calisher et al., 1989</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 1990</xref>), and of mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognise epitopes on the E1 or E2 proteins of multiple alphaviruses, e.g., 2A2C3 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Roehrig, 1986</xref>), it is possible that plasma samples that recognised more than one alphavirus or more than one flavivirus might represent serological cross-reactivity, rather than be due to infections with multiple viruses. Therefore, the results shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> were analysed based on three different assumptions: (1) The presence of neutralising antibody against any virus represented an infection with that virus; i.e., ignoring the possibility of serological cross-reactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, line A); (2) Analyses were performed with samples that neutralised only one virus; i.e., excluding all samples that may have contained cross-reactive antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, line B); and (3) Each subject was infected with only a single virus and it was the one against which the highest neutralising activity was observed; i.e., all other neutralising activity was due to cross-reacting antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, line C).
