<p>Two sets of samples were collected for this study. For the first, 100 de-identified plasma samples (3–5 mL) from 50 female and from 50 male, age-stratified, adult (20–69 years) Australian blood donors were provided by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (approved by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service Human Research Ethics Committee, approval no. 12-03QLD-10). The samples were collected in 2015 throughout the state of Queensland. The prevalence of anti-RRV IgG in subjects from northern Australia observed by

If it is assumed that the infection rate with neglected arboviruses is the same as that of RRV infections, the minimum sample size (for blood donor samples) required to detect the prevalence of such arboviral infections with 95% confidence at 0.1 margin of error would be 96. Hence, a sample collection of 100 was considered to provide statistically valid data.
