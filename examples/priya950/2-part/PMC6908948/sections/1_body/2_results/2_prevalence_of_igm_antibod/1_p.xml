<p>Four-hundred and ninety-two acute phase sera were obtained from patients between 12 and 75 years of age (median of 45 years); 238 (48.4%) were male and 254 (51.6%) were female. Thirty-two samples contained IgM antibody that reacted with C6/36 cells infected by either an alphavirus or a flavivirus, or by several viruses. As the extent of cross-reactivity observed in these assays to detect anti-arboviral IgM was unexpected (
