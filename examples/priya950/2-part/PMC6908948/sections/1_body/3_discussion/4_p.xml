<p>The prevalence of antibodies against several neglected flaviviruses suggested they are associated with human infection. This conclusion is broadly in line with prior reports from Queensland (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1Aâ€“E</xref>) were significantly lower than those that have been determined for the alphaviruses RRV and BFV. However, an annual seroconversion rate for KUNV of 0.3% is similar to that for BFV. This overall disparity between rates of infection with alphaviruses and flaviviruses might reflect differences in their transmission cycles, particularly the vectors and reservoirs that are involved.
