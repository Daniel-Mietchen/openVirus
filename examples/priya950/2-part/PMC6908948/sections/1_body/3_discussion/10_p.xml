<p>Enhancement of infection with KUNV was noted with some samples examined in this study. There is an extensive literature describing enhancement of flavivirus infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by cross-reactive and non-neutralising antibodies, starting with the report of 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes (1964)</xref>, who also described enhancement of infection by West Nile virus (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes, 1964</xref>). However, antibody-mediated enhancement of infection with KUNV, an Australian strain of West Nile virus, by human antisera has not been reported previously. It is not known if the PS-EK cells that were used in this study express the Fc receptors required for antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection to occur (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kliks and Halstead, 1983</xref>) or if another mechanism was responsible for our observations.
