<p>For many of the viruses studied, the ratio of total infections to clinical infections in humans is unknown. From estimates made with the data obtained in this study (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), it appears that approximately 5% of infections with RRV and BFV in Queensland are clinical infections severe enough to require medical attention and so be reported. If it is assumed that only a small proportion, e.g., 1%, of infections caused by flaviviruses studied in the current study results in disease, there would be at least 416 clinical infections caused by these viruses in Queensland annually.
