<p>While this study identified neglected arboviruses that may cause UFI, the prevalence of these infections may have been elevated by the samples tested coming from a collection for which arbovirus serology or ‘viral studies’ had been requested and while the presence of anti-viral IgM indicates a recent infection, it does not indicate that the infection has caused the clinical signs and symptoms observed. It should be noted that the aetiology of disease in at least 94% of the patients remained undetermined.</p>
