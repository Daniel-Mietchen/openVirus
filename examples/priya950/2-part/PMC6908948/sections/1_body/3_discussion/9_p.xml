<p>The extent of IgM cross-reactivity between the flaviviruses also was unexpected, but is reflected in the number of ‘flavivirus-unspecified’ reports made to the Australian Government National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Australian Government Department of Health, 2019</xref>). However, by combining the IgM data with those for neutralisation tests (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), it was possible to implicate a given virus as the likely causative agent of a recent UFI. In most instances in which cross-reactive IgM antibody was detected, neutralising antibodies could be identified against the same viruses. The absence of detectable RF in almost all samples suggested it was not responsible for false positive IgM reactions.
