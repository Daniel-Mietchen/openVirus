<p>The annual rate of infections with BFV (0.3%) and its seroprevalence (9.0%) were similar to those reported previously for Queensland residents [0.23% prevalence rate and 6.5% seroprevalence (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 1990</xref>)]. However, the seroprevalence was significantly higher (Chiâ€“square test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that reported previously in Australia by 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Faddy et al. (2015)</xref> among blood donors in Queensland (2.9%), by 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Vale et al. (1986)</xref> among blood donors on the south coast of New South Wales (2.9%), by 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes et al. (1987)</xref> in inland (0.3%) and coastal regions (6%) of New South Wales. Some of these differences may reflect the sensitivities and specificities of the various assays employed; e.g., the neutralisation test employed in the current study and a commercial ELISA used by 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Faddy et al. (2015)</xref>, or the type of sample collection and hypothesis of the particular study. While use of separate assay methodologies may have influenced the differences in seroprevalence values observed between Queensland and other states, it is also possible that both the abundance and species of mosquito vectors at geographically distant localities played a role (
