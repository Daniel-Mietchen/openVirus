<p>The occurrence of UFI due to ‘neglected’ Australian flaviviruses like ALFV, EHV, KOKV, and STRV appears to be extremely low and the reported annual infection rates of these viruses suggest that this has always been the case. However, they do infect humans and so population growth, societal changes (such as increased urbanisation and travel) and variations in the ecosystem (climate-related or other) could have a profound effect on their transmission cycles, with consequent changes to the rates of human infection. Under these circumstances the current routine diagnostic testing regimes would not detect a rise in the rate of infection with ALFV, EHV, KOKV, and STRV. In order to monitor any future changes in the transmission of these viruses, there is a strong case to be made for the systematic testing of a sub-sample of UFI cases by state or national public health laboratories.</p>
