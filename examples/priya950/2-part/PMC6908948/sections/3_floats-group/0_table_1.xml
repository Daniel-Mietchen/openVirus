   <italic>Values for reactive samples are shaded, with the darker shade notifying the most reactive. 
    <sup>∗</sup>There was no significant difference (
    <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Student’s 
    <italic>t</italic>-test) between the neutralisation of the virus pairs indicated. 
    <sup>#</sup>Numbers are based on an assumption that the subject had been infected with a single virus and it was the one against which the highest neutralising activity (darker shade) was observed.
