  <p>Novel aspects of contemporary Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks. Recent ZIKV outbreaks have highlighted the novel epidemic capacity of the virus. Furthermore, ZIKV has been shown to disseminate to many sites throughout the body and ZIKV RNA has been persistently detected long after infection in semen and in the vaginal tract. Most strikingly, ZIKV has been associated with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), with impacts on neurodevelopment occurring even in the absence of symptoms like fetal microcephaly. The risk for CZS is increased when infection occurs early during pregnancy. Abbreviations: CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; CZS, congenital Zika syndrome; ZIKV, Zika virus.</p>
