<p>Prior to the Yap Island outbreak, there were very few descriptions of ZIKV infection duration and pathogenesis in humans. The first undisputed account of ZIKV infection in humans was described by a researcher working in the Zika forest in 1964 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this report of his own infection with ZIKV, Simpson described an acute, five-day illness. During the first two days of infection, he developed a frontal headache, muscle pain, fever, and a diffuse maculopapular rash on his face, neck, trunk, and limbs. On the evening of the second day, his fever broke, and the rash faded over the following three days [

Even 36 years later, after ZIKV caused its first major outbreak on Yap Island, the symptoms described were relatively similar: acute rash, fever, arthritis, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, with possible headache, retro-orbital pain, and vomiting [

These reports suggest that up until the French Polynesian outbreak, ZIKV caused only a mild, febrile illness with no neurological involvement. However, given the small sample size and lack of control patients, it cannot be definitively stated that neurological symptoms arose only after the Yap Island outbreak.
