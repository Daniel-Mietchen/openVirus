<p>Following its initial isolation in 1947, ZIKV remained relatively unknown and innocuous until the Yap Island outbreak in 2007. Although no outbreaks of similar magnitude have been reported since the South and Central American outbreak, this and the outbreaks that preceded it have defined ZIKV as a pathogen with the clear capacity to cause wide-spread disease. This risk remains present as further small outbreaks continue to be reported, including in Singapore in 2016, India in 2018, and the recent retrospective identification of an outbreak in Cuba in 2017 [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Combined with the severe neurological symptoms associated with infection, ZIKV has clearly emerged as a major global health threat. In the context of pregnancy, this is especially true, as even children born with no obvious abnormalities may still be affected. While it cannot be definitively stated, it seems likely that these characteristics are newly acquired, as neither early case reports nor descriptions of the Yap Island outbreak indicated that ZIKV caused more than acute febrile illness. However, recent outbreaks have also occurred in the context of the introduction of ZIKV to novel host populations, which raises the possibility that host genetics, host nutritional habits, or previous immunity against other 
 <italic>flaviviruses</italic>, among other factors, could contribute to increased epidemic capacity or pathogenesis. Nonetheless, the neurological symptoms that remain associated with ZIKV infection merit continued research efforts to understand risk factors associated with these symptoms and to inform vaccination or therapeutic approaches that are best-suited to prevent and treat severe ZIKV pathogenesis.
