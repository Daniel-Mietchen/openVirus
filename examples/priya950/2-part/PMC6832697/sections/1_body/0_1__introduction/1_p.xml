<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus macaque in 1947 in the Ziika forest (more commonly known as the Zika forest) region of Uganda [

Over the course of four months in 2007, 73% of the population of Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, was estimated to have been infected with ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the Americas alone, over 800,000 suspected and confirmed cases were reported over the course of the epidemic [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Together, these contemporary outbreaks represent a dramatic change in phenotype for ZIKV, from an innocuous virus that caused isolated infections to one with the potential to cause widespread disease.
