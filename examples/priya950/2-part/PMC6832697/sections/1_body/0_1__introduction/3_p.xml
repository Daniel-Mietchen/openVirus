<p>The impact of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and on neonates is the most dramatic aspect of contemporary ZIKV outbreaks. Fetal microcephaly, which is typically diagnosed based on a head circumference at birth that is greater than two standard deviations below average for gestational age and sex, was first associated with ZIKV infection during the South and Central American outbreak [

Fetal microcephaly represents one of several symptoms that are collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which also includes thin cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifications, macular scarring, and marked early hypertonia [

Together, GBS and CZS demonstrate how ZIKV has emerged as a global health threat with the potential to cause severe pathology during, or after, infection.
