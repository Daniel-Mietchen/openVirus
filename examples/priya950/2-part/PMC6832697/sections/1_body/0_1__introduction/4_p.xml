<p>In this review, we will describe typical and rare outcomes of ZIKV infection in adults, including the areas of the body in which ZIKV has been detected, and the duration of virus detection. We will also examine the effect of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, risk factors for the development of CZS, and the impact of maternal ZIKV exposure on early childhood development. Finally, we will discuss pediatric cases of ZIKV infection, and how the course of infection in children compares to adult cases. Improving our understanding of the severe symptoms that can follow ZIKV infection, and the risk factors associated with them is an important step in order to develop approaches to treat or prevent these symptoms.</p>
