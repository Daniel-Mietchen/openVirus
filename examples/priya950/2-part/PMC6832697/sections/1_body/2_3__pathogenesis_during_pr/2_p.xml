<p>In order to determine the impacts of ZIKV infection during pregnancy on early life, one longitudinal study tracked infants from birth to 18 months old [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. They found that while only eight infants were born with fetal microcephaly, 62 of 216 (28.7%) had abnormal neurodevelopmental assessments [

Furthermore, of 146 infants who were given Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition assessments, 59 (40%) scored at least one standard deviation below average in at least one functional domain (language was the most affected functional domain) [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Together these studies strongly suggest that even infants born with no obvious brain abnormalities following ZIKV exposure during pregnancy are also at risk for neurodevelopmental delays or even post-natal CZS (
