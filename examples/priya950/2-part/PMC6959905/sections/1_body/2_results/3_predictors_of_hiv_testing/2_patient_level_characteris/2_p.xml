<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> displays the unweighted and weighted factors associated with HIV testing in physician offices. Four patient level characteristics – age, race and ethnicity, sex and reason for visit were significantly associated with HIV testing. Individuals aged 20 to 29 years had the highest odds for testing (OR 7.20, 99% CI 4.37–11.85) compared to the elderly age group (50–64 years). Odds for testing was higher for males (OR 1.34, 99% CI 0.91–0.93) compared to females. Patients visiting for preventive care had higher odds for testing (OR 5.29, 99% CI 3.25–8.61) compared to those with a chronic problem. Sex-age interaction was not statistically significant for physician office/ED visits; hence data were not displayed in Tables 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.
