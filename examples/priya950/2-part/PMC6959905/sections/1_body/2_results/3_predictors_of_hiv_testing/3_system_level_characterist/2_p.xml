<p>All 3 system-level characteristics (usual source of care captured based on new/follow-up visit determination; primary care provider visited and facility ownership) were significantly associated with HIV testing during physician office visits (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). New patients (OR 1.78, 99% CI 1.23–2.58) making a physician office visit had higher odds for HIV testing compared to established patients. Similarly, patients visiting nonprimary care providers or facilities (OR 1.61, 99% CI 1.04–2.50) had higher odds of HIV testing. Patients visiting medical/academic/community health center/other hospitals (OR 2.21, 99% CI 1.16–4.24) had higher odds of HIV testing compared to patients visiting physician group run facilities. By region, the odds of HIV testing occurring during a physician office visit was highest in the South (OR 2.06, 99% CI 1.23–3.44).
