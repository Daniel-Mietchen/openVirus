<p>Average annual number of visits to the physician's office decreased from 3.38 (2009) to 2.77 (2014) visits per person representing a 18% decrease over 6 years (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). National HIV testing rates in both the ED and physician offices trended upwards as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Unexplained dips in HIV testing rates were observed for physician offices in 2011 and for ED visits in 2012. Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows national weighted and unweighted estimates of HIV testing rates in physician offices and EDs across different provider, patient, and facility level characteristics. Unweighted estimates mostly mirrored weighted estimates except in a few instances. The largest differences in HIV testing rates across various characteristics occurred during physician office visits. HIV testing rates fluctuated annually but were highest in physician offices in 2014 (11.54 per 1000 visits). HIV testing rates in physician offices were highest among those aged 20 to 29 (23.07 per 1000), African Americans (17.77 per 1000), Hispanics (12.68 per 1000), and Medicaid beneficiaries (13.98 per 1000). Similarly, African Americans (10.94 per 1000) and Hispanics (8.98 per 1000) had the highest rates of HIV testing during ED visits. For physician office visits, HIV testing rates were higher for new patients (11.78 per 1000) compared to established patients. Conversely, HIV testing rates were lowest among patients visiting primary care providers (3.88 per 1000), facilities owned by physician groups (6.13 per 1000) or making visits in nonmetropolitan areas (5.33 per 1000).
