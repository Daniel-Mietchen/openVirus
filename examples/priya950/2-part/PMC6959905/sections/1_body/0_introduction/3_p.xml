<p>Providers play a key role in routine HIV testing with the relationship between physician decision-making and patient behavior established in literature.

 </sup> Based on this relationship, the “Eisenberg model for clinician's decision-making” was selected as the theoretical model for this study.

 </sup> This model posits that actual clinical decisions such as HIV testing are strongly influenced by interactions between the patient, clinician, sociological, and biomedical environment.

 </sup> Prior reservations about the viability of conducting routine HIV testing in health facilities is reduced with the development of new and successful HIV algorithms such as the rapid test-immunoflourescence and ARCHITECT-Multispot-viral load algorithms.

 </sup> These point-of-care testing options make HIV testing easier.

 </sup> However, despite these improved HIV testing technologies and after a decade of CDC recommendations, studies show disproportionate HIV testing rates remain across demographic groups, and health care settings.

 </sup> Previous studies did not specifically account for the impact of provider relationship in HIV testing decision-making. To address this problem, we applied the Einseberg model to this study, to examine HIV screening trends among persons aged 13 to 64 years visiting physician's offices or ED between 2009 and 2014. In contrast to previous studies, facility, provider, and patient-level characteristics associated with HIV testing and trends over the 6-year period are included as important predictors.
