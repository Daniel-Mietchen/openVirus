<p>Current human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) surveillance estimates show approximately 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in America.

 </sup> Despite widespread availability of HIV testing, about 15% of PLWH remain unaware of their infection.

 </sup> Undiagnosed PLWH miss benefits associated with HIV diagnosis such as early linkage to HIV care, reduction in viral load, professional and personal support to help improve their overall health.

 </sup> To increase the proportion of PLWH who are aware of their HIV status, receive the aforementioned benefits, and prevent further transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine HIV testing for persons aged 13 to 64 years using routine opt-out HIV screening in health care settings where the prevalence of undiagnosed infection is at least 0.1%.

 </sup> Previous studies classify health encounters by undiagnosed PLWH in health care settings such as the emergency department (ED) as missed opportunities for HIV testing.
