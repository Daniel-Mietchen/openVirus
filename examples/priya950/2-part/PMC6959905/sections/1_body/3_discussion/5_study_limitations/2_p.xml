<p>The results of this study should be considered with some limitations in mind. HIV testing rates do not reflect exact incidence rates. Incidence rates cannot be estimated since the same patients could make more than 1 visit. Information about who was offered testing and reasons why HIV testing was not performed was not collected. Patients not tested might have declined testing because of prior screening from another visit. Unrecognized sampling biases might hamper the national representativeness of the population sample, while errors in data collection might affect appropriate measure of HIV testing rates.

 </sup> For instance, nonresponse to participate in the survey might have resulted in underestimation or overestimation of HIV testing. Moreover, sexual behavior or intravenous drug use data are absent, so estimation of HIV testing representing these factors was not possible.
