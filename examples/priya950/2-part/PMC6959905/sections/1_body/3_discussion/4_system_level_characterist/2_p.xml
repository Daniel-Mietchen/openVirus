<p>In general, patients visiting medical, academic, community health centers, or other hospitals regulated by insurance company, health plan, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) or health corporation had higher odds for HIV testing. A prior study established that patient-provider interaction plays a leading role in subsequent decision making of the physician.

 </sup> This study found that established patients had significantly lower odds of getting tested for HIV while visiting physician offices, but no significant variations were reported for ED visits. Lower testing rates for established patients are plausible because in most cases there is ongoing physician-patient engagement and as well as an established medical history. Another important systems-level characteristic is the provider's interaction with the health system. A prior study demonstrated that provider decision-making is largely affected by the type of facilities, region of the facilities, and whether the facility is in metro or non-metro areas.

 </sup> In this study people from the South had significantly higher odds of getting an HIV test during a physician office visit. HIV testing was higher in the Northeast region for visits to the ED and in the South for physician office visits. Findings related to the influence of region on HIV testing are mixed.

 </sup> A recent study examining regional impact on HIV testing during patient visits supports our finding.

 </sup> Another study conducted on ED visits did not find significant variation across geographic regions for HIV testing.

 </sup> However two 2018 studies report on the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in the ED, as well as the difficulties in selecting patients for screening in the ED
