<p>Encouragingly, the likelihood of being tested for HIV increased significantly among visits to the ED as well as during preventative care visits to physician offices. The finding that the likelihood for HIV testing is higher for new patient visits in physician offices is expected. New patient visits typically include the investigation of existing chronic conditions with appropriate testing including HIV testing. But contrary to the finding of no differences by type of setting by Tai &amp; Merchant (2014), we found HIV testing rates were not uniformed between physician offices and ED. Plausible explanations for the reason of HIV testing differs across both health care settings were not assessed during this study. Reasons provided by previous studies about failure to conduct routine HIV testing in health settings among clinicians include a lack of knowledge of the CDC's testing guidelines; belief that patients are not at risk for HIV and assuming HIV testing is the responsibility of other health care professionals.
