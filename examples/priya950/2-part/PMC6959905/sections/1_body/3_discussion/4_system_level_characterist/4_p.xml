 </sup> Additional explanations for these variations include the following. First, full adoption of the 2006 CDC guidelines takes time and implementation may differ by health facility. There could also be facility and legislative level barriers, along with lack of awareness, resistance, and misconceptions regarding HIV testing by both physicians and patients.

 </sup> Second, in the absence of a clear mandate for clinicians and health facilities to perform routine HIV screening, as well as poor communication or dissemination of the CDC guidelines, uptake in HIV testing rates may lag across health settings. Third, the lack of strategic planning and financial support to purchase and deploy portable point of care HIV testing equipment could limit uptake of HIV testing in health settings.

 </sup> Fourth, physician behavior and reaction to the guidelines directly influence HIV testing among patients, and physicians may continue to rely on clinical presentations rather than the guidelines to recommend HIV testing. Fifth, the NAMCS and NHAMCS data may not accurately capture all HIV testing.
