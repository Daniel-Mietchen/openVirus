<p>Consistent with previous studies, African-Americans and Hispanics remained most likely to test for HIV in both physician offices and ED.

 </sup> African Americans and Hispanics have increased risk of HIV infection, and account for most new HIV diagnoses.

 </sup> However, HIV testing was most likely to occur in the ED for both African-Americans and Hispanics. This agrees with recent study findings showing minority Medicaid recipients and the uninsured as most likely to receive HIV testing in the ED.

 </sup> One factor predicting where minority populations receive HIV testing is a lack of a usual source of care. Race, mistrust of the health system, segregation in primary care based on socioeconomic status are factors influencing minorities use of the ED for routine care and by extension HIV testing.

 </sup> In contrast to the literature, this study found the highest likelihood for HIV testing by age occurring among those aged 20 to 29 in physician offices. This contradicts previous study findings of no difference in HIV testing by age.

 </sup> The finding that visits to a primary care provider had lower odds of getting HIV tested is expected. Primary care providers often have in-depth knowledge of their patients, which enables them to assess risk and determine if a patient needs HIV testing. As a result, providers may be less prone to provide/recommend HIV screening during such visits. In contrast, a previous study that analyzed NAMCS survey focusing on men aged 15 to 25 years reported that visits to the primary care physician had a higher likelihood for HIV testing in physician offices.
