<p>We conducted a serial cross-sectional study design, using physician office and ED visits data obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2009 through 2014. Both are nationally representative annual surveys that collect visit level data using a 4-stage probability sampling design from physician offices and hospitals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Details of these surveys are available elsewhere.

 </sup> We included visits made by persons aged 13 to 64 years over 6 years to conform with the CDC HIV testing guidelines. Total sample size for NAMCS from 2009 to 2014 was (unweighted n = 1002,) and for NHAMCS (unweighted n = 783). We extracted data from 2009 to 2014 because distinct questions were added to the surveys in 2009 to determine whether HIV testing was provided during the visits. Unweighted visits are only provided in the tables to show the number of sample cases, because each record can represent thousands of visits.
