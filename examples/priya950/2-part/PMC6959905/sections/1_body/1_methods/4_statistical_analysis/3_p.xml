 <italic>t</italic> tests and Pearson Chi-square statistics to assess differences and associations between proportions during bivariate analysis. We used multivariable survey logistic regression to evaluate trends in HIV testing associated with explanatory variables across both physician offices and EDs separately. Odds ratios (ORs), 99% CIs, and significance level (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 was considered as significant to account for large weighted sample sizes) for each factor are reported. No multiple comparison adjustments were made given the exploratory nature of this study. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.
