<p>Sample weights accounting for selection probability, nonresponse and ratio adjustments for each year's total sample size were applied to generate robust national estimates of both ED and physician office visits. Variables with unweighted values less than 30 were excluded to ensure reliable estimates. Adjusted sample weights, strata, and primary sampling design units provided by both NAMCS and NHAMCS were applied using multi-stage survey methods. Statistical procedures used include PROC SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYMEANS, and SURVEYLOGISTIC. We calculated proportions with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) for all years using the total visits as denominator. National rates were calculated using the following equation
