Ending the HIV epidemic is unattainable if significant proportions of people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, making HIV testing critical for prevention and treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine HIV testing for persons aged 13 to 64 years in all health care settings. This study builds on prior research by estimating the extent to which HIV testing occurs during physician office and emergency department (ED) post 2006 CDC recommendations.</p><p>We performed an unweighted and weighted cross-sectional analysis using pooled data from 2 nationally representative surveys namely National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2014. We assessed routine HIV testing trends and predictive factors in physician offices and ED using multi-stage statistical survey procedures in SAS 9.4.</p><p>HIV testing rates in physician offices increased by 105% (5.6&#x02013;11.5 per 1000) over the study period. A steeper increase was observed in ED with a 191% (2.3&#x02013;6.7 per 1000) increase. Odds ratio (OR) for HIV testing in physician offices were highest among ages 20 to 29 ([OR] 7.20, 99% confidence interval [CI: 4.37&#x02013;11.85]), males (OR 1.34, [CI: 0.91&#x02013;0.93]), African-Americans (OR 2.97, [CI: 2.05&#x02013;4.31]), Hispanics (OR 1.80, [CI: 1.17&#x02013;2.78]), and among visits occurring in the South (OR 2.06, [CI: 1.23&#x02013;3.44]). In the ED, similar trends of higher testing odds persisted for African Americans (OR 3.44, 99% CI 2.50&#x02013;4.73), Hispanics (OR 2.23, 99% CI 1.65&#x02013;3.01), and Northeast (OR 2.24, 99% CI 1.10&#x02013;4.54).</p><p>While progress has been made in screening, HIV testing rates remains sub-optimal for ED visits. Populations visiting the ED for routine care may suffer missed opportunities for HIV testing, which delays their entry into HIV medical care. To end the epidemic, new approaches for increasing targeted routine HIV testing for populations attending health care settings is recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>emergency department</kwd><kwd>HIV testing</kwd><kwd>physician office</kwd><kwd>predictors</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>trends</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Current human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) surveillance estimates show approximately 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in America.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Despite widespread availability of HIV testing, about 15% of PLWH remain unaware of their infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Undiagnosed PLWH miss benefits associated with HIV diagnosis such as early linkage to HIV care, reduction in viral load, professional and personal support to help improve their overall health.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> To increase the proportion of PLWH who are aware of their HIV status, receive the aforementioned benefits, and prevent further transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine HIV testing for persons aged 13 to 64 years using routine opt-out HIV screening in health care settings where the prevalence of undiagnosed infection is at least 0.1%.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Previous studies classify health encounters by undiagnosed PLWH in health care settings such as the emergency department (ED) as missed opportunities for HIV testing.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>Providers play a key role in routine HIV testing with the relationship between physician decision-making and patient behavior established in literature.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Based on this relationship, the &#x0201c;Eisenberg model for clinician's decision-making&#x0201d; was selected as the theoretical model for this study.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> This model posits that actual clinical decisions such as HIV testing are strongly influenced by interactions between the patient, clinician, sociological, and biomedical environment.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Prior reservations about the viability of conducting routine HIV testing in health facilities is reduced with the development of new and successful HIV algorithms such as the rapid test-immunoflourescence and ARCHITECT-Multispot-viral load algorithms.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> These point-of-care testing options make HIV testing easier.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, despite these improved HIV testing technologies and after a decade of CDC recommendations, studies show disproportionate HIV testing rates remain across demographic groups, and health care settings.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Previous studies did not specifically account for the impact of provider relationship in HIV testing decision-making.

We extracted data from 2009 to 2014 because distinct questions were added to the surveys in 2009 to determine whether HIV testing was provided during the visits.

National HIV testing rates in both the ED and physician offices trended upwards as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Unexplained dips in HIV testing rates were observed for physician offices in 2011 and for ED visits in 2012. Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows national weighted and unweighted estimates of HIV testing rates in physician offices and EDs across different provider, patient, and facility level characteristics. Unweighted estimates mostly mirrored weighted estimates except in a few instances. The largest differences in HIV testing rates across various characteristics occurred during physician office visits. HIV testing rates fluctuated annually but were highest in physician offices in 2014 (11.54 per 1000 visits). HIV testing rates in physician offices were highest among those aged 20 to 29 (23.07 per 1000), African Americans (17.77 per 1000), Hispanics (12.68 per 1000), and Medicaid beneficiaries (13.98 per 1000). Similarly, African Americans (10.94 per 1000) and Hispanics (8.98 per 1000) had the highest rates of HIV testing during ED visits. For physician office visits, HIV testing rates were higher for new patients (11.78 per 1000) compared to established patients. Conversely, HIV testing rates were lowest among patients visiting primary care providers (3.88 per 1000), facilities owned by physician groups (6.13 per 1000) or making visits in nonmetropolitan areas (5.33 per 1000).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Average annual number of visits to physician offices and emergency departments, 2009 to 2014.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-99-e18525-g002"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>HIV screening rates in physician offices and emergency departments in the US, 2009 to 2014.

In agreement with prior studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> overall U.S. HIV testing increased from 2009 to 2014.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Patient-level characteristics</title><p>Consistent with previous studies, African-Americans and Hispanics remained most likely to test for HIV in both physician offices and ED.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> African Americans and Hispanics have increased risk of HIV infection, and account for most new HIV diagnoses.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> However, HIV testing was most likely to occur in the ED for both African-Americans and Hispanics. This agrees with recent study findings showing minority Medicaid recipients and the uninsured as most likely to receive HIV testing in the ED.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> One factor predicting where minority populations receive HIV testing is a lack of a usual source of care. Race, mistrust of the health system, segregation in primary care based on socioeconomic status are factors influencing minorities use of the ED for routine care and by extension HIV testing.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In contrast to the literature, this study found the highest likelihood for HIV testing by age occurring among those aged 20 to 29 in physician offices. This contradicts previous study findings of no difference in HIV testing by age.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The finding that visits to a primary care provider had lower odds of getting HIV tested is expected. Primary care providers often have in-depth knowledge of their patients, which enables them to assess risk and determine if a patient needs HIV testing. As a result, providers may be less prone to provide/recommend HIV screening during such visits. In contrast, a previous study that analyzed NAMCS survey focusing on men aged 15 to 25 years reported that visits to the primary care physician had a higher likelihood for HIV testing in physician offices.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Findings from previous literature associated with the influence of primary payment source on HIV testing are mixed. Some of the studies support our finding of no significant effect on HIV testing for most payment sources except for self-pay patients who had a lesser likelihood of HIV testing.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Other studies reported the opposite, with Medicaid recipients reported to test more often in both physician offices and EDs.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Carter et al did not find any variation in HIV testing among men aged 15 to 25 years in physician office visits based on payment type.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>System-level characteristics</title><p>In general, patients visiting medical, academic, community health centers, or other hospitals regulated by insurance company, health plan, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) or health corporation had higher odds for HIV testing. A prior study established that patient-provider interaction plays a leading role in subsequent decision making of the physician.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> This study found that established patients had significantly lower odds of getting tested for HIV while visiting physician offices, but no significant variations were reported for ED visits. Lower testing rates for established patients are plausible because in most cases there is ongoing physician-patient engagement and as well as an established medical history. Another important systems-level characteristic is the provider's interaction with the health system. A prior study demonstrated that provider decision-making is largely affected by the type of facilities, region of the facilities, and whether the facility is in metro or non-metro areas.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In this study people from the South had significantly higher odds of getting an HIV test during a physician office visit. HIV testing was higher in the Northeast region for visits to the ED and in the South for physician office visits. Findings related to the influence of region on HIV testing are mixed.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> A recent study examining regional impact on HIV testing during patient visits supports our finding.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Another study conducted on ED visits did not find significant variation across geographic regions for HIV testing.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> However two 2018 studies report on the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in the ED, as well as the difficulties in selecting patients for screening in the ED<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup></p><p>Encouragingly, the likelihood of being tested for HIV increased significantly among visits to the ED as well as during preventative care visits to physician offices. The finding that the likelihood for HIV testing is higher for new patient visits in physician offices is expected. New patient visits typically include the investigation of existing chronic conditions with appropriate testing including HIV testing. But contrary to the finding of no differences by type of setting by Tai &#x00026; Merchant (2014), we found HIV testing rates were not uniformed between physician offices and ED. Plausible explanations for the reason of HIV testing differs across both health care settings were not assessed during this study. Reasons provided by previous studies about failure to conduct routine HIV testing in health settings among clinicians include a lack of knowledge of the CDC's testing guidelines; belief that patients are not at risk for HIV and assuming HIV testing is the responsibility of other health care professionals.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>In addition, lack of awareness and misconceptions regarding HIV testing by physicians and the patients, barriers at facility and legislative levels, costs associated with testing are major barriers affecting the CDC's recommendation.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Additional explanations for these variations include the following. First, full adoption of the 2006 CDC guidelines takes time and implementation may differ by health facility. There could also be facility and legislative level barriers, along with lack of awareness, resistance, and misconceptions regarding HIV testing by both physicians and patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Second, in the absence of a clear mandate for clinicians and health facilities to perform routine HIV screening, as well as poor communication or dissemination of the CDC guidelines, uptake in HIV testing rates may lag across health settings. Third, the lack of strategic planning and financial support to purchase and deploy portable point of care HIV testing equipment could limit uptake of HIV testing in health settings.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Fourth, physician behavior and reaction to the guidelines directly influence HIV testing among patients, and physicians may continue to rely on clinical presentations rather than the guidelines to recommend HIV testing. Fifth, the NAMCS and NHAMCS data may not accurately capture all HIV testing.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>The results of this study should be considered with some limitations in mind. HIV testing rates do not reflect exact incidence rates. Incidence rates cannot be estimated since the same patients could make more than 1 visit. Information about who was offered testing and reasons why HIV testing was not performed was not collected. Patients not tested might have declined testing because of prior screening from another visit. Unrecognized sampling biases might hamper the national representativeness of the population sample, while errors in data collection might affect appropriate measure of HIV testing rates.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> For instance, nonresponse to participate in the survey might have resulted in underestimation or overestimation of HIV testing. Moreover, sexual behavior or intravenous drug use data are absent, so estimation of HIV testing representing these factors was not possible.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The overall rates of HIV testing increased over the study period; however, increased HIV testing rates are not uniformed across different facilities and subpopulations. System level factors may play a significant role in improving HIV testing among minority populations. While our study could not investigate provider knowledge and practice, factors such as lack of time, funding constraints as well as lack of staff could impact decision to test or offer testing. The lower rates of HIV testing observed in the ED is worrisome, particularly for populations without a usual source of care. Tailored interventions for the ED may be necessary to reduce missed opportunities for HIV testing. To develop such interventions, future studies should examine factors such as reason of visit, testing history, and the reasons for offering/taking or not offering/taking HIV tests to understand both clinician and patients&#x02019; behavior appropriately. Future research should also examine which sub-populations (based on demographics and transmission risks) are more likely to get or not get tested, regardless of the health settings. In addition, future studies should also assess the knowledge, clarity and application of CDC testing guidelines among providers. Monitoring the response of health care settings, providers and patients to the CDC's HIV testing guidelines is important to achieve the goal of increasing HIV testing in the United States, and a key component of ending the epidemic. Therefore, careful and thoughtful approaches are needed for identifying HIV infections during physician and ED visits nationally.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Bankole Olatosi</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Khairul Alam Siddiqi</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Bankole Olatosi, Khairul Alam Siddiqi, Donaldson Fadael Conserve</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Bankole Olatosi</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Bankole Olatosi, Khairul Alam Siddiqi</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Bankole Olatosi</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Bankole Olatosi, Donaldson Fadael Conserve</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Bankole Olatosi, Khairul Alam Siddiqi</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review and editing:</bold> Bankole Olatosi, Donaldson Fadael Conserve</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CI = confidence interval, ED = emergency department, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus, HMO = health maintenance organizations, MSA = metropolitan statistical area, NAMCS = National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, NHAMCS = National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, OR = odds ratio, PLWH = people living with HIV.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: Olatosi B, Siddiqi KA, Conserve DF.
