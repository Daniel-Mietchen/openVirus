<p id="Par7">TaqMan real-time PCR was conducted to detect RSV, PIV1–4, HMPV, and other 12 common respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus (infA), influenza B virus (infB), human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), four types of coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1), adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (HBoV), MP, and CP, as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, real-time-PCR and RNA/DNA extraction kits were purchased from Guangzhou HuYanSuo Medical Technology Co., Ltd. RNA/DNA was extracted from 200-μL samples, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cycling conditions were 48 °C for 10 min, 94 °C for 2 min, and then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 55 °C for 35 s. The amplified products were detected using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Singapore). The sensitivity of the detection kits was 500 copies/mL and 1000 copies/mL for the target DNA and RNA, respectively.
