<p id="Par5">We performed a cross-sectional study in three tertiary hospitals between July 2009 and June 2016 in Guangzhou, southern China. Pediatric patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11,398) hospitalized with ARI were enrolled in this study. The detail inclusion criteria were pediatric patients (≤ 14 years old) who presented with at least two of the following symptoms: cough, pharyngeal discomfort, nasal obstruction, rhinitis, or dyspnea during the previous week. Patients who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography during the previous week were also included in the study, even if they did not show the clinical features described above. Some patients who had been cured and discharged some time ago but were then readmitted because of a new episode of ARI were included as new cases if met the recruitment criteria; otherwise, they were excluded. Chest radiography was conducted according to the clinical situation of the patient. Respiratory samples, including throat swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, were collected from the enrolled patients for routine screening of respiratory viruses, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> (MP), and 
 <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> (CP), according to established clinical protocols [
