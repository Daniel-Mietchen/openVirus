<p id="Par8">Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Numerical data were presented as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables of meteorological data, percentage for normal discrete variables, or median (interquartile range, IQR) for age distribution. Categorical data were compared with the chi-squared test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed with RSV, PIV, and HMPV prevalence as dependent variables and meteorological factors as independent variables. Linear correlations of meteorological independent variables were analyzed to exclude any effect on the final multiple linear regression analysis. The independent variable mean temperature drop 1 month (mean temperature in the preceding month) was also included as an independent variable in the multiple linear regression analysis because of its delay effect. A
