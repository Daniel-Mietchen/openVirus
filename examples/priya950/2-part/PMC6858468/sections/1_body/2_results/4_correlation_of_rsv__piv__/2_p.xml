<p id="Par14">Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between meteorological conditions and paramyxovirus prevalence. We first analyzed linear correlations among meteorological independent variables. We excluded the independent variables mean air pressure (adjusted

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and mean vapor pressure (adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.929, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which were linearly associated with mean temperature, and we excluded rainfall (adjusted

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.278, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which was strongly correlated with mean relative humidity. Thus, the independent variables included in the final multiple linear regression analysis were mean temperature, mean relative humidity, sunshine duration, and mean wind speed. Multiple linear regression models were established for RSV, PIV, and HMPV prevalence and meteorological data (
