<p id="Par19">In general, the epidemiology of the main respiratory viruses in patients with ARI has been closely monitored in developed countries; however, these data are less available in developing countries, mostly because of the high cost of these studies. RSV is known to occur in well-defined, recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with peaks occurring more often during the rainy season in tropical and subtropical areas; locations close to the equator have less consistent patterns, with some showing nearly continuous RSV activity and varying seasonal peaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this study, we found that RSV occurred during the change of seasons from winter to spring and from summer to autumn. This pattern is similar to those in previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. HMPV had a similar epidemic pattern to RSV, consistent with previous reports from other subtropical areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and differed from the pattern in temperate climates, which peaks at the end of winter or in early spring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In previous reports from the USA, PIV is second only to RSV as a cause of hospitalization for ARI (2–17%) among children aged younger than 5 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Seasonal peaks of PIV are mostly driven by PIV-3 and PIV-1, whereas there are a small number of PIV2 and especially PIV4 infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this study, PIV was isolated throughout the year and appeared to alternate with peaks in RSV and HMPV infection, increasing as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results differ from previous reports of biennial PIV epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The different geographic location might lead to the different seasonal distribution of PIV observed in the present study.
