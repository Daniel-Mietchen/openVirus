<p id="Par18">RSV, PIV, and HMPV are the most important respiratory viruses, causing lower respiratory illnesses among children worldwide [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In children with positive results for these three paramyxoviruses, the median age was highest in children who were HMPV positive and lowest for those positive for RSV. RSV mostly affected children under 2 years old, and the prevalence decreased with age (

The different age distributions of these three viruses may be helpful in determining appropriate pediatric care and disease diagnosis; however, laboratory testing is still necessary because of the complex diversity and similarities in clinical manifestations of respiratory pathogens [
