<p id="Par20">In addition to pathogenic characteristics, pathogenic epidemics are closely related to geographic environment, local climate, social development level, population structure, ethnic characteristics, social interaction, and so forth. Guangzhou has a maritime subtropical monsoon climate, with high temperatures (mean temperature 21.8 ± 5.8 °C) and high relative humidity (77.2 ± 7.3%). Investigation of respiratory pathogen epidemics in the region is of great importance. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between the prevalence of paramyxoviruses among pediatric hospitalized patients and meteorological conditions in Guangzhou. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed with monthly RSV, PIV, and HMPV prevalence as the dependent variable and current mean temperature (or mean temperature in the preceding month), mean relative humidity, mean wind speed, and sunshine duration as the independent variables. Regression models were established for RSV, PIV, and HMPV using the current monthly temperature model (

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, regression models using mean temperature in the preceding month model were not established. In general, the trend of associations between climate factors and respiratory pathogen activity varies with geographic location [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); this might be owing to the sensitivity of RSV and HMPV to ultraviolet light. In subtropical and temperate regions, RSV prevalence is more consistently positively correlated with lower temperatures and higher relative humidity [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which might be owing to the high relative humidity in the Guangzhou region (monthly mean relative humidity 77.2 ± 7.3%). PIV had an alternating seasonal distribution pattern with RSV and HMPV in this study. PIV incidence was negatively correlated with relative humidity, similar to RSV; however, PIV incidence was positively correlated with mean temperature, and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient of relative humidity (|− 0.194|) was smaller than the absolute value of the correlation coefficient of temperature (|0.328|) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which means that the effect of temperature on the distribution of PIV was greater than the relative humidity. This might explain the different distribution patterns between RSV and PIV. Overall, the established models were found to be of value for understanding the epidemic patterns of RSV, PIV, and HMPV (Fig.
