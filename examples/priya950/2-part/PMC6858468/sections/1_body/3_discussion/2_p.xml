<p id="Par17">The median age of the 11,398 enrolled pediatric patients was 1.8 years (IQR, 0.8–3.8), indicating the high public health burden among infants and young children, as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nearly half of all patients had positive test results for one or more of the pathogens of interest; moreover, all pathogens in the panel were detected, indicating the complexity and diversity of ARI etiology (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Higher pathogen prevalence was found among male patients than female ones (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), similar to previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. RSV, infA, MP, ADV, HRV, and PIV were the six most frequently detected pathogens in this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); these results are consistent with previous reports from China as well as international studies [
