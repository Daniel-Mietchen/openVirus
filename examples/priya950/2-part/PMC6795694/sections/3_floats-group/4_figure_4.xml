  <p>Protection mode of action afforded by a UIV. Antibodies against the HA globular head domain inhibit viral attachment via HA-mediated receptor binding to the sialic acid on cellular receptors (a). HA stalk antibodies have multiple protective functions. As the virus enters the cell, pre-bound stalk antibodies prevent the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and block the viral genome release into cytoplasm of the cell (b). Binding of stalk antibodies can also limit the access of cellular proteases to the cleavage site located in the stalk domain and inhibit the cleavage and subsequent conformational change of HA that is an essential step for acquiring viral infectivity (c). Different antibodies against HA stalk and also other viral proteins such as NA, M2, and NP are shown to mediate antibody-dependent effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), leading to the lysis of the virus-infected cells by immune cells or complement system (dâ€“f). NA antibodies inhibit receptor destroying activity of NA and prevent the budding of newly formed viral particles from the cells (g). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize the viral peptide presented on MHC-I molecule and kill the virus infected cell by the secretion of cytotoxic granules and cytokines (h).</p>
