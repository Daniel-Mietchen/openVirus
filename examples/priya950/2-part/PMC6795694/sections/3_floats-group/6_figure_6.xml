  <p>Co-evolution of influenza viruses and influenza vaccines. Within the past century, there were four influenza pandemics; 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1), 1957 Asian flu (H2N2), 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2), and 2009 swine flu (H1N1) (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski,

The 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1) evolved into seasonal influenza strain and had circulated for ~40 years until the next pandemic by 1957 Asian flu (H2N2), which after ~10 years of circulation was replaced by 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2). The 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2) has circulated until now as seasonal influenza strains. In 1977, H1N1 strain reemerged and was replaced by the 2009 swine flu (H1N1), which evolved into seasonal influenza strains circulating until now. Thus, H1N1 and H3N2 strains began to co-circulate from 1977. After the reemergence of H1N1 in 1977, World Health Organization has issued recommendations for trivalent vaccine composition containing A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains (Hannoun,
