  <p>Phylogenetic trees representing HA and NA diversity among influenza viruses. The 18 subtypes of HAs of IAV are divided into two phylogenetic groups according to their amino acid sequences similarities. The HAs of IBVs are divided into Victoria-like and Yamagata-like lineages but they are closer to each other than any of two different subtypes of IAVs. The HAs of ICVs are antigenically distant from those of IAVs and IBVs. The NAs of IAVs also show high levels of antigenic variability and are divided into two groups. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on amino acid sequence comparisons among influenza viruses. Multiple alignments were carried out using the representative sequence of each HA or NA subtype or lineage. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the ClustalW algorithm using neighbor joining (N-J) method and visualized by FigTree v1.4.4. The scale bars represent amino acid change (%).</p>
