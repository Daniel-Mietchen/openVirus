<p>Secondly, mRNA vaccines have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional vaccine platforms against various infectious diseases including the influenza virus (Pardi et al., 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). Initially, the mRNA vaccines successfully induced protective B cell and T cell immune response in mice, ferrets, and pigs (Petsch et al.,

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Notably, mRNA vaccines encoding HA elicited HA stalk antibodies in mice, rabbits, and ferrets, and the stalk antibody responses were associated with protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus infection in mice (Pardi et al., 
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>), depicting promising potential as a UIV platform.
