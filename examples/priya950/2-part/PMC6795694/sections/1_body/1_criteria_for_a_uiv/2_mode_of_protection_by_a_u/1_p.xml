<p>The cornerstone of developing a UIV is the determination of the precise protection mechanisms of immune response against influenza viruses. Influenza HA recognizes sialic acid on the cellular receptors and initiates infection by entering the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). While HA inhibitory (HAI) antibodies have long been considered as the gold standard for strain-specific protection, very few of them were shown to elicit a broad protection by binding to the conserved receptor-binding site (RBS) of HA, thereby preventing viral entry to the cell (Krause et al., 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recently, multifunctional protection mechanisms have been described for HA stalk-reactive antibodies. It has been shown that HA stalk antibodies may inhibit membrane fusion, the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm of the cell, and maturation of the HA precursor (Krammer and Palese, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, HA stalk antibodies can induce antibody-dependent effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC), resulting in clearance of virus-infected cells by the immune cells or the complement system (Jegaskanda et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>). During viral budding, NA cleaves the sialic acid from HA and supports multiple infection cycles by release of the newly assembled viral particles. NA inhibitory (NAI) antibodies specific to the conserved regions have shown an exceptional breadth, inhibiting divergent influenza viruses (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In addition to the broadly protective antibodies, T cell immunity against conserved viral internal proteins also provides a broad protection. Cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize the viral epitopes presented on MHC molecules and kill the infected cells. It is noteworthy that the cross-reactivity of T cell immunity has been recently shown to cover both IAVs and IBVs, and even the ICVs (Koutsakos et al., 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), although its protective role
