<p>Although there is a clear consensus about the urgent need for a vaccine that provides durable and broad protection against multiple strains of influenza virus, the definition of the “universality” of UIV is still debated (Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). Recently, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) held a meeting to identify and develop the criteria to define a UIV. The participants from multiple disciplines agreed that a reasonable UIV should be at least 75% effective against symptomatic influenza virus infection caused by group 1 and group 2 IAVs, with the protection lasting over 1 year for all age groups (Paules et al., 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erbelding et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similar criteria have also been suggested as preferred product characteristics (PPC) and target product profiles (TPP), describing the desired characteristics of a UIV, by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Despite the priority given to IAVs in WHO PPC (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the IBVs represent a “low hanging fruit” because of their low antigenic diversity and the lack of animal reservoir, presenting credence to potential eradication from humans (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The proposed consensus to define universal protection offers a valuable guideline to develop an effective and safe UIV. Ideally, the spectrum of protection may covers both IAVs and IBVs, considering the existence of extremely broadly protective antibodies and T cell epitopes across IAVs and IBVs from animals and humans (Corti et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Koutsakos et al., 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, as the antigenic difference between a vaccine and a target virus becomes larger, the number of conserved B cell or T cell epitopes between the two strains decreases. The limited availability of target epitopes may result in compromised protection robustness due to (1) decreased clonal diversity of cross-reactive antibodies and T cells, or (2) occurrence of escape mutants by even small amount of genetic mutations in the epitopes. Therefore, a balanced breadth and robustness of cross-protection should be considered when developing a reliable UIV (
