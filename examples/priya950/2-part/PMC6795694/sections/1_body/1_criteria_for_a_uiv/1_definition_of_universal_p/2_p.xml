<p>The NIAID and the researchers have proposed three research areas to address the knowledge gaps in developing a UIV; (1) understanding of influenza transmission, natural history, and viral pathogenesis, (2) characterization of correlates of protection, and (3) rational design of a UIV to improve potency and breadth of protection (Erbelding et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In particular, the correlates of protection elicited by a UIV may vary considerably in quantity and quality, depending on the vaccine type used and the target influenza virus tested. For instance, while the protection potency of HA stalk-based vaccine may easily be evaluated by measuring the neutralizing activity or indirect effector mechanisms by the stalk-reactive antibodies (Jegaskanda et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>), such correlates of protection cannot be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of a T cell epitope-based vaccine containing non-HA epitopes. Moreover, when using HA stalk-based vaccines, high levels of stalk-reactive antibodies represent a good protective efficacy against the same group IAVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the binding affinities of HA stalk antibodies are variable among different viruses, and therefore may require different antibody titers to exhibit sufficient protection against the viruses. This speculation is supported by the observations that broadly reactive HA stalk antibodies show considerably different neutralizing abilities and binding affinities to the viruses within the same HA group (Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, HA stalk-based vaccine and M2e-based vaccine may demonstrate a different balance of protective abilities to each other, between direct neutralization and indirect effector mechanisms (ADCC, for instance) by the respective antibodies. It has been shown that M2e antibodies provide protection via FcR-dependent effector functions rather than direct virus neutralization (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>), whereas HA stalk antibodies exert both direct neutralization and indirect effector functions (Krammer and Palese, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The antibody-mediated inhibition of virus attachment measured by hemagglutinin inhibition assay or microneutralization assay is the gold standard for seasonal influenza vaccines (Ohmit et al., 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, the assay cannot be applied simply to reflect the cross-protection by a UIV against heterologous/heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Therefore, it is essential to develop mechanistically distinct

 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays to measure potential correlates of protection in order to evaluate the protection potency and breadth of the vaccine.
