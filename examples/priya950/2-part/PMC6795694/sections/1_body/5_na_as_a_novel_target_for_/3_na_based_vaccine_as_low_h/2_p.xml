<p>Currently, we have very limited knowledge about anti-NA immunity. To develop a broadly protective vaccine based on NA, there are several critical questions that need to be answered. Firstly, although the NAI antibodies have been determined as an independent correlate of protection in humans (Couch et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Monto et al., 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), this needs to be further validated by the NA-only vaccine constructs in animal and human models. Secondly, very little is known about the breadth of NA immunity. The literature discussed earlier has consistently demonstrated a subtype-specific protection (e.g., within N1 or N2) of NA-based vaccines in animal models. Considering the repertoire of influenza viruses infecting humans and animals (including N1, N2, N3, N7, and N9 encompassing both NA group 1 and 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), a successful NA-based vaccine should be designed to elicit broad protection covering both NA groups. Hence, the determination of conserved regions or epitopes hidden in NA is urgently needed. Thirdly, the mechanisms by which NA antibodies contribute to protection are not completely understood. Many NAI antibodies inhibit its enzymatic activity and thus prevent the release of newly formed viral particles. However, the extent to which NAI antibody titers may be considered protective has not been determined yet. Evaluation of cross-protection against mismatched or heterologous strains may be even more complicated. While ADCC was shown to be involved in protection by non-neutralizing NA antibodies (Jegaskanda et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>; Wohlbold et al., 
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), other protective mechanisms are yet to be further elucidated. Further isolation and characterization of broadly protective NA antibodies is required for better design of NA-based vaccines. Comprehensive reviews on NA-based immunity and the perspectives on current knowledge gaps to be addressed may be found in specialized reviews (Wohlbold and Krammer, 
 <xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>).
