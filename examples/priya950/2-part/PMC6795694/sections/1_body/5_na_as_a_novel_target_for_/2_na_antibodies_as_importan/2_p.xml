<p>Several animal studies have identified NAI monoclonal antibodies that show protective effects against heterologous influenza infection. The breadth of NAI antibodies varied from subtype-specific to pan-influenza, depending on the conserved epitopes (Doyle et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Wan et al., 
 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recently, it was reported that influenza infection in humans induces a variety of broadly reactive antibodies directed to the NA (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this study, it was shown that among the total influenza-specific antibodies induced by infection, the NA-reactive antibodies accounted for 23% and HA-reactive antibodies 35%. By contrast, the subunit or split vaccine resulted in antibody response directed predominantly to HA (87%), with only 1% for NA. The poor ability of the seasonal vaccine to induce NA antibodies was apparently due to insufficient content or structural integrity of NA antigen used in current vaccine formulation. This research suggests that correctly folded and immunologically relevant NA antigen is capable of inducing broadly protective antibody responses.
