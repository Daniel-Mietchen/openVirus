<p>While the LAIV presents a remarkable prospect for a broadly protective influenza vaccine, several important issues need to be addressed for it to serve as a reliable vaccine modality. The protection efficacy of a LAIV substantially differs with age. The estimated protection efficacy of a LAIV is 80% in young children and only 40% in adults, to the matched strains (Jefferson et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As for T cell immune responses, clinical studies indicate that LAIVs induce better T cell response than IIVs in both children and adults (He et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Subbramanian et al., 
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hoft et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, clinical studies have reported that LAIVs are not effective at inducing T cell responses in adults and the elderly, perhaps due to preexisting “vector” immunity, which limits the replication of LAIVs (He et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Forrest et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hoft et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Considering that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity contribute to broad protection, it will be important to elucidate how preexisting immunity or immunologic imprinting affects B cell and T cell immune response induced by LAIVs in humans (Gostic et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Henry et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For this purpose, animal models mimicking preexisting immunity and controlled human challenge studies will be needed. Considering that LAIVs mimic natural infection, a fundamental question remains to be answered: if infection (or vaccination with LAIV) is effective for conferring protection, why are humans vulnerable to repeated infections with homologous or heterologous strains? At the population level, currently used cold-adapted LAIVs provide a relatively low protection rates (~40% in adults) even against matched strains (Jefferson et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, little is known whether individuals who successfully acquired protective immunity by a cold-adapted LAIV were protected against other heterologous strain(s) in the next epidemic. This may be directly addressed by a well-controlled longitudinal cohort study using human challenge models. Some studies showed that LAIVs were able to generate cross-reactive T cell responses in children for up to 1 year after vaccination, as a basis of long-term cross-protection in humans (Mohn et al., 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
