<p>Most of the LAIV-based approaches are based on cold-adapted attenuated strains (Nachbagauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). These strains acquire multiple attenuation mutations in the internal genes during the cold-adaptation process, which contribute to genetic stability to overall attenuation (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A common concern for live vaccines is safety issues, especially those associated with potential reversion of attenuating mutation(s) into virulence during vaccination. LAIVs acquired multiple attenuation mutations among various internal genes and proven safe as seasonal influenza vaccines (especially for A/Ann Arbor strain as the master strain for FluMist). However, genetically engineered LAIVs with a limited set of attenuation mutations, e.g., NS1-deletion or elastase-dependent HA cleavage (Talon et al., 
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Stech et al., 
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), may require additional monitoring on safety.
