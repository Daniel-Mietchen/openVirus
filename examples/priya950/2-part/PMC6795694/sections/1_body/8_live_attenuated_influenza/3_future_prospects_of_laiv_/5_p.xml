<p>As for IBVs, two distinct lineages diverged and circulated after 1985, which necessitates the incorporation of Victoria-like and Yamagata-like lineages in seasonal influenza vaccines. This leads us to raise a possibility of using an ancestral influenza B strain (such as B/Lee/40) before divergence into two different lineages as a UIV candidate for IBVs. Establishing new cold-adapted LAIV strains is a time-consuming and laborious. However, recent advances in reverse genetics and rational approaches to attenuate viral virulence have enabled the rapid conversion of a wild type virus into a novel LAIV strain. These approaches include NS1 truncation, elastase-dependent HA cleavage, caspase-dependent NP and NS1 cleavage, microRNA-mediated silencing, and codon deoptimization (Talon et al.,
