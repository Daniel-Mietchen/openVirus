<p>Defining the precise correlates of protection represents the most challenging step in the development of a UIV (Erbelding et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Significant efforts were made to identify the protection mechanisms of HA stalk-based vaccines, suggesting that direct neutralization in combination with Fc-dependent indirect effector mechanisms mediated by stalk antibodies were the primary correlates of protection. In contrast to HA stalk-based vaccines, LAIVs elicit multiple immunological factors including serum IgG antibodies and mucosal IgA antibodies to surface antigens (HA, NA, and M2) and cell-mediated immunity to internal antigens, synergistically contributing to protection. However, their quantitative relationship to protection has not been determined, not even for homologous protection (Sridhar et al., 
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mohn et al., 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), let alone for cross-protection against heterologous infection. The development of standardized assays to quantitatively measure T cell-mediated protection is particularly challenging, as the magnitude and the subset of T cells critical for protection is likely to differ according to strains of LAIV and challenge viruses. Further, mucosal IgA antibodies are believed to correlate with cross-protection, but it is still challenging to measure the neutralizing activity or effector functions of mucosal IgA antibodies. The complicated nature of LAIV-induced immunity, including non-neutralizing antibodies and diverse subsets of T cells, present a bottleneck to identifying precise correlates of protection.
