<p>The redirection of host immune responses from surface proteins toward internal proteins may be achieved by rational vaccination strategies with LAIVs. For example, the down regulation of expression levels of HA or NA in a LAIV (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) is likely to result in preferable induction of T cell immunity to internal proteins. Alternatively, vaccination with LAIV carrying HA from non-human influenza viruses such as H5 or H9 may be effective at boosting preexisting T cell immunity to internal proteins in humans. Given the cross-reactivity of T cell immunity between IAVs and IBVs, A type LAIVs and B type LAIVs may be administered as a bivalent formulation or by sequential vaccination to induce improved protection.
