<p>In the UIV approaches reported so far, LAIV was used either as a component in prime-boost regimens with other different vaccine formats such as IIV, DNA vaccine, or recombinant protein vaccine. Alternatively, LAIVs were also studies as a stand-alone vaccine given in single or multiple doses. A reassortant LAIV expressing a chimeric HA was constructed under the genetic background of Russian strain (A/Leningrad/134/17/57 cold-adapted virus) and used as a boosting vaccine in a ferret model (Nachbagauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Notably, the LAIV-IIV regimen showed greater protective efficacy against the pandemic H1N1 challenge than the IIV-IIV regimen in terms of viral loads in the respiratory tissues, despite 32-fold lower stalk antibody titers in serum. Several factors were presumed to account for this disconnect between stalk antibody titers and protection efficacy, including anti-NA immunity, mucosal IgA antibodies, cell-mediated immunity, and non-specific innate immune responses offered by the LAIV. Similar results were obtained when using a different LAIV strain (A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold-adapted strain) (Nachbagauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In a subsequent study performed by the same group, chimeric HA-containing the LAIV-LAIV (A/Leningrad/134/17/57 cold-adapted strain) vaccine regimen was compared with the LAIV-IIV combination in terms of protection efficacy in a ferret model, in which the LAIV-LAIV vaccine regimen conferred superior protection against pandemic H1N1 and H6N1 challenges than the LAIV-IIV (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). Another group tested a vaccination regimen comprising only LAIV (A/Leningrad/134/17/57 cold-adapted strain) as prime-boost vaccination in a mouse model (Isakova-Sivak et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). To enhance the breadth of protection, an internal gene of cold-adapted virus was replaced with the wild type. This study compared the immunogenicity and cross-protection between chimeric HA-containing LAIVs and natural HA-containing LAIVs. The chimeric HA-containing LAIVs induced higher HA stalk antibody titers and showed better cross-protection against heterologous infection with various group 1 IAVs. Thus, a cooperative role of cell-mediated immunity and HA stalk antibodies was suggested, although their individual contribution to protection were not assessed directly. It would be interesting to investigate if the cross-protection could be extended to group 2 influenza viruses such as H3 or H7 strains.
