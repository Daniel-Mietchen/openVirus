<p>In addition to direct neutralization, stalk antibodies have indirect mechanisms that involve diverse innate immune cells to clear the virus-infected cells from the host. The NK cells sense virus-infected cells via interaction between FcR and Fc portion of antibody bound to HA stalk expressed on the cell surface, and kill the infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules and antiviral cytokines, via ADCC mechanism (DiLillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The FcR-Fc interaction is also required for ADCP, by which macrophages or neutrophils recognize and engulf antibody-bound influenza viral particles or infected cells (Ana-Sosa-Batiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, stalk antibodies bound to virus-infected cells are also able to activate the complement system, leading to the lysis of virus-infected cells (CDC) (Terajima et al., 
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Animal challenge models have demonstrated broad protection by passive immunization with HA stalk monoclonal antibodies (DiLillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The stalk-reactive antibodies also inhibit NA enzymatic activity through steric hindrance, limiting NA access to the HA-bound sialic acid, thereby preventing viral egress (Wohlbold et al., 
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kosik et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The failure to release newly assembled virions from the infected cells prevents the viruses from entering into multiple cycles of infection. Overall, the stalk antibodies confer a broad protection from influenza virus infection through multiple mechanisms affecting both HA and NA throughout the infection cycle of influenza virus.
