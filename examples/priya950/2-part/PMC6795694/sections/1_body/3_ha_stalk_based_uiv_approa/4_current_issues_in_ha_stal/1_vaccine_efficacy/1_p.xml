<p>As discussed above, the protective efficacy of HA-stalk based vaccines is relatively weak, and multiple boost immunizations are required for efficient protection (Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, the breadth of protection is within the same HA group rather than both the groups (Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To complement the low efficacy, prime-boost approaches that entail sequential immunization by LAIV followed by inactivated virus containing chimeric HAs are being evaluated. As examined by a ferret challenge model, this approach provided potent cross protection (Nachbagauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It was observed that there is a “disconnect” between stalk antibody titers in serum and the protection level (Nachbagauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The results show that the broad protection observed in the ferret model was primarily mediated by multiple-level immune responses by LAIV and rather than the stalk antibodies (see section Live attenuated influenza vaccine as an alternative strategy below). This observation in preclinical model leads to the question of the relevance of HA stalk antibodies to cross-protection in humans. Studies with human infection model have led to a somewhat different interpretation on the protective role of the stalk antibodies, depending on the study design. A human challenge study showed that the naturally occurring stalk antibody titers were predictive of lowering viral shedding, but demonstrated poor correlation with the reduction of clinical symptoms upon the pandemic A/H1N1 challenge (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In contrast, a more recent study suggested the preexisting HA stalk antibodies as an independent correlate of protection against natural infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 virus (Ng et al., 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Thus, further studies are required for a conclusive demonstration of the breadth and efficacy of cross-protection offered by HA stalk antibodies in human challenge models.
