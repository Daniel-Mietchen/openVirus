<p>Although conserved among the influenza viruses, the HA stalk is not antigenically identical, showing sequence variability even within the same HA subtype. In line with this, a study demonstrated that H1 HA stalk could undergo mutations 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by immune pressure, although the variability was less than the head region (Anderson et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). On the other hand, another study show that while the stalk domain does evolve over time, this evolution is slow and, historically, is not directed to aid in evading neutralizing antibody responses (Kirkpatrick et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Several studies have isolated mutant influenza viruses showing resistance to stalk antibodies (Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Friesen et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Chai et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Notably, all isolated resistant viruses were seen to harbor three different mutations (Gln387Lys, Asp391Tyr, and Asp391Gly) in stalk region. While Gln387Lys mutation completely abolished the binding of the antibody to stalk region, the other two mutations rarely affected the antibody binding but enhanced the fusion ability of HA, representing two independent resistance mechanisms of the virus to escape stalk-reactive antibodies (Chai et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These reports together show that the stalk may undergo natural or directed antigenic changes, asking important considerations in the context of developing stalk-based UIVs. Especially, the occurrence of mutations that enhance the membrane fusion of HA in presence of stalk antibodies presents a potential concern to vaccine safety issues. It should, however, be noted that the stalk antibody escape mutants tend to lose a viral fitness and are highly attenuated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Henry Dunand et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Chai et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), alleviating the safety concerns.
