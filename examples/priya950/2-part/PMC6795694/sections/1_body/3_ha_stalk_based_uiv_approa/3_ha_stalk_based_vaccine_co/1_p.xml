<p>The first reported HA stalk-based UIV construct is the headless HA, a deletion mutant of HA lacking the globular head region (Graves et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Sagawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Steel et al., 
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). While the initial strategies demonstrated broadly protective potentials in animal models, the removal of the head region often led to misfolding of the stalk immunogen, rendering the critical neutralizing epitopes ineffective. Subsequent studies were conducted to enhance the structural integrity of the stalk immunogens by rational designs to mimic the native trimeric conformation (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mallajosyula et al., 
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Impagliazzo et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Other studies designed and evaluated nanoparticle structures consisting of the stalk antigens for broad protection in mice and ferret models (Yassine et al., 
 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Corbett et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The second approach to preferably induce stalk-reactive antibodies is based on chimeric HA that consists of stalk domain derived from the major target strains such as H1, H3, or B viruses fused with head domain from irrelevant avian strains such as H5, H6, or H8 (Krammer and Palese, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Multiple immunization was required to increase the stalk antibodies sufficient to provide protection from viruses within the same HA group (Hai et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The chimeric HA approach involves a full-length functional HA protein and, therefore, it may be expressed in genetically engineered viruses of the wild type or live attenuated influenza viruses (Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Isakova-Sivak et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Third approach relies on hyperglycosylation in the HA head domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The introduction of additional N-glycosylation sites into the immunodominant head domain shields the major antigenic sites in the head and redirects the host immune responses toward the immune-subdominant stalk. The hyperglycosylated HA antigens induced higher stalk antibodies and provided better protection than the wild type HA in a mouse model (Eggink et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similar approaches were tested for avian H5N1 vaccines, in which hyperglycosylated HA antigens were delivered in various vaccine formats such as DNA, recombinant protein, VLP, and adenoviral vector (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A recent study has shown that glycan shielding of HA head resulted in immune focus on a conserved epitope occluded at the head interface, with Fc-dependent protection activity in mice (Bajic et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). These results together suggest that hyperglycosylation in the HA head is a promising strategy to find novel target epitopes hiding in the head and stalk in HA.
