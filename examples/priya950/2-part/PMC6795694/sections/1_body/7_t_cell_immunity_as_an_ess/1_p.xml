<p>A vast majority of current efforts to develop a UIV are focused on inducing antibody response toward surface glycoproteins, M2e, HA, and NA. However, T cell immunity has been acknowledged as a potential immune correlate of broad protection against influenza infections (Sridhar, 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Clemens et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). T cell immunity may not provide sterilizing or neutralizing immunity against influenza viruses but improves the standard of care by reducing the disease severity and duration of infection, facilitating recovery from illness (Sridhar, 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It, therefore, seems that multiple immune arms including both antibodies and T cell immunity are critical to provide a truly universal protection against highly variable influenza viruses. The influenza-specific T cell immunity is known to be highly cross-reactive by recognition of conserved peptides between different subtypes of IAV (Assarsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kreijtz et al., 
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; van de Sandt et al., 
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Extensive studies have proven the protective role of vaccination or infection-induced cross-reactive CD8+ T cells in various animal models (Kreijtz et al., 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bodewes et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hillaire et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Additionally, in humans, CD8+ T cells offered cross-protection across seasonal, pandemic, avian IAVs, and both lineages of IBVs (Gras et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hayward et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; van de Sandt et al., 
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). The majority of cross-reactive T cell epitopes of IAVs are derived from internal proteins; among &gt;70 T cell epitopes identified between H5N1 and H3N2 viruses, only one derived from HA and other from internal proteins (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This is not surprising given that the conservation rate of internal proteins is &gt;90%, whereas that of surface HA and NA is only 40â€“70% among IAVs (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), which shows that inducing T cell immunity directed to internal proteins of influenza virus may provide a basis of developing T cell-based UIVs.
