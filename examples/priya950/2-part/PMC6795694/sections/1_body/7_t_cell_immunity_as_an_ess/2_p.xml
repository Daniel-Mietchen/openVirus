<p>Despite poor sequence homology between the HAs of IAVs and IBVs, HA stalk harbors not only extremely broad B cell epitopes but also T cell epitopes encompassing both types of influenza viruses. The fusion peptide in HA stalk contains a cross-reactive CD4+ T cell epitope conserved in both IAVs and IBVs, although its protective role has not been examined 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Babon et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes are highly conserved in internal proteins (Terajima et al., 
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A recent study has discovered a universal human CD8+ T cell epitope in PB1 (NMLSTVLGV PB1
 <sub>413−412</sub>) that is identical across IAVs, IBVs, and ICVs (Koutsakos et al., 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The preexisting memory PB1
 <sub>413−412</sub>+CD8+ T cells were detected in the blood and lung tissues of healthy donors and clonally expanded upon infection with IAV or IBV. This report not only showed the existence of heterotypic memory CD8+ T cells in humans that could be induced by exposure to influenza viruses, but also presents the prospect of designing a T cell-based UIV. However, these cross-reactive T cells were not induced in HHD-A2 mouse model despite multiple influenza infections or vaccinations and the protective role of the T cells could not be assessed in the study. Nonetheless, the existence of a number of cross-reactive T cell epitopes between IAVs and IBVs provides an avenue to address to a UIV.
