<p>Many studies conducted on animals and humans have elucidated the mechanisms of cross-protection conferred by M2e-based vaccines. A common observation is that antibodies specific to M2e cannot directly neutralize the viruses but confer cross-protection by eliciting several mechanisms of antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses. The most well-characterized protection mechanisms include ADCC, ADCP, and CDC (

Studies have shown that multiple types of immune cells including the natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, or macrophages have the ability to sense the virus-infected cells by interaction with the Fc receptors (FcR) and the Fc region of M2e antibodies. This results in killing (ADCC) or phagocytosis (ADCP) of the infected cells (Huber et al.,

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Guilliams et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The complement is also known to bind to the Fc of M2e antibodies and triggers the complement cascade, leading to formation of the membrane attack complex and target cell lysis (CDC) (Wang et al.,

 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). These studies together suggest that M2e-specific non-neutralizing antibodies play a crucial role in broad protection against IAVs through the clearance of the virus-infected cells. Besides non-neutralizing effector functions, it has also been shown that M2e-displaying recombinant bacteriophages induce HAI antibodies in a mouse model (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). In addition, the T cell responses directed to M2e have been shown to contribute to cross-protection. Several studies have shown the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes in M2e region in mice and humans (Jameson et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Gianfrani et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Mozdzanowska et al., 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Eliasson et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In line with this, it has been demonstrated that CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell-mediated immunity are critical for cross-protection elicited by M2e-based UIVs including VLPs or recombinant peptide vaccines (Lee et al.,
