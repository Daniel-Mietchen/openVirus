<p>It remains a challenge to overcome the low protective efficacy of M2e-based vaccines, due to intrinsic low immunogenicity of the vaccine antigen and the low abundance of M2 proteins on influenza virions and infected cells. From the clinical and practical standpoints, multiple immunizations with a high dose of vaccine antigens combined with potent adjuvants may pose safety concerns, rendering M2e-based vaccine approaches inadequate as a stand-alone UIV. Consequently, M2e antigen was combined with other influenza viral antigens (mostly HA) or supplemented with strain-specific vaccines, resulting in improved potency, and broader cross-protection. For instance, several studies combined M2e with influenza HA head or stalk domain to elicit broadly protective immunity against heterologous influenza infections with various vaccine platforms including nanoparticles, recombinant proteins, and recombinant influenza viruses (Guo et al.,
