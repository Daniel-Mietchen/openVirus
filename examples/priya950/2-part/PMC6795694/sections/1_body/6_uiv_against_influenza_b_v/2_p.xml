<p>In line with these observations, chimeric HA strategy has also been tested for a UIV against IBVs. Chimeric HAs consisting of HA head domain from IAV and stalk domain from IBV, delivered as a DNA vaccine (prime), followed by two boosting immunizations with protein vaccines into mice, provided broad protection against both the lineages as well as an ancestral strain of IBV (Ermler et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Mosaic HA is an advanced version, in which major antigenic sites of type B HA head domain were replaced by those of type A HA head so that antibodies directed to conserved regions both in the head and stalk domains of type B HA could be induced (Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The mosaic B HA provided broad protection against both lineages of IBV, through non-neutralizing ADCC-mediating antibody responses. There are only a few studies reporting B NA-based vaccine offering cross-lineage protection. A study showed that mice immunized with recombinant B NA protein of B/Yamagata/16/88 were protected from homologous Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages (Wohlbold et al., 
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Another study demonstrated that a B NA-based vaccine inhibited the transmission of both homologous and heterologous IBVs in Guinea pig model (McMahon et al., 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). As compared to IAVs, very little effort has been made so far to develop a UIV against IBVs. However, considering the limited diversity and variability (

 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
