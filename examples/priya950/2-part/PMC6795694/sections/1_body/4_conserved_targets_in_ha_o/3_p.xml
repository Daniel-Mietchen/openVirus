<p>Despite the presence of conserved epitopes, the head domain is not a feasible vaccine antigen because of the immunodominance of the surrounding variable regions in the head that compete and prevent effective induction of antibodies toward the conserved regions. Therefore, several strategies were designed to enhance the breadth of protection by HA-based vaccines. The centralized HA was reconstructed such that whole HA contained consensus amino acids derived from diverse strains within a subtype (Weaver et al., 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This engineered HA antigen induced stronger immune response and provided better protection against heterologous influenza viruses, as compared to natural wild type HA antigen. Another approach, conceptually similar to the centralized HA, is based on a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA), in which the HA was designed to carry consensus sequences. The COBRA strategy was tested against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza viruses, and demonstrated broad protection within a subtype (Giles and Ross, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Crevar et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Carter et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A third strategy is the use of ancestral sequences as vaccine antigens to widen the window of cross-protection against diversified lineages or clades. Through phylogenetic tree analysis, putative ancestral HA and NA sequences have been determined and used as vaccine antigens, showing broadened cross-protection against multiple clades of H5N1 viruses in animal models (Ducatez et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Collectively, the UIV candidates using HA head or full-length antigen are based on reconstructed HA containing consensus sequences. Although the protection breadth of those strategies appears to be restricted to a subtype or a specific clade, similar concepts may be applied to other antigens such as HA stalk or NA to substantially improve the protection breadth.
