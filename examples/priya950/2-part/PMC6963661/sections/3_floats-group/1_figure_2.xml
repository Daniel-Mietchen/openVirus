  <p>Dengue dynamics and its implications for vaccine design. Lineage turnover and dynamics depend on three key factors; genetic fitness, population immunological status, and stochastic events. (1) Genetic fitness linked to increased transmission and out competition of other lineages has been associated with positive selection of non-synonymous mutations [

   <xref rid="B146-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] and purifying/negative selection by introduction of mutations fixed by chance that have fitness advantages in an immunological context [

   <xref rid="B153-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. (3) The immunological status of the population in context of previous dengue infection likely effects lineage dynamics by balancing between ADE-mediated infection enhancement and short-term cross-serotype protection [

   <xref rid="B157-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Both viral replication rates and previous serotype/lineage infections have been associated with disease severity [
