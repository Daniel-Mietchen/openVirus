<p>Finally, the retrospective study of Daniela Weiskopf 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B106-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] which identified considerable numbers of new CD8 epitopes, showed that during primary infection most CD8 targeted serotype-specific epitopes, however this changed to mostly targeting cross-serotype conserved epitopes in secondary infection with a different serotype. Therefore, there is some skewing of CD8 responses dependent on what epitopes are conserved between the two serotypes you have been infected with. However, these conserved epitopes were of high avidity and produced a poly-functional response (INFγ, IL2, TNFα). Although, they did conduct a meta-analysis which linked HLA as a risk factor in disease severity which was associated with low CD8 response magnitude, showing that a low magnitude response was associated with a mono-functional response.
