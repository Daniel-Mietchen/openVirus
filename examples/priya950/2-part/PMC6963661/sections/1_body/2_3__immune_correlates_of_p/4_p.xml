 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Increased binding and uptake has been shown in P338D1 cells [

 <xref rid="B71-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Recent in vitro work suggests that in some FcR-containing cell types the increase in infected cells and viremia in ADE may in fact be mediated by enhanced fusion within endosomes and not increased host cell binding and uptake [
 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Work has also shown that FcR binding in ADE may modulate the antiviral response. For example, THP-1 monocyte cells infected via ADE showed that FcR signalling reduced type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and nitric oxide radicals, whilst increasing IL-10 expression. This consequently led to enhanced viral production and viral load [

 <xref rid="B73-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It should be noted however, that IL-10 induction has not been found in macrophages [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Considerable work shows or suggests that the high viremia is associated with vascular leakage [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model with maternal antibodies, found increased TNFα and linked this to vascular leakage [
 <xref rid="B78-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In humans with severe dengue TNFα levels have been found to be elevated [
