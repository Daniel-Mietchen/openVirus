<p>The combination of supporting evidence for both a protective and detrimental role for CD8 suggests that CD8 may play a multifaceted role in disease, which may depend on CD8 epitope characteristics in the context of epitopes variants and level of antigen presentation enhancement by ADE. This may have detrimental implications for the other two most progressed vaccines from NIH and Takeda which contain dengue proteins targeted by both antibodies and CD8 T-cells [

The evidence therefore suggests that a vaccine based on cross-serotype conserved CD8 epitopes may more predictably raise protective poly-function CD8 responses.
