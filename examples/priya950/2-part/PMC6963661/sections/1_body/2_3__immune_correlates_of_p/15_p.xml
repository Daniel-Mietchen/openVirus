<p>Interestingly, Heather Friberg 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B128-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] reported that dengue specific CD8 T-cells reach peak frequency slightly earlier in primary than secondary infection. This observed difference may be explained by increased apoptosis of CD8s in secondary infection, which has been reported using an NS3 epitope measuring Ki67 positive cells [
 <xref rid="B127-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In further support of a pathogenic CD8 role, an epitope- and HLA-independent measure for CD8 proliferation (CD96) has shown that during the acute febrile phase there is an increase in total activated CD8 T-cells in patients that developed vascular leakage [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B128-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] however showed no difference in the frequency of dengue specific CD8 or their activation level (CD38) in acute phase for primary or secondary infection and used multiple epitopes and HLAs.
