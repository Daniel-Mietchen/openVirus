<p>Additionally, Heather Friberg 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] suggested that as the release of the CD8 mediators was sequential starting with MIP-1b, that the mono-functional response maybe due to inherent features of the epitope variant sequence effecting the length of TCR interaction. A process referred to by the Weiskopf group [
 <xref rid="B105-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] as altered peptide ligands (APL) [
 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. It has been suggested that cross-reactive CD8s may preferentially bind to heterotypic epitope variants [
 <xref rid="B127-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], however this is not the case and instead epitope preference is due to inherent properties of the peptides affecting HLA avidity [
