<p>In further support of antigenic sin, evidence exists to suggest that cross-reactive MHC binding does not necessarily elicit an effective CD8 response [

 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. These cross-reactive CD8s are clearly able to bind epitopes across serotypes and in many cases due to serotype variability (25%–30%) these will have sequence differences (epitope variants) [
 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Considerable work on epitope variants (mostly with the NS3 GTS epitope and its variants) have shown that although stimulation with a heterotypic epitope variant (an epitope variant from another serotype) induces proliferation these T-cells are low avidity [
 <xref rid="B127-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] and have reduced cytotoxic degranulation with elevated cytokine release [
 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Furthermore, Heather Friberg 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] extensively characterised the activation of dengue specific CD8 T-cells and showed that some heterotypic epitope variants showed an atypical mono-functional CD8 response characterised by MIP-1b release, whereas other heterotypic variants of the same epitope and the homotypic variant were associated with a polyfunctional response (MIP-1b, degranulation, TNFα, IFNγ) [
 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. A poly-functional response is associated with protection in other viruses [

 <xref rid="B139-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Consequently, this suggested that the heterotypic serotype (and therefore heterotypic epitope variant) that a person gets challenged with could actually affect the type of cross-reactive CD8 response they get, i.e., the order of serotype infection [
 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. In support of this, greater numbers of dengue specific CD8s producing TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-2 prior to heterotypic infection was associated with an asymptomatic infection [
