<p>Until recently few MHCI epitopes were also known, however the seminal work of Daniela Weiskopf 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B106-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] increased the number of CD8 epitopes by over 83%, and the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) [
 <xref rid="B123-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] now has over MHCI 350 human epitopes. This, until recent scarcity of epitopes may partly explain the recent paradigm shift in CD8 correlates, driven partly by the Weiskopf group [
