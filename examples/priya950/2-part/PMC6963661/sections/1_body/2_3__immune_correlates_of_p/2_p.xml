 <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] provided direct evidence that maternal dengue antibodies both provided immunity in infants from dengue infection and that their decline correlated with severe dengue symptoms. The lack of T-cells in this situation suggested antibodies as the main mediator of protection and disease severity. Early in vitro work however showed that antibodies could also enhance infection via Fc receptors (FcR) [
