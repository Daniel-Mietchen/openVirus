<p>In-terms of vaccination this suggests that raising high levels of neutralising antibodies against E would be protective, these could be homotypic or heterotypic. However, a decline in the heterotypic levels could be detrimental. Avoiding prM antibodies may be beneficial to prevent immature virions from becoming infectious. In hindsight it is therefore not surprising that the tetravalent Sanofi CYD-TDV vaccine consisting E and prM caused increased virulence [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This could have been mediated by prM antibodies acting on immature virions or the tetravalent nature possibly encouraging cross-reactive antibodies. Alternatively, competition between each virus type may cause certain vaccine serotypes to replicate more skewing the antibody response, which has been seen in mosquitoes and humans [

 <xref rid="B104-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. It may also explain the differing levels of serotype protection seen [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. However, in a Phase II trial for CYD-TDV, neutralising antibodies against all four serotypes were detected but there was no DENV2 protection [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another consideration is that the titer of the antibody responses against each protein is not uniform (
 <xref rid="vaccines-07-00203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Understanding the subtleties of the humoral response elicited by DENV is therefore not only important to avoid detrimental enhancement effects but also to identify potential DENV protein regions with the ability to generate autoreactive antibodies. This should therefore be strongly considered during vaccine design.
