<p>Importantly, increased DENV viral replication has been associated with more severe disease [

 <xref rid="B161-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Evidence for positive selection and its association with virulence has been reported. For example, a replacing clade in Thailand in the 1990s was found to have higher viral titers within the mosquito hemocoel, suggesting increase transmission [
 <xref rid="B147-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Furthermore, the replacing DENV2 lineage in Vietnam during the late 1990s was associated with increase viral titers in humans which was linked to increased transmission [
 <xref rid="B150-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. In Nicaragua a replacing DENV2 clade had nine amino acid substitutions not found in the old clade, two of which were found in the NS5 RdRp region which could affect its RdRp activity (R401K and T290I) [
 <xref rid="B146-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Positive selection of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions, assessed by maximum-likelihood, has also been associated with replacement clades. For example, minor positive selection has been identified for NS2A [
