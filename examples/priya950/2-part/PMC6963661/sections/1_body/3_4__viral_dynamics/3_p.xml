<p>DENV lineages have been associated with varying disease severity [

 <xref rid="B150-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], therefore an understanding of these dynamics would greatly aid future intervention methods including vaccine design. However, in the field there is considerable controversy regarding the factors modulating lineage dynamics, with many papers supporting alternative hypothesises [

 <xref rid="B153-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Although, most agree that as yet we do not have a firm enough grasp to predict these dynamics. Within the field, three different factors have each been hypothesised to control dengue dynamics; (i) genetic fitness, (ii) population immunological status, and (iii) stochastic events, each with supporting evidence from the field [

 <xref rid="B153-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. This controversy is likely a consequence of the multifactorial nature of dengue infection dynamics. Coincidently, recent work [

 <xref rid="B154-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] is starting to appreciate that all three factors likely contribute in a complex cross-talk. Using the current sphere of knowledge, a hypothetical diagrammatic representation of this complex dynamic process has been created (
