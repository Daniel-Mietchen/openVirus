<p>Dengue dynamics in endemic regions are complex, characterised by continual lineage turnover and changes in prevalence [

 <xref rid="B147-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. These lineage turnover dynamics have however been classified on a genetic level as following two non-mutually exclusive patterns, (i) an incremental spectrum of dead-end variants within lineages and (ii) dramatic replacements of lineages [
