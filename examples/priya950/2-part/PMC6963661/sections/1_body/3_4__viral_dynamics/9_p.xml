<p>Conversely, an increase in prevalence of lineages has been associated with infection enhancement by ADE in secondary infection using models [
 <xref rid="B171-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>], which coincidently has been linked to increased chances of severe disease [
 <xref rid="B146-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. In support of this, OhAinle 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B146-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] showed that a replacing DENV2 clade in Managua was associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, they found that disease severity risk was associated to which DENV2 clade they became infected with following a primary DENV3 infection [

 <xref rid="B153-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Models supporting both these scenarios have predicted that ADE enhancement and serotype cross-protection are large factors controlling dengue lineage dynamics (including replacement) and prevalence [

 <xref rid="B172-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. This considerable evidence for positive selection above, and this, suggest that both positive and purifying selection likely play a key role in dengue dynamics.
