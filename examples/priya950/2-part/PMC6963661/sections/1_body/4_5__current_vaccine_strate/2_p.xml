<p>The enhancement seen with CYD-TDV is a major concern to the many other tetravalent vaccines also in development, all of which contain regions of the DENV proteome known to elicit robust antibody responses [

 <xref rid="B173-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Both contain CD8 inducing non-structural dengue proteins that are absent from Sanofi CYD-TDV, however, they also contain structural proteins raising the concern of eliciting enhancing or autoreactive antibodies. Furthermore, the tetravalent nature of these vaccines raises the question of how you can ensure each construct raises similar level immune responses to prevent enhancing effects against some of the serotypes.
