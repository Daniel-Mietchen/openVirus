<p>The DENV depends on both a human and mosquito host to complete its lifecycle, where it exists primarily in urban environments as either endemic or epidemic cycles [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The primary urban vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is found across the globe in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The virus also exists in sylvatic cycles in forested areas and has been known to infect humans on rare occasions [
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Initially an 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito will become infected by taking a bloodmeal from a febrile human host, following which the virus replicates over a period of 4–7 days [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] before it is found in the salivary gland in high numbers [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Following a bite from an infectious mosquito [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] the virus is then released into the human host via the insect’s saliva, which it injects while taking a bloodmeal [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The virus has also been shown to transmit maternally in mosquitoes to the female eggs, however its role within urban environments is unknown [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
