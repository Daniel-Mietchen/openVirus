 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. NS2B is critical to NS3′s serine protease function [

 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Processed viral proteins with some host factors form a complex that mediates the replication of the viral genome via a negative-strand intermediate. Most importantly the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) synthesises the negative-strand RNA which it uses to produce the positive sense RNA with a double stranded intermediate [

 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. NS3 and NS5 mediate the 5′ capping of the nascent +RNA [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. NS3 also functions during replication via its helicase activity [
