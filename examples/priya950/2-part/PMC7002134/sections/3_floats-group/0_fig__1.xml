  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) S2 cells were cotransfected with plasmid encoding EGFP (0.3 μg), together with either an empty vector or an expression vector for FHV B2 (FB2) or DENV2 nonstructural protein (1 μg for each) as indicated. At 24 hours post-transfection (hpt), EGFP-specific dsRNA (0.1 μg) was transfected. Total RNAs were extracted at 24 hpt and subjected to Northern blotting with a digoxigenin (DIG)–labeled RNA probe targeting the 500 to 720 nt of EGFP open reading frame (ORF). Rp49 mRNA was used as a control. (
   <bold>B</bold>) S2 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of FHV replicon (pFR1) alone or cotransfected with B2-deficient FHV replicon (pFR1-ΔB2) (1 μg) and FB2 or DENV2 NS2A (1 μg for each) as indicated. At 48 hpt, FHV RNA transcription was induced by incubation with CuSO
   <sub>4</sub> at 0.5 mM, and 24 hours after induction, total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blotting by DIG-labeled RNA probe specific for FHV RNA1 and RNA3. The band between RNA1 and RNA3 represents the mRNA transcribed from the B2 expression vector. The dmAGO2-KD and nonspecific (NC)–knockdown (KD) cells were used as a control. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The purified FB2 or DENV2 NS2A recombinant protein was incubated with 0.4 μg of 200-nt dsRNA, together with a recombinant human Dicer (rehDicer) (0.5 U) at 37°C for 12 hours. The RNAs were separated on 7 M urea–15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The EGFP mRNA levels in S2 cells expressing EGFP and EGFP dsRNA, together with wild-type (WT) or indicated mutant NS2A (1 μg for each) were determined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with that in the presence of WT NS2A defined as 1. Data represent means and SD of three independent experiments. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting, with indicated antibodies. (
