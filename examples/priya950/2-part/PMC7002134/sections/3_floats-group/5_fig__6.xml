  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Northern blotting of vsiRNAs in NC-KD, aaDicer2-KD, or aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells infected with DENV2
   <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> at an MOI of 10 at 3 dpi. U6 was used as a loading control. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells expressing dmAGO2 or dmAGO2
   <sub>D965A</sub> were infected with DENV2
   <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> (MOI = 10). At 3 dpi, the cell lysates were subjected to RNA-IP with anti-HA antibody. Input and precipitated small RNAs or proteins were detected by Northern or Western blotting via indicated probes or antibodies, respectively. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) NC-KD, aaDicer2-KD, or aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells in the absence or presence of ectopically expressed dmAGO2 or dmAGO2
   <sub>D965A</sub> were infected with DENV2
   <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> (MOI = 10) as indicated. At 1 to 3 dpi, the levels of DENV2 genomic RNAs were determined via qRT-PCR. The level of DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> RNA in Aag2 cells at 1 dpi was defined as 1 (C). The viral titers at 3 dpi were determined (D). All data represent means and SD of three independent experiments. The qRT-PCR and viral titer results were measured by two-way ANOVA and 
   <italic>t</italic> test (GraphPad Prism), respectively. *
