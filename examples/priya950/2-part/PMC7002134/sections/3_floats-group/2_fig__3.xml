  <title>NS2A works as a potent VSR during DENV infection in human 293T cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) 293T, 293T-NoDice, 293T-IFNAR1-KO, or 293T-NoDice/IFNAR1-KO cells were infected with the same titer (MOI = 10) of DENV2
   <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> at 3 dpi, and the vsiRNAs were detected via Northern blotting by using a DIG-labeled RNA probe complementary to 150 to 200 nt of the (−)-stranded antigenomic RNA. The same set of RNA and protein samples were used for Northern or Western blotting to detect indicated RNAs or proteins. The same cell lysates were subjected to RNA–immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti–pan-AGO antibody, and Western and Northern blotting were performed to detect precipitated hAGO and hAGO-bound vsiRNAs. The synthetic 21- and 25-nt RNAs were used as size markers. (
