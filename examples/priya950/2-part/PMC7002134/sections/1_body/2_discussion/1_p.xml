<p>Antiviral RNAi is an intrinsic immune defense mechanism conserved in diverse eukaryotic organisms. Vector-borne viruses, such as mosquito-borne flaviviruses, infect and replicate in both invertebrates and mammals. However, although flaviviruses have been previously revealed to induce vsiRNA production in insect cells (

 </xref>), it was unknown whether these viruses also induce vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian cells and whether and how flaviviruses use certain strategy to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection in both mammals and mosquitoes.
