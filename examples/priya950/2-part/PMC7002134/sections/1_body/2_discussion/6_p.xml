<p>Why does antiviral RNAi respond to the same flavivirus less effectively in differentiated mammalian cells than in insect cells? A probable mechanism is that mammalian Dicer bears some intrinsic inhibition(s). Factually, it has been found that the N-terminal helicase domain of hDicer can autoinhibit its siRNA processing activity (

  <italic>41</italic>
 </xref>) have revealed that the IFN-I system inhibits dsRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian somatic cells via the association of the RIG-like receptor LGP2 with Dicer. However, inactivation of IFN-I response by depleting RIG-I and MDA5 is insufficient to enable vsiRNA production in human somatic cells infected with several WT RNA viruses (

  <italic>42</italic>
 </xref>), which we also observed in DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-infected IFNAR1-KO cells. Such a discrepancy is probably attributed to the interference of VSRs. A recent study by us uncovered that infection with WT ZIKV could induce the production of abundant vsiRNAs in hNPCs, which lack IFN-I response, but not in neurons differentiated from hNPCs, implying that hDicer machinery and antiviral RNAi are highly tunable and differently regulated during distinct stages of cell differentiation (
