<p>For the reversal-of-silencing assay in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 and mosquito Aag2 cells, the EGFP reporter gene, FHV B2 and DENV1-4 viral proteins were constructed into the insect expressing vector pAc5.1/V5-HisB as previously described (

 </xref>). The 400-nt dsRNA for EGFP silencing in S2 or Aag2 cells were generated by in vitro transcription as described (

 <sub>4</sub>-induced pMT vector were provided by S.-w. Ding (Riverside, CA, USA). Mutations were introduced into the DENV2 NS2A coding region by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–mediated mutagenesis with appropriate primers containing the desired nucleotide changes.
