<p>Plaque assays were performed on BHK-21 cells in 12-well plates infected with a 10-fold serial dilution of viruses. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to allow adsorption. Then, the supernatant was removed, and cells were overlaid with 1% low–melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM containing 2% FBS. After further incubation at 37°C for 5 days, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet to visualize the plaques.</p>
