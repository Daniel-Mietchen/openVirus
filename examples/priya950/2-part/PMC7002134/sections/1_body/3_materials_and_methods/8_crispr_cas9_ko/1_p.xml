<p>The IFN-α/βRα CRISPR-Cas9 KO and IFN-α/βRα homology directed repair (HDR) plasmids (sc-401662 and sc-401662-HDR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to knockout 
 <italic>ifnar1</italic> gene in 293T and 293T-NoDice cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after transfection with the CRISPR-Cas9 KO and HDR plasmids, cells were allowed to be cultured for 3 days, selected by puromycin (1 μg/ml) (Invivogen) and single-cell sorting. The resulting clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western blotting.
