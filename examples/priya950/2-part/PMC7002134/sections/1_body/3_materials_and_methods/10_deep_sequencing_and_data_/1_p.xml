<p>Libraries of small RNAs from cell culture were constructed using TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kits (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 at RiboBio. The sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (release hg19) or mosquito genome (AaeGL5.0) by using Bowite 2.2.5, and the cellular miRNA expression level was determined on the basis of the number of reads that was identical to the annotated miRNA sequences in miRBase version 18, only allowing −2 or +2 nt to be templated by the corresponding genomic sequence at the 3′-end. vsRNA reads that cannot be mapped to human genome were then mapped to DENV2 genome with 100% identity. The subsequent analysis of length and location of these vsRNAs were calculated using in-house Perl scripts. Pairs of complementary 22-nt vsRNAs in each library in different distance categories were computed using principles as previously described (
