<p>R94A and K135A mutations in DENV2 NS2A were introduced into the infectious DENV2 cDNA clone of strain TSV01 (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>) (provided by P.-Y. Shi, University of Texas Medical Branch) by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. R140A mutation in JEV NS2A was introduced into the infectious JEV cDNA clone of SA-E70 (

  <italic>46</italic>
 </xref>) (a chimeric JEV strain where the prM-E gene of SA14-14-2 is replaced with that of SA14). The positive clones confirmed by sequencing were linearized and then subjected to in vitro transcription by using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). RNA transcripts were then transfected into C6/36 cells with Lipofectamine 3000, and the rescued viruses were harvested 3 to 4 days after transfection. All the rescued WT and mutant viruses were amplified in C6/36 cells. Viruses were concentrated by Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore), and the titers of viruses were measured by plaque assays.
