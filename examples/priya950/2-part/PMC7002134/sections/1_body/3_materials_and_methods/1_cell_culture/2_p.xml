Briefly, lungs were minced and digested in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with type II collagenase (10 mg/ml; Worthington) and deoxyribonuclease I (20 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 hours at 37°C with shaking. Cell suspensions were filtered through progressively smaller cell strainers (100 to 40 μm). Filtered cells were plated by using DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). One hour later, adherent MLFs were rinsed with HBSS and cultured for the subsequent experiments. For knockdown of Dicer, WT or
