<p>Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the samples required for detection of both viral siRNAs and viral genomic RNAs, small RNA–enriched total RNAs were isolated using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Northern blot analysis of high–molecular weight RNA, 5 μg of total RNAs was resolved on denaturing 1.5% agarose gels with 2.2 M formaldehyde, capillary-transferred to a Hybond-A nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). Equal loading was verified before transfer by ethidium bromide staining of total RNA within the RNA gels. For Northern blot analysis of low–molecular weight RNA, 20 μg of total RNAs was resolved on 7 M urea–15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to Hybond-A nylon membrane (GE Healthcare), and chemically cross-linked using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. The probe for detection of EGFP mRNA was complementary to the 500 to 720 nt of EGFP ORF. The probe for detection of DENV2 siRNA was complementary to the 150 to 200 nt of antigenomic RNA. For detection of small RNAs, DIG-labeled oligo RNA probes targeting EGFP siRNA, miR-92a, miR-21, and U6 were synthesized by Takara as previously described (
