<p>For gel shift assay, MBP-fusion proteins (4 to 16 μM) were incubated with a 0.05 μM DIG-labeled 200-nt dsRNA probe in a binding buffer [50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, and 1 U of ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitor (Promega)] at 27°C for 30 min; the total volume was 10 μl. After the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed via 6% native PAGE in 0.5× tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer and transferred to a Hybond-A nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). The membranes were incubated for 30 min with anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche). The RNA probe representing the 1 to 200 nt of EGFP was labeled with DIG–uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP) (Roche) for in vitro transcription.
