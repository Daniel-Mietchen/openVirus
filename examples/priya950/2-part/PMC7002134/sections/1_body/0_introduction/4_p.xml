<p>For flaviviruses, previous studies have revealed, as expected, that DENV and ZIKV can induce the production of vsiRNAs in infected

Given the fact that mosquito-borne flaviviruses are transmitted between humans and mosquitoes, and that they carry out their life cycles in both of these organisms, determining whether and how flaviviruses induce and antagonize the shared antiviral defense mechanism, RNAi, in the two distinct host species would deepen understanding of the flavivirus processes of the infection, transmission, and pathogenesis, as well as the mechanisms of antiviral RNAi in both mammals and insects.
