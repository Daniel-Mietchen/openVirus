<p>In contrast, in the differentiated mammalian cells in which viral infection and replication usually occur, vRI-dsRNAs and other viral nucleic acids mainly induce innate antiviral immune defenses, such as the interferon (IFN) system, and whether RNAi exerts any physiologically important antiviral effect in mammals has remained a long-lasting subject of debates (

Also, in differentiated mammalian cells, a mere handful of VSR-disabled mutant viruses, including human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), influenza A virus (IAV), and Nodamura virus (NoV), have been found to induce vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response during infection (
