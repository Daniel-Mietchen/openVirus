<p>Flavivirus encodes a polyprotein that is further processed into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Here, we initially examined all the DENV2 nonstructural proteins and found that the nonstructural protein NS2A suppressed Dicer-dependent siRNA production both in vitro and in the context of DENV2 infection. When the VSR activity of NS2A was disabled by reverse genetics, the resulting VSR-deficient mutant DENV2 induced abundant vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response in infected mammalian somatic cells. These vsiRNAs are Dicer-dependently produced from vRI-dsRNAs, loaded into AGO, and active to silence complementary viral RNA. Correspondingly, the VSR-deficient DENV2 suffered severe defects in replication and infection in mammalian somatic cells and mice, which were successfully rescued by the genetic ablation of key RNAi component. In infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito cells, DENV2 uses the same VSR (NS2A) to antagonize antiviral RNAi, and the replication defect caused by the VSR deficiency could be also rescued by the deficiency of RNAi. In addition, NS2As of other DENV serotypes and mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including JEV, WNV, and ZIKV, also suppressed RNAi in vitro, and JEV has been found to use NS2A to antagonize antiviral RNAi in both mosquito and human cells during JEV infection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RNAi can be triggered to exert a critical antiviral effect against flavivirus infection in both mammals and mosquitoes, while flavivirus uses NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade antiviral RNAi in both organisms.
