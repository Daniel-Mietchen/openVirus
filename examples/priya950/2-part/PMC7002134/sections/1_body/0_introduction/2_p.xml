<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism in all eukaryotes, in which small noncoding RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs), direct the silencing of gene expression by causing the destruction or translational repression of complementary target RNAs, respectively (

In the process of antiviral RNAi, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replicative intermediates (vRI-dsRNAs) produced during viral replication or dsRNAs from viral RNA secondary structures are recognized and cleaved by host endoribonuclease Dicer into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs), which are then loaded into Argonaute (AGO) proteins of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to direct the destruction of viral RNAs in infected cells (
