<p>After determining the protective role of NS2A on vRI-dsRNA terminal regions, we further examined some fundamental characteristics of these DENV2 vsiRNAs. Our data show that the production of either DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>- or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-derived vsiRNAs was mostly abolished by the knockdown of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Dicer-2 (aaDcr2-KD) but not AGO2 (aaAGO2-KD) (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 4 to 9, and fig. S5, A and B). In addition, since no anti-aaAGO2 antibody is available, we replaced endogenous aaAGO2 with a hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged dmAGO2 by ectopically expressing HA-dmAGO2 in aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells. These cells were infected with DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>, and the vsiRNAs derived from either virus were coimmunoprecipitated with dmAGO2 (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, previous studies have uncovered that the DDH motif, particularly its first aspartic acid (D597), of human AGO2 (hAGO2) is required for the slicing but not siRNA-loading activity of hAGO2. Given that this residue is also conserved in AGO proteins of other organisms, including fruit fly and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito (fig. S5C), we generated the dmAGO2 mutant by substituting the first aspartic acid of the DDH motif to alanine (dmAGO2
 <sub>D965A</sub>). Our results show that vsiRNAs could also load into dmAGO2
 <sub>D965A</sub> in either WT or mutant DENV2–infected aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, these DENV2 vsiRNAs, either derived from WT or VSR-deficient mutant, are Dicer-2–dependently produced from vRI-dsRNAs and can effectively load into AGO2 of the RISC to be functional in mosquito cells.
