<p>Next, we examined whether the VSR activity of NS2A facilitates DENV2 replication in Aag2 cells. Our data show that the viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> were significantly attenuated at 3 dpi in Aag2 cells (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Impairing RNAi by knocking down aaDicer2 or aaAGO2 or by inactivating the slicing activity of AGO2 (i.e., replacing aaAGO2 with dmAGO2
 <sub>D965A</sub>) successfully rescued the viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> to the similar levels of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito cells, DENV2 uses the same strategy, i.e., NS2A as bona fide VSR, to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection.
