<p>We sought to generate VSR-deficient mutant viruses by introducing the R94A or K135A mutation in the NS2A coding region of the infectious clone of the DENV2 strain TSV01 (fig. S2E). The wild-type (WT; DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>) and mutant (DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> and DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>) viruses were successfully recovered, and the plaque morphology was examined in baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We next determined the one-step growth curve of WT and mutant DENVs in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito Aag2 and C6/36 cells. As expected, both DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> and DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> showed weaker growth patterns than did DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> in Aag2 cells (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). While the replication of DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> and DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> had no significant difference in Aag2 cells (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), we found that the replication of DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> was markedly weaker than that of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> in C6/36 cells (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Notably, in contrast to Aag2 cells that have an intact RNAi, C6/36 cells have a dysfunctional RNAi pathway (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, it is suggested that the replication defect of DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> cannot be rescued by the RNAi incompetency in C6/36 cells, and that the R94 residue of NS2A may be involved in viral RNA replication. Given that DENV2
 <sub>R94A</sub> appears to be irresponsive to the status of RNAi in infected cells, we did not include this mutant in the subsequent studies.
