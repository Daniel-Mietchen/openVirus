<p>To identify the critical residue(s) responsible for the dsRNA-binding and/or RNAi suppression activities of DENV2 NS2A, we performed multiple sequence alignments of the positively charged residues of NS2As encoded by the four DENV serotypes, ZIKV, JEV, and WNV (fig. S2C) and then examined the single-point mutations of conserved arginine (R) or lysine (K) to alanine (A) via reversal-of-silencing assay. The mutational analysis revealed that the conserved R94 and K135 are critical for the in vitro VSR activity of NS2A (

S2B, lanes 6 to 11) and failed to inhibit hDicer-mediated in vitro production of siRNA from synthetic dsRNA (fig. S2D, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the R94 and K135 residues are critical for the in vitro VSR activity of NS2A.
