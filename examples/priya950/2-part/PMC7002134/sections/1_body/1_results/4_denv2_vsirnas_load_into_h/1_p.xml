<p>After demonstrating that VSR-deficient DENV2 induces vsiRNA production in 293T cells, we aimed to determine whether these vsiRNAs can load into the RISCs and be functional. Our results showed that the vsiRNAs in DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected normal or IFNAR1-KO 293T cells were coimmunoprecipitated with hAGO proteins by using an antiâ€“pan-AGO antibody (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 3 and 9), indicating that DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> vsiRNAs can load into hAGO in human somatic cells.
