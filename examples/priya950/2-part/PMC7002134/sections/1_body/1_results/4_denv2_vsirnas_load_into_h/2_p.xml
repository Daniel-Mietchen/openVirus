<p>Next, we sought to determine whether these vsiRNAs are able to specifically guide the degradation of cognate DENV2 genomic RNAs. To this end, we designed a plasmid that transcribes an mRNA containing 
 <italic>egfp</italic> open reading frame (ORF) followed by the sequence of 1 to 200 nt of the DENV2 genome, named “EGFP-DV
 <sub>1–200</sub>” (as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, upper). This region of DENV2 genome is complementary with numerous vsiRNAs produced in cells infected with DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> as being previously detected by deep sequencing (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, we also constructed the plasmid EGFP-DV
 <sub>400–600</sub> using the same strategy, which contains the 400 to 600 nt of the DENV2 genome but is not complementary with previously detected DENV2 vsiRNAs, as a negative control. Our results showed that the mRNA levels of EGFP-DV
 <sub>1–200</sub> were substantially reduced by infection with DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> but not DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, neither DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> nor DENV
 <sub>WT</sub> showed any silencing effect on the mRNA of EGFP or EGFP-DV
 <sub>400–600</sub> (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3 and 8 and 9), as these plasmids do not contain any vsiRNA cognate sequence. As expected, DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> failed to silence EGFP-DV
 <sub>1–200</sub> mRNA in 293T-NoDice cells (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, lane 12). Together, our data show that DENV2 vsiRNAs can effectively load into hAGO of the RISCs and guide sequence-specific silencing of cognate DENV2 RNA dependently of hDicer in human somatic cells.
