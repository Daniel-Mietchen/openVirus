<p>After determining that vsiRNA production can be triggered by infection of VSR-deficient DENV2 and be active, we examined whether RNAi exerts antiviral effect on DENV2 replication in infected human somatic cells. To this end, normal 293T and 293T-NoDice cells were infected with DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>. Our results showed that the deficiency of VSR resulted in substantial attenuation of viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> at 3 dpi in 293T cells (

 <sub>K135A</sub> but not DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (
