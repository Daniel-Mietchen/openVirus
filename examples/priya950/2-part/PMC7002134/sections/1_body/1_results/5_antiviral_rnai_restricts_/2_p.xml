<p>If RNAi exerts antiviral effect, then the rescue of VSR-deficient viruses should be observed in cells with the deficiency of RNAi. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (C and D)</xref> and fig. S4 (A and B), the replication defect of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> was rescued by the deficiency of hDicer, corresponding to the abolishment of vsiRNA production in 293T-NoDice cells (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Besides, loss of hDicer cannot increase the viral RNA replication of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>), implying that RNAi is fully suppressed during DENV infection in differentiated mammalian cells. Moreover, in the absence of IFNAR1 (IFNAR1-KO), the deficiency of hDicer could further enhance DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> replication (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>), further confirming that RNAi exerts antiviral effect irrespectively of IFN-I.
