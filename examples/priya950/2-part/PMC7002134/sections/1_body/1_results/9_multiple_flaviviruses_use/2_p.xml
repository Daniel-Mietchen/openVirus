<p>It would be intriguing to investigate whether these flaviviruses also use NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection. On the basis of the sequence alignment of flaviviral NS2As, the K135 of DENV2 NS2A corresponds to the R140 of JEV NS2A (fig. S2C), both of which are positively charged. Thus, we introduced the R140A mutation in the NS2A coding region of the infectious clone of the JEV strain SA-E70 (fig. S8A) and recovered the WT (JEV
 <sub>WT</sub>) and mutant (JEV
 <sub>R140A</sub>) viruses. The plaque morphology was examined in BHK-21 cells (fig. S8B). We further infected mosquito Aag2 or C6/36 cells and human 293T or 293T-NoDice cells with JEV
 <sub>WT</sub> or JEV
 <sub>R140A</sub> and examined viral replication. Consistent with the data obtained using WT and VSR-deficient DENV2 (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), JEV
 <sub>R140A</sub> exhibited a replication defect in the RNAi-competent Aag2 or 293T cells when being compared to JEV
 <sub>WT</sub> (fig. S8, C and E). On the other hand, impairing RNAi rescued the replication defect of JEV
 <sub>R140A</sub> in both mosquito and mammalian somatic cells, as the replication of JEV
 <sub>WT</sub> and JEV
 <sub>R140A</sub> in RNAi-incompetent C6/36 or 293T-NoDice cells showed no significant difference (fig. S8, D and F). These data imply that RNAi can exert antiviral effect against JEV infection in both mammalian and mosquito cells, and JEV NS2A also works as a bona fide VSR to antagonize antiviral RNAi during JEV infection of either host cells.
