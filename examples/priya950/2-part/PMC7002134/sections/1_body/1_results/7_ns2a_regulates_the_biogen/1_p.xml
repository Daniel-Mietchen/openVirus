<p>After determining that RNAi exerts the antiviral effect and NS2A works as a bona fide VSR in the context of DENV infection in differentiated mammalian cells, we sought to examine whether DENV2 uses the same mechanism to evade antiviral RNAi in infected mosquito cells. Our previous data showed that DENV2 NS2A does have in vitro VSR activity in insect cells (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, we infected mosquito Aag2 cells with DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> (MOI = 10). Total RNAs were extracted at 3 dpi and then subjected to deep sequencing. Since antiviral RNAi is predominant in insects, it was not surprising to find a dominant pattern of vsiRNAs, i.e., 21-nt vsRNA reads with an almost equal ratio of positive and negative strands, in DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-infected Aag2 cells (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and table S1). These vsiRNA pairs were distributed along the entire DENV2 genome (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data show that like insect viruses, DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> can induce the production of abundant vsiRNA in mosquito cells even in the presence of VSR.
