<p>Moreover, vsiRNAs from DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>- or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected Aag2 cells were detected via Northern blotting with the probe complementary to 3′-end 150 to 200 nt of DENV2 antigenome (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Consistent with the sequencing data, the detected level of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-vsiRNAs was higher than that of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-derived siRNAs (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), because more vsiRNAs were located at the 5′ termini of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> genome than that of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E to H</xref>). Together, our data indicate that NS2A plays a protective role on the terminal regions of vRI-dsRNAs from Dicer-2 cleavage in DENV2-infected Aag2 cells.
