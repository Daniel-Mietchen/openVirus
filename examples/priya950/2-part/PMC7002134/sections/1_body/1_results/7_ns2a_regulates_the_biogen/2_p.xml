<p>In the context of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> infection, vsRNA reads were also presented as a dominant 21-nt size and divided approximately equally into positive and negative strands (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and table S1), while vsRNA reads in DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected cells were less abundant than those in DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-infected cells (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) likely because of the reduced viral RNA replication of the mutant virus. The analysis of the genomic origin of the vsiRNAs (21-nt size) showed that DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-derived vsiRNAs were more concentrated at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the DENV2 genome than did DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-derived vsiRNAs (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D to F</xref>), consistent with our sequencing data in the DENV2-infected mammalian cells (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A close-up view of vsiRNA presented in 1 to 200 nt of DENV2 genome also confirmed that DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-derived vsiRNAs were more enriched at the 5′ termini of the genome (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, G and H</xref>).
