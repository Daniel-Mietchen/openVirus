<p>Moreover, we assessed the effect of VSR deficiency on viral replication in vivo by infecting littermates of 
 <italic>Ifnargr</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (AG6) that lack IFN-I/II receptors with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of WT or VSR-deficient mutant of DENV2 via intracerebral injection. The mortalities of the infected mice were monitored for 15 days. Our data show that DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> infection resulted in 60% mortality of the infected mice within 10 days, whereas DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected mice all survived at 15 dpi (

In addition, mouse brains derived from AG6 mice infected with WT or mutant virus at 3 and 6 dpi were extracted and the viral RNA accumulations were determined, showing that the replication of VSR-deficient DENV2 was substantially restricted compared to that of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub> (
