<p>Consistent with our observations in human 293T cells (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the knockdown of murine Dicer (mDicer-KD) rescued the viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> in either WT or

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> MLFs (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). These data further confirm the rescuing effect of the loss of Dicer on VSR-deficient DENV2 and indicate that it is not attributed to IFN-I. In addition, the production of vsiRNAs was dependent on the presence of mDicer in both WT and

  <sup>−/−</sup>
