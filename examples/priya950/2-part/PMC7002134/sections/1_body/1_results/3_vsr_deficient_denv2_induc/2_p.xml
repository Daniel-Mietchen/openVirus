<p>On the other hand, when the VSR activity of NS2A was disabled by reverse genetics, the positive-strand bias of DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-specific vsRNA reads was substantially reduced and the proportion of negative-stranded vsRNAs in 22 ± 1–nt size was significantly improved, which shows the apparent peak of vsRNAs in 22 ± 1–nt size of both polarities in infected 293T cells (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and table S1). Of note, DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-specific vsRNA reads became less abundant than those of DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>, likely because of the greatly attenuated replication of the mutant virus. The DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-vsRNAs were enriched for a population of 22-nt vsRNAs that contain a 20-nt perfectly base-paired duplex with 2-nt 3′ overhangs (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, peak “−2”), which were not observed in the DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-vsRNAs (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), showing that a significant proportion of vsRNAs with the canonical siRNA properties were produced in DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected 293T cells. DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-infected hDicer-deficient (NoDice) 293T cells failed to produce vsiRNAs (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and F</xref>), demonstrating that the vsiRNAs production in 293T cells is Dicer dependent.
