<p>Further bioinformatic analyses revealed that DENV
 <sub>WT</sub>-vsRNA reads (22 ± 1–nt size) were mainly positive stranded and distributed along the entire DENV2 genome (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), whereas DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-vsRNA reads (22 ± 1–nt size) were highly enriched at the terminal regions of the DENV2 genome (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), which formed successive or phased complementary pairs of vsiRNAs (fig. S3A). A close-up view of vsiRNA presented in 1 to 200 nt of DENV2 genome also confirmed that DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-derived vsiRNAs were more enriched at the 5′-terminal of the genome (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). We speculated that without the protection of VSR, DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-vsiRNAs would be produced from viral genomic terminal regions where the RNA replication is initiated, consistent with the previous observations in cells infected with other WT and VSR-deficient RNA viruses like FHV, NoV, IAV, and EV-A71 (
