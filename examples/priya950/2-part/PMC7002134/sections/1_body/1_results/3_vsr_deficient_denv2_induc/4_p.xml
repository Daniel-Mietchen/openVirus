<p>The type I IFN (IFN-I) system is the major antiviral mechanism in mammal, and therefore, it would be intriguing to examine whether the IFN-I system has any impact on the production of vsiRNAs by using VSR-deficient DENV2. To this end, we infected IFN-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1)–knockout (IFNAR1-KO) 293T cells with DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>. Similar with that in normal 293T cells, the infection of 293T-IFNAR1-KO cells with DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> triggered the production of abundant vsiRNAs (fig. S3B and table S1), which were also highly enriched at viral genomic terminal regions (fig. S3, C and D, peak “−2”). These results show that RNAi exerts antiviral effect irrespectively of IFN-I in human somatic cells.
