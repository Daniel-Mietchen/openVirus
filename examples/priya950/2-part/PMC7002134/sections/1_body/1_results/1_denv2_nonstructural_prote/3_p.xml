<p>A key step of RNAi is the biogenesis of siRNAs from the cleavage of exogenous or endogenous dsRNAs by mammalian Dicer or insect Dicer-2 (

 </xref>). Thus, we examined whether NS2A would affect the siRNA production from dsRNA via small RNA Northern blotting. Our data show that DENV2 NS2A inhibited the production of siRNAs from transfected dsRNAs in S2 cells (fig. S1E, lane 4). Moreover, we further examined whether NS2A binds to long dsRNA. To this end, gel shift assays were performed by incubating 0.05 μM synthetic 200-nt digoxigenin (DIG)–labeled dsRNA with increasing concentrations of recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)–fusion NS2A (fig. S2A). Our data show that NS2A has the in vitro dsRNA-binding activity (fig. S2B, lanes 3 to 5).
