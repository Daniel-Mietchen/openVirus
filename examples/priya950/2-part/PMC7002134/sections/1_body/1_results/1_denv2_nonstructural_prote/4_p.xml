<p>To further determine the direct role of DENV2 NS2A to protect dsRNA from Dicer-mediated cleavage, we used a classic in vitro Dicer cleavage assay, in which purified synthetic dsRNA was incubated with recombinant human Dicer (hDicer) and MBP-fusion NS2A. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, while dsRNA was efficiently processed into siRNAs by hDicer (lanes 2 and 3), the presence of MBP-NS2A effectively protected dsRNA from Dicer cleavage dose dependently (lanes 5 to 8). Together, we conclude that DENV NS2A suppresses RNAi by sequestrating dsRNA from Dicer cleavage in vitro.
