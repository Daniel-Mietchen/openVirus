<p>Previous studies by us and others have implied that antiviral RNAi response and vsiRNA production would become obvious in differentiated mammalian cells infected with viruses whose VSRs are disabled by reverse genetics (

 </xref>–

 </xref>). Therefore, to examine whether flavivirus has the ability to induce antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian somatic cells, we first sought to determine whether any flaviviral protein can work as a potential VSR. To this end, we examined all DENV2 nonstructural proteins via a classic reversal-of-silencing assay. In this assay, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–specific dsRNA was transfected into EGFP-expressing 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, together with expression vectors for individual DENV2 nonstructural proteins, and the levels of EGFP mRNA and protein were determined via Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1 (A to C), the ectopic expression of DENV2 NS2A effectively restored the expression of EGFP mRNA and protein, indicating that NS2A is a potential VSR in insect cells. Of note, the ectopic expression of Flock House virus (FHV) B2 protein (named FB2), a well-established VSR, and the knockdown of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Dicer-2 (dmDcr2-KD) or AGO2 (dmAGO2-KD) were used as positive controls, which, as predicted, inhibited the dsRNA-induced RNAi (
