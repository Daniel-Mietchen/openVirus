<p>Spread of awareness of dengue infection among health care workers and public has paved the way of increased serological tests leading to higher rate of detection of dengue cases over the past few years (

The endemicity of dengue is spreading and has witnessed a 30-fold increase with rapid expansion to more than 100 countries in Africa, America, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Western Pacific areas from urban to rural settings and worst affected regions are South-East Asia and Western pacific regions (
