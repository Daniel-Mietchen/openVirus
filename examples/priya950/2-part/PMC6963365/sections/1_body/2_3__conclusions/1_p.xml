<p>ARIs are extremely common in children, especially those under 5 years old. They can lead to complications, super-infection, respiratory failure, and even compromised respiratory function in adulthood. For some of the responsible pathogens, vaccines are available. This review focuses on the most recent data about vaccines against respiratory pathogens. The use of influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis and measles vaccines is essential to reduce ARIs burden. Vaccination coverage rates must be improved to achieve the full benefits of these vaccines. Recently, advances in the knowledge of RSV virus biology and immunology as well as the development of new techniques to generate vaccine candidates are finally increasing the number of promising vaccines against even this harmful pathogen.</p>
