<p>In conclusion, prevention of pertussis with currently available vaccines reaching high vaccination coverage rates remains a priority, including the vaccination of pregnant women [
 <xref rid="B83-vaccines-07-00168" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Several different aP vaccines are available, but it has yet to be determined which of them confers the highest and the most-prolonged protection. Further studies are needed to evaluate the importance of individual antigens included in aP vaccines in conferring protection against disease, colonization, and transmission. However, present knowledge seems to indicate that pertussis toxin, particularly if genetically detoxified, represents the main antigen that ensures protection from disease even if not from infection. The optimal pertussis vaccine would be one that induces both mucosal and systemic responses similar to those occurring under natural infection, leading to long-term protection against both disease and infection. Such a vaccine might increase public confidence and result in better vaccine uptake.
