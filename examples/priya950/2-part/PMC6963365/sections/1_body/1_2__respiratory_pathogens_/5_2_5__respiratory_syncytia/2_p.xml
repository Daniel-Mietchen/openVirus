<p>Despite a consensus on the need for an RSV vaccine, there is no licensed product available yet, mainly due to the early age of infection, the capacity of RSV to evade innate immunity, and the failure of RSV-induced adaptive immunity to prevent re-infection [

Owing to the substantial burden of RSV disease worldwide, RSV vaccine continues to be a necessity for most infants, children and also the elderly. The ideal vaccine should produce long-lasting immunity characterized by a robust Th1-mediated response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies; furthermore, it should protect against both RSV-A and RSV-B, in the presence of maternal antibodies as well, and avoid vaccine-enhanced disease.
