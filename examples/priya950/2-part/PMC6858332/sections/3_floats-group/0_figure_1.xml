  <p>Temperature Dependency of the Dengue cases and Schematic representation of the Human-Vectors interactions in the epidemiological model. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Weekly observed dengue cases and average temperature in Singapore from January 2013 to December 2014. Two outbreaks took place during those two years during the summer. It is possible to observe a correlation between temperature and number of reported cases of people affected by the disease. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Compartmental classification for DENGUE disease. Humans can occupy one the four top compartments: susceptible, which can acquire the infection through contacts (bites) with infectious mosquitoes; exposed, where individuals are infected but are not able yet to transmit the virus; infectious, where individuals are infected and can transmit the disease to susceptible mosquitoes; and recovered or removed, where individuals are no longer infectious. The density of mosquitoes changes according to the seasonal transition from Aquatic (A) to Adult Mosquitoes (V). Similar to the humans case, Mosquitoes can occupy three different compartments and they can die with a given rate depending on the temperature.
