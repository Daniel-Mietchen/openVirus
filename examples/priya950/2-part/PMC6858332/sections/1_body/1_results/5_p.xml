<p id="Par11">We start our simulations with initial conditions for infected human agents based on the observed number and distribution of cases in January 2013, while we obtain the initial mosquito populations by running the population dynamic model for an initial warm-up period as described in the Materials and Methods section. To account for the stochastic nature of the simulation, for each parameter value, we ran the simulation 100 times and report the median and average values in the following.</p>
