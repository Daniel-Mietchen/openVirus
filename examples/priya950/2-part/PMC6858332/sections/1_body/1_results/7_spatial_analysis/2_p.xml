 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. We can observe that the mobile phone mobility model and the radiation model perform in a similar way, consistently well approximating the observed spatial distribution during the time period of our study. The Levy-distribution model is performing slightly worse, while the random mobility model gives significantly worse results. Looking at the results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we find that the overall distribution of the infected cases for the random mobility model corresponds well to the average population density (i.e. average of work and home locations in each cell). This means that our random mobility model achieves a good mixing among the population. The difference from the real distribution of dengue cases and the other mobility models highlights that uniform mixing among the population does not account for a spread of dengue in Singapore, thus mobility patterns are an important factor. While previous large-scale epidemiological studies often treat cities as well-mixed nodes in a larger travel network

 </sup>. It is unclear yet, how the intra-city and inter-city epidemiological models are best reconcilied; we note that frequent travelers are often a non-uniform sample of the total population of any city, thus local and long-range spread of infectious diseases can have complex intervowen patterns. The further difference between the Levy and radiation mobility model is consistent with previous work which found the radiation model to best reproduce the statistical properties of human commuting

 </sup>. Furthermore, the good results obtained from the mobile phone data show that the home-work commuting estimated from this dataset indeed accounts for the most important factors in human mobility in Singapore.
