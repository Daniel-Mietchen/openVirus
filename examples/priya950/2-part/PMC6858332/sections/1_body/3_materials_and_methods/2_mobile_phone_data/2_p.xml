<p id="Par20">To show that the cellphone dataset is representative of Singapore it is possible to compare the distribution of the home locations identified by our clustering procedure with official census data from 2010
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> (See Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref> in SI). Singapore is divided into 55 urban planning areas
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup> and we compare the number of home locations identified in each of them with the 2010 census data
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. With a correlation coefficient of 0.96, the two spatial distributions are highly linearly correlated as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref> in the supplementary materials. Furthermore, we note that penetration of mobile phones (number of active mobile phone subscriptions compared to the total population) in Singapore was above 140% at the time of our study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>, one of the highest rates in the world. This way, we expect that almost all of the population has a mobile phone and many people have more than subscription. As the flight range of mosquitoes is limited to a few hundred meters
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, it is generally assumed that humans carry the dengue virus to previously dengue-free areas and infect local mosquitoes. For this reason in our model mosquitoes don’t travel among different cells. Therefore, in the computational implementation each day is represented by two steps: daytime, during which population stay at work, and nightime during which poluation stay at home.
