<p id="Par23">We collected data about climate conditions in Singapore during years 2013 and 2014, during which two outbreaks during the respective summers took place. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref> we show the number of dengue cases during the epidemiological weeks in 2013 and 2014 comparing it with the average temperature. The impact of daily temperature fluctuations on dengue virus transmission by the

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes have been extensively studied and the results indicate that the weekly mean temperature is statistically significant relative to the increases in dengue incidence in Singapore and signifies the hazardous impacts of climatic factors on the increase in intensity and magnitude of dengue cases
