 </sup>. In the 2013 dengue outbreak in Singapore, a significant rise in the number of dengue fever cases was reported in Singapore and caused 8 victims and a total of 22318 cases. In the week of 16–22 June 2013, there was a record of 842 dengue cases in Singapore in a single week. This figure was far beyond the highest number of cases per week in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The number of weekly dengue fever cases has exceeded the epidemic threshold of 237. Similarly high number of cases were reported over the course of 2014, with the maximum number of weekly reported cases having a peak of 891. In the following years, the number of dengue cases were significantly lower due to increased efforts to control the mosquito population. We show the total number of dengue cases during 2013 and 2014 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>. For the spatial analysis of Dengue outbreaks, we use a dataset that is a collection of data from the NEA. Data was collected twice a week since May 2013 (except for a gap in October 2013) from SGCharts Charting Singapore’s Data

 </sup>. The data provide information of the number of dengue cases in local spatial clusters that were established dynamically based on the location of recent cases. Spatial clusters are typically a few hundred meters in size, encompassing multiple city blocks. This allows us to have a good representation of the spatial spread of dengue, while still protecting to privacy of people affected. We display the cumulative spatial distribution of dengue cases in 5(a).
