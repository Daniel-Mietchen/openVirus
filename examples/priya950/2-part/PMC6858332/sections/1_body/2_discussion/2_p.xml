<p id="Par16">We modelled four different mobility patterns: 1) mobility estimated from mobile phone data, 2) random mobility patterns, 3) mobility estimated from census data following a Levy distribution model and 4) mobility estimated from census data following a radiation model. We were able to reproduce the main temporal and spatial patterns of the dengue outbreak in 2013 and 2014. Our results show that human mobility is a very important factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue even on the short scale corresponding to intra-city distances. This is evidenced by the large difference found between the observed spatial pattern of dengue cases and the ones obtained by the completely random mobility model which corresponds to a “perfect mixing” among the population. This extends the results obtained from the previous work of Wesolowski

 </sup>. We believe that our main contribution is showing that human mobility patterns are important for the spread of vector-borne diseases even on intra-city scales; this is in contrast to previous studies which often assume cities to be a well-mixed environment for the purpose of epidemiology and study disease spreading between cities and regions

 </sup>. It is an interesting question for future work to what extent this result applies to other types of diseases, e.g. airborne infections that require only shorter co-location of people to spread, thus are able to exploit mixing of population in a more rapid way.
