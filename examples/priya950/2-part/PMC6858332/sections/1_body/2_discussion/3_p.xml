<p id="Par17">Furthermore, we found that more sophisticated models of intra-city mobility can give good estimates of the spatial spread of dengue, opening up the possiblity to incorporate these into modeling and control of vector diseases in urban environments. The proposed methods could be integrated into urban planning in near real time. Mobile phone data is an obvious candidate for this purpose, giving real-time information on people’s movements. A major limitation of mobile phone data generated by national operators is the difficulty in capturing cross-border travel patterns and it is not possible to monitor with high accuracy the flux of people travelling to the city. On the other hand, we found that the radiation model of people’s commuting behavior performs similarly well, opening up the possibility to improve prediction of disease spread if accurate census data is available. Thus, we believe our methods can be readily used in other cities where these mobility models can be estimated, while accuracy will be affected by overall predictability of human movements and regularity of commuting patterns

 </sup>. Concluding, we note that the methods we presented here can be readily generalized to consider different mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, malaria, yellow fever and different sources and models of human mobility, having a large potential usability for better understanding, control and prevention of vector disease epidemics in urbanized areas.
