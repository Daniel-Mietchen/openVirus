 </sup>. The rapid urbanization, the increase in international travel and trade, the modification of agriculture and environmental changes have increased the spread of vector populations, putting more and more people at risk. Mobile phone data can give real-time mobility information that can be combined with infectious disease surveillance data and seasonally varying environmental data to map these changing patterns of vulnerability in cities that are changing everyday. In this paper we proposed an agent based model in order to explicitly simulate the epidemic spread of the disease as governed by the transmission dynamics of the dengue virus through human-mosquito interactions and promoted by the population movements across the city state of Singapore. In this methodology humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents and humans go through the epidemic states of dengue.
