 </sup>. Estimates show that more than half of the world’s population already lives in cities, while further big increases are expected especially in Asia and Africa. Challenges presented by new megacities include the rapid spread of new epidemics, which can become worldwide threats due to increased global connectivity

In this paper we explore the effectiveness of pervasive technologies, specifically mobile phone data, in predicting and understating the emergence of mosquito borne disease outbreaks in urban environments. Cell phone data has been shown to be valuable in monitoring mobility patterns in near real-time
