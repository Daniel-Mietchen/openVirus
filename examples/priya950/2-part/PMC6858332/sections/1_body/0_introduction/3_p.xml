<p id="Par4">Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection, transmitted by female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus when biting humans. The infection causes flu-like symptoms with occasional complications that can be fatal. There are four strains of the virus and the infection with one strain produces lifelong immunity to that type. However, a second infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. Dengue continues to be a global threat, with about half the world’s population being at risk of infection

 </sup>. Worldwide, there are more than 50 million infections every year, leading to half a million hospitalizations and up to 25 thousands deaths. Dengue is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The prevention and control solely depends on controlling the mosquito populations. There is active development for vaccines, with a first-generation vaccine becoming available recently
