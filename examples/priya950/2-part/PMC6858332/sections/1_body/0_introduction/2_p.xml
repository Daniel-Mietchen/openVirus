 </sup>, we now employ a large-scale dataset of human mobility to study the connection between intra-city mobility and dengue spread. We focus on comparing a dengue transmission model based on people’s real commuting patterns (as inferred from the mobile phone dataset) with the observed dengue cases and with simulations employing random mobility models. This allows us to measure the impact of mobility model on the accuracy of modeling the spatial distribution of dengue cases. We especially focus on comparing random mobility that results in perfect mixing of population with more structured mobility models, effectively evaluating the importance of intra-city human mobility in dengue spread.
