<p id="Par5">The modeling of dengue outbreaks has attracted the interest of many researchers in many disciplines from physics to computational biology. Presented models investigate, for example, the variability of the mosquito population

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>

 <sup>

 </sup> presented a dengue model, which takes into account the evolution of the mosquito population. Another study shows that dengue appears to travel in waves
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. As the flight range of mosquitoes is limited to a few hundred meters
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, it is generally assumed that humans carry the dengue virus to previously dengue-free areas and infect local mosquitoes. There is evidence that the spread of mosquito-borne diseases is related to human mobility
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Various agent-based simulations suggest that the mobility of humans could be the main driving force behind the spread of the dengue virus

 </sup> showed that the human mobility, estimated from the road network, influences the spread at a national scale in Cambodia. Especially house-to-house human movements seem to play a key role in Iquitos, Peru
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Related malaria studies show that human mobility, which is estimated from cell-phone networks, drives the dissemination of malaria parasites as well
