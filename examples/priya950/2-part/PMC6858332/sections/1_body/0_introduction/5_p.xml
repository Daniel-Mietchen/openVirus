 </sup>. While these work generally assume that intra-city mobility is an important factor for dengue epidemics, a direct quantification of this effect is still lacking. For the first time, we analyze the effectiveness of mobile phone useage data to predict the dengue spreading in an urban environment, such as Singapore. In doing so, we compare random mobility patterns with the real one estimated from anonymized mobile phone usage records in an agent-based model of dengue transmission adapted from previous studies

 </sup>. This way, we are able to characterize the effect of human mobility on urban scales in the spread of vector-borne diseases and the effectiveness to use mobile phone data to estimate disease epidemics on this scale as well.
