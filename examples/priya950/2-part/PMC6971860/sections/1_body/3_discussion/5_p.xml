<p id="Par34">Comparison of genetic mutation characteristics among DENV1 viruses in Vietnam in 2017 with those of DENV1 causing the disease in Vietnam in 2005 and 2008 as well as DENV1 strains in Thailand in 2010, Myanmar in 2002, Cambodia in 2008, Brunei in 2006, China in 2017 and Brazil in 2010 showed differences in many amino acid positions in all genes, especially with the DENV1 strain causing outbreak in 2005 in Vietnam, suggesting that DENV1 in Vietnam 2017 did not share the same ancestor as the DENV1 from 2005, although they both caused outbreaks in the same geographic area. Thus, it can be seen that in the same geographical area there exist many different forms of DENV, the emergence of new DENV forms in a geographical area may be due to the spread from other geographic areas due to globalization.</p>
