<p id="Par37">Previous studies on the phylogenetic tree construction of DENV often used the nucleotide sequence of E gene. In this study, through successful sequencing of the complete genome of 72 DENV1 viruses, so the phylogenetic tree was established using the entire genome sequence. The analysis showed that all 72 DENV1 viruses that circulated in Vietnam 2017 were likely derived from the DENV-1 strain that caused outbreaks in Vietnam 2007 to 2008 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This suggested that the DENV1 was responsible for the outbreak of dengue in Vietnam in 2017 and originated from the DENV that was previously distributed in Vietnam. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between these DENV1 strains and two other DENV type 1 strains from Cambodia (2006 and 2008). These findings confirmed the origin and circulation of DENV in Vietnam. There exists no report of any intrusion of DENV from other geographical areas. However, several studies in China, Brunei, and Singapore have shown DENV1 to be imported from distant geographic areas, such as Brazil, the USA and Columbia.
