<p id="Par36">Boxplot and heatmap mapping provides a clear picture of the genetic relationship of 72 viruses with strains in Vietnam and in the world. The analytical results suggested that the DENV1 circulating in the 2017 dengue epidemic very similar to the 2007â€“2008 dengue outbreaks in Vietnam, with a close relationship to strains from Cambodia. Surprisingly, the DENV1 sequenced from other countries in the same geographical areas, such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Brunei, Singapore, and Indonesia, revealed a close genetic relationship with strains from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and the USA and exhibited large genetic differences with strains in Vietnam. These findings suggest an introduction of genetic transfer or the spread of DENV from one geographic region to another. This, in turn, could result in the mixing of genetic resources of different origins in order to create new variant strains.</p>
