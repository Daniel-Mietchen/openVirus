<p id="Par31">Other studies on the epidemiology of DENV causing outbreaks in Vietnam have been recorded as iendemic strains, but there were still a number of outbreaks that were caused by strains from some other geographical areas. Therefore, studying the genome characteristics of DENV strains will help to trace the origins of the virus strain in 2017 as well as provide more effective prevention. In this study, we selected 72 DENV-1 viruses with the highest viral load to conduct genome sequencing using NGS Illumina MiSeq system. The sequencing results showed that all 72 DENV-1 were successfully sequenced with high reliability, in which all gene segments were repeated from 1000x to 10,000x, the average reads were 5000x, this is a very high level of repetition for the sequencing of a viral RNA genome by the MiSeq system. The advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is that the nucleotide sequence is read repeatedly, thus allowing the detection of minor mutations that occur in the viral genome.</p>
