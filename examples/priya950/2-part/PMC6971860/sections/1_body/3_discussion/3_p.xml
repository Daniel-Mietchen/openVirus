<p id="Par32">Genome analysis of 72 DENV-1 viruses showed that there were various amino acid alterations in all structural and non-structural genes. The proportion of viruses with amino acid changes is scarce, ranging from 1 to 6 viruses, which focused only on certain positions on the genes. However, it was recognized that there are major strains of DENV1 carrying amino acid mutations in several positions, such as in the E gene with positions 54D/N, 226â€‰T/A, 347I/M/V, 463A/V. The amino acid alterations in the envelope protein help the virus enhance neutrovirulence during pathogenesis. In addition, several positions with amino acid variants were observed in the NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5 genes. These changes may be related to the DENV virulence, but further studies are needed to clarify the influence of the amino acid substitution of DENV and dengue hemorrhagic fever severe.</p>
