<p id="Par17">A total of 300 adult patients presenting at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi with clinical symptoms of dengue (fever, fatigue, and muscle and joint aches) within three days of symptom onset, and a positive NS-1 test were included in the study between June and August 2017. Patients were tested for NS1 antigen using a rapid test kit from Cortez (USA). Blood samples (2–3 mL) of patients with acute dengue fever were collected and centrifuged. The plasma was separated and stored at − 80 °C. All patients signed written informed consent forms to participate in the study. This study was reviewed and approved by ethical board of the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases.</p>
