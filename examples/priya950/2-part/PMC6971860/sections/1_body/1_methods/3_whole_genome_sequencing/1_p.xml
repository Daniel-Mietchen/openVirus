<p id="Par20">Qiagen kits (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit; Qiagen Sciences Germantown, MD, USA) were used for extracting viral RNA from DENV-1 strains (large scale) as described above. The RNA was used as a template to synthesize cDNA (using ProtoScript® II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit – New England BioLabs, MA, USA), followed by DNA replication using two primer pools (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). PCR products were visualized using gel electrophoresis; their concentrations were measured and standardized. The PCR products were cleaved into short DNA fragments, followed by insertion of Index1 and Index2 in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The purification step discarded the excess products. The sample was standardized and quantified to prepare the library. After completing the library preparation, the samples were placed into the Illumina MiSeq machine to read the sequences. The results were then processed to remove the links and poor quality reads from the raw data to obtain the best sequences. The completed sequence of DENV type 1 was then assembled from the reads using the CLC software. We used a DENV-1 sequence from 1997 (GenBank accession number NC_001477.1) as the reference sequence. The coverage of each nucleotide position on the gene sequence was calculated using the SAM tools.
