<p id="Par19">The Real-time OneStep Multiplex RT-PCR amplification was performed in a 25-μL reaction volume using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum™ 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Invitrogen; CA, USA). A PCR mix of two reactions was prepared in a 0.2-mL, thin-walled tube; reaction 1 contained 25 μL 2× reaction mix, 1 μL enzyme, 20 pmol of dengue type 2 primers (DENV2-F, DENV2-R), 20 pmol of dengue primers type 4 (DENV4-F, DENV4-R), 10 pmol dengue 2 probe (DENV2-Probe), 10 pmol dengue 4 probe (DENV4-Probe), and 10 ng template ARN. The final volume was made up to 50 μL with distilled water. The reaction 2 contained 25 μL 2× reaction mix, 1 μL enzyme, 20 pmol of DENV-1 primers (DENV1-F, DENV1-R), 20 pmol dengue type 3 primers (DENV3-F, DENV3-R), 10 pmol of dengue 1 probe (DENV1-Probe), 10 pmol of dengue 3 probe (DENV3-Probe), and 10 ng template ARN. The final volume was made up to 50 μL with distilled water. The primer sequences were listed in Table

 <sup>8</sup> copies/ml) were added. The PCR was performed using the LightCycler 480 (Roche) at 50 °C for 30 min (cDNA synthesis). The application parameters included 1 cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min and 45 cycles of initial heat activation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, followed by reading the fluorescence. The DENV serotypes were determined by specific fluorescence and viral load were calculated via threshold cycle values (Ct).
