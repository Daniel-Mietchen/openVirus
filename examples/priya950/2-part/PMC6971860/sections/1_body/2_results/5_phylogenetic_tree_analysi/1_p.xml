<p id="Par29">We next analyzed the genetic relationship between 72 DENV-1 viruses from NS-1 positive dengue patients in Vietnam in 2017 with viruses circulating in Vietnam in previous years and several strains from in other regions of the world. The phylogenetic tree was analyzed and built based on the sequence of the entire viral genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in which 72 DENV1 were denoted by 1–72, and reference DENV1 were denoted by 73–119. The analysis results showed that the strains in Vietnam in 2017 had the highest genetic similarity to the strains in Vietnam in 2007 and 2008. In addition, the genetic relationship from phylogenetic tree indicated that these strains belonged to the group of DENV-1 from Vietnam (2007 and 2008), Cambodia (2001, 2006, and 2008), Thailand (2001 and 2010), Myanmar (2002), Malaysia (2005) and were not clustered into the same group with pathogens from USA, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, and Columbia. Although in the same geographical area, the analysis also revealed that the DENV-1 viruses of this study had a significant difference as compared with the DENV1 strains in Singapore (2013), Myanmar (1976), Malaysia (1972), China (2006), Indonesia (1998), and Brunei (2006).
