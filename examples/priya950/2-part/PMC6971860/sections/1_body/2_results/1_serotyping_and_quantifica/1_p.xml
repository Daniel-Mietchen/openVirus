<p id="Par24">The Real-time RT-PCR results from 300 NS-1 positive dengue patients showed 276 samples to be positive for DENV–1, 22 samples for DENV–2, one sample for DENV–3, and one sample for DENV–4, there were no co-infections detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Viral load quantification revealed that out of a total of 276 DENV–1 samples, only four showed a viral load ≤10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mL, whereas the remaining samples exhibited a load &gt; 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mL. All 22 DENV–2 samples and two samples of DENV–3 and DENV–4 showed a viral load &gt; 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We selected 72 type 1 dengue samples with the highest viral load to conduct whole-genome sequencing.
