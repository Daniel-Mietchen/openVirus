<p id="Par28">Heatmap is a graph that displays information in the form of a matrix, revealing the distance between the two row variables (72 strains of DENV-1) and column (47 dengue reference strains), from cold color to hot color, indicating the gradual increase in the distance value between DENV-1 samples and the dengue reference (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The results of the analysis showed a clear separation into two groups that were being referred to different distance between 2017 DENV1 genomes and reference genomes. Which is geographically reasonable; group 1 of all green means the distance between the samples and reference is small, resulting in a high sequence similarity between the genomes, whereas the orange and red groups showed the inverse result. The DENV1 patterns (denoted D1) revealed a lower similarity to the DENV1 strains from Japan and Myanmar (yellow). Moreover, there seemed to be a significant difference with the strains from Brunei, Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Singapore (orange-red) although these countries are in Southeast Asia. The sequence of D1 samples were also exhibited distinct difference with the strain from American such as Brazil, Colombia, Mexico (red). However, the sequence of D1 samples almost coincided with the pathogen DENV1 that circulated in Vietnam during the 2007â€“2008 dengue outbreaks (dark blue).
