<p id="Par11">Genome sequence of DENV-1 are classified into 5 genotypes, including I, II, II, IV and V [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies have indicated anassociation between specific genotypes and the proportion of cases with more severe disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, DENV is classified as being of low, medium and high epidemiological impact. In which, several DENV may be retained in sylvatic cycles with little transmissibility to humans, other DENVs cause dengue fever only [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In contrast, many genotypes of DENV may be associated with the potential to also cause the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
