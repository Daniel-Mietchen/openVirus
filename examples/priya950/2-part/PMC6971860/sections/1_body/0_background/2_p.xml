<p id="Par10">There are four dengue viruses, denoted as DENV–1, DENV–2, DENV–3, and DENV–4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The genome structure of DENV has positive sense RNA genome of 10.6 to 11.0 kb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The genome encodes for a single open reading frame (~ 3400 codons) and is flanked by 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR (untranslated region) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The genome encodes for three structural proteins, namely C protein, M protein, and E protein, and seven non-structural proteins, namely NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are four commonly circulating dengue viruses in the world, which share a similarity of 65 to 70% of amino acid sequences [
