  <p>Antiviral IFN stimulation and the effect on energy and lipid metabolism. Counteracting viral infections, which seize the cell energy and lipid metabolism for viral production but enhance fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol synthesis, effective IFN response leads to an antiviral state through an IFN autocrine or paracrine regulatory loop. The induction of antiviral state is accompanied by a general arrest of protein and lipid metabolism. The IFN suppression of lipid metabolism is multifaceted such as directly repressing the synthesis of FA and cholesterol, and regulating via the upstream regulators of AMPK and mTOR complex. In addition, IFNs have been also implicated in the regulation of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and cholesterol transport to facilitate cell antiviral response. Taking together, the effective IFN response, especially that during acute phases of antiviral responses, is unlikely to induce obesity and meta-inflammation underlying obesity; however, the prolonged IFN responses during chronic viral infections might be an adipogenic drive in an opposite way (
