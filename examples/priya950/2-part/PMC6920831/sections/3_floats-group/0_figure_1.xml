  <p>Intrinsic interferon (IFN) response to microbiota tonic induction may suppress obesity in addition to its role in potentiating rapid antiviral response. In homeostatic situation, gut epithelia and the underlying leukocytes (mainly macrophages and dendritic cells, for example) sense natural shedding of microbial molecules from microbiota (particularly virobiota) and sustain an intrinsic expression of innate immune IFNs, particularly including IFN-β and probably IFN-λ. Acting through a non-canonical AKT-mTOR pathway, intrinsic IFNs signal IL-10/TGF production and contribute to maintain an anti-inflammatory microenvironment, which attenuates meta-inflammation and adipogenesis related to visceral obesity. The anti-obesity effect of transfecting IFN-β was recently demonstrated in addition to its role in potentiating rapid antiviral response via IFN autocrine loop of regulation. Abbreviations: AKT-mTOR, protein kinase B and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, type I IFN receptor; IFNLR, type III IFN receptor; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; IL-10, interleukin 10; PAMP, pathogenic associated molecular pattern; TGF, transforming growth factor; and TLR, Toll-like receptor.</p>
