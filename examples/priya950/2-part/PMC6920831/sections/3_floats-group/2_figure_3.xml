  <p>A reciprocal causality of obesity and chronic viral infections. High-fat diet and viral infection (particularly chronic viral infections) may independently (or synergistically in most time) induce dysbiosis of gut microbiota leading to gut inflammation and leaking, which at least partly results from prolonged IFN production upon chronic viral infection and underlies systemic inflammation of obesity. In turn, through the production of long-chain fatty acid (LFA) and leptin by expanding adipocytes, obesity is accompanied with meta-inflammation (enhanced by LFA) and susceptibility to viral infections (through suppression of IFN antiviral signaling by leptin induction of SOCS3 signaling). Abbreviations: NF-ÎºB, nuclear factor-kappa B; P-STAT, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; and that in the legend of
