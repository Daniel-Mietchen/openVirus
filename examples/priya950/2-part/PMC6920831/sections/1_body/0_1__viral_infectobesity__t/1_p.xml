<p>According to recent statistics, the prevalence of obesity was 39.8% and affected about 93.3 million US adults in 2015~2016 [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, in many other countries worldwide, overweight and obesity are also dramatically on the rise, particularly in urban areas [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We face an obesity epidemic that has a complex and multifactorial etiology [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While obesity is multifactorial, a simplified thermo-dynamic model, rather than a biological model, has prevailed in obesity clinics for over 90 years [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A key suggestion of this simplified model is to cut down one’s calorie intake and exercise more. While addressing proximate causes of obesity serves as a global health priority, it seems incomplete or ineffective to control obesity given that the epidemic has continued to worsen at the global level [

 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent investigations postulate that both physics and biology have tremendous utility for understanding obesity. In this regard, we review the biological complex of obesity and interpret its etiology from the interaction between immune and metabolic systems (i.e., immunometabolism). As pointed out by Hotamisligil [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], metabolic and immune systems are among the most fundamental requirements and are highly inter-dependent for species survival. Sequentially, obesity displays itself as a metabolic overload (shown by excess adipose tissue) in addition to an immune disorder, which accompanies a low-grade inflammatory state known as “meta-inflammation” involving both reprogrammed immune cells and adipocytes [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Immunologically, chronic inflammation accompanies persistent infections (either locally or systemically) as well as microbiota dysbiosis [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, persistent infections could also retain energy storage via adipogenesis at adipose depots for immune preparation [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The visceral adipose depots in mammals, as counterparts of the insect fat body which functions as both a storage and an immune organ, may evolutionarily enhance their role in anabolic storage for combat readiness when facing long-term defense risks posed by pathogenic persistence [

 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this context, recent studies have associated obesity with numerous microbial agents in both humans and animal models—a phenomenon described as infectobesity [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Microbial infections generally beget inflammation and alter metabolic function in surrounding cells or even systemically in the animal body. In this review, we recap the evidence of viral agents in association with obesity and relevant metabolic syndrome [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,

 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to examination of the major viruses or virus-like agents (VLA) that have been associated with obesity, we emphasize shared immune responses underlying the viral infectobesity. With this regard, interferons (IFNs), as a group of crucial cytokines in regulation of antiviral and autoimmune processes, are key to understanding the pathogenesis of persistent viral infections that are associated with most, if not all, viral infectobesity [

 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, the effect of IFNs and IFN-mediated signaling pathway (collectively known as the IFN system) in reprograming cellular lipid metabolism provides a biochemical mechanism to understand the interaction of viral infection and obesity [
