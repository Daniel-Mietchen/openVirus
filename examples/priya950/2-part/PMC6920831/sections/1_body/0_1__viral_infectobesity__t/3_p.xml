<p>To recap the evidence of viral infectobesity, adenoviruses (Ad) including an avian isolate from India (SMAM-1) and several serotypes of human Ad have been associated with obesity regarding epidemiological correlation in certain subsets of humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, as SMAM-1 infection caused fat gain and high body mass index (BMI) in both birds and probably humans. At least five human Ad serotypes including Ad-5, -9, 31, -36, and -37 have been observed to cause obesity at different levels. First, these five Ad serotypes induced adipocyte differentiation and increased lipid synthesis in cultured animal fibroblasts or pre-adipocytes. Second, Ad-5, Ad-37, and particularly Ad-36 infections increased the adipose index in animal models including chickens (Ad-36 and -37), mice (Ad-5 and -36), rats, and marmosets (Ad-36). Third, Ad-5 has been associated with child obesity and Ad-36 in both adults and children [

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Mechanistically, Ad-36 infection activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) (which is the so-called master-switch of adipocyte development) to signal adult stem cells to become adipocytes; meanwhile, the virus also induces the expression of some cell glucose transporters to facilitate energy supply [

 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, adenoviral E4orf1 protein (early region 4 open reading frame 1) was identified as a viral mechanism mediating acute adipogenesis in cells and animals [

 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00726-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> have also been associated with obesity in animals and humans through pathological studies or epidemiological observations; however, other viral mechanisms (such as viral factors regulating inflammatory response and lipogenesis in adipose depots) directly engaged in adipogenic effects warrant further investigation [

 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Notably, because phages do not directly infect animal cells, these bacterial viruses plausibly exert an adipogenic effect by affecting the symbiosis of microbiota [

 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The adipogenic observation in the patients of prion diseases (or coined as “slow viruses” previously), is plausibly ascribed to host immuno-metabolic adaptation to the chronic pathogenesis during disease progress, because no adipogenic effect has been associated to the prion protein [

 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this context, we emphasize that host immuno-metabolic adaptation to prolonged viral infection comprises a common etiology for viral infectobesity. As multiple immune factors, particularly inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) and adipokines (such as leptin and adiponectin), have been well-addressed elsewhere in obesity, we highlight the regulatory role of the IFN system in immunometabolic regulation in the scenario of viral infectobesity [
