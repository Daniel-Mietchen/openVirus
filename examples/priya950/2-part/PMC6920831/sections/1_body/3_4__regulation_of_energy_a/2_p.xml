<p>Cell membranes provide a pivotal role and serve as a platform in viral life cycles from entry and replication to assembly and exit. Indeed, the biochemical properties of cell membranes such as fluidity, raft-domain structure, and lipid composition are among the major determinants affecting different stages of viral infections [

 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In this context, both cholesterols and sphingolipids (including ceramide) not only affect viral entry, replication, and exit for being structural components that determine the biochemical property of cell membranes, but also actively serve as lipid signaling and direct antiviral molecules to regulate both cellular antiviral responses as well as viral life cycles [
