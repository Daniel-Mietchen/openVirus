<p>Evolutionarily, the IFN system represents a signature antiviral mechanism in high vertebrates. The molecular evolution diversifies three types (type I, II, and III) and multiple subtypes/isoforms within type I and type III IFNs. IFN-γ, as the single type II IFN, is mainly produced by NK cells and CTLs and mediates pro-inflammatory response along with the activation of adaptive immune cells. Type I IFNs such as IFN-α/β are expressed by most nucleated cells; in contrast, type III IFNs are produced and active primarily in epithelial cells [

 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Even though type I and III IFNs activate similar downstream signaling cascades in their responsive cells, respectively; type III IFNs (IFNλs), unlike type I IFNs, do not elicit strong inflammatory responses in vivo [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The effects in inflammatory induction of type I IFNs are more complicated. It depends on their subtypes, tissue location, and even temporal phases during viral pathogenesis. For example, the universal IFN-α/β subtypes may induce more pro-inflammatory response than IFN-κ or IFN-ε, which have a restrictive expression in keratinocytes or the reproductive tract, respectively [

 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In addition, the sustained IFN-α produced during persistent viral infections elicits more inflammatory cytokine responses [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, most of these antiviral IFN responses were observed during the infection of pathogenic viruses. However, several recent studies discovered that, in addition to the robust IFN reaction to infectious viruses, there is always an intrinsic IFN production signaled by gut microbiota [

 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In homeostatic situations, gut epithelia and the underlying leukocytes (including NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) sense the natural shedding of microbial molecules from microbiota and sustain an intrinsic expression of innate immune IFNs, particularly IFN-β and probably also the epithelial IFN-λ subtype [

 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Acting through a non-canonical AKT-mTOR pathway (IFN-β) or an IRF1-indolent process (IFN-λ), these intrinsic or local IFNs signal the expression of some anti-inflammatory and cell growth cytokines including IL-10 and IL-13 to maintain an anti-inflammatory microenvironment, which buffers a homeostatic resistance to meta-inflammation in obesity (

Although more investigations are needed, it is logical to think that the gut virome, especially the “commensal” part should contribute to signaling the intrinsic IFN-β response by microbiota. This thought is largely backed by the role of the gut virome in modulating microbiome composition (such as by phages) as well as more sensitive IFN-inductive effects from viral PAMPs compared to bacterial components [
