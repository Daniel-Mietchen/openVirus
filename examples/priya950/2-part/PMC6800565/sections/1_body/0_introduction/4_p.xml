<p>PCR, direct immunofluorescence, and rapid antigen-detection immunoassays may be used to diagnose conjunctivitis. Viral cell cultures of the conjunctival specimen may help confirm the presence of adenovirus with immunofluorescence, but are less frequently conducted, due to the requirement of elaborate equipment and trained laboratory staff, as well as significant delays in obtaining results. Much evidence has proved that PCR is the best standard method to diagnose viral conjunctivitis.
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This technique has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and accurate and less time-consuming than cell culture. In a study at Johns Hopkins Hospital, conjunctivitis specimens of 307 staff were taken and examined by PCR. Only 22 (7%) patients were infected.
