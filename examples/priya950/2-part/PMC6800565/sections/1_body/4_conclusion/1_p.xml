<p>This study demonstrated that adenoviruses were a much more common viral cause of conjunctivitis in the studied region than found in other regions. In addition, the acquisition rate of eye infection is expected to decrease dramatically in this region through control of adenoviruses. Demographic variables, such as age, sex, and income, were not significantly associated with acquisition of viral conjunctivitis. Most cases of conjunctivitis were reported to occur in summer and autumn. On the other hand, this study revealed that multiplex PCR has the potential to replace several diagnostic tests, with subsequent cost savings. This test also reduces the risk of misdiagnosis by clinicians. In light of the high prevalence of adenoviral conjunctivitis in the studied region, additional studies should investigate common viral genomes in west Iran, including Hamadan, so that health-care systems can be assisted in preventing and treating viral infections.</p>
