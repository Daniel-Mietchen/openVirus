<p>Reactions were set up and performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each tube of 25 µL real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) contained 1 µL enzymes, 1.5 µL primer/probe mix, 12.5 µL buffer and 10 µL extracted DNA. Real-time PCR was performed using the LightCycler and multiplex eye-infection kit (Fast Track Diagnostics) to amplify viral and bacterial targets at 42°C for 15 minutes, followed by 94°C for 3 minutes, and finally 40 cycles for 8 seconds at 94°C and 60°C for 34 seconds. The presence of specific viral sequences in the reaction was represented by an increase in fluorescence from the relevant dual-labeled probes and reported as cycle-threshold valus bya real-time thermocycler.</p>
