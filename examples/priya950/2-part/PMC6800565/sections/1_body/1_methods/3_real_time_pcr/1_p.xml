<p>The samples were used for adenovirus PCR analysis. We used multiplex real-time PCR, which was able to detect adenovirus, HSV1, HSV2, VZV, and 
 <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. The assay was performed at a private laboratory with a real-time LightCycler (Roche). Each assay was divided into two tubes, one for 
 <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> and adenovirus and the other for HSV1, HSV2, and VZV, based on the manufacturer's guidelines.
