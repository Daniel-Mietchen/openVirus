<p>Specimens were extracted using a column-based High Pure viral nucleic acid kit (Roche). Briefly, samples in viral transport medium were centrifuged at 13,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. Then, 200 μL sediments were added to 400 μL lysis buffer, vortexed, and incubated at 72°C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the mixture was spiked with 5 μL IC. After mixing, the solution was centrifuged through a filter tube at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute. In the next step, 500 μL inhibitor removal buffer was added to the filter tube and again centrifuged. After the column had been washed twice with the appropriate buffer, the genome was eluted with 50 μL elution buffer. Extracted DNA purity was verified based on its absorbance at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths with NanoDrop and then stored at −70°C until later use.
