<p>The increased prevalence of conjunctivitis in summer and autumn is likely to be related to increased frequency of certain activities, such as swimming and walking outside the city during warm seasons, while in winter, because of cold weather and decreased frequency of activities that are associated with increased risk of contagion, significant decrease in the prevalence of the disease has been reported. This finding indicates that contagion has a significant role in the increased prevalence of the disease.
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Considering that most patients with conjunctivitis are diagnosed and treated with clinical symptoms, the prevalence of pathogenic agents is not estimated. Study of prevalence of the disease's etiological agents using a rapid laboratory method can offer valuable information about the most common pathogenic agents to health-care providers, in order to prevent and treat diseases. Adenoviruses were found to be the most common cause of conjunctivitis in the studied region, as with other regions of the world.
