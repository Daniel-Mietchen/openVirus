<p>Real-time PCR was used to study the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis in 125 patients attending ophthalmology clinics in Hamedan. Previous similar studies had not considered such patient demographics, but we decided to study associations of occupation, income, and medical history with this disease as well. In our study, adenoviruses were the most prevalent pathogen in patients with conjunctivitis: 94.4% had adenovirus in their specimens of lower conjunctival discharge. This study was first to investigate viral conjunctivitis and associated demographic characteristics in a city in west Iran. Two studies had already been conducted in central Iran. One of these was conducted on 100 patients with eye redness and conjunctivitis symptoms attending a university-affiliated hospital in Tehran, 16 of whom were positive for adenovirus on PCR.

To achieve this purpose, the researchers took samples from 150 suspected patients using sterile swabs and examined them using PCR. They found that 14.6% of the patients were positive for adenovirus and 3.3% for HSV1.
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Both studies found that patient sex was not associated with acquisition of conjunctivitis, although aging and increased incidence of the disease were closely associated. Despite consistency in evidence on higher prevalence of adenoviruses among the causes of conjunctivitis, the prevalence of adenoviruses in the current study was found to be much higher than reported by studies conducted in central Iran. In this study, a high rate of occurrence of adenovirus during summer and fall was almost the same, perhaps showing an epidemic of adenovirus.
