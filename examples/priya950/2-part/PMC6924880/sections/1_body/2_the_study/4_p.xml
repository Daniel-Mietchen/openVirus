<p>A preliminary study we performed showed that many pigs in these countries possessed antibodies against JEV (K. Maeda, unpub. data). We found that JEV was more often isolated from serum samples from JEV antibodyâ€“negative pigs in farms where JEV seroprevalence was low. Because JEV isolation seems to be difficult in endemic regions, we suggest selecting younger pigs, which are less likely to be JEV antibody positive, for virus isolation studies to increase the chances of success.</p>
