<p>In areas of high hepatitis B endemicity (eg Southeast Asia and sub‐Saharan Africa), perinatal mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) and horizontal transmission during childhood are the most common routes of infection, while sexual contacts, unsafe injecting practices, and unhygienic medical or cosmetic procedures drive transmission elsewhere.

 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection is inversely related to age at infection: around 90% of infants infected perinatally develop chronic infection, unless vaccinated at birth. This risk decreases to around 30% among children infected before the age of six years and to less than 5% of persons infected as adults.
