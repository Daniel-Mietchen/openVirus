<p>In Scotland, advocates used political pressure and scientific evidence to raise awareness of the human impact of hepatitis C and its links to inequalities, which generated political consensus to support significant funding and evidence‐based policy initiatives.

Substantial investment in a robust monitoring and surveillance system – combined with ambitious treatment targets – facilitated progress and demonstrated immediate impact, which helped to sustain momentum.

Launched in 2006, Phase I focused on gathering evidence to inform and generate proposals for the development of hepatitis C services and identify the additional investment required. Subsequently, in Phase II the Scottish Government committed funds to substantially improve prevention (including increasing coverage of harm reduction services), diagnosis and treatment services and deliver evidence‐based actions throughout the country for improved hepatitis C prevention and control (Figure

Since 2011, the Hepatitis C Action Plan has been integrated with other national policies within the Scottish Government's Framework on Sexual Health and Blood Borne Viruses, which adopts a multi‐agency outcomes‐based approach with a strong focus on challenging inequalities.
