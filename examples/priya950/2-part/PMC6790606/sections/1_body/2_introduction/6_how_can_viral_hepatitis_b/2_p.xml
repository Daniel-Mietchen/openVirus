A multipronged approach comprising three main pillars is most effective in addressing the local context; comprising (a) evidence‐gathering and planning the response; (b) implementation of disease‐specific activities, including investments in the delivery of care; and (c) integration of the viral hepatitis response into SDG 3 by adopting a public health approach and embedding services into universal health coverage.
