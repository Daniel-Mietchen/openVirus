<p>Egypt is committed to ending its generalised hepatitis C epidemic. It has developed one of the largest national programmes for hepatitis C treatment.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> Egypt provides free and universal access to locally produced DAA treatment, as part of a national action plan for the prevention and control of viral hepatitis. To maximise efficiencies, the country has rolled out mass screening since October 2018, providing direct linkage to hepatitis C care. Over six months, more than 49 million people were reached, of whom over 2 million were diagnosed as hepatitis C‐antibody positive (in addition, &gt;2.5 million possible cases of diabetes and &gt; 10 million possible cases of hypertension were identified and referred for further assessment and management). Of hepatitis C patients linked to care and confirmed as ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive, 750 000 started treatment.
