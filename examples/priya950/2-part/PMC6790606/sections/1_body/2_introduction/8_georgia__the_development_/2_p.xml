<p>Georgia was the first country in the WHO European region to set a hepatitis C elimination goal and develop a national plan for viral hepatitis tailored to the local context. Georgia's significant experience with HIV prevention and control programmes and the existing human and technical capacities to implement large‐scale health programmes facilitated the implementation of their national hepatitis C elimination programme.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> An international Technical Advisory Group assisted with describing the local hepatitis C epidemiology and proposing strategies, objectives and actions to address gaps in advocacy and awareness, surveillance, harm reduction, blood safety, infection control, and evidence‐based screening and linkage to care. Gilead Science provided direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) therapy to Georgia at no cost after the elimination programme commenced; reportedly, a key reason for their decision was the Georgian Government's commitment to an elimination response.
