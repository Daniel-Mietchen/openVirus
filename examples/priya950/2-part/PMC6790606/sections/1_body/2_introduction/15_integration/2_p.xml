<p>The cost burden of viral hepatitis diagnostic tests and treatment – in particular the new DAA treatment for hepatitis C – challenges the feasibility and sustainability of effective viral hepatitis elimination activities. Unlike for other major communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, there is little funding available for viral hepatitis at an international level and most countries lack dedicated hepatitis budgets or programmes.
