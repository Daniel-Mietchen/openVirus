<p id="Par49">Despite the importance of the M2 functions, it is not an essential protein for influenza A virus. In laboratory practice, so-called “M2 null” viruses have been obtained by various modifications of stop codons [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. All of these viruses were viable but had a reduced replication level [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. Moreover, an M2-deficient single replication (M2SR) virus has been generated and evaluated as a possible candidate for live influenza vaccine. The M2SR vaccine was able to infect cells and express all viral proteins except M2, without generating progeny virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. This vaccine platform proved efficient in protecting animals (mice and ferrets) against heterologous/heterosubtypic influenza virus infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and is now undergoing phase I clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03553940; NCT02822105).
