<p id="Par74">Ideally, a universal influenza vaccine should induce both a humoral (antibodies) and a T-cell immune response to conservative epitopes of the influenza virus. M2e and HA stalk domain are the most widely used viral targets for a universal influenza vaccine design due to their conserved nature and the proven ability of their specific antibody to protect against heterologous viral infections. Many vaccination strategies have been explored to elicit potent antibody responses against these naturally weak immunogens. The vaccine-induced anti-HA stalk antibodies target either group 1 or group 2 HAs, with limited cross-reactivity between the two HA groups, suggesting that a cHA-based universal influenza vaccine has to include three components: a group 1 HA, a group 2 HA, and an influenza B stalk-based antigen [

Since it is not possible to predict which virus will cause the next pandemic, we recommend that four different M2e consensus sequences be included in the new M2e-based vaccines to maximize cross-reactivity of the M2e-targeted antibody against all circulating influenza A viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Licensing of a new M2e-based vaccine is challenging due to the lack of clearly defined correlates of protections of such vaccines for humans. In addition, the M2e-specific protection is of lower potency compared to HA-targeted neutralizing immunity, therefore the problem of proving non-inferiority over existing influenza vaccines remains to be solved. Nevertheless, the conserved M2 ectodomains can be used as a supplement to overcome strain specificity and improve long-term cross-protection of currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines [
