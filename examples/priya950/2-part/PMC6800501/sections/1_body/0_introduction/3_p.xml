<p id="Par29">The broadly protective vaccines currently being developed can be divided into two groups. 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par30">Vaccines that induce antibodies to structurally conserved regions of viral proteins, such as the stalk domain of the hemagglutinin which is important for the penetration of the influenza virus into the cell [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]; broadly immunogenic epitopes located at the contact surface between HA head domains [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]; the enzymatic site of NA, where the surface cell sialic acids are cut [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; and the ectodomain of the M2 protein (reviewed in this manuscript). Induced antibodies can both have a neutralizing function and participate in the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or phagocytosis (ADCP), thereby accelerating the elimination of the virus from an infected organism [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>].

  <list-item>
   <p id="Par31">Vaccines that induce a cross-reactive T-cell immune response to the conserved epitopes of the virionâ€™s internal proteins, such as nucleoprotein (NP) and M1 [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is supported by a strong correlation of CD8+ T cells specific to conserved viral epitopes with cross-protection against symptomatic influenza in the absence of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>].
