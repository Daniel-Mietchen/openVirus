<p id="Par58">It is worth noting that, when shortened forms of the ectodomain M2 are used, and with regard to various defense mechanisms, the carrier of M2e epitopes plays an important role in immunogenicity. For example, immunization with a shortened form of M2e (2–16 amino acid residues) along with Freund’s adjuvant did not lead to the formation of a high level of anti-M2e antibodies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It was concluded that a shortened form of M2e will produce a high level of anti-M2e antibodies only with a support system capable of inducing a T-cell response. This study also revealed the presence in M2e (17–24 a.a.) of amino acids important for the formation of a T-cell response.
