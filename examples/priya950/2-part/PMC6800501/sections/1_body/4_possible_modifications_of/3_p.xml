<p id="Par57">Fu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] compared different anti-M2e antibodies, and showed that the protective properties of L18 antibody (which recognizes the M2e 4–13 site) were superior to those of O19 (which recognizes the M2e 2–9 site), while S1 (recognizes the M2e 7–13 site) did not protect mice against lethal influenza A virus challenge. Data from other groups indicate that the M2e 4–13 region contains a B-cell epitope and a sequence recognized by the 14C2 antibody (M2e 6–13) [
