<p id="Par61">One of the first prototypes of a universal influenza vaccine used hepatitis B core protein combined with the M2e peptide (M2HBc) as a carrier. In this design, the natural position of the N-terminal region of M2, located in the extracellular space, was simulated. Immunization of BALB/c mice with M2HBc resulted in a high level of protection against the lethal dose of influenza A virus, and led to the formation of anti-M2e antibodies, which were shown to be effective in passive immunization experiments [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] were used to induce anti-M2e antibodies. Another carrier used was the GCN4 protein, which is a eukaryotic transcriptional protein activator. The use of M2e-tGCN4 resulted in significant production of M2e-specific antibodies, which protected vaccinated mice from a lethal dose of mouse-adapted influenza virus [
