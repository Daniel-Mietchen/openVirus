<p id="Par62">The most effective and cost-effective method is the creation of recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs), on the surface of which M2e would be represented [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], it has been suggested that M2e could also be used as a tetramer in the creation of recombinant constructs. In this approach, M2e will form a compactly folded protein, thereby ensuring the correct geometry of the virus particles. In addition, there are confirmations of the creation of VLPs consisting of five M2e tandem repeats (M2e5x). The intramuscular administration of M2e5x protected mice from influenza A viruses of different serotypes [
