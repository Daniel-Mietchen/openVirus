<p id="Par64">It is interesting to note that in the vast majority of successful M2e vaccine studies mouse models were used, while only a few studies were conducted on other animals (pigs, ferrets, monkeys, dogs), where protection against challenge, if studied, was modest at best. One possible explanation for such diverse results is that mice of various inbred (including knockout and knock-in) strains are readily available at relatively low cost, whereas larger animals are more expensive and genetically outbred, resulting in significant host response variability. Even ferrets within commercial populations have distinct patterns of T-cell reactivity as a result of the heterogeneity at the MHC locus [
