<p id="Par63">There are data on the highly conservative nature of Cys17 and Cys19 residues, although, in many studies, these residues were replaced by Ser17 and Ser19, respectively, in order to avoid protein aggregation due to the formation of disulfide bonds between M2e sites. Such substitutions are widely used because it has been shown that Cys17 and Cys19 residues do not affect the expression of M2e [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and the double substitution does not affect the immunogenic properties of M2e epitopes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
