<p id="Par60">Despite numerous reports of the low immunogenicity of M2e because of its small size, small number of copies in the virion, and the possible shielding effect of larger surface proteins of influenza A virus [

This allowed the use of Sf9 lysates infected with Bac-AM2 as a source of antigen to study the antibody response to M2 in people previously infected with influenza A virus [
