<p id="Par34">At first, M2 was detected only in infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and not in the influenza virions themselves, which made it possible to put forward an assumption about the specific location of this protein. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of M2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], a hydropathy graph was constructed indicating the presence of a hydrophobic domain. Further study of the protein led to the conclusion that the C-terminus is located in the cytoplasmic space, while the N-terminal part of M2 is exposed at the viral surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].
