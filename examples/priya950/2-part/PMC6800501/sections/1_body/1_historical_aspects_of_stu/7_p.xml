<p id="Par38">Mutational analysis, crystallography analysis of the structure and nuclear magnetic resonance have established that M2 is a transmembrane protein, consisting of four Î±-helices. Each helix has two conservative residues (His37 and Trp41), which play an important role in the life cycle of influenza virus [
