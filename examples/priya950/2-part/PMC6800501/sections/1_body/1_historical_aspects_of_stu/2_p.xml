<p id="Par33">Further study using viral lysate labelling with [
 <sup>35</sup>S] methionine and subsequent separation in a polyacrylamide gel detected a new protein with greater electrophoretic mobility than the already known influenza A protein. Isolation of different mRNA segments followed by peptide synthesis in vitro produced a new peptide of similar molecular weight; it was concluded that the 7th segment of the mRNA of the influenza A genome and the new M2 protein were genetically related. RNA-RNA hybridization established that the 7th segment encodes M1 and M2 proteins [
