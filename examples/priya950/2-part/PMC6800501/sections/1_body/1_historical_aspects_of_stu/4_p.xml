<p id="Par35">The first monoclonal antibody to M2 (14C2) was obtained in 1988 as a result of the immunization of BALB/c mice with purified M2 protein along with Freundâ€™s adjuvant. A subsequent study of 14C2 showed that the antibody binds to the extracellular N-terminal region of M2 (M2e) [

To this end, splenocytes from BALB/c mice immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-linked M2 peptide SLLTEVETPIRNEWGCRCND were fused with F23.1 hybridoma cells producing an immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) monoclonal antibody. The authors selected a monoclonal antibody (3F12), which not only had cross-reactivity to different influenza A strains, but could also bind to the T-cell receptor. It was also shown that such a bispecific antibody is able to limit the growth of influenza A virus in vitro (with less efficiency than 14C2) and redirect activated T-cells to eliminate infected cells [
