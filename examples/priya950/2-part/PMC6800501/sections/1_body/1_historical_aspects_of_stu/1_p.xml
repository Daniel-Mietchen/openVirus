<p id="Par32">Most attempts to create a universal influenza vaccine have been based on the M2e epitopes. The first evidence of the existence of M2 protein was published in 1981 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Several groups had already shown that the influenza A virus has a segmented genome consisting of 8 elements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. It was also known that the 8th mRNA encodes two proteins, NS1 and NS2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and that the nucleotide sequence of the 7th mRNA contains two open reading frames [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>], which were thought to encode the already discovered M1 protein and a previously unknown protein consisting of 97 amino acid residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
