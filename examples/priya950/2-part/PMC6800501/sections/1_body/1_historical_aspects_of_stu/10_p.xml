<p id="Par41">The structure of free M2e is currently unknown. However, a number of studies have obtained crystallographic data on the structures of “M2e + antibody”. Using the example of MAb65, MAb148, Fab148 and Fab65 antibodies, it has been shown that M2e can take at least two different conformations to increase its affinity. For example, interaction with Fab148 and MAb148 occurs through residues 2–5, which play an important role in the interaction and form a β-turn. For interaction with MAb65, not only do residues 5–8 form a β-turn, but also the whole M2e takes a U-shaped formation with a central Trp15 [
