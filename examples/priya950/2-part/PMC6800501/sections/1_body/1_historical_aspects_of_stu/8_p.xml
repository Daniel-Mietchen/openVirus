<p id="Par39">The entire M2 protein can be divided into 3 parts: the N-terminal or extracellular domain (23 a.a., excluding the 1st methionine); the hydrophobic transmembrane domain (19 a.a.); and the C-terminal domain (54 a.a.). The extracellular domain of M2 (M2e) consists of 23 amino acid residues and is a highly conserved region in all influenza A viruses. One of the reasons for the low variability of M2e is its inability to induce an immune response in an infected organism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], so there is no selection pressure on the site. A more important reason is believed to be the genetic relationship between M2e and M1: a.a. 1–9 of M2e and M1 are encoded by the same nucleotides in the same reading frame. Amino acids 10–23 of M2e and a.a. 239–252 of M1 are also encoded by the same RNA sequence but are translated in different reading frames [
