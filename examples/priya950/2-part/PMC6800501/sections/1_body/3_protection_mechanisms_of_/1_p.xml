<p id="Par50">Despite the small size of M2e, many questions about this protein remain unanswered. For example, the defense mechanism of M2e-containing vaccines has not been fully clarified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Since anti-M2e antibodies were discovered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>], it has been believed that they are the main mechanism of the protective action that has been repeatedly shown in various animal models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Importantly, several groups have noted that M2e-based influenza vaccines induced a long-lasting M2e-specific antibody response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The presence of antibody 14C2 reduces the expression level of viral protein M2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], thereby indirectly affecting the formation of new viral particles. However, it has been shown that influenza viruses that have mutations in the C-terminal region of M2 and the N-terminal region of M1 (even one amino acid substitution could be sufficient, for example, Pro10His, Val31Ile or Ala41Val) are resistant to the action of antibody 14C2 [
