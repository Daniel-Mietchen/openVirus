 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] showed that B cell-deficient mice are very poorly protected by a mucosal M2e-based vaccine even though these mice mount a considerable CD4 T cell response against M2e. In 2011, El Bakkouri et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] demonstrated the crucial role of Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) in the in vivo protection afforded by M2e-specific IgG isotypes. In this study, wild-type and FcR γ
 <sup>−/−</sup> BALB/c mice were passively immunized with anti-M2e immune serum, followed by lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted virus. Despite similar distribution of anti-M2e IgG titers and antibody isotype in both mouse strains, the FcR γ
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were significantly less protected than wild-type animals. Further experiments demonstrated that the activating receptor FcγRIII associated with the common γ-chain is required for anti-M2e IgG1 isotype-mediated in vivo immune protection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similar results were yielded in study by Lee et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]: although the wild-type mice and FcR γ
 <sup>−/−</sup> genotype mice had similar levels of antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2a) after immunization with M2e5x virus-like particles (VLP), the vaccine was significantly less protective in mice without an FcR γ-chain than in wild-type mice. Van den Hoecke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>] showed that protection against influenza virus with different IgG antibody subclasses requires different FcR subtypes: protection with IgG1 requires FcγRIII, while IgG2a requires all three activating FcγRs.
