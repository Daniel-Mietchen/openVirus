<p id="Par52">It is known that M2 protein is expressed abundantly on the surface of infected cells, whereas only a few molecules are incorporated into the virion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>], therefore anti-M2e IgG antibody provide protection by interacting with virus-infected cells and triggering immune effector cell activation through its Fc region, resulting in killing and/or phagocytosis of the infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Many studies attempted to identify the effector cells which are responsible for elimination of M2-expressing cells in the presence of anti-M2e IgGs. Controversial results were yielded with respect to the formation of natural killer (NK)-mediated ADCC in response to immunization with M2e-containing vaccines. A number of studies have shown that the ADCC mechanism has an essential role of [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>], whereas experiments with peptide-specific monoclonal antibodies have refuted this [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>] looked at the effect of NK-mediated ADCC during passive immunization, which introduces additional difficulties in identifying the true mechanism of protection. Using a conditional cell depletion protocol, El Bakkouri et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] demonstrated that alveolar macrophages (AM) play a critical role in the protection mediated by anti-M2e IgG antibody. These results are of particular interest because AM are resident in the lung and are considered one the first immune cells to interfere with respiratory pathogens in the airways. The contribution of these components of the immune system alone is not sufficient for a complete defense, but it can influence innate immunity and the first stages of the adaptive immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The activation of the complement system as a result of viral elimination after immunization with M2e-containing vaccines also raises questions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The complement system can bind to influenza virions in the presence of virus-specific antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A study by Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>] showed the importance of the C3 complement system in reducing viral titer in the lungs of mice after challenge, although Jegerlehner et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] found that the system does not play a significant role in protection.
