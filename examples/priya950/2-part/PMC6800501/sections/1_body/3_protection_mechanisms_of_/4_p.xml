 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>], however different studies yielded discrepant results in M2e-specific T-cell responses, most probably due to the differences in immunization protocols, vaccine platforms and adjuvants, strains of animals, and routes of immunization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. A study by Eliasson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] demonstrated a critical role of M2e-specific lung-resident memory CD4, but not CD8, T cells induced by mucosal CTA1-3M2e-DD vaccine in protecting mice against a lethal influenza virus infection. Importantly, these CD4 T-cell responses were long-lasting, protecting animals even 12 months after vaccination [

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice recovered more quickly after viral exposure than naïve FcR γ
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, most probably due to the prevalence of IFN-γ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs of immunized FcR γ
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice [
