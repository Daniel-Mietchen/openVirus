All of the contradictory data mentioned can be explained by unaccounted mechanisms in the formation of protection or by the additional influence of the M2e carrier (studies with contradictory results used different types of carriers). Another factor may be the lack of a unified methodology. However, all researchers agree that the response to M2e-containing vaccines involves many key parts of the immune system, which can have a significant protective effect.</p>
