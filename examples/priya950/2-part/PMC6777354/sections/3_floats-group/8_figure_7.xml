 <caption>
  <p>A median joining network for the major epidemic cluster of GII.P17-GII.17 strains based on nucleotide sequences from the 
   <italic>RdRp</italic> to 
   <italic>VP1</italic> (3133 bp). The detected areas for Japanese strains used in the analysis are shown with the number of strains on a Japanese map. The filled circles represent viral haplotypes, including collection years and months for the strains. The sizes of the circles represent the number of strains within the haplotype. Red arrows indicate strains associated with the production of many haplotypes.
