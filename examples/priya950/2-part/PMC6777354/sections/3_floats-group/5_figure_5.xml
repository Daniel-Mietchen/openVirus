  <p>Structural models of the VP1 protein for representative GII.17 strains in the clusters of the Kawasaki2014 variant and its ancestor. Three-dimensional VP1 dimer structures for Tokyo/27-3 [ancestor; cluster 3; 
   <bold>(A)</bold>], Kawasaki323 [cluster 2; 
   <bold>(B)</bold>], and Kawasaki308 [cluster 1; 
   <bold>(C)</bold>] viruses are shown. Each monomeric chain that comprise the dimer structures is colored gray (chain A) and dim gray (chain B). The predicted epitope regions of the strains are circled in black and the amino acids of the epitopes with no substitutions are colored blue for the shell domain and cyan for the P2 domain. Positive selection sites are colored yellow with the positions under the order of alignments. Orange circles represent the HBGA binding sites on the structures. Amino acid substitutions on the epitopes, non-epitopes, and positive selection sites within the clusters are colored green, magenta, and red, respectively.
