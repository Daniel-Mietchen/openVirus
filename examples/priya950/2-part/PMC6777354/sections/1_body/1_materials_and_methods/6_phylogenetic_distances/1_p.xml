<p>Phylogenetic trees were created using the maximum likelihood method in MEGA7 software (Kumar et al.,

 <italic>VP1</italic> and K80+Γ for 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>) were selected using the jModelTest2. Branch reliability was supported by 1,000 replications of bootstrap values. Phylogenetic distances between GII.17 strains were calculated by Patristic software (Fourment and Gibbs,
