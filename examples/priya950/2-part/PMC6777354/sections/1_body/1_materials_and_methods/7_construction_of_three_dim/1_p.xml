<p>Structural models of the VP1 and RdRp proteins of HuNoV [Hu/GII/JP/1976/GII.17/Tokyo/27-3: AB684681 (VP1), Hu/GII/NE/1995/GII.P3/Amsterdam/1: KJ194500 (RdRp), Hu/GII/JP/2014/GII.P17-GII.17/Kawasaki323: AB983218 (VP1 and RdRp), Hu/GII/JP/2015/GII.P17-GII.17/Kawasaki308: LC037415 (VP1 and RdRp)] were generated based on homology modeling using the MODELLER software v9.15 (Webb and Sali, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Three crystal structures for VP1 (PDBID: 1IHM, 5F4M and 5LKC) and one for RdRp (PDBID: 1SH0) were used as the templates based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

 </xref> (BLAST) analyses of the proteins. Amino acid sequences of the templates and the target strains were aligned using MAFFTash software (Standley et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Katoh et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The constructed structures were minimized using the GROMOS96, implemented by Swiss PDB Viewer v4.1 and evaluated by Ramachandran plots via the RAMPAGE server, which showed the favored regions of 96.1% ± 0.26 (VP1) and 98.0% ± 0.46 (RdRp), the allowed regions of 3.43% ± 0.32 (VP1) and 1.47% ± 0.32 (RdRp), and the outlier regions of 0.47% ± 0.058 (VP1) and 0.57% ± 0.15 (RdRp) (mean ± SD) of all residues in each structure (Guex and Peitsch, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Lovell et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The final models were modified and colored using Chimera v1.12 (Pettersen et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Conformational epitopes on the VP1 dimer structures of the GII.17 strains were predicted using DiscoTope 2.0, EPCES, and EPSVR programmes (Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kringelum et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Cut-off values were set at −3.1 for the DiscoTope 2.0 and 81 for the EPCES and EPSVR in order to encompass epitopes on the VP1 of GII.17 identified by a previous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study (Lindesmith et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Consensus sites identified by more than one of the three tools and regions with two or more closely apposed residues of the sites on the VP1 dimer structures were determined to be conformational epitopes. Positive selection sites in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region of the GII.17 strains were predicted using the Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) and Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME) algorithms on the Datamonkey server (Pond and Frost, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Delport et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Murrell et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Weaver et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Generally, FUBAR hypothesizes constant selection pressure at each site for the entire phylogeny and utilizes a Bayesian approach to estimate non-synonymous (
 <italic>dN</italic>) and synonymous (
 <italic>dS</italic>) substitution rates at each site. MEME is used to detect positive selection sites under a proportion of branches. Significance levels were set at posterior probabilities of &gt;0.9 for FUBAR and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for MEME.
