<p>Transition of effective population sizes was estimated by a Bayesian skyline plot using the BEAST2 package v2.4.8. Appropriate substitution models were selected based on comparison of the BIC values in the dataset, including 337 strains of the Kawasaki2014 variant in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region. The clock models were appropriately selected on the basis of path-sampling/stepping stone-sampling marginal-likelihood estimation. The MCMC was run on chain lengths of 480,000,000 steps with sampling every 2,000 steps. After evaluation based on the ESS values, the Bayesian skyline plot was generated by Tracer
