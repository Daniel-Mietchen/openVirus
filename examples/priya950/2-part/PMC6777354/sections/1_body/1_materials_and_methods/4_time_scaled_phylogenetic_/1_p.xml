<p>Phylogenetic trees with molecular clocks were generated by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using the BEAST2 package v2.4.8 (Bouckaert et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Best substitution models (GTR+Î“+I for both 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>) were determined for the constructed datasets (365 strains for 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 156 strains for the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>) by comparison of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values using jModelTest2 software (Guindon and Gascuel,

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Appropriate clock and tree prior models (relaxed clock exponential and coalescent exponential population tree prior for both 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>) were selected by path-sampling/stepping stone-sampling marginal-likelihood estimation using the BEAST2 package (Baele et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The MCMC runs were conducted with chain lengths of 930,000,000 steps with sampling every 16,000 steps for 
 <italic>VP1</italic>, and with chain lengths of 465,000,000 steps with sampling every 8,000 steps for 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>. The analyzed data was evaluated by the effective sample sizes (ESS) values using Tracer

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In this study, the evolutionary rates of overall clusters in the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were calculated since the rate of a cluster could not be estimated due to the limited number of strains available for analysis.
