<p>Sequencing was performed with Sanger and next-generation sequencers. For Sanger sequencing, a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was first performed for 30 min at 45°C and then 2 min at 94°C, followed by a total of 45 cycles of 30 s at 98°C, 30 s at 55°C and 90 s at 68°C, and then a final extension of 7 min at 68°C using specific primers for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions and a PrimeScript II High Fidelity One Step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan;

Cycle sequencing was performed for 1 min at 96°C, followed by a total of 30 cycles of 10 s at 96°C, 10 s at 50°C and 2 min at 60°C using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA). The DNA sequences were analyzed using a 3500 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems). Full-length nucleotide sequences of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions were acquired using the primer walking method. Next-generation sequencing was conducted as described previously (Dennis et al.,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Data analysis was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.0.1 (Qiagen). Contigs were assembled from the obtained sequence reads by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. HuNoV genotypes were determined using the Norovirus Genotyping Tool (version 2.0) and the Human Calicivirus Typing Tool
