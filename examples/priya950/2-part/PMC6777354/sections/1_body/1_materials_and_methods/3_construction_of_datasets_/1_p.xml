<p>All full-length nucleotide sequences of the

 </xref> (accessed on 29 August, 2017). For the GII.P17-GII.17 genotype, only sequences with information on sample collection years and months were used in this study. Moreover, nine sequences associated with some recent outbreaks of GII.P17-GII.17 (Sakon et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) were combined with those of the new Japanese strains above. To construct time-scaled phylogenetic tree, we added representative 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of all GII genotypes, including porcine NoV GII (GII.11, GII.18, and GII.19) and other HuNoV GII genotypes (18 strains), as well as an outgroup strain of HuNoV GI genotype (GI.1) to the dataset of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region (resulting in a total of 365 strains). The representative 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> sequences of the GII genotypes, including porcine NoV (GII.P11 and GII.P18) and other HuNoV GII genotypes (20 strains), as well as an outgroup strain of HuNoV GI genotype (GI.P1), were appended to produce an 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> dataset consisting of 156 strains (
