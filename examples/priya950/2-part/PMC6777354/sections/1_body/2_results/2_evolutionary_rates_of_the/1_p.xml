<p>The evolutionary rates of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The rate for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region was 2.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 2.2–3.2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), while that for the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region was 2.3 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% HPD 1.5–3.2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). These results indicate that the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains evolved with similar rates.
