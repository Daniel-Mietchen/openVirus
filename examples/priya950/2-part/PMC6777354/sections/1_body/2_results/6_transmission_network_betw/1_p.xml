<p>Links in circulation of prevalent GII.P17-GII.17 (cluster 1) in Japanese regions and in other countries were analyzed using a median joining network. The strains analyzed in this study were divided into four clusters. Strains belonging to cluster 1 were mainly found from Japan, while those belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were found in various countries including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Australia. The strains in cluster 4 were detected only in Miyagi prefecture in Japan. Notably, the network contained the key strains that were linked to the many other strains (
