<p>We constructed time-scaled phylogenetic trees using the MCMC method based on the full-length of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> (343 strains) and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> (133 strains) regions in the GII.17 strains detected in the various countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The MCMC tree for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region estimated that the common ancestor of the GII.17, GII.13, and GII.21 diverged in September, 1931 (95% HPD January, 1911–February, 1950). A common ancestor of the GII.17 strains diverged in November, 1948 (95% HPD September, 1934–November, 1961) and further diverged into seven clusters by around October, 2011. Of these, the GII.P17-GII.17 strains belonged to clusters 1 and 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The GII.17 strains in clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 (no information on the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> sequence in cluster 7) were composed of the distinct 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> genotypes, including GII.P3, GII.P16, GII.P4, and GII.Pe, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>). Most strains of the GII.P17-GII.17 belonged to the cluster 1 (the Kawasaki308 type). The common ancestor of the cluster 1 diverged in October, 2011 (95% HPD May, 2009–August, 2013), while that of cluster 2 (the Kawasaki323 type) emerged in July, 2010 (95% HPD July, 2007–September, 2012) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, analyses of phylogenetic distances exhibited no overlap between intra- and inter-cluster peaks at a value of 0.035 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). With respect to the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the common ancestor of the GII.P17 and GII.P3 diverged in January, 1988 (95% HPD December, 1980–May, 1993). Subsequently, the common ancestor of the GII.P17 diverged in October, 2009 (95% HPD May, 2006–April, 2012) and then further into two clusters by around August, 2012. The GII.P17-GII.17 strains were contained in clusters 1 and 2 in the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region, which was compatible with the classification in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region. Most strains of the GII.P17-GII.17 also belonged to cluster 1 (the Kawasaki308 type). The common ancestor of cluster 1 diverged in August, 2012 (95% HPD December, 2010–January, 2014), while that of cluster 2 (the Kawasaki323 type) did so in April, 2011 (95% HPD September, 2009–October, 2012). Furthermore, phylogenetic distances overlapped between the intra- and inter-cluster peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 strains emerged and formed two variants in approximately the past 10 years.
