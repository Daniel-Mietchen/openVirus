<p>Human norovirus (HuNoV) is a major causative pathogen of acute viral gastroenteritis (de Graaf et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although HuNoV is most prevalent during autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere, the virus can be detected throughout the year (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A previous report suggested that approximately 680 million people annually suffer from gastroenteritis due to HuNoV infection worldwide (Kirk et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Molecular epidemiological studies have indicated that distinct GII.4 variants have recurrently emerged every 2â€“3 years in the past decade to cause pandemics of gastroenteritis in all aged individuals (Bull et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, GII.P17-GII.17 (Kawasaki2014 variant) has suddenly been prevalent since 2014 in various countries including Japan, China, South Korea, Italy, Romania, Argentina, Brazil, and the USA (Chan et al.,

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, the epidemiology of this virus over a long period of time is unclear at present.
