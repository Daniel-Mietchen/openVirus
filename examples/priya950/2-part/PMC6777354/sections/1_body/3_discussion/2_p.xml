<p>The evolutionary rates of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions in the GII.P17-GII.17 were ~2.7 and ~2.3 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The rate for GII.17 is likely similar to that for GII.2 in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region, but lower than that of GII.4 (Bok et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Siebenga et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Mizukoshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Motoya et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the rate for GII.P17 is likely analogous to that for GII.P16, but lower than that of GII.P4 (Nagasawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ozaki et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Interestingly, it has been suggested that GII.P4-GII.4 virus prevalence is associated with the rapid evolution of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> regions with a high ratio of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions to synonymous substitutions (Bull et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Parra et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Previous reports have also suggested that the rates of non-synonymous amino substitutions in the VP1 protein differ between GII.17 and GII.4, with GII.4 being greater than GII.17 (Mori et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>); therefore, the rates of antigenicity change between GII.17 and GII.4 viruses may be distinct. In contrast, it has been estimated that the number of negative selection sites in GII.P4 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> are larger than that in GII.P17 (Ozaki et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and thus variations in nucleotide substitution in GII.P4 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> may be restricted compared to GII.P17. However, despite such restrictions, we observed a lower evolutionary rate in GII.P17 than GII.P4. This may be due to differences in replication activities and/or in replication errors of the RdRp protein between GII.P17 and GII.P4. Additional 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies may be needed to address these possibilities.
