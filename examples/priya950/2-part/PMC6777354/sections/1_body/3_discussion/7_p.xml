<p>In conclusion, the GII.P17-GII.17 virus has evolved differently to GII.P4-GII.4. However, this virus may have the potential to alter its antigenicity, host-binding capability (i.e., HBGA) and genome replication efficiency. Such changes could recurrently generate variants of GII.17 with the potential to produce pandemics such as those caused by GII.4 variant strains. Thus, additional and continuous evolutionary analyses of this genotype should be needed in the future.</p>
