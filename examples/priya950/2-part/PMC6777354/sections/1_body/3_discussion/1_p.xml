<p>In this study, we demonstrated the molecular evolution of both the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions of GII.P17-GII.17 since the emergence of the virus. First, a MCMC time-scaled evolutionary phylogenetic tree based on GII.17 
 <italic>VP1</italic> nucleotide sequences showed that all the present strains grouped into a total of seven clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Trees also indicated that the recently emerged GII.P17-GII.17 strains uniquely formed 2 clusters (clusters 1 and 2) based on both the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions. The common ancestor of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region of the GII.P17-GII.17 viruses diverged first, followed by divergence of the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region after a several-year delay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Previous reports have also suggested a gap in the divergence of GII.P16-GII.2 strains (Mizukoshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Nagasawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). To resolve this issue, we analyzed the phylogenetic distances of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions and found that the distance of the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region was longer than that of 
 <italic>RdRp</italic>, indicating that the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> in GII.P17-GII.17 is larger than that of 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the evolutionary rates for the overall cluster in GII.P17-GII.17 were similar between the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> regions (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we also calculated the rates of the strains belonging to the cluster 1, which resulted in reduction of the value in the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region, but not in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region (data not shown). These results suggest that the differences of divergent times and genetic distances between these regions may be associated with those in the changes of the evolutionary rates. Furthermore, we analyzed the time-scaled MCMC phylogenetic trees by adding 343 sequences of GII.17 for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic>, 133 sequences of GII.P17 for the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> and data of not only collection years but also months, which produced confidence intervals (95% HPD values) that were smaller in our analyses than in an earlier report (Sang and Yang, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, more precise collection data, as well as the use of a large number of virus strains, may facilitate the construction of more precise MCMC phylogeny.
