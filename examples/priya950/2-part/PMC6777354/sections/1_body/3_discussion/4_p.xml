<p>We additionally found amino acid substitutions in the conformational epitopes of the VP1 capsid protein of GII.P17-GII.17 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Such substitutions were also identified around the HBGA binding sites. Such evolutionary substitutions may induce both changes in antigenicity and in HBGA binding ability (Tan et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; de Rougemont et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lindesmith et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Debbink et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Indeed, Lindesmith et al. showed that some amino acid substitutions (corresponding to aa394-aa397 in our alignments) are located adjacent of the HBGA binding sites and result in changes in the antigenicity of the GII.17 capsid protein (Lindesmith et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Jin et al. also reported changes to the antigenicities and HBGA binding affinities of GII.17 capsid proteins belonging to different phylogenetic clusters (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, an amino acid substitution (aa376) located adjacent the HBGA binding sites was identified as a possible positive selection site. Previous reports have suggested that aa375 and aa377 are associated with the HBGA binding ability (He et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Koromyslova et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>); however, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports regarding possible roles of the aa376 substitution in antigenicity and the HBGA binding capability, which is a subject for possible further study.
