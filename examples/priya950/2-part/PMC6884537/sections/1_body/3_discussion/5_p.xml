<p id="Par29">The estimated incidence of RSV-A associated ALRI in our study is particularly high. We estimated an incidence of 112 cases per 1000 population per year (168 per 1000 population per year &lt;1 year of age) while other African studies using passive case detection have reported incidences of 11

 </sup> per 1000 person-years in children &lt;1 year of age. Even in studies using active case detection the incidence of RSV disease has generally been similar to our study which used passive case detection. Reanalysis of active case detection data from a number of locations for a systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI found incidence in the first year of life of 38 in India, 88 in Indonesia, 105 in Kenya, 149 in Bangladesh, 148 in Guatemala, 116 in Nigeria and 331 in South Africa

 </sup>. Our estimated incidence of RSV disease in the first year of life was greater than in all these studies, which had used active case detection, apart from the South African study, indicating a very high burden in our setting. A recent study from Mali using active surveillance in infants less than 6 months of age reported a very high incidence of RSV detection at 537 per 1000 person-years
