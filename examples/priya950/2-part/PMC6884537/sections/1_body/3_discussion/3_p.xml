<p id="Par27">We used a monthly sampling design to estimate the expected number of cases during the observation period and estimated that 14% of children aged 2â€“23 months in the population presented with ALRI associated with RSV, PIV or IV and that 11% presented with ALRI associated with RSV-A. The incidence of any target virus and RSV-A associated ALRI within this demographically well-defined population was 140 and 112 cases per 1000 population per year respectively. The three target viruses were highly prevalent, one or more being detected in 58% of children with ALRI and RSV-A detected in 46% of children. The number of ALRI cases associated with IV and PIV respectively, was only 14% and 13% of the number associated with RSV.</p>
