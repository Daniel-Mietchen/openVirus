<p id="Par32">Currently, no influenza vaccines are used in The Gambia. Given the IV profiles and circulation dynamics, similar to those seen in Senegal (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/flunet" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.who.int/flunet</ext-link>) where an early and late peak in the same year are generally observed every second year, early use of the previous year Northern Hemisphere (NH) recommended vaccine composition and a switch to that for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) for vaccination later in the season could be considered. However, it may be that recommendations for the SH vaccine would be too late for a vaccination campaign in late January/early February to cover the potential March-April circulation of IV. Our results showed that the global recommendations for the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain were appropriate for The Gambia but there was a mismatch for A(H3N2). NH recommendations for B/Yamagata were mismatched and the recommended SH vaccine was appropriate (see Supplementary Material p.Â
