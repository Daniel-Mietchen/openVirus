<p id="Par33">Our study had a number of limitations. Due to the inability to detect all cases in the population our estimates of incidence are minimal estimates of the true incidence. The observation period of 11 months was not able to capture the known year-to-year variability in the prevalence and seasonality of different respiratory viruses. We excluded those aged &lt;2 months, and although the peak age for RSV disease is between 3â€“11 months

 </sup>, infants less than 2 months of age are at risk of severe disease. We tested for the three respiratory viruses expected to be most prevalent and did not include viruses such as human metapneumovirus. Inclusion of a larger number of viruses could have closed part of the diagnostic gap, especially for the months of November and December. The testing of only 22% of children with ALRI for viruses was largely overcome by a scheme of random monthly sampling and simulation of the expected number of unobserved cases. This approach provided a valid point estimate of incidence but wider confidence intervals. The ability to detect RSV and IV from swabs stored in STGG compared to the gold standard virus transport media can be generalised to PIV as all are enveloped viruses.
