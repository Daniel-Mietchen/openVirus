<p id="Par17">In order to study the viruses circulating in the region, isolates detected in children resident within and those resident outside the BHDSS were eligible for selection for genome sequencing. We used the sequences of Gambian RSV and IV from this study, selected sequences extracted from GenBank for RSV and GISAID for IV, and selected sequences of RSV and IV from Dutch surveillance for influenza-like illness and other acute respiratory infections to infer phylogenetic trees of the genetic relatedness of viral genes encoding the G-protein of RSV-A and RSV-B and the hemagglutinin gene of IV (Supplementary Methods p.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). The RSV G-protein and IV hemagglutinin amino acid sequences were analysed for substitutions compared to parental strains for RSV or vaccine strains for IV. RSV F-protein gene sequences were analysed for antigenic site composition in the context of RSV-A strain A2 and RSV-B strain B1 that are frequently used in vaccine development

 </sup>. In addition, potential N-glycosylation sites were identified for RSV F- and G-proteins and IV hemagglutinin and potential O-glycosylation sites for RSV G-protein.
