<p id="Par16">The expected value and 95% confidence limits for the total number of cases among all children resident in the BHDSS and presenting with ALRI between 1 February and 31 December 2015 were derived by simulation taking into account the monthly sampling of patients resident in the study area (Supplementary Material p 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). We simulated the monthly proportions of children with viral-associated ALRI, assuming a binomial distribution with the observed proportion of positive samples from the number of patients sampled each month. We then randomly sampled from an independent binomial distribution with these proportions, from the whole population of ALRI cases to estimate the number of positive cases each month at the population level. This was repeated 1,000,000 times for each month and the expected number of positive cases and their 95% confidence limits were estimated as the mean and 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the simulated values. We used these expected values and the mid-point population (12,318 × [11/12]) to calculate the expected incidence of ALRI associated with each of the target viruses with 95% confidence limits. Simulations used R v3.43 software.
