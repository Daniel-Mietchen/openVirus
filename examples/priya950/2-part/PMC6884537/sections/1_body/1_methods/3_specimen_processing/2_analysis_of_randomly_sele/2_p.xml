<p id="Par13">Extraction of nucleic acid from the clinical specimens and control material in STGG was performed on a MagNA Pure 96 Instrument (Roche) using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche). Specimens and controls were spiked with EAV as an internal control. One-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies) was done for the detection and typing of IV, RSV, PIV and EAV. We determined IV subtyping and lineage using the same approach. The Primers and probes used and the PCR protocol are listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>. For each RT-PCR positive control (strains indicated in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), two negative controls consisting of STGG and GLY were included.
