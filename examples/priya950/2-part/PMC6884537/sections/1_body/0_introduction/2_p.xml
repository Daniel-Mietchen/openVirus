<p id="Par3">In order to address the ongoing burden of virus-associated ALRI and to develop evidence-based vaccination strategies, additional data are needed from low-income settings. Recent case-control studies from low-income countries have established an etiologic association between ALRI and respiratory syncytial (RSV), parainfluenza (PIV), influenza (IV) and human metapneumo viruses

 </sup>. However, these studies could not calculate disease incidence. A recent systematic review estimated the global number of cases of RSV-associated ALRI in 2015 at 33.1 million, 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59 600 deaths with 45% of cases occurring before 6 months of age
