 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. All Gambian RSV-A viruses clustered in the ON1 clade and all but one of the sequenced RSV-A viruses clustered with 2014 and 2015 viruses from The Netherlands and the USA in a subgroup of clade ON1 characterised by specific amino acid substitutions. Further diversification was seen characterised by particular common amino acid substitutions. One Gambian RSV-A clustered with 2015 and 2016 viruses from New Zealand and The Netherlands in another subgroup of clade ON1 characterised by specific amino acid substitutions. All five sequenced RSV-B clustered in a subgroup of clade BA characterised by specific amino acid substitutions with 2013–2016 RSV-B viruses from other continents. One Gambian RSV-B virus lost two stop codons resulting in a longer G-protein. Several of the amino acid substitutions of the clusters containing the Gambian RSV-A or RSV-B resulted in the gain or loss of potential O-glycosylation sites in the G-protein. Less complete G-protein gene sequences from Kenya in 2014–2015 did not cluster with Gambian RSV-A sequences (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). For RSV-B, a small proportion of 2015 and all 2016 Kenyan RSV-B, clustered with Gambian RSV-B in a larger subgroup of clade BA (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Full details of the G-protein sequence analysis can be found in the Supplementary Material p. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">31.</xref> Gambian RSV F-protein sequences showed that key antigenic sites were highly conserved, although some amino acid differences were observed between RSV-A and RSV-B (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). RSV-B had one N-glycosylation site less than RSV-A at amino acid 126 due to T128L difference. Circulating IV genotypes were similar to the rest of Africa and The Netherlands in 2015, with similar amino acid changes compared to the recommended vaccine strains (Supplementary Material p.
