<p id="Par20">Ct values for IV A and B controls generated from RNA extracted from STGG were consistently slightly higher (average 1.2 and 1.0 higher Ct respectively) than those generated from RNA extracted from the gold standard GLY, and similar was observed for RSV A and B controls (average 1.2 and 1.4 higher Ct respectively). The fraction positive for RSV and IV among the four replicates per dilution started to drop one 10-fold dilution step earlier with RNA extracted from STGG compared to GLY. Taken together these findings suggest a minor but clear inhibiting effect of STGG on RNA extraction and/or RT-PCR efficiency. We conclude that detection of IV and RSV in STGG is up to 10 times less sensitive than in GLY. Despite the reduced sensitivity of viral detection in STGG, the collection of clinical specimens in the acute phase of disease when viral load is high still provides good clinical performance for the detection of IV, RSV and PIV.</p>
