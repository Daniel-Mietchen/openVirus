<p id="Par21">STGG specimens were tested from a total of 532 patients (13 not resident in the BHDSS) with an average of 48 (range 42–58) per month from February through December 2015. One or more viruses were detected in 303/519 patients (58.3%) with 14 cases (5%) of co-infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). RSV-A was detected in 237/519 (45.9%) patients, and constituted the predominant virus in the dry season months February through June as well as during the rainy season July through October (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). RSV-B was uncommon, detected in only seven patients. PIV-1 was detected in only one patient, while PIV-3 was detected in 16 (one with RSV-A co-infection) mainly in the first half of the year and PIV-4 was detected in 16 (three as a co-infection with RSV-A) primarily in the second half of the year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A small number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases (n = 5) were detected early in the year with A(H3N2) appearing later in the year (n = 15). B/Yamagata infections (n = 19) began when A(H1N1)pdm09 infections started to drop and peaked at the same time as A(H3N2) viruses in the rainy season months of September and October (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In general, OP swabs had higher Ct values than NP swabs indicative of a difference in viral load (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Detection of RSV was greater in NP versus OP specimens.
