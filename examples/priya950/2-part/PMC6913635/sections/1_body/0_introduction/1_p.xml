<p>In Europe, there are three human pathogenic viruses transmitted from birds, by mosquitoes, to humans: West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) (Flaviviridae) and Sindbis virus (SINV) (Togaviridae). The transmission of all the three viruses is dependent on mosquitoes from the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic>. The distribution and importance of Flaviviruses is increasing in Europe, with both WNV and USUV detected from mosquitoes and birds as far north as Germany [
 <xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>], and with human and equid WNV cases as far north as the Czech Republic and Germany [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. USUV was also recently detected in birds in Belgium and in one dead Blackbird in southern Sweden [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. A key question is: how far north is there a risk of Flavivirus transmission to humans?
