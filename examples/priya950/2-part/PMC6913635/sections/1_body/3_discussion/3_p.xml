<p>The use of CDC light traps is not ideal for collecting these 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species. We have previously shown that these traps pose a bias towards catching 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> over 
 <italic>Cx. torrentium</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Thus, the absence of SINV in this study could be due to the low number of 
 <italic>Cx. torrentium</italic> sampled. However, the infection rate of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> in endemic areas can reach 8 infected mosquitoes in 1000 individuals [
 <xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>], which should have been detected in the collections of over 7000 mosquitoes in this study. Future investigations on the impact of individual vector species abundance on virus transmission should ideally include sampling over a latitudinal gradient using unbiased traps, such as CDC-gravid traps, in combination with virus detection as well as seroprevalence data in the human and avian population.
