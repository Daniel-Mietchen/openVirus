<p>The number of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens/torrentium</italic> collected in 2007 was extraordinary high for Sweden. However, despite the large sample size, no flaviviruses or SINV were detected. During the years studied, 2006â€“2008, transmission of WNV was still mainly reported from the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, such as France and Romania [
 <xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>], while USUV was transmitted in a few central European countries such as Austria and Hungary [
 <xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Since then, the reports of both WNV and USUV have increased, indicating a spread of the viruses. However, seroconversion of sentinel chickens to both WNV and USUV was detected on the British Isles already in 2004 [
 <xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>], so it is possible that both viruses were circulating in larger areas of Europe than detected at the time. Our results indicate that no flaviviruses were circulating in southern Sweden during these years.
