<p>In this study, mosquitoes were sampled in rural and suburban surroundings of the city of Kristianstad in southern Sweden (56,0387; 14,14,380), where the probability of Flavivirus introduction from the south would be the highest and where SINV have never been reported to cause disease. Sampling was performed every second week from mid-July to mid-September in 2006, 2007 and 2008, using Centers of Disease Control miniature light traps (CDC-traps) baited with carbon dioxide. A cold chain using dry ice was maintained from the time of emptying the traps until storage at −80 degrees Celsius. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified on a chill-table using a stereomicroscope and keys by Becker et al. [

 <italic>Cx. pipiens/torrentium</italic> were sorted out, and 1–50 mosquitoes were pooled and used for RNA extraction using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracted RNA was then screened for Flaviviruses by a pan-flavi RTqPCR using the QuantiTect® SYBR® Green RT-PCR kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The primers used were Flavi all S (5′-TACAACATGATGGGGAARAGAGARAA-3′), Flavi all S2 (5′-TACAACATGATGGGMAAACGYGARAA-3′) and Flavi all AS4 (5′-GTGTCCCAGCCNGCKGTRTCRTC-3′), designed by Patel et al. [

In addition, all samples were screened for SINV by a SINV specific RTqPCR using the Power SYBR™ Green RNA-to-CT™ 1-Step Kit (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) [
