<p>To gain more information about the phylogenetic relatedness of the sequenced viruses in this study, sequences from GISAID platform were retrieved and compared. The HA gene of A/swine/Nigeria/12VIR4047/2011 and the other Nigeria swine isolates are closely related to A/Nigeria/4280/2011, A/Ghana/601/2011 and A/Cameroon/EID/07/11/1870/2011 deposited in GISAID, all of which are human isolates of influenza H1N1pdm09 virus clustering together in the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref rid="F0001a">Figure 1</xref>). However, nucleotide alignment of the HA gene of the swine viruses from Nigeria differed by thirteen nucleotides and three amino acid substitutions at position N138S, Q240R (H1 numbering) and I312V compared to earlier H1N1pdm09 isolates from humans in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and the prototype A/California/07/2009(H1N1) (
