<p>Sequence analysis of the NA gene relative to A/California/07/2009 also revealed amino acid substitutions at positions V106I, N248D, Y351F, S439G. S439G substitution in the amino acid is also unique to A/Swine/Nigeria/VIR44-09/2009. All other reference viruses has S in this position. The PB2 protein of Nigerian isolate of H1N1pdm09 had D527G amino acid substitution, for PB1 G replaced K in position 736, for NS gene amino acid substitutions between A/Swine/Nigeria and prototype A/California include G28V, W103C, Q109K, I111M, I123V, W187E, G189D, V234M, S246N. The PA gene also had four substitutions presented in 
 <xref rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Most of these mutations are silent without a yet to be described significance. There were no observed substitutions in the matrix gene except S31N that has been described for most influenza A/H1N1pdm09 isolates as the predominant amantadine-resistant mutation in M2.
