<p>The observed transmission and circulation of influenza H1N1pdm09 from humans to pigs resulted in the emergence of a virus with few amino acid substitutions in the animal host. These substitutions include the 240 position (H1 numbering) of H1N1pdm09 HA which is occupied by either amino acid glutamine (Q) in 95% of cases including in H1, H2 and H3 or arginine (R) in only about 5% of cases (Matrosovich 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 2000). Most H1N1pdm09 influenza virus circulating globally including those detected in human host in Nigeria have Q in position 240 (Q226 -H3 numbering) [
 <xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. This is subsituted by arginine (R) in the swine isolates from Nigeria. This mutation may also have been selected as a result of replication in embryonated egg as suggested by [
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>] where human viruses in chicken-embryonated eggs resulted in selection of variants with amino acid substitutions near the HA receptor-binding sites.
