<p>This first and till date only report of complete genome sequencing of H1N1pdm09 virus in Nigeria represent the first full data in the GenBank from Africa and provides baseline genomic data on swine influenza virus circulating in pigs in Nigeria and probably the rest of West African agro-ecological zone as later reported in Kenya, Togo, Uganda and further detection in Nigeria and Ghana [
 <xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. This likely reverse zoonoses also revealed the epidemiological intricacies in the circulation and transmission of influenza virus at the human-animal interface whereas infectious pathogens can readily cross interspecies barrier and are transmitted from human to animals with potentials for re-transmission from animals to human. It is, however, important to note that Nigerian health-care workers and the general public have limited knowledge of the risk of transmission of influenza virus from animals to human and from human to animals [
