<p>Complete genome sequencing of all eight gene segments of three viral isolates and partial sequences for 12 RT-PCR positive samples was carried out by Sanger method using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 (3130x Genetic Analyser, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). (not all isolates obtained in Nigeria were re-isolated at the OIE Reference laboratory in Padova, Italy due to sample deterioration at storage and transportation). Cycle condition for sequence reaction was set at: 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 4 min for 25 cycles. This was followed by gel filtration clean up of sequenced products using Column AutoSeq G-50 before analysis in 16 capillary Sequence Analyser (3130x Genetic Analyser, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Subsequently, sequence assembly and editing were performed using Seqscape version 2.5 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene sequences were thereafter compared with corresponding genes of other influenza virus strains obtained from GenBank and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). These include human influenza sequences from Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon, viz.: A/Nigeria/4280/2011, A/Ghana/601/2011 and A/Cameroon/EID/07/11/1870/2011.</p>
