<p>To infer the evolutionary relationship for each gene segment, we employed maximum likelihood (ML) methods available through the PhyML program, incorporating a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites and a heuristic SPR branch-swapping search Parameter values for the GTR substitution matrix, base composition, gamma distribution of the rate variation among sites (with four rate categories) and proportion of invariant sites (I) were estimated directly from the data using MEGA 7. A bootstrap resampling process (1,000 replications) using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and incorporating the ML substitution model defined above, was employed to assess the robustness of individual nodes of the phylogeny [
 <xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Nucleotides and amino acid substitutions of influenza H1N1pdm09 isolates from Nigeria were compared with prototype A/California/07/2009(H1N1) and phylogenetic trees were constructed for all the genes to assess genomic clusters and relationships. Though three isolates were used to construct the phylogenetic trees, some of the genes only had two clearly resolved sequences used to construct the tree for such gene.
