<p>Pigs are mixing vessels of influenza viruses and known reservoirs of virus genes capable of causing emergence of novel influenza virus strains with potential adverse economic and public health consequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Although the pandemic H1N1pdm09 influenza virus was first reported in human in Mexico in 2009 [
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>], genetic evidence suggests that it may have circulated undetected for several years in pigs prior to its recognized spillover transmission into the human population [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. Surveillance for swine influenza in animals have also shown that the human pandemic virus was transmitted to pigs in Canada and USA [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. It has also been observed that the H1N1pdm09 virus evolves more rapidly in pigs than in humans [
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Although millions of pigs are reared in close proximity to humans in urban and peri-urban settings in Nigeria, there is a dearth of epidemiologic and genomic data on swine influenza viruses in the country and in sub-Saharan Africa [
