<p>The pandemic H1N1pdm09 has been shown to be a product of gene reassortment of avian, swine and human influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The ecological and biological elements that engendered such a reassortment events are favoured by intensive livestock farming practices and intermingling at the human-animal interface in urban and peri-urban settings. Practices where pigs are reared in large numbers in enclosures with frequent contacts with human handlers (farmers, farm attendants, traders and butchers) predispose to inter and intra-species transmission and exchange of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface thus favouring the emergence of novel strains. Such emerging strains may possess markers of molecular changes in the influenza virus genome that may be important for transmission and pathogenicity of the virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]The ecology, transmission and molecular epidemiology of pandemic H1N1pdm09 in sub-Saharan Africa are yet to be fully understood [2:6]. To improve our comprehension of the genomic and epidemiologic dynamics of pandemic swine-origin H1N1pdm09 isolates from Nigeria, we carried out a complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic study of isolates of swine influenza virus obtained from embryonated egg culture of samples collected from pigs with respiratory signs in a peri-urban piggery in Lagos State, Nigeria.
