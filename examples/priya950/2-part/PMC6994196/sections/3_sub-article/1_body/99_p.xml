<p>4. Fig. 7 â€“ How many human placental donors were tested? How many tissue explants were tested per donor per time point? Is the data in this figure a compilation of replication from different donors or a single donor? What is the counterstain for the IHC? In c and d, are these tissue explants the cross section of a single villus? Please clarify what it is that the reader is looking at. In such a small piece of tissue, how confident are you of the cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without a specific cell marker? Addition of arrows to indicate the different cell types would be helpful. Is there any background IHC staining in uninfected human placental explants? Control staining images would be helpful. </p>
