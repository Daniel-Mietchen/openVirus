<p>Reviewer #1: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus of the order Bunyavirales that causes severe disease in ruminants and humans. Surprisingly, pathology resulting in abortion remains poorly described. In the present work, pregnant ewes were inoculated intravenously with a highly virulent strain of RVFV and necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Tissues were collected and analyzed by real-time qPCR, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. Results reveal that maternal epithelial cells are the first placental cells to be infected, followed by fetal trophoblasts. In addition, RVFV can bypass the maternal epithelial cell layer by directly targeting fetal trophoblasts in the hemophagous zone, a region of the ovine placenta where maternal blood is in direct contact with fetal cells. Abortion was associated with widespread necrosis of placental tissues and severe hemorrhage. Experiments with human placental explants revealed efficient infection and replication in both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts. Results demonstrate that RVFV targets the fetal-maternal interface in both ovine and human placentas. The virus crossed the ovine placental barrier via two distinct routes, ultimately resulting in placental and fetal demise followed by abortion. Finding show that the same RVFV strain replicates efficiently in human trophoblasts and underscores the risk of RVFV infection during human pregnancy.</p>
