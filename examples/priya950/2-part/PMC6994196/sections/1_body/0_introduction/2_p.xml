<p>Humans can be infected via mosquito bite, although most human cases are attributed to contact with contaminated animal tissues, particularly during the slaughtering of diseased animals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The disease in humans generally follows a transient, febrile course with severe headache and muscle pains. Infection of the eye may induce temporal or permanent loss of vision resulting from retinal damage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a minority of patients, the infection progresses to encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever, of which the latter is often fatal [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notably, experiments with second-trimester human foetal tissue explants recently revealed that human syncytiotrophoblasts are susceptible and permissive to RVFV replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These reports warrant further studies to determine if RVFV infections pose a perhaps underestimated risk for human pregnancy.
