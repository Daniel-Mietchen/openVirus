<p>The detrimental consequences of RVFV infection during ovine pregnancy were already reported after the first outbreak of RVF in 1930 and abortion storms have since then become a hallmark of RVF epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of RVFV-induced abortion in pregnant ewes was not yet described in literature. In the present study, we experimentally infected pregnant ewes at one third- or at mid-gestation and describe the pathogenic events that result in abortion of the ovine foetus. We furthermore investigated the susceptibility of human placental explants for the same RVFV strain.
