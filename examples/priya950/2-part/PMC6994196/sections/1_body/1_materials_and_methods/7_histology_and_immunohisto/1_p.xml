<p>Paraffin embedded tissue was cut into 4 μm sections, collected on silane-coated glass slides and dried for at least 48 h in a 37°C incubator. After deparaffinization and rehydration in graded alcohols, sections were stained routinely with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or immunostained for RVFV antigen. For immunostaining, endogenous peroxidase was blocked for 30 min in methanol/H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> followed by antigen retrieval through 15 min autoclaving at 121°C in pH 6 citrate buffer (Antigen unmasking solution, Vector Laboratories ). As RVFV Gn-specific primary antibody, monoclonal antibody 4-D4 was used. Specificity of the immunostaining was confirmed with 2 other mAbs directed against different proteins of RVFV. Mouse envision peroxidase (Dako, Denmark) was used as secondary antibody and diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako, Denmark) as the substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunostaining for cytokeratin was performed using a rabbit mAb to cytokeratin 19 (Abcam 52625, USA) followed by α-rabbit-ImmPRESS-AP and Vector Red as substrate (Vector Laboratories, USA). Hematoxylin was used to counterstain the slides.
