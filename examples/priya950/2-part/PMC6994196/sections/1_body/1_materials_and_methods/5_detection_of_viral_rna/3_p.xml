<p>Five μl of the RNA was used in a RT-qPCR using the The LightCycler RNA Amplification Kit HybProbe (Roche, Almere, the Netherlands). Primers and probes were purchased from IDT. Forward primer: 5’-AAAGGAACAATGGACTCTGGTCA-3’, reverse primer: 5’-CACTTCTTACTACCATGTCCTCCAAT-3’; Probe: 5’-6FAM-AAAGCTTTGATATCTCTCAGTGCCCCAA-TMR-3’. Cycling conditions were as follows: 45°C for 30 min, 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 35 s at 57°C, followed by cooling down to 30°C.</p>
