<p>Full term placentas were obtained by caesarean section from healthy donors at the Isala hospital in Zwolle, the Netherlands. The placentas were transported on ice and placed in large petridishes with complete medium (40% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM], 40% F12 nutrient mixture, 10% FCS supplemented with 1% a/a). Chorionic villi were separated from the placenta and cut in 4x4 mm pieces, after which the samples were washed 3x with PBS + a/a. Placental explants were incubated with 2,5x10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of RVFV in 1 ml complete medium, or in 1 ml complete medium (negative controls) in a 24-wells plate. Medium was removed 16 hpi, after which explants were washed 3x with PBS + a/a. Samples were collected at 1, 2 or 4 days post inoculation (dpi). Samples for quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) were stored at -80°C. For virus isolation, 200 μl supernatant samples from each timepoint were pooled. For IHC, explants were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 48 h followed by routine processing in paraffin blocks. Each sample was analysed in quadruplicate. The 1 dpi timepoint was taken at 16 hpi after washing the explants. At 3 dpi, 1 ml of fresh medium was added to the 4 dpi samples.
