<p>To study if RVFV strain 35/74, which was originally isolated from sheep, replicates in human placentas, explants of human term placentas were inoculated with the virus. The results show that the virus replicates efficiently in cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g007">Fig 7</xref>), as revealed by RT-qPCR, virus isolation and IHC. In some areas of the placenta, viral antigen was detected in cytotrophoblasts but appeared to be absent in syncytiotrophoblasts, suggesting that the former are more permissive to RVFV replication (
