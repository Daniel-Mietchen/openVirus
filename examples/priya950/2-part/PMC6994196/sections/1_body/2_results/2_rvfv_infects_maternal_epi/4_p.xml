<p>At 6 dpi, extensive haemorrhages were observed in the placentomes of the RVFV infected ewes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007898.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, in some placentomes maternal and foetal villi were starting to separate. Both maternal epithelial cells (viable and necrotic) and foetal trophoblasts were strongly positive for RVFV antigen throughout the entire placentome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Compared to the placentomes at 4 dpi, the area of RVFV positive maternal epithelial cells and foetal trophoblasts was greatly increased covering almost the entire maternal and foetal epithelial lining of the placentome including the haemophagous zone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). H&amp;E staining revealed haemorrhages in the maternal villi with extensive necrosis of the maternal epithelium but only limited areas of necrosis of foetal trophoblasts (
