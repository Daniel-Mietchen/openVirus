<p>Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of RVFV antigen as small foci spread throughout the placentomes collected at 4 dpi in experiments 1 and 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These foci consisted of a cluster of strongly stained epithelial/syncytial cells of the maternal villus with occasionally a single positive trophoblast in the epithelial lining of the opposite foetal villus (
