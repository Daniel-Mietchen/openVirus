<p>Our study has revealed that RVFV uses at least two routes to cross the ovine placenta. The first route involves the haemophagous zones of the placenta, where foetal trophoblasts are in direct contact with maternal blood. Trophoblast cells in the haemophagous zone are specialised in phagocytosis of erythrocytes from the blood to provide the foetus with iron. The presence of RVFV in maternal pools of blood in the haemophagous zone may therefore result in direct infection of trophoblasts or via co-uptake of the virus during erythrophagy. The second route initiates with infection of maternal epithelial cells of the placenta. Virus released from these cells exposes foetal trophoblasts. Progeny virus produced by infected trophoblasts is subsequently released into the foetal mesenchyme exposing endothelial cells of foetal bloodvessels, which were also identified as target cells of RVFV.</p>
