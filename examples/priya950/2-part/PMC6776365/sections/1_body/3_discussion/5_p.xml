<p>Some limitations in our study should be mentioned. First, rodent population density was extremely low in the springs of 1998 and 1999, which reduced the overall explanatory ability of our model. Second, prevalence of SEOV infection in Norway rats was assessed by mathematical model due to lack of available data. Third, to ameliorate the influence of vaccination campaign and other interventions, only the selected time range of data was used to detect the relationship between intrinsic/extrinsic drivers and SEOV transmission. Further efforts should be made to improve model reliability through efforts such as addition of data to the available dataset. More attention should be paid to the association between economic development, such as infrastructure improvement, the spatial distribution of Norway rat, and induced SEOV infections across districts in subsequent studies.</p>
