<p>Hantaviruses carried by species of wild rodents, such as HTNV and PUUV, have been extensively studied, but SEOV is vectored by the Norway rat, a domestic rodent that is found in urban environments and is associated with humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. SEOV infections, have milder symptoms and lower fatality rates (1–2% vs. 5–10%) than HTNV infections, so less attention is focused on SEOV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Besides, SEOV infections have a higher asymptomatic infection rate of 8–20%, compared with HTNV at 1–4% [
