<p>Wavelet analysis is widely used in ecology and epidemiology studies to explore the variety in the periodicity of a time series through its decomposition properties [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was performed to test the statistical significance of the results. In the significance test, 1000 surrogate datasets were simulated by bootstrapping to test the null hypothesis, where a
