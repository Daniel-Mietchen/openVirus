<p>Here, 1 month is used as the time interval in the time-discrete model; 
 <italic>b</italic> represents an array consisting of 12 values, representing the reproduction rates of the rodent population over 12 months. As Norway rat breeds throughout the year in the regions studied [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], all of the reproduction rates were set at &gt;0. 
 <italic>m</italic> denotes the natural mortality of the Norway rat population, whose mean life span is generally not more than 1 year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. 
 <italic>K</italic> represents the environmental carrying capacity and is used to model the environmental pressure from intraspecific competition for food availability or other resources. For identifying the extrinsic effect on Norway rat population fluctuation, we constructed 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub> to reflect the potential climate effect. Based on the results of the correlation analyses and CCM, minimum temperature and absolute humidity were potential drivers for rodent population dynamics. We constructed equation

 <italic>δ</italic>
