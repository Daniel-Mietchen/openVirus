<p id="Par20">Let us consider the annual changes among the viruses of livestock (swine H1: Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4B</xref>; chicken H5: Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4C</xref>). Many variations were present coincidently in any given year, especially in recent years, when the sequences became available from various areas. Such a variety may hide the effects of drifts from higher axes of the PCA. In fact, the PC values formed horizontal rows in the plots. However, the variations detected in an area did not change much, even in lower PC axes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4B,C</xref>). The small changes may result from differences in the districts that were surveyed in specific years, rather than from those caused by drifts. Moreover, strains that may be transmitted from humans to swine were detected several years after the human epidemics; this may have occurred if the strains were kept unchanged among swine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). These observations suggest that livestock viruses are rather conserved. Each district may keep its own set of a virus library and we may be observing only a limited portion of the variation. The conserved character of these viruses suggests the presence of a weaker selective pressure for newer epitopes. The variety suggests an absence of competition among viruses; i.e., they might have a limited ability to migrate.
