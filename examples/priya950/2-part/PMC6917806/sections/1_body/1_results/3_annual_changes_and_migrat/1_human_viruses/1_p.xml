<p id="Par14">Let us consider the annual changes of the group R in humans (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A–C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4A</xref>). In any given year, only a few variations of the H1 subtypes were found. They were changed slightly by drifting and were detected in another area in the subsequent year (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). As the lives of humans span several decades, they might be immune to viruses that appeared in the past. This may represent a selective pressure to viruses. Moreover, humans may travel to other countries by air while carrying viruses. Hence, the viruses spread worldwide, unifying the outbreaking strains. Although changes in one to several residues may be sufficient to escape specific antibody defenses

 </sup>, humans have various antibodies that target different epitopes. The drifts that occur within a year would be insufficient for viral spread in the same district; hence, H1 outbreaks occurring in two consecutive years were rare (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Thus, the areas that record an outbreak change yearly (Fig.
