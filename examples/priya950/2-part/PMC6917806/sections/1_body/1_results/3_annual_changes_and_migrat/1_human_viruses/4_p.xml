<p id="Par17">In addition to the annual continuous drifts, several leaps were also observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, arrows between different colours). For example, variants coloured in blue started in 1985, kept drifting, and were recorded through to 2001, going around the world several times. Those coloured in black were found in 1995 and were recorded through to 2007. Those in grey did not change in PC1, but they went back toward the PC2 axis (other directions also appeared in lower PCs, with contributions from positions that changed several times; Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4A</xref>). The leaps would refresh the character of the epitopes; e.g., the black leap might allow the parallel evolution of the blue and black variants detected in PC4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The leaps seemed to occur during the years in which the viruses were not detected in the areas that reported the surveillance viral counts and sequences (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).
