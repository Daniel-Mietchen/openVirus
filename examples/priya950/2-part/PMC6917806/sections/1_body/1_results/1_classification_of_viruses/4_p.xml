<p id="Par8">The tendency to segregate into the three groups was also observed for the other genome segments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>); the R, M, and U groups appeared from the top, clockwise. The groups that include the segments of the two pandemic viruses, Russia 1977 and Mexico 2009, are termed R and M, respectively, with U being the remaining group. As the distances among the groups are similar in all segments, they were placed similarly on the plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Variations in the rotation angle of the triangle were caused by differences in the number of samples among the groups. Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> includes several very old strains: the 1918 and 1943 human pandemic strains (green) and the 1930 swine strains (grey); they showed a tendency to be located closer to the origin of the plot. The magnitudes of PCs were similar among the segments, showing that the groups were separated by similar distances. This suggests a constant mutation rate among the segments, which might be branched from the ancestral strain coincidentally as a new set of viruses. The complete separations observed negate the possibility of homologous recombination between viruses, which would yield some intermediates among the groups. Those of the 1930 swine strain may be an exception among the intermediates, which will be discussed below.
