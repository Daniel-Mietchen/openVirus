<p id="Par10">It should be noted that avian viruses showed lower PC values and appeared around the centre of the PCA, while swine and human viruses exhibited extreme values (Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Thus, avian viruses had sequences that were similar to the average among samples at amino acids that were characteristic to the three groups of human and swine viruses: R, M, and U. Avian samples also showed characteristic motifs at other positions, which may appear in lower PCs.
