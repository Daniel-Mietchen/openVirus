<p id="Par5">Let us consider the varieties of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, which is encoded in an RNA segment, the product of which is the major antigen that appears on the surface of viruses. The method presented here divided the types of viruses into three large groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). As the differences among the samples were large, to ease the alignment, amino acid sequences were analysed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In panel A, the distances among the types were ≥0.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1A</xref>); this value shows the average rate of the difference at any residue between pairs of sequences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. The sPC values are the projections of those distances on the PC axes, which concentrate at certain sets of residues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B</xref>). Each axis contributes to some part of the differences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1C</xref>). Viruses were classified based on antigenic differences of other segments; however, the segregation showed likely differences in HA as well. The viruses differed by several indels; in particular, types C and D had extra domains that conferred different activities. Moreover, type A class viruses were further segregated into three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and the clusters were further classified into lower PCs, showing the characteristics of the subtypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Table of PC for samples).
