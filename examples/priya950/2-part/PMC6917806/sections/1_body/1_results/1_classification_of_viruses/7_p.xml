 </sup>. However, the triple-reassortant group was absorbed into the two groups, U and M, and the sorting differed among segments in the strains presented here (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, blue, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The frequency of shifts detected was another of the differences detected; i.e., only a few shifts were estimated
