<p id="Par13">From 1977 to 2009, many residues in the type R viruses changed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>, asterisks). They are mainly located on the surface of the protein, where they may form epitopes. Therefore, the changes that occurred at those positions would be beneficial for escaping the immune system of humans. Conversely, we identified characteristic residues of the R, M, and U groups, which were indicated by the hexagonal directions of PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1E</xref>, green). They exhibited higher scores because they appeared unchanged in only one of the groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>). These residues might play important roles in the function of the respective protein.
