<p id="Par26">The leaps of drifting observed here (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) may not denote punctuated evolution; rather, they may be the result of accumulating mutations that occurred in areas that do not report sequences. For instance, very few records are available from the African continent. The history of the R type also included some bifurcations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,C</xref>); i.e., viruses located on different branches appeared in different districts in parallel. If these viruses competed within a small area, only the strain with the highest infectivity would remain. If some drifts occurred coincidently in areas located far apart, such branching might have occurred and might have been maintained for a while.
