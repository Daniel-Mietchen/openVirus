<p id="Par31">It should be noted that assortment of the M segments was insufficient to produce the pdm09 virus. Although the reassortant virus was repeatedly detected in human samples, it was transmitted from swine and did not spread among humans. The segments showed PCs located nearer the average compared with pdm09 (Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). If a human-to-human transition requires the specific characteristics of a virus, those characteristics should be detected in some of the PCs when enough samples are included in the calculation and the extreme values observed in PC1 and PC2 may reflect such characteristics. The archiving of the characteristics requires further shifts in all the segments of the assorted M virus.
