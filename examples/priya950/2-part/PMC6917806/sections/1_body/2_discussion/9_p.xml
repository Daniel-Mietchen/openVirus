<p id="Par32">The origin of M type polymerases in the reassortant and pdm09 viruses may not be the result of a direct shift from avian viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Instead, they might be maintained among swine and may have drifted away from the avian type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The same would be true for the R type segments. Although most of the sequencing data were obtained from humans, the R type may have been overlooked among swine. If these viruses do not cause severe symptoms, they may not attract the attention of farmers or researchers. In fact, focused approaches detected the R type in swine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Such endemic R types may show lower values in PC closer to the origin; e.g., those found in England and Dötlingen in 2005 might satisfy this condition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>; HA), and other segments also exhibited such endemic candidates.
