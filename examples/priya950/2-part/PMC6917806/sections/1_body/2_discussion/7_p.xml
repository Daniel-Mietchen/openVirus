 </sup>. The American classic virus and the reassortant virus could be defined using the segments (R, R, R, M, M, U, U, M) and (M, M, M, M, M, U, U, M) from segments 1 to 8, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Replacing the U groups of NA and MP with those of the European type (U, U, U, U, U, M, M, U) can complete all M segments of pdm09. Such shifts may occur occasionally (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
