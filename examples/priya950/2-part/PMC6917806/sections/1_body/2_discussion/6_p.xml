<p id="Par29">We should be aware of the risk of keeping groups of swine that have different influenza strains in adjacent farms because new viruses may be produced by genome shifting. To prevent this, the segregation of imported swine from domestic ones is critical. Districts that report several viral types should prevent farm-to-farm contamination. Moreover, the exchange of genomes between human and swine viruses may give rise to a new strain with new sets of surface proteins that is able to infect humans. The Switzerland virus (NCBI taxonomy ID: 940568) proved that the group U strain is also capable of infecting humans; therefore, a new pandemic may occur in the case of an outbreak of this type of virus. Such viruses of human origin are maintained among swine, maybe latently (Fig.Â
