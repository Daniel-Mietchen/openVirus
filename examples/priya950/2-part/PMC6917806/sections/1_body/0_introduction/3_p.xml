 </sup>. In particular, they are inappropriate for studying the evolution of human influenza viruses, because they are polyphyletic. They not only change annually but are transferred from other species or emerge from unsuspected regions and can then spread worldwide. Therefore, sometimes they change drastically; here I express the phenomenon as a leap, for avoidance of confusion with a shift, which shows re-assortment of genomes. Such a leap is against the assumptions of tree-shaped models.
