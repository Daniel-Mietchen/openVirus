<p>Both ZIKV and WNV exerted CPEs in hiPSCs, NSCs and neurons, leading to massive cell death, due in part to apoptosis mediated by activation of caspase-3, in agreement with previous reports [

 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. At variance, DENV-2 infection had milder CPEs on NSCs and did not induce cell apoptosis, confirming results in literature [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cell viability assays demonstrated that WNV induced massive cell death with complete cell loss at 96 hpi, while only 10% reduction of NSC viability was observed after ZIKV infection. These findings suggest that ZIKV replication is slower and the virus can persist for a longer time in infected cells.
