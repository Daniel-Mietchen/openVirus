<p>In agreement with the accumulating evidences reporting infection of NSCs by ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], this study confirmed the permissiveness of hiPSCs-derived NSCs to productive ZIKV infection. Immature neurons and hiPSCs also supported ZIKV replication, although at lower efficiency. These data are in contrast to a previous study showing that infection of undifferentiated hiPSCs and immature neurons was inefficient [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Different observations were reported in other studies that demonstrated permissiveness of developing immature neurons to ZIKV infection as well as relative resistance of mature neurons in adult human brains [
