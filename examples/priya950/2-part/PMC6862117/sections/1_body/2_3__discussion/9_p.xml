<p>The literature reports absent or low levels of innate immune response against viral infection in mESCs [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], hESCs [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and also in hiPSCs [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which are characterized by intrinsic high level expression of a set of genes with antiviral activity which confer resistance to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At variance, our data demonstrate that hiPSCs infected by flaviviruses were able to activate an innate antiviral response characterized by upregulation of 
 <italic>MDA5</italic>, 
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>, 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic>, and other ISGs. Therefore, innate immunity represents an uncharacterized property of pluripotent stem cells that requires further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms.
