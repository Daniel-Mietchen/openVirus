<p>Recent reports demonstrated that ZIKV directly infects NSCs of the fetus and impairs growth in mice [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. ZIKV has a negative impact on neurogenesis either by abrogating it completely or by disrupting neural cell organization [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To further investigate if ZIKV could impair the formation of neural precursors and neurons, the effect of viral infection during the neural differentiation process, which is critical for brain development, was analyzed. Our experiments showed that ZIKV infected and replicated in hiPSCs during their differentiation into NSCs, inducing CPE and cell death, but it did not affect the differentiation process, as demonstrated by the maintenance of the NSC marker Pax6 at the end of the neural induction phase. Likewise, in NSCs infected prior to their differentiation into neurons, ZIKV did not block neuronal development, as confirmed by the expression of the neuron marker Î²-tubulin during neurogenesis. In these cells, ZIKV induced massive cell death that increased with time, leading to a complete disruption of cell monolayer, so the neurogenesis process could not be completed. Similar findings were reported with human NSCs growing as neurospheres and brain organoids [

Since hiPSCs and NSCs do not present organization features typical of 3D structures, we used EBs to investigate the effect of ZIKV infection during embryogenesis. Cells forming EBs exhibit heterogeneous patterns of differentiated cell types from the three germ lineages and are able to respond to similar cues that direct embryonic development [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, this 3D structure enables differentiation and morphogenesis yielding micro-tissues similar to native tissue structures. ZIKV infected EBs leading to a reduction in their volume and number. Consequently, the surviving EBs were not able to fully attach to the substrate and died. These data suggest that ZIKV induces cell death and abrogates cell differentiation and EBs formation, which can explain the impairment of embryo development observed after ZIKV infection in vivo.
