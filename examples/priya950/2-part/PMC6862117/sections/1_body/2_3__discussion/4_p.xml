<p>DENV-2 and WNV also infected NSCs, hiPSCs, and neurons. DENV-2 infected hNSCs but at lower rate than ZIKV, in agreement with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At variance, WNV infected and replicated in all cell types with significantly higher efficiency than ZIKV and DENV-2. Notably, WNV was able to infect hiPSCs and immature neurons, although at lower rate than NSCs. Studies in the literature report resistance of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and hiPSCs to WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and increase of permissiveness to viral infection as cells progress towards neural differentiation [

 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The high resistance of stem cells, including hiPSCs, to viral infection was ascribed to the intrinsic expression of a set of ISGs with antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Likewise, differential expression of innate immune programs in neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex confer differential susceptibility to WNV infection and other neurotropic viruses [
