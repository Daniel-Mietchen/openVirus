<p>In this study, we investigated expression of a set of genes involved in antiviral innate immunity and showed that ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 infection induced a similar pattern of antiviral response in NSCs, neurons and hiPSCs, characterized by a marked upregulation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and the IFN-induced factors with antiviral activity IFIT1 and IFIT2. The highest expression levels of the antiviral genes were observed in cells infected by WNV, while ZIKV and DENV infections had milder effects on host innate antiviral response. These differences could be ascribed to the higher burden of WNV-infected cells due to higher infection and replication efficiency of the virus but also to the extent of viral inhibition of host innate immune response.</p>
