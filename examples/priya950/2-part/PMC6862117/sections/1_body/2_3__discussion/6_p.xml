<p>Regarding the investigation of the innate antiviral response during ZIKV infection, studies based on different cell types and viral strains led to different observations. In primary human skin fibroblasts, ZIKV Asian lineage induced the upregulation of three important PRRs known to be activated by viral dsRNA, specifically TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5, and, also, other factors involved in downstream pathways, such as IRF7, IFNα, IFNβ, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) [
