<p>Neural induction of hiPSCs was performed using Gibco PSC Neural Induction medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing neurobasal medium and neural induction supplement 50×. Neural induction medium was changed every other day from day 0 to day 7 of neural induction. From day 7, primitive NSCs were maintained in NSCs expansion medium containing 50% neurobasal medium, 50% Advanced DMEM/F12 and neural induction supplement 50×, which was changed every other day.</p>
