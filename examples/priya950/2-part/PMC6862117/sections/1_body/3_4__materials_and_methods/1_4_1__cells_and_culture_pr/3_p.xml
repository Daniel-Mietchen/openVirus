<p>Expanded NSCs were differentiated into immature neurons. NSCs were seeded onto polyornithine- (20 µg/mL) and laminin- (10 µg/mL) (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) coated culture dishes in NSCs medium. The next day, NSCs medium was replaced with neural differentiation medium consisting of Neurobasal medium, 2% B-27 Supplement, GlutaMAX 100× 2mM and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific). The culture medium was changed every 3–4 days.</p>
