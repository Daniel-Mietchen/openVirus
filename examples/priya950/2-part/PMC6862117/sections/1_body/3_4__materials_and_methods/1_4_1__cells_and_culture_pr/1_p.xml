<p>Human iPSCs were generated by reprogramming of erythroblasts from healthy donors using Sendai virus-based vectors, as reported [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Blood samples were collected from donors after they gave informed consent. The research involving human samples was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles and with the Review Board and Ethics Committee of Padova University Hospital. Briefly, for hiPSC reprogramming, PBMCs were separated from whole blood samples, expanded and differentiated for 10 days in EM medium to obtain the erythroblast population. Then, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were transduced with four Sendai virus vectors expressing the Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, respectively, at a MOI of 10. Clones derived from reprogramming were manually picked, expanded, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Human iPSC clones were grown on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF, Global Stem, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) feeder layer with hiPSCs medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12), 20% Knockout serum replacement (KSR), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1% GlutaMAX 100×, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1% of β-mercaptoethanol 1000× (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, ORF Genetic, Kópavogur, Iceland) 10 ng/mL; or onto feeder-free layer Geltrex substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with serum-free StemMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
