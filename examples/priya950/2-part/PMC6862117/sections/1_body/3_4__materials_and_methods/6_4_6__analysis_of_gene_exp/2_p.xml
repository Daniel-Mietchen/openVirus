<p>Expression of genes encoding key factors involved in antiviral innate immunity (i.e., 
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>, 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic>, 
 <italic>MDA5, RIG-I, TLR3, TLR7, IL-1β, IRF3, IRF7, Viperin, IFN-α</italic>, and 
 <italic>IFN-β</italic>) was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. Nucleic acids were purified from cells by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). qRT-PCR was run on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR results were normalized to GAPDH mRNA and analyzed using the ΔΔCt method.
