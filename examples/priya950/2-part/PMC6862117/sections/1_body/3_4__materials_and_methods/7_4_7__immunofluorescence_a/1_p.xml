<p>Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific), permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Then, cells were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 4% BSA. Primary antibodies specific for flavivirus E protein (1:500, Merck Millipore), PAX6 (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich), Nestin (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), β-Tubulin (1:1000, Abcam), MAP-2 (1:250, Abcam), OCT4 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SSEA3 and SSEA4 (1:50, Abcam), KLF4 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SOX2 (1:50, Merck Millipore) were used. All the antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following secondary antibodies, diluted 1:250, were used: anti-mouse IgG FITC (Chemicon international, USA); anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor-546 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or DRAQ5 fluorescent probe solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with 20× magnification or a confocal microscope (Leica) with 63x magnification.</p>
