<p>Cell survival was evaluated by MTT assay in mock and infected NSCs plated in 96 well tissue culture plates (8 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well). Upon viral infection with a MOI of 1, cell viability was analyzed at 72 h and 96 hpi. Freshly dissolved solution of MTT (5 mg/mL, AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, a solubilization solution (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.01 M HCl) was added and, after overnight incubation at 37 °C, absorbance was read at 620 nm.
