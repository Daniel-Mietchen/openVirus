<p>The following viral strains were used in experiments: ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (GenBank KJ776791), Asian lineage, clinical isolate from French Polynesia, 2013; WNV strain AUT/2008 (GenBank KF179640), lineage 2, goshwak isolate from Austria, 2008; DENV serotype 2 strain, clinical isolate. Viruses were grown on Vero cells to generate viral stocks at titer of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID50/mL (ZIKV), 1.7 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL (WNV), and 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID50/mL (DENV-2).
