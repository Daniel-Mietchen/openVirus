<p>The activity of Caspase 3 was measured at 72 hpi and 96 hpi in mock and infected NSCs plated in quadruplicate in 12 wells plates (7 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well). For each virus a MOI of 1 was adopted. Briefly, cells were detached from the well, fixed with 4% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), permeabilized in 90% methanol and stored at −20 °C overnight.
