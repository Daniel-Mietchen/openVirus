<p>In order to model ZIKV infection during neurogenesis, hiPSCs and NSCs were infected with ZIKV at MOI 0.1 and 1, followed by triggering the differentiation process into NSCs and neurons, respectively. Supernatants were harvested every 24 h until 7 days pi for viral titration by qRT-PCR and TCID50 assay. In hiPSCs infected prior to their differentiation into NSCs, ZIKV replicated efficiently and induced massive cell death. At 7 dpi, when the neural induction was almost completed, most cells were positive for ZIKV E protein. Cells also expressed PAX6, a marker of the early ectoderm, thus indicating that ZIKV infection did not impair the differentiation process (
