<p>Likewise, ZIKV replicated efficiently in NSCs infected prior to their differentiation into neurons. A progressive increase of ZIKV titer was measured in cell supernatant, followed by a decline due to massive cell death. Also in this case, ZIKV infection did not block the neural differentiation process, as shown by expression of the neuron-specific protein Î²-Tubulin in infected cells (
