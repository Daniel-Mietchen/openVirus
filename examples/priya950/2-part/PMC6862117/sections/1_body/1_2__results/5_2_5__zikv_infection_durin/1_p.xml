<p>Modeling of ZIKV infection during embryogenesis was performed by infection of hiPSCs with ZIKV MOI 1 during their differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs), i.e., micro-tissue similar to native tissue elements. Viral infection was monitored by collecting the supernatants of infected cells and analyzing viral RNA copy number by qRT-PCR at different time points pi. Viral RNA load increased with time, reached a peak at 5 dpi and then decreased in parallel with the decrease of the number of live cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05404-f010">Figure 10</xref>b, ZIKV infection of hiPSCs and subsequent random differentiation into EBs growing in suspension outlined a progressive reduction in the volume and number of the EBs that displayed jagged edges when compared to mock controls. When the adhesion stimuli were added, infected EBs were not able to fully attach to the gelatin-coated plastic. Surviving adherent infected cells started to die with subsequent detachment.
