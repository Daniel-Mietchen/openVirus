<p>Modulation of genes involved in innate antiviral immune response was analyzed by qRT-PCR on hiPSCs, NSCs, and neurons after infection with ZIKV (MOI 1), WNV (MOI 0.01), and DENV-2 (MOI 1) at 48 and 96 hpi. While no relevant changes in mRNA levels were apparent at 48 hpi, except 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic> mRNA, which was significantly higher in infected NSCs than in mock-infected control NSCs, induction of expression of most genes was significant at 96 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05404-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). In NSCs, but also in hiPSCs and neurons, all flaviviruses significantly up regulated the 
 <italic>MDA5</italic>, 
 <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>, and 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic> genes. WNV, although used at lower MOI than the other flaviviruses (since infection with MOI 1 led rapidly to complete cell death), induced in the highest levels of innate immune response gene transcripts, especially in NSCs, with a particularly strong stimulation of 
 <italic>IFNB1</italic> and the effector 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic>, a critical mediator involved in antiviral immunity.
