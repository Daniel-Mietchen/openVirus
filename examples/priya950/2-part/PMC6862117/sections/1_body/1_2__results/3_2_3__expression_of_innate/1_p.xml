<p>To investigate the innate antiviral response of cells to flavivirus infection, we measured by qRT-PCR the mRNA levels of a panel of genes, which represent key players in host restriction of flavivirus infection. The panel included genes encoding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activated by viral dsRNA, i.e., 
 <italic>TLR3, DDX58/RIG-I, IFIH1/MDA5</italic>, and by ssRNA (
 <italic>TLR7</italic>); genes encoding interferon (IFN) regulatory factors 3 (
 <italic>IRF3</italic>) and 7 (
 <italic>IRF7</italic>); interferon type I IFNα (
 <italic>IFNA1</italic>) and IFNβ (
 <italic>IFNB1</italic>); IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral activity, i.e., IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>) and 2 (
 <italic>IFIT2</italic>) and Viperin (
 <italic>RSAD2</italic>); the mediator of the inflammatory response IL-1β (
 <italic>IL1B</italic>). Intrinsic expression of innate antiviral immune response genes, analyzed in cells harvested at different time points after seeding, showed no significant differences, while some variability in mRNA expression levels was observed according to cell differentiation status (
