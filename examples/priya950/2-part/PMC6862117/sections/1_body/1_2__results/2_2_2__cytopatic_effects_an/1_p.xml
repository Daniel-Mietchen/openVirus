<p>ZIKV exerted a cytopathic effect (CPE) not only in NSCs, but also in hiPSCs and neurons infected at different MOIs. An aggressive CPE was observed also in WNV-infected cells, while no CPE was apparent in DENV-2-infected cells at 96 hpi, in agreement with the lower replication efficiency of this virus. Accordingly, measurement of cell viability by the MTT assay showed massive death of NSCs at 96 hpi with WNV, while no significant decrease in cell viability occurred following infection with ZIKV and DENV-2 (

A significant 3-fold and 6-fold increase of caspase-3 activity, a marker of cell apoptosis, was demonstrated in ZIKV- and WNV-infected NSCs, respectively, compared to mock-infected control NSCs at 96 hpi, while no significant changes in cell apoptosis were measured in DENV-2-infected NSCs (
