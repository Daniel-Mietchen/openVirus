<p>The different cellular tropism and ability to counteract host cell intrinsic immunity is conceivably one of the key factors that explains the diverse clinical presentation of infections caused by genetically related viruses. This is the case of neurological disease associated with flavivirus infection. In this part of the study, we evaluated and compared the infection and replication efficiency of flaviviruses in pluripotent stem cells and cells differentiated towards the neural lineage. Among flaviviruses, we chose WNV as representative of neurotropic viruses, DENV as representative of viruses associated with hemorrhagic fever, which may cause neurological complications in patients with severe shock syndrome, and ZIKV, which is unique among flaviviruses for its ability to infect the fetus during pregnancy and cause severe developmental defects of the central nervous system. For infection modeling, we used human iPSCs (hiPSCs), which share pluripotency features of human embryonic stem cells, NSCs and immature neurons, which represent the neural progenitor cells and neurons in the developing fetal brain, respectively. hiPSCs clones were generated by reprogramming of erythroblasts expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with Sendai virus vectors carrying the four Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). Human NSCs and immature neurons were obtained from the neural differentiation of human iPSC clones (
