<p>Viral replication kinetics was evaluated in time-course experiments of infection at different MOIs in hiPSCs, NSCs, and neurons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05404-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Viral RNA load and infectious virus yield were measured by qRT-PCR and TCID50 assay, respectively, in supernatants of infected cells. Growth curves showed that flavivirus replication was more efficient in NSCs than in hiPSCs and neurons. Comparison of replication kinetics of the different flaviviruses showed that WNV had the highest efficiency, as shown by a more rapid increase in viral titer, followed by ZIKV, while DENV-2 showed the lowest replication efficiency in NSCs.
