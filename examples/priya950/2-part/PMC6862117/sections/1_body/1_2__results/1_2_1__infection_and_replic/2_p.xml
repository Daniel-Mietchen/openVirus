<p>NSCs were infected with viruses at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. MOI was defined as the ratio of the number of infectious virus particles measured as plaque forming units, PFU, or tissue culture infectious dose 50%, TCID50, to the number of target cells that were present in a well. Target cell infection was assessed at 72 h post infection (hpi) by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody targeting the flavivirus envelope (E) glycoprotein. The percentage of infected cells was estimated by fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification by counting the number of positive cells to the total number of cells in five fields of view in triplicate experiments. The average infection rate was estimated as 25% ± 8%, 80% ± 12%, and 15% ± 5% of NSCs infected with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, respectively. Representative confocal microscopy images of ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2-infected NSCs are shown in
