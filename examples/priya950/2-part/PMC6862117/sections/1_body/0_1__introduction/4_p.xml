<p>One of the central questions in the search for therapeutic targets for the treatment of flaviviral neurological syndromes is whether these diseases are induced by virus-mediated cytolysis, immune-pathological responses to infection, or a combination of both [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Animal models have permitted temporal analysis of the progressive dissemination of virus infection within the CNS and identification of cells targeted by viral infection, have revealed important details regarding host factors that restrict viral replication and the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections, and have been fundamental for vaccine development [

 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Breakthroughs on cell reprogramming and generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have revolutionized approaches to the study of human diseases. iPSCs are generated directly from adult differentiated cells that are reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state by introducing genes important for maintaining the essential properties of embryonic stem cells [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Generation of hiPSCs and their differentiation into a variety of cells and organoids have allow to set up versatile, non-invasive, ethically sustainable, cruelty-free, and patient-specific models for the investigation of the mechanisms of human diseases, including viral infections and host–pathogen interactions, for the discovery of new drugs, and for the development of personalized therapies [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Human iPSC-derived neural cells and brain organoids have been extensively used to investigate the mechanisms of ZIKV and other flavivirus infection and pathogenesis and have been used as platforms to discover therapeutic targets and to test antiviral compounds [

 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Initial studies with hiPSCs studies were crucial to provide evidence of the tropism of ZIKV for human cortical neural progenitor cells and to demonstrate that ZIKV infection impairs cell differentiation and induces apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], supporting the causative role of ZIKV in fetal microcephaly. Human iPSC-derived brain organoids, which are 3D structures mimicking endogenous human brain development and organization, showed that ZIKV preferentially infects radial glia cells as compared to intermediate progenitors or immature neurons, leading to cell death [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Activation of TLR3-mediated innate immune response was one of the mechanisms involved ZIKV deleterious effects on neurogenesis [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, the ability of viruses to infect and replicate was found to be dependent on cell differentiation status, since stem cells appear to be refractory to viral infection probably due to constitutive high-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while cell susceptibility to viral infection increases in differentiated cells [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Comparisons with other flaviviruses—e.g., DENV—showed that the tropism for neural stem cells was a distinguishing feature of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but no extensive comparative analyses have been performed with typically neurotropic flaviviruses like WNV.
