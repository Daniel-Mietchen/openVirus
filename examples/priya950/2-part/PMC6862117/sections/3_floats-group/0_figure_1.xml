  <p>Characterization of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hiPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Representative light microscope images of hiPSCs, NSCs, and neurons used to model flavivirus infection; (
   <bold>b</bold>) RT-PCR analysis of immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hiPSCs for a panel of pluripotency markers; (
   <bold>c</bold>) RT-PCR analysis and IF staining of NSCs for the NSC differentiation markers SOX1, SOX2, Nestin, and PAX6; (
   <bold>d</bold>) RT-PCR analysis and IF staining of neurons for the neuron differentiation markers ENO, MAP-2, and β-Tubulin. The stemness marker OCT4 was not expressed in NSCs and neurons, as expected. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Magnification 20×.
