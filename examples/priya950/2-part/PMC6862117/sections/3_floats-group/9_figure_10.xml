  <p>Analysis of ZIKV infection in hiPSCs differentiating into embryoid bodies (EBs). (
   <bold>a</bold>) hiPSCs were infected with ZIKV at MOI 1 and, after 2 days, cells were detached by collagenase IV treatment in order to initiate differentiation of EBs. EBs were grown in suspension for the first 7 days and in adhesion on gelatin-coated surfaces on the following days. 10Ã— magnification. (
   <bold>b</bold>) RT-PCR products derived from the amplification of markers belonging to the three germ layers in EBs at day 16. Only the results of mock infection are shown, since the test could not be performed in infected cells because of the poor quantity and quality of purified RNA. (
   <bold>c</bold>) ZIKV RNA load measured by qRT-PCR and (
   <bold>d</bold>) infectious ZIKV titer determined by TCID50 assay in the supernatant of ZIKV-infected hiPSCs induced to EB differentiation (MOI 1).
