  <p>Analysis of ZIKV infection in differentiating NSCs. (
   <bold>a</bold>) CPE of ZIKV-infected differentiating NSCs at different time-points post infection. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining assessing the expression of flavivirus E protein (green) and β-Tubulin (red) in ZIKV-infected differentiating NSCs at 6 and 20 dpi. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. 20× magnification. (
   <bold>c</bold>) ZIKV RNA load measured by qRT-PCR in cell culture supernatants. (
   <bold>d</bold>) ZIKV load measured by TCID50 assay in cell culture supernatants. qRT-PCR data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments conducted in quintuplicate. Viral load data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments in duplicate. *
