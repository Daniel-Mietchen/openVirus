<p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed by downloading HPeV5 VP1 sequences from GenBank (National Centre for Biotechnology information (NCBI), USA) in August 2019, and aligning the sequences using Muscle [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in Geneious (Biomatters, New Zealand). Sequences with ambiguous bases, or those which were truncated, were removed from the alignment. The optimum model for transitions/transversions was determined in Mega X [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated in Mega X using 1000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting tree was visualized in Figtree 1.4.4 [
