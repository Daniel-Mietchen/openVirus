<p>Barcoded libraries were loaded on to an Ion 530 chip using the Ion Chef templating robot, and sequenced using an Ion Torrent S5 XL sequencer (Thermofisher Scientific). Human parechovirus and rhinovirus sequences were obtained by mapping the obtained sequencing reads to HPeV and rhinovirus reference genomes using MagicBLAST (NCBI). The consensus sequences from the mapping were obtained from the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Broad Institute, University of California) and assembled in Geneious 11.1.5 (Biomatters, New Zealand).</p>
