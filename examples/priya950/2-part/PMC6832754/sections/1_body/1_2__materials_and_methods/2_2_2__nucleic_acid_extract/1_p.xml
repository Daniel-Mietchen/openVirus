<p>Nucleic acid from samples submitted to VIDRL was extracted using the Qiagen Qiamp 96 kit and a Qiacube HD extraction robot, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was reverse transcribed using Bioline’s Sensifast synthesis kit (Bioline, UK), as per kit instructions, and cDNA was stored at −20 °C until processing. This cDNA was used in the parechovirus detection, typing and sequencing PCRs described below.</p>
