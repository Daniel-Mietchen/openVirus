<p>At the time of writing (August 2019), only nine full-length HPeV5 genomes were available on GenBank. However, 76 near-complete HPeV5 VP1 sequences were available, and these were downloaded and aligned with the 696nt VP1 sequences of G001-19 and G002-19. After excluding any sequences with ambiguous bases, or those which were significantly truncated at either the 5’ or 3’ end of the gene (which included the partial VP1 from cases V1 and V5), a final alignment of 567 nucleotides from 72 HPeV5 VP1 sequences was created, and a corresponding maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree generated (

The 2019 Australian HPeV5 VP1 sequences ranged in nucleotide similarity between 77% and 100% with international HPeV5s, but were only 80.78%–80.95% similar to HPeV5’s detected in Queensland, Australia, in 2012 and 2013 (GenBank accessions: MH931514.1 and MG712788.1) [

Of these, the recombinant HPeV5 VP1 was most similar to the most recent sequences reported in 2018 from Germany (all &gt;99.5% similarity) and Belarus (100% similar to G002-19) [
