<p>The case-G001-19/Vic/Jun/19 infant presented at 2 weeks of age in late June 2019 with a 24 h history of irritability, rash and fever. There was no significant past history, having been born uneventfully at term gestation. The infant was tachycardic (heart rate of 180 beats per minute (BPM)) and had impaired perfusion with delayed capillary refill. An erythematous macular rash was apparent across the torso. The fontanelle was full but soft. Haemoglobin was 161 g/L, white cell count was 5.7 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocytes 1.4 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophils 3.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L and platelets 153 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. C-reactive protein levels were not elevated, and the general chemistry was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was blood-stained with a red cell count of 8829 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/L and a white cell count of 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/L. The protein content was slightly elevated at 1.06 g/L and the glucose was normal. CSF, blood and urine bacterial cultures were negative. CSF was positive for parechovirus by PCR and negative for herpes simplex virus and enterovirus. A nasopharyngeal (NPA) swab tested negative for influenza A/B virus by rapid test and a second NPA swab tested positive (PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27.6) for rhinovirus by a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory pathogens. The infant was treated empirically with intravenous antibiotics (cefotaxime and benzyl-penicillin) for 48 h and acyclovir for 24 h along with intravenous (IV) saline and dextrose for circulatory support and hydration. The infant improved clinically and was discharged after 3 days, but continued to have some irritability for the following week.
