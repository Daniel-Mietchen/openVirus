<p>Simplot analysis of the G001-19 HPeV5 against reference HPeV5 (AM235749.1) and HPeV3 (KY556671.1) genomes is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00913-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The structural genes (VP0, VP3 and VP1) were most similar to HPeV5, while the non-structural genes were more similar to HPeV3. The polymerase (viral protein 3D) was highly similar (&gt;95%) to the Australian recombinant HPeV3, which has been the predominant HPeV lineage in Australia since 2013. In particular, it was most similar to the HPeV3s sequenced from the earliest epidemic in 2013/14 (GenBank accessions: KY556671.1, KY556674.1 and KY55673.1). The middle region of the genome, which included the non-structural viral proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A and 3B, only shared 85%–95% homology to either HPeV3 or HPeV5. Querying this region in BLAST found that the most similar sequence was an HPeV1 from the Netherlands from 1993 (K150-93 (GQ183023.1)), with an overall similarity of 87.8%. However, many HPeV1, 3 and 4 sequences also shared &gt;85% similarity with this region, and, therefore, it is possible that this section of the genome was acquired from a yet to be sequenced HPeV belonging to any one of these types, and possibly even the progenitor virus for the 3’ end of the Australian recombinant HPeV3, given the similarity to the HPeV3s from the earliest Australian epidemic. The Simplot analysis indicated that the potential sites of recombination events were in the 5’ end of the 2A protein and 3’ end of the 3C protein (
