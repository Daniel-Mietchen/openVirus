<p>Retrospective analysis of all HPeV-positive cases from Southeastern Australia in 2019 found that seven of the ten cases were positive for HPeV5 based on VP1 sequencing, and three positive for HPeV1. In four HPeV5 infections, the infant had been treated for suspected meningitis or sepsis, and in 6 out of the 7 cases, CSF had been submitted for parechovirus and enterovirus testing, indicating significant clinical concern for the infant. All HPeV5-infected infants were less than 3 months of age (mean age of 1 month), while all three HPeV1-positive infants were 9 months or older and CSF had not been submitted for testing (see 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The VP1 nucleotide sequences of the seven HPeV5s were 99.1% similar or higher.
