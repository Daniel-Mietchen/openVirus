<p>Sufficient sample remained from two of these HPeV5-positive cases (V1/Vic/Feb/19 (V1) and V5/Tas/Mar/19 (V5)) to perform additional VP1, partial 2C-3A and 3D PCRs and Sanger sequencing (accession numbers MN451643-MN451648). A 296 nt section of the 2C-3A region of the HPeV5s (corresponding to nucleotides 4589 to 4885 of G001-19) was able to be aligned from all four HPeV5’s sequenced. The HPeV5 from V1 (Feb/19) was 96.96% similar to G001-19, while the HPeV5 from V5 (Mar/19) was 97.64% similar to G001-19. V1 was 98.65% similar to V5. In contrast to the recent Australian recombinant HPeV3 sequences, these HPeV5’s possessed a glutamine (Q) residue at the amino acid residue immediately upstream to the 2C-3A cleavage motif QLENQ. V1 (Feb/19), however, had changed a glutamine for an arginine, corresponding to the residue 12 amino acids upstream of the QLENQ motif in the G001-19 polyprotein. A 607nt region of the 3D polymerase (corresponding to nucleotides 6489 to 7096) was aligned. The V1/Vic/Feb/19 HPeV5 was 98.68% similar to G001-19 and V5/Tas/Mar/19 HPeV5 was 99.01% similar to G001-19. V1 was 99.01% similar to V5. In both PCR regions, G002-19 was identical to G001-19.</p>
