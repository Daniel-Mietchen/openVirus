<p>In June and July 2019, two infants aged 1 month or less presented to University Hospital Geelong with fever, rash and irritability and both were admitted for treatment. Both infants tested positive for HPeV and samples were subjected to detailed virus sequencing. Here, we describe the detection of a novel recombinant HPeV type 5 (HPeV5), the clinical presentation of the affected infants, and retrospective epidemiological analysis of HPeV-positive infants from Southeastern Australia in 2019.</p>
