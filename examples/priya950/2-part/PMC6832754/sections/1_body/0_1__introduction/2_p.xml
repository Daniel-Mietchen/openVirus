<p>This particular strain of HPeV3 has only been recorded in Australia. However, recent studies in Europe have identified HPeV3 causing disease in young children in the United Kingdom and Germany between 2016 and 2018 with highly similar viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) sequences to the Australian recombinant HPeV3, although this is only based on partial sequencing (256â€“807 nucleotides) of the capsid region [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This may support our previous finding that this HPeV3 likely continued to circulate in people between Australian epidemics, based on the molecular evolution of the virus between epidemics [
