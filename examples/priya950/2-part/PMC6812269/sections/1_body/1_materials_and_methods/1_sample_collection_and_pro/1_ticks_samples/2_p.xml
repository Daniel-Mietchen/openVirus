 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> ticks were collected on cattle (except for two ticks collected by flagging); 
 <italic>D. marginatus</italic> ticks were collected on wild boars (except for one tick collected by flagging); 
 <italic>Ha. hystricis</italic> ticks were collected either on wild boars (
 <italic>N</italic> = 11), on dogs (
 <italic>N</italic> = 2), and by flagging (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3); 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks were either collected on dogs (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) or on wild boars (
 <italic>N</italic> = 15); and 
 <italic>Rh. sanguineus</italic> ticks were either collected on dogs (
 <italic>N</italic> = 12) or on the floor of houses were dogs lived (
