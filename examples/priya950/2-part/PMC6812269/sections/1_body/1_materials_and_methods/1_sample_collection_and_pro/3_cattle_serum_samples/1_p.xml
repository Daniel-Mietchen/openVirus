<p>With the support and under the control of the local veterinary services from the Department of Livestock Development, 70 cattle were blood sampled in the Tha Wang Pha district, Nan province, in November 2012. When animals were infested, ticks were collected. Animals were tested by ELISA against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma evansi</italic> as previously described (Desquesnes et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and seropositive samples were tested by PCR using 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> primers previously published (Masiga et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Pruvot et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) to confirm active infection.
