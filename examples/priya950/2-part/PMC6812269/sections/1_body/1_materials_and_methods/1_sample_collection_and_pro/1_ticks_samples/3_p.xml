<p>All ticks were washed as previously described (Vayssier-Taussat et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) to remove external contaminants and homogenized individually in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum. After clarification, DNA and RNA extractions were performed from 100 μl of supernatant using the Nucleospin Tissue or the Nucleospin RNA II kits, respectively (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified DNA and RNA were eluted into 50 μl of elution buffer and RNAse-free water, respectively. Extracts were kept at −80°C before HTS libraries preparation and further amplifications.
