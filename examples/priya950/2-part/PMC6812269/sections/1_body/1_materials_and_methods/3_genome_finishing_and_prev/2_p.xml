<p>For prevalence study, individual RNA extracts were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the qScript cDNA Supermix kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quanta Biosciences, USA). Briefly, the reaction was performed in a final volume of 5 μl containing 1 μl of qScript cDNA Supermix 5×, 1 μl of RNA, and 3 μl of RNase-free water. Cycling condition was as follows: one cycle at 25°C for 5 min, one cycle at 42°C for 30 min, and one final cycle at 85°C for 5 min. Specific Taqman qPCR systems targeting the polymerase gene were designed for six relevant viruses (the sequences of primers and probes are available upon request). Real-time Taqman qPCR assays were performed in a final volume of 12 μl using the LightCycler® 480 Probe Mastermix (Roche Applied Science) at 1× final concentration, with primers and probes at 200 nM, and 2 μl of cDNA. Negative (water) control was included in each run. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, then 60°C for 15 s, with a final cooling step at 40°C for 10 s.</p>
