<p>The quantification of abundance of each viral taxon was obtained by summing the length (in amino acids) of all sequences being associated to this taxon instead of summing the raw number of sequences, to take into account the identification of long viral contigs. In addition, to take into account that contigs are the results of the assembly of numerous reads, we weighted the identification of viral hits coming from contigs by multiplying the length (in amino acids) of contigs with their respective
