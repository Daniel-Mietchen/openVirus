A BLAST-based similarity search was performed for all contigs and singletons against the protein Reference Viral database (Bigot et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) followed by a BlastP-based verification of the accuracy of the viral taxonomic assignation against the whole protein NCBI/nr database. A final BLAST-based verification was performed against NCBI/nt to confirm that no better hit was obtained in non-coding regions of NCBI/nt.
