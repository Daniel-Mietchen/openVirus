<p>Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed on conserved non-structural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene. Complete ORFs were aligned along with other representative sequences of viral orders/families using MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) aligner under the L-INS-i or G-INS-i parameters (Katoh et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The best amino acids substitution models that fitted the data were determined with ATGC Smart Model Selection (Lefort et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) implemented in

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood method implemented through RAxML program under the CIPRES Science Gateway portal (Miller et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) according to the selected substitution model. Nodal support was evaluated using the “automatic bootstrap replicates” parameter. For

 <italic>p</italic>-distance, and 10,000 bootstraps replications were used.
