<p>To maximize the probability of detecting antibodies specific to the viruses detected in ticks and minimize the risk of cross-reactions, we decided to target viral external proteins, meaning glycoproteins (GP) or nucleoproteins (NP) when GP were not identified. The annotation of the genes and the consecutive identification of surface proteins were first performed by position-specific iterated Blast (Psi-Blast). For viral ORFs for which we could not determine the function of the gene by Psi-Blast, Swiss Model was used to model the structure of the viral protein and to compare it to known structures deposited onto the PDB database (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Finally, for hypothetical proteins for which neither Psi-Blast nor Swiss Model gave positive results, online prediction of possible N- and O-glycosylation sites was performed both on the NetNGlyc and NetOGlyc webservers (
