<p>A modified version of Burbelo's protocol was developed for expression of fusion proteins: HEK-293A cells (kindly provided by Bernard Klonjkowski, Veterinary School, Maisons-Alfort, France) were transfected with polyethylenimine (PEI, Polyscience Inc., USA) instead of Cos-1 cells and Fugene-6 transfecting reagent (Burbelo et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin mix, 1% amphotericin B, and 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) with two passages a week. Cells (4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> per well) were plated on a six-well plate the day before transfection, and 5 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected with 20 μl of 1 mg/ml PEI. Two days post-transfection, fusion proteins were harvested as previously described (Burbelo et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor cocktail minitablets, Roche Applied Science) and 10% of glycerol were added to the cell lysates to enhance protein stability. The luciferase activity of the fusion proteins was measured onto a Centro XS
 <sup>3</sup> LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, France) by adding the NanoLuc substrate (NanoGlo reagent, Promega) to 10-fold dilutions of the lysates. Titers (in light unit LU/ml) were corrected for background by subtracting LU values produced by negative controls constituted of cells transfected with the same amount of PEI without plasmid DNA.
