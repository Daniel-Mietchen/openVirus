<p>One hundred nanograms of pre-linearized pFC32K vector (digested by SgfI and EcoICRI restriction enzymes, Carboxy Flexi Enzyme Blend, Promega) was used to clone by GA the target fragments at a ratio of 1:3 to 1:10 (depending on the constructs) in XL1 competent cells (Agilent Technologies, USA). Positive clones were screened by PCR with primers designed in the vector and flanking the inserts and verified by Sanger sequencing. PureLink HiPure midiprep kit (Invitrogen) was used to extract plasmids from 100 ml of bacterial overnight cultures grown in LB medium supplemented with 25 Î¼g/ml of kanamycin.</p>
