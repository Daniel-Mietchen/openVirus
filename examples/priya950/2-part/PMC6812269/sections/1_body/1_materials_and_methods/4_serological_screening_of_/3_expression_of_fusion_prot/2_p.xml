<p>LIPS assay was performed as previously described by Burbelo et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) except that human and cattle sera were not diluted. Sera of 30 healthy French donors living in Paris area who did not report travel to Thailand or any tick bite (kindly provided by ICAReB platform of Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) were screened for the presence of antibodies against the targeted viruses as a non-exposed group control. Residual background was measured as the mean of 10 negative controls (without serum), and positivity threshold was defined as the mean of these controls + 5 standard deviations.
