<p>The increasing accessibility of HTS technology and the resulting description of viral communities in various environmental samples pave the way for a better understanding of viral spillovers. However, identifying a list of viruses at higher risk of emergence requires first the characterization of the ecological cycle of the virus, including its putative reservoir hosts, hematophagous arthropod vectors (in the case of arboviruses), and vertebrate recipient hosts (Temmam et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Usual practices combine field surveillance of vectors and wildlife, description of viral communities present in these animals, analyses of bloodmeal origin in arthropods, and phylogenetic analyses of viruses. Recently, novel approaches tried to predict vertebrate and invertebrate hosts using computational modeling (Babayan et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this study, we combined field surveillance of arthropods and virome characterization with comprehensive phylogenetic analyses to select relevant viruses close to tick-borne arboviruses. We further characterized putative spillover events by applying a systematic serological survey in human and cattle populations highly exposed to these ticks. Among the viral communities characterized in Thai ticks, we selected viruses belonging to four viral families known to contain zoonotic viruses (

 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> families) and a recently recognized viral family for which the zoonotic potential was still unknown (
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic>).
