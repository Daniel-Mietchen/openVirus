<p>Among the list of human-infecting pathogens, two-thirds are zoonotic agents (Woolhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). With increasing contacts between humans, wildlife, and their associated arthropods (due to changes in land use, global climate warming, or urbanization), the frequency of human infections with animal viruses is expected to increase (Cutler et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Wolfe et al. noted that the emergence of a pathogen of vertebrate into a new susceptible vertebrate population goes through four main steps: (1) spillover of a pathogen from its animal reservoir to sporadic human cases, (2) limited interhuman transmission of a zoonotic pathogen, (3) large-scale spread of a zoonotic pathogen through interhuman transmissions, and (4) adaptation of the pathogen to humans (Wolfe et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This is not the case for arboviruses: arbovirus emergence is linked to the spread of infected arthropods (directly or via the geographical expansion of their vertebrate host, as for ticks) into new areas or to the incursion of humans in new biotopes. Most recent epidemics that emerged were linked to arboviruses that were already known but described in limited areas, as the recent example of Zika virus rapid expansion (Liu et al.,
