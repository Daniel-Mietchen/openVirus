<p>The transcriptome of Thai ticks was sequenced at a depth of 222 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> reads. Most sequences were assigned to the Eukaryota domain while bacteria and viruses represented 0.09 and 0.001% of validated taxonomic assignation of reads, respectively. Of these, more than 99% of viral sequences were composed of RNA viruses, while few other related viral sequences were identified (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). ssRNA negative-strand viruses represented 97.20% of all viruses, followed by ssRNA positive strand viruses (1.94%), unclassified viruses (0.70%), and dsRNA viruses (0.14%). Only few sequences were assigned to DNA viruses (ssDNA: 0.01%), reflecting the specificity of RNA extraction. The identification of ssDNA viruses would more likely correspond to the sequencing of ssDNA viral transcripts, reflecting the replicative form of these viruses.
