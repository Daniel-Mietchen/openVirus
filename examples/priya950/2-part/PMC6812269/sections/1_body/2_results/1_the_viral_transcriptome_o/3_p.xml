<p>The negative-strand ssRNA viruses constituted more than 97% of viral sequences (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Among these, more than 66% of ssRNA viruses were assigned to the nonsegmented 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> or 
 <italic>Jingchuvirales</italic> orders. For example, sequences assigned to the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family mainly mapped onto a novel strain of Wuhan tick virus 1 (WhTV1), with amino-acid identities ranging from 93 to 97%, depending on the gene (WhTV1-Thailand virus, accession no 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MN095536" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MN095536</ext-link>); while other unclassified 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>-related sequences were detected (as for example a distant Tacheng tick virus 3 virus or a new strain of Nayun tick rhabdovirus). Few sequences, were assigned to the 
 <italic>Sprivivirus</italic>, the 
 <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>, and the 
 <italic>Ledantevirus Rhabdoviridae</italic> genera. Viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> mapped onto Wuhan tick virus 2 (WhTV2) and Brown dog mivirus 1 (a new strain of Changping tick virus 2 [CpTV2]), with amino-acid identities ranging from 89 to 99% (WhTV2-Thailand virus: MN095546; and CpTV2-Thailand virus: MN095545). Finally, a novel unclassified mononegavirus genome presented distant homologies with Norway mononegavirus 1 (amino-acid identities ranging from 55 to 64%, depending on the gene).
