<p>Among the ssRNA viruses, positive-strand RNA viruses were in the minority (1.96% of ssRNA viruses). More than 98% of sequences were taxonomically related to Trinbago virus, a BLTV4-related virus identified in Trinidad and Tobago 
 <italic>Rh. sanguineus</italic> ticks (Sameroff et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The strain identified in Thai ticks, tentatively named BLTV4-Thailand virus (accession no.

 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genera (more likely corresponding to cattle-infecting viruses that are detected through the bloodmeal of ticks), or to the
