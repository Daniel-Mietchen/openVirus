<p>To test if one or more viruses identified among Thai ticks is able to infect selected mammalian species (humans and cattle) highly exposed to tick bites, and therefore could constitute putative novel tick-borne arboviruses, we developed LIPS-based serological screening against Thailand tick thogotovirus and LTPV-, BLTV4-, WhTV1-, WhTV2-, and CpTV2-Thailand viruses. Results are presented in
