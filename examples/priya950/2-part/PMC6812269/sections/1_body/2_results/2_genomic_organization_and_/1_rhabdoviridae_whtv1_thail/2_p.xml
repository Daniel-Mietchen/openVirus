<p>Recently, numerous tick-associated rhabdoviruses were reported worldwide, but they are still unassigned to a genus and fall in several distinct clades that possibly constitute new genera in the family (Tokarz et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>; Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Xia et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Brinkmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses performed on the complete amino-acid sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase revealed that WhTV1-Thailand virus falls in a clade, distant from classical rhabdoviruses, that comprised viruses identified exclusively in ticks from a wide range of geographical origins (China, USA, Turkey and Norway) (
