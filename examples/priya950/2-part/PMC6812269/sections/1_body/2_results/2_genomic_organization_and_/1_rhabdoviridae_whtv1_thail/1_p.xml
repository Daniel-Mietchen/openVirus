 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> is a family of RNA viruses infecting a large spectrum of hosts, ranging from plants to invertebrates and vertebrates. Tick-borne rhabdoviruses include viruses belonging to the recognized 
 <italic>Ledantevirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ephemerovirus</italic>, and the putative 
 <italic>Sawgravirus</italic> genera (Labuda and Nuttall,

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tokarz et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> viruses present a general genome organization of linear negative-strand ssRNA genome usually encoding five proteins, in the order N (nucleoprotein)/P (phosphoprotein)/M (matrix)/G (glycoprotein)/L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). WhTV1-Thailand virus presents a similar gene organization, although only four ORFs were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). ORF1 code for a protein of 488 aa corresponds to the putative nucleoprotein of the virus. ORF2 code for a hypothetical protein of 363 aa presenting numerous O-glycosylation sites. Its size (in the range of those observed for other 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> phosphoproteins), the absence of transmembrane domains, and its richness in acidic amino acids (PI = 4.89) suggest that ORF2 could code for the putative P protein of WhTV1-Thailand virus. ORF3 codes for a small protein of 205 aa corresponding to the putative matrix protein of the virus. The last ORF codes for a large protein of 2,183 aa corresponding to the RNA polymerase of the virus. WhTV1-Thailand virus present therefore an N–P–M–L gene organization, suggesting that a major evolution event in its emergence was the loss of G gene. Walker et al. noted that gain and/or loss of genes was common and a major driver of rhabdoviruses evolution (Walker et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and several assumptions were made to explain the mechanism of entry in hosts cells of such viruses presenting the loss of G protein, as for example the use of a helper virus (Sameroff et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). WhTV1-Thailand viral ORFs present genetic identity ranging from 93 to 97% at the protein level, depending on the gene, with its closest viral relative 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> associated rhabdo-like virus (
