<p>WhTV2-Thailand virus presents amino acid identity ranging from 89 to 92% with the prototype Wuhan tick virus 2 while CpTV2-Thailand virus is close to Brown dog tick mivirus 1, a Changping tick virus 2-related virus (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses performed on the complete amino-acid sequence of the RdRP confirmed that WhTV2-Thailand and CpTV2-Thailand chuviruses belong to the circular clade I of the 
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, with a highly supported bootstrap of 100, they both placed in a subclade composed exclusively of viruses identified in ticks (
