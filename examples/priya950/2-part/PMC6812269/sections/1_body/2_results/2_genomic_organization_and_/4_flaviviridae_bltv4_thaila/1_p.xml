 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is a family of positive-strand ssRNA viruses composed of four recognized genera: 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (arboviruses infecting both vertebrates and invertebrates), 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> (mammalian viruses including primates, humans, pigs, and bats), 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> (animal viruses such as bovine diarrhea virus or classical swine fever virus), and 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> (human Hepatitis C virus). Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) are divided into mammalian- and seabird-infecting viruses (Brackney and Armstrong, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Mammalian TBFVs are transmitted by 
 <italic>Ixodidae</italic> hard ticks, while seabird TBFVs are transmitted by 
 <italic>Argasidae</italic> soft ticks. The flavivirus viral genome of ~10â€“12 kb codes for a unique polyprotein that will be cleaved during maturation by viral and host proteases into viral structural and non-structural proteins. Recently, Shi et al. reported the identification of divergent flavivirus-like viruses in arthropods with genome size ranging from 16 to 26 kb with similar genome organizations, including Bole tick virus 4 (BLTV4) virus primarily identified in 
 <italic>Hy. asiaticum</italic> Chinese ticks and later in 
 <italic>Rh. sanguineus</italic> ticks from Trinidad and Tobago (Trinbago virus) (Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Sameroff et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We identified in Thai ticks a genome close to Trinbago virus, tentatively named BLTV4-Thailand virus. Its genome of 15.5 kb (shorter than BLTV4 genome of 16.2 kb) codes for a unique polyprotein of 5,089 aa.
