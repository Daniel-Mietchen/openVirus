<p>The 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family is composed of seven genera: types A/B/C and D 
 <italic>Influenzavirus, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic>. Thogotoviruses, arthropod-borne viruses infecting mammals mainly transmitted by ticks, have been identified in Africa, North America, Southern Europe, the Middle East, and in Far East Asia, either in ticks and/or in humans (for Thogoto virus, Dhori virus, and Bourbon virus) (Ejiri et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thogotoviruses are composed of six negative-strand ssRNA segments that code from the polymerase complex (segments PB2, PB1, and PA), the glycoprotein (GP), the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein (M). Although influenza viruses present a surface GP constituted of hemagglutin and neuraminidase proteins, the GP of thogotoviruses present structural similarities with the gp64 envelope glycoprotein of alphabaculoviruses (Morse et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Kadlec et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). We identified in Thai ticks a viral genome close to Oz virus (OZV), a thogotovirus recently isolated from 
 <italic>Am. testudinarium</italic> ticks in Japan (Ejiri et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Provisionally named Thailand tick thogotovirus, this virus presents the characteristics of a 
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic> member, meaning: (i) the six segments genome architecture [segment 1 codes for the putative PB2 protein of 764 aa; segment 2 for two ORFs (of 187 and 559 aa, respectively)] constituting the PB1 protein complex; segment 3 for the PA protein of 637 aa; segment 4 for the GP protein of 510 aa; segment 5 for the NP protein of 465 aa; and segment 6 for the M protein of 252 aa); and (ii) the structural conformation of Thailand tick thogotovirus GP close to the baculovirus fusion protein gp64 (data not shown) (Morse et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Kadlec et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Thailand tick thogotovirus presents an amino-acid identity with OZV ranging from 69% (GP) to 82% (NP) (
