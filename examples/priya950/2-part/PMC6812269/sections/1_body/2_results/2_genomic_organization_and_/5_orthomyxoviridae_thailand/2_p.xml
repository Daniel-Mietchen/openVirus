<p>Phylogenetic analyses performed on the six segments of Thailand tick thogotovirus and representative 
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic> genomes resulted in the same topology, i.e., a clustering of Thailand tick thogotovirus with OZV in a sister clade of the group formed by Bourbon and Dhori viruses, suggesting that no reassortment events occurred during Thailand tick thogotovirus evolution (
