 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> is a family of segmented negative-strand ssRNA viruses which comprise 
 <italic>Goukovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Phasivirus</italic> (insect-specific viruses), 
 <italic>Tenuivirus</italic> (plant arboviruses), and 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> (animal arboviruses) genera. This latter is the unique known viral genus among the family able to infect vertebrates, including humans and domestic animals. Recognized tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) are currently clustered into three main serogroups: SFTS virus, Bhanja virus, and Uukuniemi virus serogroups (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Matsuno et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Palacios et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The ecological cycle of TBPVs implies 
 <italic>Ixodidae</italic> ticks as the main vector, wild small animals (e.g., 
 <italic>Soricidae</italic> or 
 <italic>Erinaceidae</italic>) or migratory birds (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) as putative reservoirs and/or amplifying hosts (also responsible of the dissemination of the virus over long distances), and accidental mammalian hosts. SFTS-like viruses are able to infect humans, while other TBPVs usually infect domestic animals like sheep, goat, and cattle (Hub√°lek et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and, in rare specific cases, humans (Calisher and Goodpasture, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). Viruses belonging to this genus are trisegmented, with L segment coding for the viral RdRP, M segment coding for the glycoprotein precursor which will be further matured in two glycoproteins (GP) and a non-structural protein (NS), and the S segment coding for the nucleoprotein (NP) and a NS protein. Recently, bi-segmented phlebovirus-like viruses without any M segment were reported in ticks from various origins (Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). LTPV-Thailand virus presents the same bisegmented genome architecture, with L and S segments of 6,517 and 1,406 nt, respectively (which is in the range of trisegmented phleboviruses), coding for the expected RdRP and NP genes. As for other bisegmented phleboviruses, LTPV-Thailand virus lacked the M segment. It has been proposed that a high degree of divergence of M segments of these phleboviruses may explain that usual Blast-based methods of taxonomic assignation of reads have missed this segment (Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As a consequence, the only identified structural protein of LTPV-Thailand virus was NP, which interestingly present structural homologies with the nucleoprotein of SFTS virus, a tick-borne phlebovirus causing severe symptoms in humans and close to the Uukuniemi virus serocomplex (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
