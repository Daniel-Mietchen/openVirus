 <italic>Chuviridae</italic>, a recently recognized viral family among the 
 <italic>Jingchuvirales</italic> that was primarily assigned to the 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> order forms a monophyletic group of segmented, non-segmented, and circular viruses (Siddell et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) at median distance with segmented and unsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses (Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). They infect a wide variety of invertebrate hosts, including Crustacea, Nematoda, Insecta, Myriapoda, Arachnida, and Ixodida. Among tick-borne chuviruses, both 
 <italic>Argasidae</italic> (Argas mivirus) and 
 <italic>Ixodidae</italic> ticks are infected by tick-borne chuviruses (e.g., Bole, Changping, Dermacentor, Lonestar, Suffolk, and Wuhan mivirus). 
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> viruses present a large variety of genome organization, from a circular L–G–N order of genes (clade I, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) to segmented or linear G–N–L order of genes (clade II, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) (Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). WhTV2-Thailand virus present a genome of 11.4 kb with three ORFs: the first ORF codes for a large protein of 2,189 aa corresponding to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the virus; ORF2 code for the putative glycoprotein of 683 aa and ORF3 codes for the nucleoprotein of 411 aa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). WhTV2-Thailand virus genome was confirmed to belong to the circular L–G–N form of 
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> by performing PCR with the forward primer located in 3′ of the genome and the reverse primer in the 5′ part (data not shown). CpTV2-Thailand virus presents similar genome organization as WhTV2-Thailand virus, with a circular ssRNA genome, except that its genome is shorter (10 kb) and that the G ORF overlaps the L ORF on 61 nucleotides (this junction was confirmed by specific amplification followed by Sanger sequencing). The L gene code similarly for the RdRP of 2,164 aa, the G gene codes for the glycoprotein of 710 aa and the N gene codes for the nucleoprotein of 374 aa (
