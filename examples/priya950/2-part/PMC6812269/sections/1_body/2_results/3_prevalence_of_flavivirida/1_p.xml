<p>Among the 266 tick extracts used to generate the pool sequenced, 231 were available and screened individually for the presence of Thailand tick thogotovirus and other LTPV-, BLTV4-, WhTV1-, WhTV2-, and CpTV2-Thailand viruses. Results are presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3A</xref>. LTPV-Thailand phlebovirus was only detected in 
 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> ticks at a global prevalence of 21%. BLTV4-Thailand virus was mainly detected in 
 <italic>Rh. sanguineus</italic> ticks (19%) and in one 
 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> tick. Interestingly, these two viruses are genetically close but presented only 82% of nucleotide identity in the RdRP gene. Thogotovirus-related virus was identified at low prevalence (&lt;3%) in adult 
 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> ticks, while WhTV2-Thailand chuvirus was more prevalent (18%). CpTV2-Thailand virus was only detected in 
 <italic>Rh. sanguineus</italic> ticks at a global prevalence of nearly 19%. Finally, WhTV1-Thailand virus was only detected in more than 21% of 
 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> ticks (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3A</xref>).
