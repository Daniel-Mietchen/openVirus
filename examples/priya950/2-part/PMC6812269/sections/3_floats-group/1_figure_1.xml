  <p>Schematic organization of the six viral genomes identified in Thai ticks. The open reading frames (ORFs) are indicated with yellow arrows, and genome coverage is indicated in pink. Segmented viruses were presented as concatenated sequences for better clarity (blue arrows represent the different segments). The putative envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Thailand tick flavivirus is highlighted by a red arrow in the polyprotein ORF.</p>
