<p>The last three Chikungunya outbreaks in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were modeled using the SEIR model and estimates the Basic Reproduction Number

 </sub> for the years 2016, 2018, and 2019. The simulations results register values greater than 1 for all of them, and 2019 is the most severe, even though the data was limited for the first six months. The calculation of

 </sub> gives a global overview of the impact and scale of the outbreak. Sensitivity analyses were performed to indicate, quantitatively, the importance of each parameter to the epidemic profile in different stages of the outbreak. A more detailed approach could take into account the number of infected people in each neighborhood with different sanitary conditions, and such details are not explored in this work. This study was expanded to include the Mayaro virus, which was reported as an emerging disease in South America [

Also, to possibly stop or at least decrease the intensity of an outbreak, three interventions strategies were proposed by modifying the basic equations of the SEIR model. These interventions are associated to the increase of the vector mortality rate by fogging techniques, the decrease of mosquito birth rate by decreasing the amount of places where the mosquito lay the eggs and, the decrease of the rate in which humans transmit the disease to mosquitoes by the isolation of infected people or the usage of repellent. Although those simulations do not retract real data, they can contribute to discussions about public and government policies directions.
