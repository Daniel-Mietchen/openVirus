<p>The usage of the SEIR model allows us to estimate the importance of each parameter in the characterization of an outbreak by performing a parameter sensitivity analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It was carried out a hundred thousand Monte Carlo simulations sampling around the ±5% range from the best fit value of the Chikungunya epidemic data of 2018. From these simulations, the time-shift on the peak and the total number of infected people were obtained. Additionally, the Spearman correlation for each parameter with the time-shift and the total number of infected people was calculated. [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g003">Fig 3A</xref> shows that the rate of recovery plays a significant role in the time scale of the epidemic. The parameter presented a negative correlation, which means that positive variations in this parameter will modify the shift by delaying the peak reaching point; the same is observed about the mosquito birth-death rate. On the other hand, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g003">Fig 3B</xref> shows that by decreasing the magnitude of the transmission coefficients or increasing the value of 
 <italic>γ</italic> and 
 <italic>μ</italic> may reduce the number to total cases of infected people. These parameters modification can be related by triggering public interventions, which will be discussed in the next section. Intuitively, a fast recovery would decrease the probability of a mosquito to bit an infected person, while the increase on the birth-death rate of the mosquito will create similar effect: an infected mosquito would die quickly, therefore it may not be able to transmit the disease. Sensitivity analyses based on the outbreak time dependence are presented in the Supporting Information.
