<p>The data which contains the weekly number of infected people of Chikungunya outbreak in Rio de Janeiro was obtained from the surveillance report for the years 2016, 2018, and 2019, which are publicly available [
 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The ratio between the number of reported cases and the total population is presented in red circles 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The total number of cases reported in 2019 is 22896 until the 26
 <sup>th</sup> week when the data was collected. This number is almost two times higher in comparison with 2016 and 2018 in 52 weeks, 14203 and 10700, respectively. In 2017 the total number of cases was 1870, which will not be used in this study. Then, the SEIR model was applied to fit the incidence data where the upper and the lower bound of the model parameters were set to vary in a range described in the literature.
