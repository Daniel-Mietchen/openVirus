 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g004">Fig 4</xref> presents the distribution of the number of cases and the cumulative number of cases as a function time for different fogging intensities, A and B, respectively. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, once the fogging action starts, the number of cases per week stop to grow and starts to decrease over time. The strength of the parameter 
 <italic>ω</italic> dictates how fast these curves decay. The cumulative number of cases also reflects the fogging action for different intensities, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g004">Fig 4B</xref>. The total number of case drops to 70.0% when 
 <italic>ω</italic> = 0.25 presented in dashed red line and drops to 54.0% when 
 <italic>ω</italic> = 0.5 shown in the dotted yellow line when compared with the real data without fogging action 
 <italic>ω</italic> = 0.0.
