<p>In this work, we perform mathematical modeling of Chikungunya outbreaks in Rio de Janeiro for the years 2016, 2017 and 2019 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Chikungunya virus infects humans through mosquitoes as the disease vector. The model adopted here is a compartmental model known as SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) [

 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The approaches using this class of models have been successful in modeling epidemic related to human vector dynamics [
