 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) is a famous pathogen in producing serious infections that resistant to many of the common antibiotics. In order to increase the MRSA treatment efficiency, an aptamer-functionalized gold nanorods (Apt@Au NRs) was introduced as a targeted PTT. It specifically bound to MRSA cells, resulting in recognition and inactivation of MRSA cells through hyper-thermia. The immobilization of aptamer on the surface of AuNRs led to the increase in targeted MRSA cell- binding affinity [
