<p id="Par22">Another effective aptamer- nanoparticle complex against biofilm was also reported. Graphene oxide (GO), is an extensively used chemically modified graphene derivative, which has anti-microbial activity. A research group was studied the conjugation of four different aptamer sequences (ST-1, ST-2, ST-3, ST-4) with GO in order to apply as an anti-biofilm agent in 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> model. ST-1 aptamer -conjugated graphene oxide (ST-1-GO) provides a powerful platform to impede biofilm formation through a targeted manner, showing the synergistic effect of aptamer and GO against biofilm formation. By using ST-1-GO, effective anti-biofilm concentration of GO was decreased from 125 mg/L to 100 mg/L, while the anti-biofilm effect was enhanced from 66.4 to 71.4%. Actually, GO entry into the biofilm was facilitated by aptamer ST-3 and they could reduce the cellular membrane potential to inhibit bacterial growth at the same time. The results support that ST-1 aptamer can be a therapeutic candidate for drug delivery [
