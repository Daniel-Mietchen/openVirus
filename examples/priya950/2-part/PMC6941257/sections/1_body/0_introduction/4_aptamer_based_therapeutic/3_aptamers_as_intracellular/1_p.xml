<p id="Par17">Conventional therapy with antibiotics had faced serious restrictions, including low intracellular drug concentrations, loss of the drug through efflux pumps or enzymatic degradation and development of multi-drug resistance (MDR) strains. Drug delivery systems have introduced numerous profits, including improving treatment by increasing the efficacy and duration of drug activity, increasing patient satisfaction by reducing the required dose of drug, adaptation with convenient routes of administration, delivering to the target site to reduce the unwanted effects, and the reduction in cost of treatment that are generally due to their good stability, expanded loading capacity and improved physicochemical features [
