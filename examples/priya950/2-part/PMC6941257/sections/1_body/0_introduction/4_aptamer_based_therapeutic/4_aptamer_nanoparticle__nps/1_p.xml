<p id="Par19">NPs are small particles with the size of 1–100 nm, which exhibited the potential of antimicrobial activities. Thus, they are appropriately suited to fight microbial infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Antibiotics encapsulated in NPs have a large capacity to be replaced with antibiotics in free form. There are numerous benefits in nano-encapsulation strategy such as very-small size, a big surface-zone-to-mass ratio, high loading capacity and high reactivity, protection of antibiotics against physical inactivation, improvement in antibiotics pharmacokinetics, facilitation of the antibiotic release in infection area and reducing the required dose of drug [
