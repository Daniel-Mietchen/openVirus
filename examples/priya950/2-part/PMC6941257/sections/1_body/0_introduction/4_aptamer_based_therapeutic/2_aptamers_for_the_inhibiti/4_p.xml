 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> is another important pathogen of the genus 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> that causes the emergence of anthrax. The virulence of 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> depends on the production of anthrax toxin. The anthrax toxins consist of three components. One of them is protective antigen (PA), and the active PA heptamer can bind one or more molecules of edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF) or both that facilitates the pass of this complex into the cell. EF with PA forms edema toxin. A main virulence factor of 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> is the LF with zinc metalloprotease activity and is capable of cleaving a 
 <italic>kinase</italic> enzyme, known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) family. Blocking the interaction between LF and MEK1 leads to the reduction of LF toxicity. An ssDNA aptamer (ML12) was reported that could bind strongly to and was an impressive inhibitor of LF. ML12 by blocking the active site of LF, prevented the protease activity and served as a promising drug candidate for neutralization of LF toxicity [
