<p id="Par10">Biofilms are persistent communities of microbes that embedded in a matrix of exopolysaccharide and can adhere to surfaces. Biofilms are important in human infections that are hard to treat and cannot be easily eradicated with current antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Chronic infections by biofilm-forming strains are associated with the accumulation of bacteria, which have a much more complex antibiotic resistance profile, due to the failure of antibiotics in penetrating the polysaccharide layer, as well as, biofilm resistaant against the human immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Treatment of biofilm infections is currently a serious problem and antibiotic therapy alone is often inadequate for complete treatment. Biofilms are shown in more than 65% of microbial infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Motility and initial attachment are believed to be the major features for biofilm formation. It was found that the binding of specific aptamer to the flagella of 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesuis</italic> could result in the restriction of bacterial rotational frequency, due to the increment of the electrostatic repulsion of cells and surfaces and therefore, preventing the formation of mature biofilms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, it was shown that in the presence of aptamer, cells were more easily attacked by antibiotics. In this study, it was indicated that the pretreatment of biofilm forming 
 <italic>S. choleraesuis</italic> with aptamer at the concentration of 1.1 μM, could substantially decrease the amount of ampicillin needed for the similar inhibition, as well as, prevented the development of antibiotic resistant strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It could be concluded that using aptamer pretreatment could eliminate the need for highly potent antibiotics in high dose.
