<p id="Par12">Toxins are powerful bioactive molecules that are produced by various bacterial pathogens and play a key role in the pathogenesis of bacteria. They are essential virulence factors allowing the organism to harm the host, through various physio-pathological pathways. Some toxins may target macrophages and neutrophils, resulting in the reduction of intrinsic immune responses and as a result, provide a suitable environment for active bacterial proliferation [
