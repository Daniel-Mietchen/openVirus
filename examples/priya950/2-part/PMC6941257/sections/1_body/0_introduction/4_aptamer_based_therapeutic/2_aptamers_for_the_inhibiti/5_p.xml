<p id="Par16">Another important toxin related syndrome is Botulism, caused by 
 <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic>. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are one of the most lethal toxins for humans, which also considered in biological weapons. Types A, B and E are the main causes of human illness and type A is the strongest one among other serotypes. This toxin is a 150 kDa protein, which is cleaved into 100 kDa and 50 kDa proteins linked by a disulfide bond; light chains (LCs) with zinc-endopeptidase activity and a nontoxic subunit (heavy chain). The carboxyl-terminal of the botulinum heavy chain binds to the target nerve cells and stimulates endocytosis of the toxin molecule. The LCs inactivates the proteins that regulate the release of acetylcholine, and results in the blocking of neurotransmission at peripheral cholinergic synapses. Three aptamers for BoNT were reported that were bounded to LC with inhibition constants in the low nM range and could cause a strong inhibition of endopeptidase activity [
