<p id="Par26">Tetracycline-loaded hydrogels were considered for controlled release by using DNA oligonucleotide as aptamer similar agent, that increased tetracycline loading and sustained its release. The study was designed based on the physicochemical features of nucleic acid sequences and possible interaction between oligonucleotide and tetracycline. This oligonucleotide could rise the partition coefficient of tetracycline between hydrogels and drug loading solutions and also, it could slow the release of tetracycline from hydrogels to increase bacterial inhibition [
