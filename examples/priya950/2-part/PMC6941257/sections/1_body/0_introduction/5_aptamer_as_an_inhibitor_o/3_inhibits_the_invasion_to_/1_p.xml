 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar 
 <italic>typhi</italic> (
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>) produces a feverish disease called typhoid fever. IVB pili is expressed by 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, which is the main character in the development of epidemics of typhoid fever. Monocytes and macrophages are critical effector molecules that play a crucial role in defense against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacterial infections. Several aptamers were recently developed that specifically bind to type IVB pili and can interfere with bacterial pathogenesis, such as inhibit the bacterial aggregation or inhibit the entry of bacteria into human monocytic cells. In this study, RNA aptamers generated based on SELEX procedure, which one of them, S-PS8.4, exhibited the binding affinity in the nM range for 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> type IVB pili [
