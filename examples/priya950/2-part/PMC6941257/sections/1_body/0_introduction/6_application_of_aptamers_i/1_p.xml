<p id="Par32">Viral infections are a threat to human health. Effective and early treatment can improve the prognosis of the disease. Due to repeated virus mutations and viruses escaping the immune system, many viral drugs are ineffective. In addition, many antiviral drugs can cause severe side effects or may interfere with other drug agents and lead to low efficacy. As a targeted treatment, aptamers can be applied against a variety of viruses. They can be effective in antiviral therapy through several methods [

As an example, the influenza virus hemagglutinin binds to the sialic acid receptor of the host cell, playing a fundamental role in initiating of viral infections. A DNA aptamer, A22, obstructed influenza virus infection by blocking the virus attachment to host cells [

Two aptamers were selected, which interfered the interaction of the gD protein and the HSV-1 target cell receptor [
