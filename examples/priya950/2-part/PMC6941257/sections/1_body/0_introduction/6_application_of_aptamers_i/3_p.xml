<p id="Par34">Moreover, aptamers may be applicable in drug development. One example in this regard is RNA aptamers developed against aminoglycoside by in vitro selection to discover the interactions between aminoglycoside and natural RNAs, including HIV RNAs, which may have similar mechanism in their interactions. The in vitro selected aminoglycoside aptamers seem to have valuable applications in the discovery of the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV infection, including molecular mechanism of interaction with aminoglycoside antibiotics, and screening of efficient anti-HIV drug candidates [
