 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB)
 <italic>,</italic> the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, is another important human pathogen that developed various mechanisms to multiply and survive resistantly in the lungs by confusing the immune system [

The polyphosphate kinase (PPK) gene in MTB regulates the intracellular metabolism of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), which plays a main role in bacterial persistence. The inhibition of PPK activity resulted in the interference of polyP-dependent processes. Aptamer G9 is a therapeutic agent developed against MTB and at the concentration of 1 μM could completely inhibit PPK2 protein of bacteria. Through this process, it exhibited promising antimicrobial activity against MTB [
