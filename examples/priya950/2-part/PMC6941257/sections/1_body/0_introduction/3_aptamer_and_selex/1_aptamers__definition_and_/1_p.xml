<p id="Par4">Aptamers are small single-stranded oligonucleotides (DNAs or RNAs) with low molecular weight (ranging 5–40 kDa), which form a specific three-dimensional structure. Compared with antibodies, aptamers have minor complexity and immunogenicity, in addition to higher affinity and specificity against variety of targets (proteins, cells or small molecules). As well, they have more flexibility and therefore, can attach to interior non-accessible epitopes that cannot be easily targeted by antibodies. They also, show more stability, in addition to the fact that after denaturation, they can return to their proper primary conformation without loss of activity [

Several important attributes of aptamers make them a promising alternative to antibodies, including having thermal and chemical stability, simple chemical synthesis that reduce the cost of production and at the same time, it is possible to made modification through chemical synthesis process to make them more adaptable for different applications [
