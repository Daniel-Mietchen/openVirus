<p id="Par8">The multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria such as 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> have developed due to inappropriate use of antibiotics. Accordingly, novel anti-microbial agents are required to fight these resistant strains. In a report, the effect of aptamer on colony formation of 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> was studied that indicated 30â€‰min incubation of specific aptamer with bacteria could result in a significant growth inhibition. The antimicrobial effect of this aptamer might be the result of bacterial cell wall depolarization [
