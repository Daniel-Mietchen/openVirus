<p>DNA of the following vector-borne pathogens was amplified in five individuals: (1) piroplasmids (n=1), (2) 
 <italic>Ehrlichia/Anaplasma</italic> sp. (n=2), (3) 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. (n=3). No 
 <italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp. DNA was detected. These pathogens were identified through sequencing as: (1) 
 <italic>Theileria equi</italic> (1/30, 3.3%, 95% CI=0.3–10.15), 100% identity to GenBank 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> sequences in equids worldwide; (2) 
 <italic>Anaplasma platys</italic> (2/30, 6.6%, 95% CI=2.8–16.14), 100% identity to GenBank 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> sequences in dogs worldwide; (3) 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. (1/30, 3.3%, 95% CI=3.4–10.15), 100% identity to GenBank 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. sequences detected in fleas worldwide, and 
 <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic> (2/30, 6.6%, 95% CI=2.8–16.14), 100% identity to GenBank 
 <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic> sequences in lions from Namibia, and cats from Malaysia, Guatemala and Brazil. The new 
 <italic>T. equi</italic>, 
 <italic>A. platys</italic>, 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic> nucleotide sequences were submitted to the GenBank database under accession numbers MK774808, MK791257, MK791259 and MK791258 respectively. Four of the five vector-borne infected individuals were healthy and carried only one pathogen, whereas one cat was pyrexic at the time of sampling and coinfected with 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> (
