<p>Examples of pathogen spillover from a domestic species to a wild counterpart have been described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Canine distemper virus (CDV) has caused several fatal epidemics in wild canids such as African wild dogs (
 <italic>Lycaon pictus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and wild felids such as Serengeti lions (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]; and more recently domestic dogs have been identified as the origin of CDV infection in Iberian wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus signatus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and jackals (
 <italic>Canis mesomelas</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Likewise, possible cross-species transmission of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) from domestic cats has been recorded in guigna (
 <italic>Leopardus guigna</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and bobcats (
 <italic>Felis rufus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and FeLV outbreaks have been reported in Florida panthers (
 <italic>Puma concolor coryi</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Iberian lynxes (
 <italic>Lynx pardinus</italic>) causing high mortalities [
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Regarding feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), it is considered endemic in some wild felid populations such as African lions (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) and many of the South American felids such as pumas (
 <italic>Puma concolor</italic>), jaguars (
 <italic>Panthera once</italic>), ocelots (
 <italic>Leopardus pardalis</italic>), margays (
 <italic>Leopardus wiedii</italic>), Geoffroy’s cat (
 <italic>Leopardus geoffroyi</italic>), and oncilla (
 <italic>Leopardus tigrinus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. However, high FIV prevalence have been described in some species of Asian wild felids like Palla’s cat (
 <italic>Otocolobus manul</italic>) or leopard cat (
 <italic>Prionailurus bengalensis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and possible spillover from domestic cats to wild felids has been described in guignas from Chile [
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and the Tsushima cat (
 <italic>Felis bengalensis euptilura</italic>) from Japan [
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Epidemics associated with vector-borne agents such as piroplasmids have also been recorded in wildlife. It was proposed that the death of one third of the Serengueti lion population was due to the co-occurrence of 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> and CDV infection [
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Piroplasmids are considered the second most commonly found parasites in the blood of mammals after trypanosomes [
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], making them important vector-borne agents in those species [
 <xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In addition to conservation implications, owned, free-roaming domestic cats could be a reservoir of zoonotic agents due to their poor health care and free-ranging behavior. 
 <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic> is currently the most commonly encountered 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> zoonosis [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Asymptomatic infection with 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. is frequently reported in cats, which are therefore considered to be a major reservoir for human infection. Cats can also be infected by members of Anaplasmataceae, which are rickettsial organisms that infect human and animal leukocytes [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
