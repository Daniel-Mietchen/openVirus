<p>Domestic cats were selected based on their non-vaccinated and non-neutered status as well as their owned, free-roaming behavior. All of them were mix-breed, domestic short-haired cats. EDTA-anticoagulated blood and serum samples collected through manual restraint, by cephalic or jugular venipuncture were preserved at −20°C until further processing. The collection of samples was performed with the informed consent of the owners and under considerations of animal welfare and ethical aspects under the approval of Animal Ethics committee of the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity in Universidad de Chile, resolution of 20 November 2015.</p>
