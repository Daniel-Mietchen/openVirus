<p>We detected an occurrence of 13.3% for 
 <italic>A. platys</italic>, an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae, described mainly in dogs from various regions of the world such as Brazil [
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], Venezuela [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Japan [
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], causing infectious canine cyclic thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus 
 <italic>sensu lato</italic> is suspected to be involved as its principal vector [
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The presence of 
 <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> in Chile has been described from Arica in the north (18°29′01ʺS) to Valdivia in the south (39°49′11ʺS) [
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although the mode of transmission of 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> in cats is unknown, 
 <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> has been described parasitizing cats [
 <xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. 
 <italic>Anaplasma-</italic>like bodies have been detected in cat platelets and molecular detection of 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> has been reported in cats from Brazil, Thailand and North America [
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], however the clinical implication of 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> in cats is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first description of 
 <italic>A. platys</italic> in domestic cats in Chile.
