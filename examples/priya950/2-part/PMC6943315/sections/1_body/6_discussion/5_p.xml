<p>With reference to the molecular detection of piroplasmids, DNA detection of 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> was recorded in one individual. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, Central and South America are considered among the endemic regions of 
 <italic>Theileria equi</italic> [
 <xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The disease is readily identified in all regions of South America with the exception of the southernmost areas of Chile and Argentina [
 <xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> is transmitted to equids by ticks of the genera 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A sequence from a free-roaming domestic cat caught within a Brazilian zoo showed 94% identity with 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> [
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, reports of 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> in domestic cats are rare. To our knowledge, our study constitutes the first report of 
 <italic>T. equi</italic> in Chile.
