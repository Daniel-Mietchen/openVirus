<p>The occurrence of vector-borne pathogens was higher in rural Valdivia, the northern part of the study area, compared to rural Chiloe Island, in the south [
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], analyzed different vector-borne agents infecting Darwinâ€™s fox from Chiloe Island and found only one animal positive for 
 <italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp. A wide range of factors (e.g., climatic differences, human and animal population dynamics) may affect the occurrence and spread of vector-borne pathogens [
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The main factor that could explain the difference in vector borne occurrence between the two study areas is the distribution of 
 <italic>R. sanguineous</italic> in Chile; Valdivia is the southern distribution limit of this tick, it is therefore absent from Chiloe Island [

 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Other drivers may lie behind the observed occurrence difference, such as different cat abundance or cat population migratory flows [
 <xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], which could be limited on Chiloe Island due to its intrinsic isolation, posing an obstacle for the arrival of pathogens. However, small sample size for vector-borne pathogen detection in this study suggests our results constitute only preliminary data, and therefore more analyses are needed.
