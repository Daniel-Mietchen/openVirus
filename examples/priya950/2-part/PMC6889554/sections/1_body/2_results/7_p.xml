<p id="Par51">The Bayesian inference revealed that the Brazilian GII.17_2014 strains detected in this study have high similarities and belonged to clade D (epidemic strain) with TMRCA estimated in 2010 (2009–2012). Temporal and spatial analysis estimated that the strains detected in this study most likely originated from China. The strains were spread in Brazil from Hong Kong/China through Amazonas state. Lineages of GII.17_2014 were observed in Amazonas and Pará State. The TMRCA for these lineages was estimated in the year 2013 (2013–2015) with mutation rates of 1.97 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> (1.28 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> –2.66 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>) and 2.05 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> (1.38 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>–2.77 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>) substitutions/site/year, respectively (Fig.
