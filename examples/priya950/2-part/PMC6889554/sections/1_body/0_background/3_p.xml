<p id="Par25">Morphologically, NoV is a small, non-enveloped virus, exhibiting icosahedral symmetry with a diameter ranging from 27 to 40 nm. NoV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is organized in three open reading frames (ORF). The ORF1 encodes six non-structural proteins, which are involved in viral replication. The ORF2 encodes the largest structural protein (VP1), which is subdivided into shell (S) e protruding (P) domains. Within the P domain there is a highly variable region called P2 that is essential for virion binding with the host cell histo-blood group antigens (HBGA). The ORF3 encodes the smallest structural protein (VP2) [
