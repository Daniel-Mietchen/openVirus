<p id="Par57">In the Amazon, there was an increase in the circulation of emerging NoV strains during 2015â€“2016. In 2016, Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported the presence of GII.17_2014 genotype among children hospitalized in northern Brazil for the first time, with a frequency of 38.5% (5/13). In a study with Argentinian patients with AGE, this variant was detected in 25% (1/4) of the samples. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis revealed that this genotype presented characteristics of the emergent strain that circulated in Asian countries [
