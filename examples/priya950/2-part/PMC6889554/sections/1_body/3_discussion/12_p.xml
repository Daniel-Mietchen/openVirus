<p id="Par67">In this study, the identified changes modified the chemical nature of amino acid at positions 294 to 296, 393/395, and 407, which may have an impact on the properties and structure of the P2 domain of the virus. Additionally, all these positions are located at the outer points in the viral capsid structure and are part of exposed loops. The study by Lindesmith et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] demonstrated changes in residues 393â€“396 that may have contributed to the emergence of new variants of GII.17. These findings reinforce the notion that a new antigenic variant with the pandemic potential may occur by the accumulation of mutations in several sites in the subdomain P2 [
