<p id="Par63">The phylogenetic trees obtained in this study demonstrated that all the Brazilian strains were grouped in clade D, which were the strains responsible for the epidemic that occurred in Asia since 2014. Sang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggested that strains from clades C and D, which were responsible for outbreaks in different countries, are two distinct variants as they are genetically distinct and that the minimum amino acid distance between them is 4.2%. The clade D variant replaced clade C in the 2014â€“2015 epidemics. Our study obtained similar amino acids variation (4.72%), corroborating with the earlier findings.
