<p id="Par59">With the emergence of the new GII.17_2014 strain, there was a need to design new primers that efficiently amplify the VP1 region of the viral genome. Therefore, the primers designed in this study aimed to amplify the whole VP1 region into two large fragments. The primers described in the literature were included in this study to amplify the virus genome analysis region (ORF1 and ORF3).</p>
