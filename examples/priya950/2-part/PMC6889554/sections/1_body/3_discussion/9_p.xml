<p id="Par64">The mutation rate for strain GII.17 determined in this study was 1.95 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> substitutions/site/year with the TMRCA estimated in 1881. Sang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] identified an evolution rate of 1.68 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> substitutions/site/year for GII.17, which is similar to the rate obtained in this study. Our investigation also corroborated with the results obtained by Parra et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which indicated that GII.17 were a static genotype accumulating only a few amino acid mutations over years.
