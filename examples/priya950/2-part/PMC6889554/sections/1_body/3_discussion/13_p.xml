<p id="Par68">Furthermore, two insertions were observed at positions Asp377 and Gly397. These residues interact with the fucose of the HBGA in the GII.4 strains. According to Singh et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], this insertion at the loop harboring Asp378 does not change the orientation of the side chain of the protein and consequently does not alter the binding mechanism at this position. These inserts were also described by Chan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], but the role of these changes in virus binding with HBGA remains unclear.
