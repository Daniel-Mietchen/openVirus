<p id="Par37">Four genomic fragments containing the NoV polymerase and VP1 regions were amplified by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR was performed in a 25-μL reaction volume comprising 8 μL of viral RNA, 16 μL of reagent mixture (0.5 μL H
 <sub>2</sub>O-free DNAse/RNAse, 12.5 μL of 2X Reaction Mix, 1 μL of each primer, 1 μL SuperScript® III RT/Platinum™ Taq Mix), and 1 μL of DMSO. The PCR conditions were as follows: For primers II.17-3F,3R and II.17- 4F,4R [45 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 3 mins, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 90 s, and finally 68 °C for 5 min]; For primers LNOV 5KF/5KR [45 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and finally 72 °C for 10 min]; primers LNOV 6KF/6KR [45 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 72 °C for 10 min]. The amplicons were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, USA).
