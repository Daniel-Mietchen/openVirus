<p id="Par44">Three-dimensional structure of proteins was constructed employing a protein homology modeling. The initial search and selection were performed using Protein Data Bank (PDB), with the NoV capsule GII.17_2014 as the initial parameter. Modeller 9.15 software was used to construct the three-dimensional models. After protein modeling, these models were validated using Procheck and Verify 3D to confirm the quality of the biochemical parameters [

Molecular docking was performed using the three dimensional structures of P2 protein constructed by homology modelling and HBGA using the Autodock Vina software, which uses Genetic Algorithm to define the best binding site and superimposes with the structures [
