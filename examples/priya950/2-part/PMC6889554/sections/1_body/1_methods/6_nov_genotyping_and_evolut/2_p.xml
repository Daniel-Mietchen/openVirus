<p id="Par40">The sequences were aligned using the Mafft 7 algorithm in Aliview 1.17.1 alignment viewer and editor software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the MEGA 6.06 software and the phylogenetic trees were generated by the maximum likelihood method with GTR + I + G4 nucleotide substitution model in jModelTest v. 2.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with 1000 bootstraps. Evolutionary distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model [
