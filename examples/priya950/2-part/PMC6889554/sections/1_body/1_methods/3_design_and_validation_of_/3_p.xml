<p id="Par33">The RNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Alemanha). Initially, a one-step RT-PCR was performed with the temperature gradient ranging from 44.9–58 °C to identify the ideal annealing temperature. The validation tests were performed in triplicates on three different days by two analysts using the same samples (control sample GII.17_2014 previously sequenced) under the same conditions for a period of up to 48 h [
