<p id="Par32">The primers were designed based on multiple alignments of GII.17 norovirus genome sequences available in GenBank (including Brazilian strain) using the Geneious 10.0.6 and Primer3 softwares. The parameters used for primer designing were as follows: minimum size of 1000 bp for the first pair (LNOV 5KF/5KR) and 550 bp for the second pair (LNOV 6KF/6KR), melting temperature (tm) of approximately 60 °C and medium GC content of 55%. The polymerase region was amplified using the II.17-3F, 3R and II.17-4F, 4R primers as described by Xue et al. [
