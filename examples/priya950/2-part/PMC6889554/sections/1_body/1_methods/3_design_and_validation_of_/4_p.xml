<p id="Par34">Positive and negative controls (CP = 5; CN = 5) were tested in three rounds in the same thermocycler by the same two analysts. The detection limit (LD) was determined using the serially diluted (10
 <sup>1</sup>–10
 <sup>9</sup>) total RNA samples (RNAse-free water was used for dilution). The fluorometric quantitation of total RNA was performed for the previously sequenced GII.17_2014 sample in a QubitTM Fluorometer (Invitrogen) apparatus using the Qubit® RNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The initial concentration of extracted undiluted viral RNA was 6.0 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> ng/μL. The RT-PCR was performed in a single step using the One-Step SuperScript III RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amplification of the NoV partial genome was performed using five sets of primers to amplify the viral polymerase (ORF1) and capsid (ORF 2) regions. The amplicons were visualized in 1.5% agarose gels.
