<p>Weaknesses: The weaknesses are minor. However, the approach brings up two points. First, in theory minor changes in the viral genome at the target site could reduce or ablate resistance by altering the ability of the scFv to neutralize. The authors discussed this in their paper and thought they could manage this outcome through selection of other scFVs transgenes, but these may run into the same problem. Nevertheless this approach may drive evolution/selection of viruses that fail to interact with these transgene effectors. Perhaps building transgenics with multiple transgenes may mitigate the ability of DENVs to adapt to any one transgene and designing a mosquito with a combination of effector gene approaches may be a future goal. Second, the fitness of the TADV-A may be further improved by introgressing the scFv transgene into a field-collected (true wild-type) strain of Aedes aegypti since the progenitor HWE strain contains recessive lethals that compromise fitness. However, I view these as minor issues for this paper. Please address.</p>
