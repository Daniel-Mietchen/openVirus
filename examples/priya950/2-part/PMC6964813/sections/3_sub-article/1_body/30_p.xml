<p>Reviewer #1: The authors present new genetically engineered Ae. aegypti strain expressing a highly and broadly cross-neutralizing single chain antibody against DENV. They demonstrate through a series of experiments that these engineered mosquitoes can effectively (100%) inhibit the infection, dissemination and transmission of all four serotypes of DENV. Further, they demonstrate that their strain is even more effective than Wolbachia, which is currently the gold standard for DENV inhibition. Overall this is a very exciting and impactful manuscript. Below are my critiques.</p>
