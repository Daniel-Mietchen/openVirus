<p>Therefore, there has been increasing interest in the development of engineered gene-drive technologies, which are able to rapidly transmit themselves and any linked “cargo” genes, such as anti-pathogen effectors, through wild disease-transmitting populations [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] such that only a few releases of modest amounts of engineered insects could drive desirable cargo genes through wild populations, making them efficient and cost effective for vector control. To achieve disease reduction, such gene-drive systems need to be linked to useful “cargo”, such as effective anti-pathogen genes, and several approaches for engineering

 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while another described miRNA cassettes targeting DENV-3 that reduced viral transmission rates[

 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, all previous approaches have been limited by their ability to target only one or two—not all four—major DENV serotypes. Because hyperendemicity of DENV in tropical areas is frequent[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and secondary DENV infection has been linked to severe dengue disease (SDD), refractory mosquitoes should be capable of blocking all serotypes or risk being ineffective in controlling dengue epidemics. Therefore, better anti-DENV effectors are needed.
