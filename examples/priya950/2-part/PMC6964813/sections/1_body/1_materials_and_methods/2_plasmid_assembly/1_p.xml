<p>To generate vector OA984 (the anti-DENV scFv-antibody transgene), several components were cloned into the 
 <italic>PiggyBac</italic> plasmid pBac[3xP3-DsRed] (a kind gift from R. Harrell) using Gibson assembly/enzymatic assembly (EA) cloning [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. First, a 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> codon-optimized tdTomato marker was amplified with primers 984.1A and 984.1B (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008103.s006">S2 Table</xref> for all primers) from a gene synthesized vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into a XhoI/FseI-digested pBac[3xP3-DsRed] backbone using EA cloning. The resulting plasmid was digested with AscI, and the following components were cloned in via EA cloning: the predicted 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> carboxypeptidase promoter [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] amplified from 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> genomic DNA using primers 984.2A and 984.2B, a GFP sequence amplified from vector pMos[3xP3-eGFP] [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] with primers 984.3A and 984.3B, and a 677-bp p10 3â€™ untranslated region (UTR) amplified with primers 984.4A and 984.4B from vector pJFRC81-10XUAS-IVS-Syn21-GFP-p10 (Addgene plasmid #36432). The anti-DENV scFv was then subcloned into the final vector from a gene-synthesized plasmid (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) using PmeI and PacI sites and traditional ligation cloning. Annotated plasmid sequences and plasmid DNA are available via Addgene (plasmid #120363).
