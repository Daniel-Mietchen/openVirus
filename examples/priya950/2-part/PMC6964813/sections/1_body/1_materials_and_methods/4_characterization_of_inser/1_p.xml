<p>To characterize the insertion site of vector OA984 or OA984-HA in transgenic mosquitoes, we adapted a previously described inverse polymerase chain reaction (iPCR) protocol [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] as follows. First, genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 10 transgenic fourth instar larvae using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen #69504) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Two separate restriction digests were performed on the gDNA (at 100 ng/μL) to characterize the 5’ and 3’ ends of the 
 <italic>PiggyBac</italic> insertion using Sau3AI (5’ reaction) or HinP1I (3’ reaction) restriction enzymes. A ligation step using NEB T4 DNA Ligase (NEB #M0202S) was performed on the restriction digest products to circularize digested gDNA fragments, and two subsequent rounds of PCR were carried out per ligation using the corresponding 
 <italic>PiggyBac</italic> primers listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008103.s007">S3 Table</xref>. The final PCR products were cleaned up using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen #28004) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol and were sequenced via Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience, Nottingham, UK). To confirm the transgene insertion locus and orientation via PCR, primers were designed based on iPCR-mapped genomic regions and used in tandem with 
 <italic>PiggyBac</italic> primers based on their location as listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008103.s007">S3 Table</xref>. Sequencing data then was blasted to the AaegL5.0 reference genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The sequencing data was aligned with SeqManPro (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) to determine the orientation of the transgene insertion site. Analysis of the sequencing data indicated that the insertion site for TADV-A is on chromosome 2 (approximate position 310,340,476), the insertion site for TADV-B is on chromosome 2 (approximate position 301,489,980), and the insertion site for TADV-C is on chromosome 1 (approximate position 30,451,048) when aligned to the AaegL5 assembly (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_002204515.1)[
