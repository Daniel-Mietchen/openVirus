<p>To determine whether expressing an anti-DENV antibody in mosquitoes could confer resistance to DENV, we first needed to engineer a broadly neutralizing antibody that was compatible with mosquitoes and could be expressed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in its desired form. We chose 1C19 as our model due to its ability to cross-neutralize multiple DENV serotypes in humans[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As it is a human monoclonal antibody, however, it cannot be unobtrusively expressed in mosquitoes, so a new form that is both compatible with mosquitoes and maintains its neutralization capabilities had to be designed. We then choose to engineer an scFv comprising the linked variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains because this format removes the human-specific constant region that could impart difficulties in a mosquito and it can be expressed in one “chunk” in an organism without the need for additional 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> processing. To do this, sequences for the 1C19 VH and VL chains were obtained from hybridoma cells expressing the human monoclonal antibody[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We then engineered a scFv comprising the VH and VL domains of 1C19 linked using a 15-amino-acid repeating glycine-serine [G(4)S]3 linker[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] that was codon-optimized for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. We also engineered a version of this 1C19 scFv that was fused with a 3’ 30-amino-acid human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, commonly used as a general expression tag, reasoning that it might be useful in downstream expression analyses. To conditionally drive expression of the 1C19 scFvs in the midgut of female mosquitoes following a blood meal, which would ensure 1C19 expression any time the mosquito was in contact with DENV, we used the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> carboxypeptidase (CP) promoter [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which should induce expression in the midgut following blood ingestion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008103.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). (Previous findings determined that the CP promoter induces enhanced transcription of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> CPA mRNA after a blood meal and a somewhat moderate expression in sugar-fed mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].)The engineered anti-DENV transgenes (termed plasmid OA984 for the untagged version and plasmid OA984-HA for the HA-tagged version) also contained an eye-specific 3xP3 promoter[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], driving expression of tdTomato as a fluorescent transgenesis marker. Following the typical transgenesis procedure in mosquitoes, consisting of embryonic microinjection and G
 <sub>0</sub> outcrossing, multiple independent transgenic lines (n = 6) were readily identified in the G
 <sub>1</sub> generation via the robust expression of tdTomato fluorescence; three of the lines with the strongest marker expression (termed Transgenic Anti-DENV [TADV]-A, containing OA984; and TADV-B and C, containing OA984-HA) were selected for further experiments. We carried out inverse PCR (iPCR) on genomic DNA extracted from the transgenic mosquitoes to verify the transgene insertion site and performed backcrosses to WT for multiple generations to ensure that the transgenic lines represented single chromosomal insertions, and were able to confirm that, in all three independent lines, the anti-DENV transgenes were stably integrated into single chromosomes.
