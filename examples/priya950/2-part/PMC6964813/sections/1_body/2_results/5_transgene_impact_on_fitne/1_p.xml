<p>To determine whether the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv had any significant fitness effects on transgenic mosquitoes, we assessed several fitness parameters including larval to pupal development time, male and female fecundity and fertility, male mating success, and longevity (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No significant differences were observed between WT and TADV-A mosquitoes when examining male mating success and fecundity and fertility in both males and females (
