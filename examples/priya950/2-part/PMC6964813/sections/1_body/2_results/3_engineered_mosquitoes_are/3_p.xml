<p>To assay for viral dissemination to the rest of the mosquito body, total RNA was collected from whole TADV-A mosquito carcasses (without midguts) and dissected midguts from both homozygous and heterozygous mosquitoes at 14 dpi. The results from three biological replicates indicated that none of the homozygous TADV-A mosquitoes (n = 30) were positive for viral replication (dissemination) in either the midgut or the midgut-free carcass (

Finally, as transmission occurs through the saliva, viral transmission rates were determined by collecting the saliva from individual mosquitoes at 14 dpi and measuring the DENV-2 titers using an assay for the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). No DENV-2 was detected in the saliva of homozygous TADV-A mosquitoes (n = 30) (
