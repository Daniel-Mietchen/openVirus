Recent advances in genetic engineering technologies have made it possible to create mosquitoes with reduced vector competence, limiting their ability to acquire and transmit pathogens. Here we describe the development of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes synthetically engineered to impede vector competence to DENV. These mosquitoes express a gene encoding an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing DENV human monoclonal antibody and have significantly reduced viral infection, dissemination, and transmission rates for all four major antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. Importantly, this is the first engineered approach that targets all DENV serotypes, which is crucial for effective disease suppression. These results provide a compelling route for developing effective genetic-based DENV control strategies, which could be extended to curtail other arboviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>With limited success of traditional vector control methods to curb dengue infections and more than half of the world&#x02019;s population still at risk, there is a need for novel strategies to reduce its impact on public health. Recent advances in genetic technologies has allowed for precise modifications of mosquito genome to make them resistant to infections, thus breaking the transmission cycle. Here we generated engineered <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes efficiently expressing a DENV-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a previously characterized broadly neutralizing human antibody, which blocked infection and transmission in these mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an engineered transgene capable of rendering <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes 100% refractory to all four serotypes of DENV. The engineered mosquitoes, in future, could easily be paired with a gene drive, capable of spreading the transgene throughout wild disease-transmitting mosquito populations and preventing further DENV transmission. Since a number of diverse and well-characterized antibodies exist against other arboviruses (eg chikungunya and Zika, this work also provides a proof-of-concept principle for developing similar genetic strategies for reducing the impact of these arboviruses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR0011-17-2- 0047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6853-9884</contrib-id><name><surname>Akbari</surname><given-names>Omar S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by a Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Safe Genes Program Grant (HR0011-17-2- 0047) awarded to O.S.A. and a NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Award (1R21AI123937) awarded to O.S.A and CSIRO internal funding to P.N.P.

Transmitted by infected mosquitoes, DENV infection typically manifests as severe fever, headaches, and myalgia[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and can advance to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Global incidences of DENV and its associated economic burden have increased dramatically in recent years [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with over 50% of the world&#x02019;s population now at risk of infection[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and 390 million documented infections per year[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for an estimated $40 billion in economic losses annually[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, there are currently no specific treatments nor preventive prophylactic measures [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] because the single commercially available vaccine [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is only partially effective [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and due to increased risk of severe dengue illness and hospitalization among certain groups, its use is prevented in many contexts [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Current control measures including the removal of standing water and the use of chemical insecticides have had limited success in reducing <italic>Aedes</italic> populations [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and, thereby, incidences of DENV[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and can instead cause insecticide resistance and behavioral changes such as a shift in biting times[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, novel vector control strategies[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], like the use of genetically modified mosquitoes to either suppress mosquito populations or render mosquitoes unable to transmit pathogens[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], are increasingly needed. For example, the development and deployment of a genetic Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)-like system termed Release of Insect Dominant Lethal (RIDL) has had some success in reducing <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito populations in the wild[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, releases of mosquitoes artificially infected with the intracellular endosymbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, which can make infected males incapable of successfully mating with uninfected females in an SIT-like manner and can inhibit mosquito infection with pathogens such as DENV and ZIKV[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], have also been carried out. These have been intended to either suppress mosquito populations or make them less likely to transmit pathogens, and may hold promise for reducing the incidence of disease [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, these technologies require releases of large numbers of insects&#x02014;and must be carried out on an ongoing basis for RIDL and <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based SIT&#x02014;for continued vector control, which is laborious and expensive.</p><p>Therefore, there has been increasing interest in the development of engineered gene-drive technologies, which are able to rapidly transmit themselves and any linked &#x0201c;cargo&#x0201d; genes, such as anti-pathogen effectors, through wild disease-transmitting populations [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] such that only a few releases of modest amounts of engineered insects could drive desirable cargo genes through wild populations, making them efficient and cost effective for vector control. To achieve disease reduction, such gene-drive systems need to be linked to useful &#x0201c;cargo&#x0201d;, such as effective anti-pathogen genes, and several approaches for engineering <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> resistance to DENV have been attempted. For example, one study used RNA interference by employing inverted RNA repeats to target DENV-2 in a conditional and tissue-specific manner[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while another described miRNA cassettes targeting DENV-3 that reduced viral transmission rates[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition to using synthetic small RNAs, others have taken advantage of the mosquito&#x02019;s innate antiviral JAK/STAT pathway to increase resistance to DENV-2 and DENV-4[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, all previous approaches have been limited by their ability to target only one or two&#x02014;not all four&#x02014;major DENV serotypes. Because hyperendemicity of DENV in tropical areas is frequent[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and secondary DENV infection has been linked to severe dengue disease (SDD), refractory mosquitoes should be capable of blocking all serotypes or risk being ineffective in controlling dengue epidemics.

Here, we engineer <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> to express a 1C19-based, broadly neutralizing, single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that is capable of neutralizing all four DENV serotypes[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Crucially, we demonstrate that mosquitoes expressing this anti-DENV scFv cannot be infected with or transmit any of the four DENV serotypes and have few significant fitness costs conferred by the presence of the antibody.

To determine the larval to pupal development time of transgenic and WT control mosquitoes, the larvae were allowed to pupate, and pupae were collected and counted every day until no pupae were left.

After three days, egg papers were collected, and the eggs were counted and vacuum hatched in nine-ounce plastic cups. Starting on the fourth day, the larvae were counted every day until no larvae were present. Female fecundity refers to the number of eggs laid per female, and fertility reflects the number of eggs hatching to produce larvae. To measure male mating success, fecundity, and fertility, one TADV-A transgenic or WT male was mated to five WT females in a single mesh-covered cup filled with water and lined with egg paper. Three days post blood meal, the cups were checked for the presence of eggs, which were collected, counted, and hatched. Hatched larvae were then counted every day until no larvae were present. Male mating success was calculated as the percentage of single male outcrosses that produced larvae.

We then engineered a scFv comprising the VH and VL domains of 1C19 linked using a 15-amino-acid repeating glycine-serine [G(4)S]3 linker[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] that was codon-optimized for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. We also engineered a version of this 1C19 scFv that was fused with a 3&#x02019; 30-amino-acid human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, commonly used as a general expression tag, reasoning that it might be useful in downstream expression analyses. To conditionally drive expression of the 1C19 scFvs in the midgut of female mosquitoes following a blood meal, which would ensure 1C19 expression any time the mosquito was in contact with DENV, we used the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> carboxypeptidase (CP) promoter [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which should induce expression in the midgut following blood ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008103.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). (Previous findings determined that the CP promoter induces enhanced transcription of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> CPA mRNA after a blood meal and a somewhat moderate expression in sugar-fed mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].)The engineered anti-DENV transgenes (termed plasmid OA984 for the untagged version and plasmid OA984-HA for the HA-tagged version) also contained an eye-specific 3xP3 promoter[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], driving expression of tdTomato as a fluorescent transgenesis marker. Following the typical transgenesis procedure in mosquitoes, consisting of embryonic microinjection and G<sub>0</sub> outcrossing, multiple independent transgenic lines (n = 6) were readily identified in the G<sub>1</sub> generation via the robust expression of tdTomato fluorescence; three of the lines with the strongest marker expression (termed Transgenic Anti-DENV [TADV]-A, containing OA984; and TADV-B and C, containing OA984-HA) were selected for further experiments. We carried out inverse PCR (iPCR) on genomic DNA extracted from the transgenic mosquitoes to verify the transgene insertion site and performed backcrosses to WT for multiple generations to ensure that the transgenic lines represented single chromosomal insertions, and were able to confirm that, in all three independent lines, the anti-DENV transgenes were stably integrated into single chromosomes.</p><fig id="ppat.1008103.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1008103.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Effect of anti-dengue virus (DENV) single-chain variable fragment (scFv) on DENV titers of TADV-A, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected (<italic>w</italic>Mel), and wildtype (WT) mosquitoes.</title><p>(A) Schematic of experiment.

After the infected blood meal enters the mosquito midgut, there are two potential outcomes: in the first (applies for all tested strains), the virus replicates and disseminates past the midgut to become transmissible; in the second (applies to TADV-A mosquitoes), the anti-DENV transgene expresses scFv antibodies in the midgut that bind to the virus and neutralize it.

While mosquitoes homozygous for the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv showed complete refractoriness to DENV infection, heterozygous mosquitoes were still partially refractory to DENV infection, dissemination, and transmission, with significant, several orders-of-magnitude reductions in viral titers in the saliva. Given previous characterizations of the 1C19 scFv antibody, we presume that it achieves this refractoriness because, when it is secreted into the epithelium of the posterior midgut in mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], it binds to the exposed fusion loop of DENV and inhibits the virus particle from releasing its genome into the cytoplasm for replication. Based on previous findings, it is likely that this significant reduction in viral titers would be sufficient to render heterozygous mosquitoes unable to transmit DENV to a susceptible host[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Though this remains to be demonstrated, our results show that heterozygous 1C19 scFv antibody-expressing transgenic mosquitoes are just as efficient at viral suppression as&#x02014;and homozygous mosquitoes are significantly more efficient than&#x02014;<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes, which are currently being released for DENV control because they are known to be refractory to DENV[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>The difference in refractory levels in the homozygous versus heterozygous mosquitoes also suggests that the refractory phenotype is particularly sensitive to scFv antibody expression levels, a phenomenon previously observed with anti-malarial scFv transgenes [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and anti-ZIKV synthetic small RNA transgenes [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. If this means that complete refractoriness is susceptible to positional effects, e.g., not refractory when the scFv antibody transgene is expressed from a different, possibly more weakly expressing genomic insertion position, the identification of more robust midgut-specific promoters may help to ensure sufficiently high expression levels from a single copy of the transgene regardless of insertion site, as can the use of multiple anti-DENV scFv antibodies in a single transgene [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additionally, while we observed no significant reduction in multiple fitness parameters in transgenic mosquitoes when compared to WT, some differences in fitness were observed, and more extensive analyses on fitness of both infected and uninfected transgenic heterozygotes and homozygotes (possibly after introgression with a field-collected mosquito strain) would have to be performed before use of such mosquitoes in the field.</p><p>The strategy we describe here provides an efficient &#x0201c;cargo&#x0201d; gene that can be coupled with a gene-drive system to reduce or eliminate the risk of DENV transmission by mosquitoes. In fact, previous efforts have demonstrated effective Cas9-mediated homing-based gene drives in malaria vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and even <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, since homing-based drive systems quickly convert heterozygotes to homozygotes [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], linking the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv antibody described here to such a drive system could, in theory, rapidly convert wild mosquito populations into transgenic homozygotes that would be completely resistant to DENV transmission. Of paramount importance to the viability of such an approach is the evolutionary stability of the refractory transgene, specifically in terms of the likelihood of viral-resistant evolution. Indeed, several studies have shown that, in some contexts, DENV can rapidly evolve resistance in response to neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and this may be especially likely in the TADV-A heterozygotes described in this study. However, this potentially can be managed through the selection of antibodies with mechanisms/epitopes that minimize the chance of evolved resistance and the use of a combination of distinct anti-DENV antibodies (many of which have been described, e.g.,[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]), as well as a combination of antibody and non-antibody based DENV refractoriness transgenes (e.g., [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; [<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>])). The deployment of such a pan-serotype-targeting strategy could serve as an effective component of a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence and impact of DENV.</p><p>Due to similarities within viral families, this research could have far-reaching consequences for rendering mosquitoes resistant to other arboviruses like ZIKV and CHIKV by using similar genetic engineering strategies to develop scFv-based transgenes. Multiple potent antibodies that effectively neutralize these various mosquito-borne viruses have also been identified in the last decade[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Although not all of these will confer robust viral resistance when expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> in mosquitoes, the availability of diverse, well-characterized antibodies of this sort, largely as a result of antibody therapeutic development efforts[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], should allow for the identification of those that function within the desired context. Given the increasing incidence of disease caused by these viruses and the resulting global health implications, such scFv-based transgenes coupled with gene-drive systems[<xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] can provide an effective, sustainable, and comprehensive strategy for reducing the impact of arboviral mosquito-borne diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1008103.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Expression correlation analyses of gene expression levels (indicated by TPM [transcripts per million] values) in dissected midgut tissues from WT or transgenic (TADV-A, -B, or -C) mosquitoes without a blood meal (A) and 24 hours after a blood meal (B).</bold> The y-axis corresponds to TPM values in WT samples, and the x-axis corresponds to TPM values in respective transgenic samples.

They demonstrate through a series of experiments that these engineered mosquitoes can effectively (100%) inhibit the infection, dissemination and transmission of all four serotypes of DENV. Further, they demonstrate that their strain is even more effective than Wolbachia, which is currently the gold standard for DENV inhibition. Overall this is a very exciting and impactful manuscript. Below are my critiques.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The study by Buchman et al generated Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that produce a single chain antibody that is capable of neutralizing all four strains of Dengue virus. The paper is well written and contains necessary controls and experiments for the conclusions they are drawing. They engineered the antibody expression to coincide with blood meal digestion to limit expression and find it had little impact on mosquito fitness. Mosquitoes homozygous for the antibody appear completely refractory for virus whereas heterozygotes tested positive for virus, but contained significantly lower quantities of virus. They include Wolbachia infected mosquitoes to compare their results with other well-established strategies to decrease mosquito competence for Dengue transmission. They find that the heterozygotes carrying the antibody decrease viral quantities similar to Wolbachia infected mosquitoes and homozygotes are more effective. While outside of this particular study, I cannot help but wonder how quickly Dengue will be able to escape neutralization from a single antibody. This is a very provocative study demonstrating a new method to decrease dengue spread. Future work would require incorporating antibody expression with a potent gene drive.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This is a very elegant study where transgenic Aedes aegypti expressing an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing dengue virus human monoclonal antibody are refractory to all four dengue virus serotypes. As such the study can be considered a significant advance that paves the way to develop transgenic mosquito-based dengue control. One weakness is the lack of basic biological insight.</p><p>Reviewer #4: Strengths: This paper by Buchman et al builds on previous work by the group where they engineered miRNAs in Aedes aegypti for resistance to DENV1-4. In the paper under review, they have engineered Mab 1C19 as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to build an effector transgene for resistance to multiple DENV serotypes. The key innovative aspect of this work is the development of the scFv from IC19 since the monoclone has broad neutralzing activity against the four serotypes. This type of approach (targeting all four serotypes) has been a 'holy grail' of geneticists/arbovirologists interested in designing Aedes aegypti for resistance to DENVs and furthers population replacement strategies/approaches. This research group also has a continued interest in developing antiviral transgenes in the context of gene drive so this might all come together. An important feature of this work is the IC19 scFv expression levels are increased with homozygosity generating apparent complete resistance to DENV1-4. It was a nice touch to compare DENV resistance of TADV-A vs wMel Wolbachia infected mosquitoes. The paper is well written and follows a logical experimental approach for developing transgenesis and characterizing transgene efficiency and a DENV 1-4 resistance phenotype.</p><p>Weaknesses: The weaknesses are minor. However, the approach brings up two points. First, in theory minor changes in the viral genome at the target site could reduce or ablate resistance by altering the ability of the scFv to neutralize. The authors discussed this in their paper and thought they could manage this outcome through selection of other scFVs transgenes, but these may run into the same problem. Nevertheless this approach may drive evolution/selection of viruses that fail to interact with these transgene effectors. Perhaps building transgenics with multiple transgenes may mitigate the ability of DENVs to adapt to any one transgene and designing a mosquito with a combination of effector gene approaches may be a future goal. Second, the fitness of the TADV-A may be further improved by introgressing the scFv transgene into a field-collected (true wild-type) strain of Aedes aegypti since the progenitor HWE strain contains recessive lethals that compromise fitness. However, I view these as minor issues for this paper. Please address.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #3: The authors could have elaborated more on biological aspects, such as the RNAseq data (unlikely that no endogenous mosquito gene were not regulated). The authors should also elaborate on the fitness data that did show some interesting patterns especially for dengue virus 1.The comparison between the transgenic mosquitoes and Wolbachia only involved one virus strain (a lab strain) so one should be cautious with the interpretation of that data.</p><p><bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold></p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1: 1. The following excerpt is a run-on sentence and should be changed. Line numbering would have been helpful.</p><p>&#x0201c;Moreover, releases of mosquitoes artificially infected with the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia, which can make infected males incapable of successfully mating with uninfected females in an SIT-like manner and can inhibit mosquito infection with pathogens such as DENV and ZIKV(Aliota et al., 2016;Walker et al., 2011), have also been carried out to either suppress mosquito populations or make them less likely to transmit pathogens, and may hold promise for reducing incidence of disease(Moreira et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2017).&#x0201d;</p><p>2. A description of the carboxypeptidase promoter should be presented. Presumably, it is constitutively expressed and only translated following a bloodmeal? This should be included somewhere in the manuscript.</p><p>3. It is unclear where this scFv is expressed. Is it secreted, membrane bound or cytosolic? There was no mention of its localization. If it is secreted how does the antibody bind the virus prior to infection? Presumably, transcripts will be translated upon bloodfeeding (see above comment), but temporally how does this align with the rate of midgut infection? Can the antibodies still block infection after internalization into early endosomes? I am not suggesting this paper needs to be converted into a mechanistic paper, but it should discuss these questions.</p><p>4. The first paragraph of the discussion discusses how heterozygous mosquitoes could be sufficient to halt transmission due to their reduction in transmission. This may or may not be true which is acknowledged; however, if this argument that heterozygous mosquitoes could be effectively used in nature if needed than it would have been nice to see the fitness studies expanded to include the TADV-A heterozygotes.</p><p>5. The authors discuss the possibility of escape mutants in the discussion. I don&#x02019;t think this is a major concern in the homozygotes because they demonstrated sterilizing immunity; however, this could be important in heterozygotes.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Minor:</p><p>What was the concentration of virus in the blood-meal? I was unable to find this information in the manuscript.</p><p>Sup Fig 1: Western blots for the Non blood-fed midguts should be run on the same gel as the positives to demonstrate relative expression levels. Running the samples on multiple gels makes things harder to evaluate and potentially makes the background bands more apparent.</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
