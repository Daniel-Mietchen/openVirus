  <p>Schematic of viral liperoxidation by IONzymes for virus inactivation. IONzymes directly contact with IAVs particles and collapses viral lipid envelope via enhancing the level of lipid peroxidation, which further produces free radicals to destroy the neighboring proteins, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein 1, and then impaired various viral structures and functions, resulting in a failed infection into host cells.</p>
