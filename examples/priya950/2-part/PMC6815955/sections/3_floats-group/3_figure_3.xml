   <bold> IONzymes destruct hemagglutination activity of multiple H5 clades. (A)</bold> Phylogenetic analysis of the complete hemagglutinin genes of H5 subtype IAVs from different clades, including clade 0, clade 2.3.2.1, clade 2.3.4, clade 2.3.4.4, and clade 7.2. The complete sequences were chosen to perform multiple sequence alignment by MEGA (Version 6), and then, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred with 1,000 bootstraps. The result is displayed as a dendrogram using iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> HA titer of IONzyme-treated H5 clades, under 2 h. Data shown represent the meansÂ±s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided 
   <italic>t</italic>-test to the control group (IONzymes, 0 mg/mL). **
