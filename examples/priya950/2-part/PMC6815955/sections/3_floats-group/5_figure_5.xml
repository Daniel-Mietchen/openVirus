   <bold> IONzymes reduce IAVs-induced apoptosis 
    <italic>in vitro</italic> and pathogenicity 
    <italic>in vivo</italic>. (A-C)
   </bold> Apoptosis analysis of MDCK cells infected with IONzyme-treated IAVs (H5N1 SY strain) using flow cytometry. MOI = 1 under 24 h p.i.. The proportions of early apoptotic cells (annexin V+ and PI-; A), later apoptotic cells (annexin V+ and PI+; B), and necrotic cells (annexin V- and PI+; C) were analyzed. 
   <bold>(D-G)</bold> BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with IONzyme-treated of IAVs. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Morbidity was evaluated by monitoring weight changes over a 14-day period and was plotted as a percentage of the animals' weights on the day of inoculation (day 0). The data represent the average body weight of each group (n = 5). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Mortality expressed as percent survival. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Representative histopathological changes in H&amp;E (hematoxylin and eosin)-stained lung tissues on day 7 p.i.. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> Viral replication in the lung (n = 3). Data shown represent the means±s.d. of three samples. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided t-test (two groups). **P&lt;0.01. Scale bars: 500 μm.
