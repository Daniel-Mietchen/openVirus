   <bold> Destruction of multiple subtypes of IAVs by IONzymes. (A)</bold> Phylogenetic analysis of the complete hemagglutinin genes of H1~H12 subtype IAVs. The complete sequences were chosen to perform multiple sequence alignment by MEGA (Version 6), and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred with 1,000 bootstraps. The results are displayed as a dendrogram using iTOL (Interactive Tree of Life). 
   <bold>(B-L)</bold> HA and TCID50 titers of IONzyme-treated multiple subtype IAVs under 2 h, including H1(B), H2(C), H3(D), H4(E), H6(F), H7(G), H8(H), H9(I), H10(J) H11(K), and H12(L). Data shown represent the meansÂ±s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided t-test to the control group. *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01.
