   <bold> IONzyme-loaded facemask protects against influenza. (A)</bold> A picture of anti-IAVs mask with eight-layer absorbent filter cotton. Different concentrations of IONzymes were added on the third layer of selected area (5 cm
   <sup>2</sup>), respectively. After drying, IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype) was sprayed onto the eighth layer (the outermost layer). After standing for 0.5 or 1 h, the population of the living virus on the control area or IONzyme-added area were harvested, and then HA and TCID
   <sub>50</sub> titers of H1N1
   <bold> (B)</bold>, H5N1
   <bold> (C)</bold>, and H7N9
   <bold> (D)</bold> IAVs were measured. The data are presented as the mean Â± s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided
   <italic> t</italic>-test to the control group.
