   <bold> IONzymes abolish infectivity of IAVs. (A)</bold> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> titer of IONzyme-treated IAVs (H5N1 SY strain) under 2 h. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Attachment ability of IONzyme-treated IAVs (pretreated for 2 h) on MDCK cells under 1 h. NP protein was detected by flow cytometry. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> MDCK cells were infected with IONzyme-treated IAVs at a MOI of 0.5 or 1. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> At 24 h p.i., the cells were fixed to detect replication by immunofluorescence stain of hemagglutinin protein (green).
   <bold> (D)</bold> Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i. to detect viral release by HA titer. Data shown represent the means±s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided
   <italic> t</italic>-test to the control group.
