<p>In summary, our findings reveal that IONzymes effectively induced lipid peroxidation in viral envelope and dysfunction of neighboring proteins responsible for host infection. IONzymes may perform lipoxidase-like activity in the antiviral process. This viral inactivation via liperoxidation may contribute to understanding antiviral property of iron oxide nanoparticles and other inorganic nanomaterials. In addition, as a typical nanomaterial, IONzymes exhibit features such as multifunctionality, high biocompatibility, high stability and low cost, which will render them competent for serving as a scalable biocidal part of equipment protective against viral infection. Therefore, we propose that IONzymes represent a general antiviral agent against influenza viruses and other enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Nipah virus, all of which represent considerable challenges to national healthcare systems.</p>
