<p>In agreement with these results, examining viral morphology by transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that the lipid envelope of IONzyme-pretreated IAVs was considerably damaged (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). In addition, we examined the neighboring proteins of IAVs, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), and nucleoprotein (NP). As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, hemagglutinin, NA, and M1 proteins were destructed under high concentration of IONzymes (&gt; 1 mg/mL), whereas NP protein appeared to be unaffected. It is well known that hemagglutinin and NA have transmembrane domains in viral lipid and M1 is close to inside of the lipid. It is reasonable that these protein destructions were ascribed to lipid peroxidation. To confirm the relationship between protein destruction and lipid peroxidation, we investigated the extent of the damage of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as a standard protein, in the IONzyme-liposome mixture under neutral pH. As shown in SDS-PAGE result (Figure. S5), BSA was well degraded by IONzyme-liposome system other than single IONzymes. We then tested purified hemagglutinin protein using the same IONzyme-liposome system. The subsequent western blot assay showed that hemagglutinin protein was destructed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>). Together, these findings indicated that lipid peroxidation in liposome induced by IONzymes was able to degrade proteins. Therefore, we concluded that IONzymes induce lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope, and simultaneously compromise the integrity of envelope structure as well as the integrity of neighboring proteins of H5N1 virus.
