<p>Next, we tested whether IONzymes induce lipid peroxidation on the viral envelope of influenza A virus that possesses a liposome-like structure (named henceforth viral lipid envelope). To this end, we incubated IAVs (H5N1 subtype, SY strain, if not specified) with IONzymes at physiological conditions. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and S4, incubation with IONzymes at 4 mg/mL for 2 h resulted in 1.87 ± 1.16 µmol/mg MDA, demonstrating that IONzymes are able to induce lipid peroxidation of the viral envelope of IAVs at neutral pH. Liposome is simply constituted with lipid. The commercial lipid may have been oxidized in the storage and thus already has certain level of MDA before forming liposome. In contrast, a virus is composed of lipid, proteins and nucleic acids, forming a rigid structure with proteins on viral surface. Therefore, no signal was detected in IONzyme-untreated IAVs, presumably because that viruses rather than liposomes possess considerable structural stability under natural conditions.
