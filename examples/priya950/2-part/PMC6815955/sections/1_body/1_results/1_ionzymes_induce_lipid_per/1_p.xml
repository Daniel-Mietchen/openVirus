<p>We synthesized IONzymes using a solvothermal method, a common system to produce inorganic nanocrystal products. As shown in Figures S1, the synthesized IONzymes measured approx. 200 nm in diameter. Importantly, it exhibited a high peroxidase-like activity as demonstrated by the colorimetric reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>) under acidic condition. The catalytic kinetics followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Vmax values to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and TMB were 207 nM/s and 263.5 nM/s, respectively (Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). These features demonstrated that the quality of IONzyme products are identical to those prepared before
