<p>To investigate the destructive effects on other subtypes of IAVs, we treated IONzymes with H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, and H12 subtype and evaluated the HA and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titers. Although these subtypes are genetically distant according to phylogenetic analysis of the complete hemagglutinin genes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A), IONzymes efficiently reduced the HA and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titers of above H1-H12 subtypes with dose-dependence (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B-L).
