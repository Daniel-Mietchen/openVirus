<p>When treated with 2 mg/mL IONzymes, H7N9, a subtype of avian influenza which was first found in 2013 in China and causes severe illness, combined with high mortality
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, showed undetectable HA titer (Log2) and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (Log
 <sub>10</sub>/0.1 mL) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>G). Other subtypes, such as H3N2, H8N4, H9N2, H10N3, and H11N2, exhibited a similar destructive efficiency by IONzymes ( â‰¥2 mg/mL). If increased IONzymes up to 4 mg/mL for the treatment, H1N1, another threatening subtype which was from swine flu but infected many people in the world in 2009
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, was completely inactivated according to the data of HA titer and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). In fact, IONzymes at 4 mg/mL abolished biological activity of most subtypes except H2N2, H6N2, and H12N5. Collectively, the above results demonstrated that IONzymes possess a broad-spectrum effect on various subtypes of IAVs.
