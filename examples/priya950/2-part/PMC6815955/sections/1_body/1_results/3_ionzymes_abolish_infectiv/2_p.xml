<p>We next examined the attachment, proliferation, and release of H5N1 virus in the process of infection to MDCK cells. We quantified virus attachment on the surface of MDCK cells by using NP protein as marker, as it was the only protein not affected upon IONzymes treatment. To measure NP protein, virus samples were incubated with MDCK cells for 1 h and then labeled with fluorescent anti-NP antibody for flow cytometer assay. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S14</xref>, the value of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of NP protein was 23.2±0.91 in the virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes, which was much lower than the value of 56.1±0.73 in the intact virus. This result demonstrated that the ability of H5N1 virus attach to MDCK cells was reduced, which can be ascribed to the destruction of hemagglutinin by IONzymes. We next examined the sequential viral replication of IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C, the intact H5N1 virus efficiently replicated inside MDCK cells (labelled with anti-hemagglutinin antibody) at 24 h post infection (p.i.) when the value of multiplicity of infection (MOI) was set to 1 (the ratio of infectious virus to target cells). In comparison, no fluorescent signal was observed in the virus treated with IONzymes at 4 mg/mL for 2 h, indicating that viruses failed to replicate in MDCK cells. This result may be due to failed invasion of H5N1 virus following treatment with IONzymes. We next evaluated the viral titer (HA titer) of budding viruses released into the supernatant of cell culture when H5N1 virus infected MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, the HA titer (Log2) became undetectable when virus was treated with 2 mg/mL IONzymes for 24 or 48 h p.i.. This result indicated that IONzymes treatment may stop the production of progeny virions due to the reduction of NA activity. Taken together, IONzymes abolish the infectivity of H5N1 virus to host cells, especially at the initial attachment and invasion step of viral proliferation process
