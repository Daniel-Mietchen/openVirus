<p>We further evaluated the pathogenicity of IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus using an animal-infection model. To this end, we chose mice (BALB/c) due to their high susceptibility to H5N1 virus as well as its high pathogenicity
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The infection of intact H5N1 virus reduced the body weight of mice by over 20%, whereas those infected with H5N1 virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes maintained their body weight, similar to uninfected mice (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). We also observed highly mortality in the mice infected with intact H5N1 virus, in which all mice died within 10 days post infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). In comparison, the mice infected with H5N1 virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes obtained 100% survival rate in 14 days observation, identical to that in uninfected mice. We also examined the pathological status and viral proliferation in the lung tissue of the infected mice. Using an H&amp;E staining method, we found that the lung tissues of mice infected with intact H5N1 virus exhibited severe pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar wall edema and thickening, and hemorrhaging on day 7 p. i. (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F). In comparison, the group infected with IONzyme (4 mg/mL)-treated H5N1 virus showed negligible pathological changes. We then conducted a 50% embryo infectious doses (EID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryo infection model. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G, no virus was detected in the lung tissue indicated by EID
 <sub>50</sub> assay in the group infected with IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus. In comparison, mice infected with intact H5N1 virus showed the EID
 <sub>50</sub> (Log
 <sub>10</sub>/0.1 mL) at 4.0Â±0.2 in the lung tissue. Taken together, these results showed that IONzymes efficiently inhibit IAVs-induced apoptosis in MDCK cells and reduce the pathogenicity and viral proliferation in mice.
