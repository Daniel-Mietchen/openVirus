<p>To confirm the contribution of lipid peroxidation in viral inactivation, we compared the effects of IONzymes between enveloped viruses and non-enveloped viruses. Two viruses, Newcastle disease virus (NDV, representative envelope virus) and Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2, representative non-enveloped virus) were treated with IONzymes following the same procedure for H5N1 virus. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F, IONzymes treatment (4 mg/mL) reduced the HA titer (log 2) of NDV below levels of detection, with similar effects found for H5N1 virus. In contrast, the same IONzymes treatment only reduced 16% infectivity (number of infected cells) of PCV-2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S13</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that the lipid envelope is the target of IONzymes.
