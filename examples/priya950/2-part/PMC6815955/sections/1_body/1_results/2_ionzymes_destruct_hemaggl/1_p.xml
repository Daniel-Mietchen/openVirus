<p>To evaluate the activity of hemagglutinin on H5N1 virus after treatment with IONzymes, we performed hemagglutination (HA) assay, which is indexed in HA titer to reflect the function of hemagglutinin protein
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. We found that IONzymes reduce the HA titer of either chicken embryos-produced (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, S7) as well as cell-produced H5N1 virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref>) as well as further purified virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>), showing that the reduction occurs in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>). In addition, IONzymes with 200 nm at diameter posed a stronger lipid peroxidation level (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S10</xref>) and antiviral activity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S11</xref>) than those with diameter at 100 nm or 50 nm. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, the HA titer (Log2) of H5N1 virus was reduced from 5.00±0.00 to 0.33±0.57 when IAVs were treated with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes (200 nm at diameter, unless specified otherwise) under 2 h. These findings indicated that hemagglutinin protein lost the ability to bind sialic acid receptors on blood cells in IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus. NA function also influences hemagglutination activity because of a functional balance between the hemagglutinin and NA protein
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Similarly, more than 60% of NA activity was reduced when H5N1 virus was treated with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes under 2 h (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). These results indicated that the biological functions of hemagglutinin and NA protein were compromised by IONzymes.
