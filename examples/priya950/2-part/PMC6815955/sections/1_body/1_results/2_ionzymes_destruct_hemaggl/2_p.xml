<p>To confirm that such inactivation was caused by lipoxidase catalysis, we compared the effects of natural lipoxidase treatment on H5N1 virus using the same procedure in IONzyme experiments. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, natural lipoxidase at 0.8 mg/mL reduced HA titer (Log2) from 6 to 3.8, indicating that natural lipoxidase induced denaturation of H5N1 virus in a manner similar to IONzymes. Furthermore, IONzymes possessed a well antiviral activity under O
 <sub>2</sub>-rich conditions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S12</xref>). However, both natural peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase, HRP) and catalase failed to show such reduction in HA titer (Log2) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, E). These results indicated that IONzymes destruct viruses probably through mimicking the lipoxidase-like activity rather than peroxidase-like or catalase-like activity.
