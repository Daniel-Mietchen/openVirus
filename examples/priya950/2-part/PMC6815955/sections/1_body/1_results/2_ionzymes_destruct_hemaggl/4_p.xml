<p>H5 subtype IAV mutates much more rapidly than most other subtypes such as H7 and H9. Therefore, a standardized “clade” nomenclature was developed and first adopted in 2008, based on the evolution and divergence of H5N1 viruses that evolved from the original HA gene of the 1996 H5N1 virus. To date, 10 distinct clades (0-9) and many sub-clades have been identified
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Here, we further checked the envelope-dependent virus destruction using H5 clades (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). In addition to the H5N1 SY strain, we tested the effect of IONzymes on other representative H5 strains originated from different clades, including clade 0, clade 2.3.2.1, clade 2.3.4, clade 2.3.4.4, and clade 7.2, which possess the same envelope structure except genetic mutations of H5 hemagglutinin protein. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, IONzymes treatment dramatically reduced HA titer (Log2) for all H5N1 clades. In particular, HA titer (Log2) was all undetectable in the group treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes under 2 h. These results demonstrated that IONzymes treatment can destruct a virus with a common envelope structure such as H5N1, despite the fact that it contains numerous clades.
