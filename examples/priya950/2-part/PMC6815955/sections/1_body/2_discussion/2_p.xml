<p>This finding extended biomedical applications of iron oxide nanoparticles with enzyme catalytic property. The discovery of intrinsic enzyme-like activities enables iron oxide nanoparticles to be used as enzyme mimics in biological system, including stimulating stem cell proliferation, killing bacteria and antioxidant protection

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, it remains far from clear how and why iron oxide nanoparticles destruct virus. In our antiviral experiment, we found that natural lipoxidase (non-heme iron-containing enzyme) rather than peroxidase or catalase performed antiviral activity under neutral pH. IONzymes have been well known with peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities, which regulate ROS balance in cellular or bacterial system. However, the two activities were invalid in the antiviral reaction. Wang et al. has reported that Fe

 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles induced lipid peroxidation by peroxidase-like activity which requires acidic pH and the presence of H

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. However, in our work Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles could induce lipid peroxidation under neutral pH, indicating that the catalysis is distinct from the peroxidase process. Therefore, we deduce that IONzymes may possess the lipoxidase-like activity in the process of inducing lipid peroxidation to destruct virus.
