<p>Importantly, IONzymes specifically act on viruses containing a lipid envelope, while showing little effect on non-enveloped viruses (PCV-2). In addition, it has previously been shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-containing phospholipids found in membranes that are highly vulnerable to lipid peroxidation attack

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> might be more sensitive to lipid peroxidation of IONzymes. Hemagglutinin and NA are membrane proteins which are responsible for virus infection to host cells and M1 is a matrix protein to form a coat inside the viral envelope

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. The lipid peroxidation may directly damage the transmembrane counterpart of hemagglutinin and NA or cause a structure change due to envelope disintegration. The western blot analysis verified that the three proteins were destructed. In contrast, we found that peroxidation cannot impact nucleoprotein (NP), an internal influenza virus protein, encapsulating the virus genome to form a ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) for the purposes of transcription and packaging
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Therefore, our results indicated that the peroxidation damage ignited by IONzymes in viral envelope only passes on the transmembrane proteins and adjacent matrix protein. Previous a study reported that lipid peroxidation led to the disintegration of lipid membrane and the production of lipid-derived radicals, which ultimately damage the proteins
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, implying that IONzymes induce the lipid peroxidation of viral lipid envelope and may further locally produce an amount of radicals to destroy neighboring proteins.
