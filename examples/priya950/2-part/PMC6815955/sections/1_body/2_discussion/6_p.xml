<p>It has been well known that facemasks are very important to protect people from influenza infection in crowded spaces. For instance, live-poultry markets (LPMs) allows a high frequency of human-poultry contact and results in a five H7N9 influenza epidemic waves in China 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Therefore, such protective equipment is needed to intercept virus transmission from poultry to human. However, most facemasks only provide isolation protection for influenza virus but cannot inactivate the adsorbed virus. This may not only provide insufficient protection to the users, but also become a new contaminated source with high spreading risk because virus accumulated on facemasks still remains infectivity

Our IONzyme-loaded facemask possesses an outstanding characteristic to fast inactivate multiple IAVs within the mask, implying potential broad applications of IONzymes in bioprotective PPEs against the emerging influenza threats, especially in high-risk places, such as hospitals and LPMs.
