<p>Importantly, IONzymes inactivate a broad spectrum of influenza A viruses. IAVs can be classified into various subtypes on the basis of antigenic differences in two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and NA protein, at least 18 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1 to N11) have been detected
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. The common feature is that all subtypes of IAVs contain a typical lipid envelope. In addition, membrane-proximal cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA are highly conserved in sequence in all subtypes of influenza virus
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. IONzymes treatment remarkably disintegrate envelope and destruct hemagglutinin and NA, we hypothesize that IONzymes are active against other viruses containing a lipid envelope.
