<p>MDCK cells were infected with IONzyme-treated IAVs at an MOI of 1. At 24 h p.i., the cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, saturated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h with mAb 3A9 (anti-hemagglutinin of H5N1 IAV), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, MO, USA). After being washed, the cells were observed using a Leica fluorescence microscopy.</p>
