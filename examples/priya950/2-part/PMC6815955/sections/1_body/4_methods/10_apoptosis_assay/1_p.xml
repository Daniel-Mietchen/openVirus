<p>MDCK cells were infected with IONzyme-treated or untreated IAVs (SY strain) at an MOI of 1. At 24 h p.i., both infected and noninfected cells were treated with trypsin and were slightly washed three times with PBS. According to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), an aliquot of cells (~10
 <sup>6</sup>) was stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The stained cells were then analyzed by a caliber flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Annexin V possesses high affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS), which is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in the process of apoptosis. PI cannot permeate live cells and early apoptotic cells but stains necrotic cells, binding tightly to the nucleic acids in the cell. As a result, early apoptotic cells are characterized by annexin V
 <sup>+</sup> and PI
 <sup>-</sup> staining, later apoptotic cells by annexin V
