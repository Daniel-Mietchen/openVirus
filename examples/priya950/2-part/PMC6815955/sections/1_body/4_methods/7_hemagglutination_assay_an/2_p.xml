<p>To measure the 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), the individual supernatants were serially diluted 10-fold from 10
 <sup>-1</sup> to 10
 <sup>-9</sup>, and each dilution (10
 <sup>-5</sup>-10
 <sup>-9</sup>) was inoculated into confluent MDCK cell monolayers by using 96-well plates under 37 °C for 1 h. After 1 h, the monolayer was rinsed with PBS, overlaid with medium (1% FBS in DMEM) and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. To identify influenza virus positive wells, the HA assay was performed

 <sub>50</sub> per 0.1 mL was calculated using the Reed-Muench method as described previously
