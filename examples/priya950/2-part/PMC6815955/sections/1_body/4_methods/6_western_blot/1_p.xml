<p>Samples (supernatant) were lysed with RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) containing protease inhibitor. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 Â°C and the protein concentrations were determined and calibrated (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce, USA). Protein extracts were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBST) and 5% skimmed milk powder, and probed with antibodies specific for mAb 3A9 (anti-hemagglutinin of H5N1 IAV)
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, mouse serum (anti-M1 of H5N1 IAV)
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, pAb (anti-NA of H5N1 IAV)
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, and pAb (anti-NP of IAV, Sino Biological Inc, China), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (EMD Chemicals). Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, USA) on radiographic film.
