<p>Supernatants were analyzed using a neuraminidase assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μL supernatant were mixed with 70 μL detection buffer, 10 μL NA fluorogenic substrate and 10 μL double-distilled water. Fluorescence was released with an emission wavelength of 460 nm and an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and monitored using a multifunctional microplate reader (Tecan). NA activity is shown as the intensity of fluorescence above the background values for supernatant without virus.</p>
