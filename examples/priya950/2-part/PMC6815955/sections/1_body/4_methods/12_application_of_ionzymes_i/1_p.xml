<p>Basing on the traditional facemasks with absorbent filter cotton, different concentrations of IONzymes (0.8 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 0.4 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 0.2 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, and 0.1 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) were added on the third layer of selected area (5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>), respectively. After drying by airflow for 30 min, IAVs was sprayed onto the eighth layer (the outermost layer). After incubating for 0.5 or 1 h, both the control area (equal volume PBS) and the IONzyme area were placed into a tube containing 200 Î¼L PBS. After washing and extrusion, viral suspensions were harvested, and the population of viable virus was then measured using HA and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> methods.
