<p>The development of nanotechnology has provided abundant nanomaterials for antiviral treatments
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Specifically, many inorganic nanoparticles have shown antiviral effects on influenza viruses, such as silver nanoparticles
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or gold nanoparticles
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, how these nanomaterials affect viruses remains unclear. In recent years, the intrinsic enzyme-like properties of nanomaterials have raised widely concerns, providing in-depth understanding on the biological effects of nanomaterials. Now these nanomaterials performing enzyme-like activity are proposed as a new generation of artificial enzymes and denoted as “Nanozymes”
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The main property of nanozymes, compared to natural enzymes, is that their activity can be adjusted by modulating the size, morphology, dopant and surface modification 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Iron oxide (Fe

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. This classical nanoparticle is currently used for bioseparation, biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery as well as hyperthermia therapy, primarily because of its unique magnetic properties 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Previously, we found that at acidic pH conditions, ferromagnetic nanoparticles exhibit peroxidase-like activities, which can catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Due to this unique enzyme-like property, iron oxide nanoparticles are denoted as iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes). We consequently applied this catalytic property to biomarker detection in immunoassay, H

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, Ebola detection
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, tumor diagnosis
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, anti-bacteria and biofilm elimination for caries prevention
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and wound healing
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In addition, IONzymes were shown to exhibit catalase-like activity at neutral pH conditions, converting hydrogen peroxide into oxygen
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. These catalase-like activities enable IONzymes to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in protection of neurons and improving anti-inflammatory processes
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. A recent study also reported that IONzymes induce membrane lipid peroxidation in synthesized liposome
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. On the basis of these earlier observations, we hypothesized that IONzymes may provide a possibility to develop universal antiviral strategy and represent a suitable tool for investigating the antiviral mechanisms of inorganic nanomaterials.
