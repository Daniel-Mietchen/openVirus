<p>Here, we present a successful paradigm of broad-spectrum antiviral activity on IAVs using IONzymes. We found that our IONzymes catalyze lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope and thus compromise the integrity of the neighboring proteins (Scheme 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="SC1">1</xref>). In addition, the catalytic inactivation mediated by IONzymes act on variable subtypes of IAVs, showing the ability to prevent IAVs transmission and infection.
