However, developing a universal anti-viral strategy has remained challenging due to the presence of diverse subtypes as well as its high mutation rate, resulting in antigenic shift and drift.

IAVs infect a broad range of species, including wild birds, poultry, and humans, resulting in annual flu epidemics and global pandemics<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Although various vaccines have been developed against IAVs, antigenic shift and drift accelerate the diversity and emergence of novel stains, rendering timely vaccine development a considerable challenge<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Antiviral drugs represent an alternative anti-AIVs strategy, however drug-resistance rapidly renders those drugs ineffective<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Moreover, the presence of multiple influenza subtypes renders developing a universal anti-IAVs strategy difficult. In contrast, all types of IAVs possess a lipid envelope as a conserved component essential for maintaining virus integrity and infectivity. Therefore, compromising the viral lipid envelope should result in inactivation of the virus, potentially representing an antiviral strategy against multiple subtypes of IAVs.</p><p>The development of nanotechnology has provided abundant nanomaterials for antiviral treatments<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Specifically, many inorganic nanoparticles have shown antiviral effects on influenza viruses, such as silver nanoparticles<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or gold nanoparticles<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, how these nanomaterials affect viruses remains unclear. In recent years, the intrinsic enzyme-like properties of nanomaterials have raised widely concerns, providing in-depth understanding on the biological effects of nanomaterials. Now these nanomaterials performing enzyme-like activity are proposed as a new generation of artificial enzymes and denoted as &#x0201c;Nanozymes&#x0201d;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The main property of nanozymes, compared to natural enzymes, is that their activity can be adjusted by modulating the size, morphology, dopant and surface modification <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Iron oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles, as the most typical nanozymes, which performs two enzyme-like activities, namely peroxidase and catalase activities<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. This classical nanoparticle is currently used for bioseparation, biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery as well as hyperthermia therapy, primarily because of its unique magnetic properties <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Previously, we found that at acidic pH conditions, ferromagnetic nanoparticles exhibit peroxidase-like activities, which can catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Due to this unique enzyme-like property, iron oxide nanoparticles are denoted as iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes). We consequently applied this catalytic property to biomarker detection in immunoassay, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Glucose Detection<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, Ebola detection<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, tumor diagnosis<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, anti-bacteria and biofilm elimination for caries prevention<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and wound healing<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In addition, IONzymes were shown to exhibit catalase-like activity at neutral pH conditions, converting hydrogen peroxide into oxygen<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. These catalase-like activities enable IONzymes to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in protection of neurons and improving anti-inflammatory processes<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. A recent study also reported that IONzymes induce membrane lipid peroxidation in synthesized liposome<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. On the basis of these earlier observations, we hypothesized that IONzymes may provide a possibility to develop universal antiviral strategy and represent a suitable tool for investigating the antiviral mechanisms of inorganic nanomaterials.</p><p>Here, we present a successful paradigm of broad-spectrum antiviral activity on IAVs using IONzymes. We found that our IONzymes catalyze lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope and thus compromise the integrity of the neighboring proteins (Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="SC1">1</xref>). In addition, the catalytic inactivation mediated by IONzymes act on variable subtypes of IAVs, showing the ability to prevent IAVs transmission and infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>IONzymes induce lipid peroxidation to destruct Influenza A viruses</title><p>We synthesized IONzymes using a solvothermal method, a common system to produce inorganic nanocrystal products. As shown in Figures S1, the synthesized IONzymes measured approx. 200 nm in diameter. Importantly, it exhibited a high peroxidase-like activity as demonstrated by the colorimetric reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>) under acidic condition. The catalytic kinetics followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Vmax values to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and TMB were 207 nM/s and 263.5 nM/s, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). These features demonstrated that the quality of IONzyme products are identical to those prepared before<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>To investigate whether IONzymes are capable to induce lipid peroxidation, we measured maleic dialdehyde (MDA) produced by incubating our IONzymes with liposome constituted with egg phospholipid. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, IONzymes at 4 mg/mL with 2 h incubation resulted in increased MDA levels up to 2 folds compared to untreated liposome. In addition, the generation of MDA presented a dependence on IONzymes dosage at neutral pH conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and reached a peak value at 1 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><p>Together, these results indicated that IONzymes have the ability to induce lipid peroxidation in liposomes. Importantly, lipid peroxidation occurred under neutral condition rather than acidic pH, indicating that catalytic performance resembles lipoxidase activity rather than peroxidase, which requires acidic pH and the presence of hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>Next, we tested whether IONzymes induce lipid peroxidation on the viral envelope of influenza A virus that possesses a liposome-like structure (named henceforth viral lipid envelope). To this end, we incubated IAVs (H5N1 subtype, SY strain, if not specified) with IONzymes at physiological conditions. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and S4, incubation with IONzymes at 4 mg/mL for 2 h resulted in 1.87 &#x000b1; 1.16 &#x000b5;mol/mg MDA, demonstrating that IONzymes are able to induce lipid peroxidation of the viral envelope of IAVs at neutral pH. Liposome is simply constituted with lipid. The commercial lipid may have been oxidized in the storage and thus already has certain level of MDA before forming liposome. In contrast, a virus is composed of lipid, proteins and nucleic acids, forming a rigid structure with proteins on viral surface. Therefore, no signal was detected in IONzyme-untreated IAVs, presumably because that viruses rather than liposomes possess considerable structural stability under natural conditions.</p><p>In agreement with these results, examining viral morphology by transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that the lipid envelope of IONzyme-pretreated IAVs was considerably damaged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). In addition, we examined the neighboring proteins of IAVs, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), and nucleoprotein (NP). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, hemagglutinin, NA, and M1 proteins were destructed under high concentration of IONzymes (&#x0003e; 1 mg/mL), whereas NP protein appeared to be unaffected. It is well known that hemagglutinin and NA have transmembrane domains in viral lipid and M1 is close to inside of the lipid. It is reasonable that these protein destructions were ascribed to lipid peroxidation. To confirm the relationship between protein destruction and lipid peroxidation, we investigated the extent of the damage of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as a standard protein, in the IONzyme-liposome mixture under neutral pH. As shown in SDS-PAGE result (Figure. S5), BSA was well degraded by IONzyme-liposome system other than single IONzymes. We then tested purified hemagglutinin protein using the same IONzyme-liposome system. The subsequent western blot assay showed that hemagglutinin protein was destructed (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>). Together, these findings indicated that lipid peroxidation in liposome induced by IONzymes was able to degrade proteins. Therefore, we concluded that IONzymes induce lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope, and simultaneously compromise the integrity of envelope structure as well as the integrity of neighboring proteins of H5N1 virus.</p></sec><sec><title>IONzymes destruct hemagglutination activity of IAVs</title><p>To evaluate the activity of hemagglutinin on H5N1 virus after treatment with IONzymes, we performed hemagglutination (HA) assay, which is indexed in HA titer to reflect the function of hemagglutinin protein<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. We found that IONzymes reduce the HA titer of either chicken embryos-produced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, S7) as well as cell-produced H5N1 virus (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref>) as well as further purified virus (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>), showing that the reduction occurs in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>). In addition, IONzymes with 200 nm at diameter posed a stronger lipid peroxidation level (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S10</xref>) and antiviral activity (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S11</xref>) than those with diameter at 100 nm or 50 nm. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, the HA titer (Log2) of H5N1 virus was reduced from 5.00&#x000b1;0.00 to 0.33&#x000b1;0.57 when IAVs were treated with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes (200 nm at diameter, unless specified otherwise) under 2 h. These findings indicated that hemagglutinin protein lost the ability to bind sialic acid receptors on blood cells in IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus. NA function also influences hemagglutination activity because of a functional balance between the hemagglutinin and NA protein<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Similarly, more than 60% of NA activity was reduced when H5N1 virus was treated with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes under 2 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). These results indicated that the biological functions of hemagglutinin and NA protein were compromised by IONzymes.</p><p>To confirm that such inactivation was caused by lipoxidase catalysis, we compared the effects of natural lipoxidase treatment on H5N1 virus using the same procedure in IONzyme experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, natural lipoxidase at 0.8 mg/mL reduced HA titer (Log2) from 6 to 3.8, indicating that natural lipoxidase induced denaturation of H5N1 virus in a manner similar to IONzymes. Furthermore, IONzymes possessed a well antiviral activity under O<sub>2</sub>-rich conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S12</xref>). However, both natural peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase, HRP) and catalase failed to show such reduction in HA titer (Log2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, E). These results indicated that IONzymes destruct viruses probably through mimicking the lipoxidase-like activity rather than peroxidase-like or catalase-like activity.</p><p>To confirm the contribution of lipid peroxidation in viral inactivation, we compared the effects of IONzymes between enveloped viruses and non-enveloped viruses. Two viruses, Newcastle disease virus (NDV, representative envelope virus) and Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2, representative non-enveloped virus) were treated with IONzymes following the same procedure for H5N1 virus. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F, IONzymes treatment (4 mg/mL) reduced the HA titer (log 2) of NDV below levels of detection, with similar effects found for H5N1 virus. In contrast, the same IONzymes treatment only reduced 16% infectivity (number of infected cells) of PCV-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S13</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that the lipid envelope is the target of IONzymes.</p><p>H5 subtype IAV mutates much more rapidly than most other subtypes such as H7 and H9. Therefore, a standardized &#x0201c;clade&#x0201d; nomenclature was developed and first adopted in 2008, based on the evolution and divergence of H5N1 viruses that evolved from the original HA gene of the 1996 H5N1 virus. To date, 10 distinct clades (0-9) and many sub-clades have been identified<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Here, we further checked the envelope-dependent virus destruction using H5 clades (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). In addition to the H5N1 SY strain, we tested the effect of IONzymes on other representative H5 strains originated from different clades, including clade 0, clade 2.3.2.1, clade 2.3.4, clade 2.3.4.4, and clade 7.2, which possess the same envelope structure except genetic mutations of H5 hemagglutinin protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, IONzymes treatment dramatically reduced HA titer (Log2) for all H5N1 clades. In particular, HA titer (Log2) was all undetectable in the group treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes under 2 h. These results demonstrated that IONzymes treatment can destruct a virus with a common envelope structure such as H5N1, despite the fact that it contains numerous clades.</p></sec><sec><title>IONzymes abolish infectivity of IAVs</title><p>Next, we evaluated the infectivity of IAVs treated with IONzymes. To exclude possible interference from other components present in either the allantoic fluid or cell lysate, we purified H5N1 virus using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The purified H5N1 virus was incubated with IONzymes and then collected for the assay of 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, the value of Log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> per 0.1 mL was reduced from 4.33&#x000b1;0.00 (without treatment) to below the detection limit (with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes under 2 h), indicating that H5N1 virus treated by IONzymes lost its infectivity.</p><p>We next examined the attachment, proliferation, and release of H5N1 virus in the process of infection to MDCK cells. We quantified virus attachment on the surface of MDCK cells by using NP protein as marker, as it was the only protein not affected upon IONzymes treatment. To measure NP protein, virus samples were incubated with MDCK cells for 1 h and then labeled with fluorescent anti-NP antibody for flow cytometer assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S14</xref>, the value of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of NP protein was 23.2&#x000b1;0.91 in the virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes, which was much lower than the value of 56.1&#x000b1;0.73 in the intact virus. This result demonstrated that the ability of H5N1 virus attach to MDCK cells was reduced, which can be ascribed to the destruction of hemagglutinin by IONzymes. We next examined the sequential viral replication of IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C, the intact H5N1 virus efficiently replicated inside MDCK cells (labelled with anti-hemagglutinin antibody) at 24 h post infection (p.i.) when the value of multiplicity of infection (MOI) was set to 1 (the ratio of infectious virus to target cells). In comparison, no fluorescent signal was observed in the virus treated with IONzymes at 4 mg/mL for 2 h, indicating that viruses failed to replicate in MDCK cells. This result may be due to failed invasion of H5N1 virus following treatment with IONzymes. We next evaluated the viral titer (HA titer) of budding viruses released into the supernatant of cell culture when H5N1 virus infected MDCK cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, the HA titer (Log2) became undetectable when virus was treated with 2 mg/mL IONzymes for 24 or 48 h p.i.. This result indicated that IONzymes treatment may stop the production of progeny virions due to the reduction of NA activity. Taken together, IONzymes abolish the infectivity of H5N1 virus to host cells, especially at the initial attachment and invasion step of viral proliferation process<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>IONzymes reduce virulence and pathogenicity of IAVs</title><p>We next evaluated the virulence and pathogenicity of H5N1 virus treated with IONzymes. Influenza virus infection induces apoptosis in multiple cell types, subsequently resulting in cellular and organ damage, leading to lethal pathogenicity <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. To determine cell damage, we inoculated MDCK cells with H5N1 virus with or without prior treatment with IONzymes. We identified cellular apoptosis by double staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometer assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A-C and S15, the infection of H5N1 virus primarily induced cell apoptosis rather than necrosis. H5N1 virus led to 20.6&#x000b1; 0.4 % cells with late apoptosis. In contrast, IONzyme (4 mg/mL)-treated H5N1 virus induced 15.1&#x000b1; 0.7 % cells with late apoptosis which is close to the same level in mock cells (without virus infection), indicating IONzymes treatment reduced the virulence of H5N1 virus<italic> in vitro.</italic></p><p>We further evaluated the pathogenicity of IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus using an animal-infection model. To this end, we chose mice (BALB/c) due to their high susceptibility to H5N1 virus as well as its high pathogenicity<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The infection of intact H5N1 virus reduced the body weight of mice by over 20%, whereas those infected with H5N1 virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes maintained their body weight, similar to uninfected mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). We also observed highly mortality in the mice infected with intact H5N1 virus, in which all mice died within 10 days post infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). In comparison, the mice infected with H5N1 virus treated with 4 mg/mL IONzymes obtained 100% survival rate in 14 days observation, identical to that in uninfected mice. We also examined the pathological status and viral proliferation in the lung tissue of the infected mice. Using an H&#x00026;E staining method, we found that the lung tissues of mice infected with intact H5N1 virus exhibited severe pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar wall edema and thickening, and hemorrhaging on day 7 p. i. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F). In comparison, the group infected with IONzyme (4 mg/mL)-treated H5N1 virus showed negligible pathological changes. We then conducted a 50% embryo infectious doses (EID<sub>50</sub>) assay in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryo infection model. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G, no virus was detected in the lung tissue indicated by EID<sub>50</sub> assay in the group infected with IONzyme-treated H5N1 virus. In comparison, mice infected with intact H5N1 virus showed the EID<sub>50</sub> (Log<sub>10</sub>/0.1 mL) at 4.0&#x000b1;0.2 in the lung tissue. Taken together, these results showed that IONzymes efficiently inhibit IAVs-induced apoptosis in MDCK cells and reduce the pathogenicity and viral proliferation in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>IONzymes destruct multiple subtypes of IAVs</title><p>To investigate the destructive effects on other subtypes of IAVs, we treated IONzymes with H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, and H12 subtype and evaluated the HA and TCID<sub>50</sub> titers. Although these subtypes are genetically distant according to phylogenetic analysis of the complete hemagglutinin genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A), IONzymes efficiently reduced the HA and TCID<sub>50</sub> titers of above H1-H12 subtypes with dose-dependence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B-L).</p><p>When treated with 2 mg/mL IONzymes, H7N9, a subtype of avian influenza which was first found in 2013 in China and causes severe illness, combined with high mortality<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, showed undetectable HA titer (Log2) and TCID<sub>50</sub> (Log<sub>10</sub>/0.1 mL) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>G). Other subtypes, such as H3N2, H8N4, H9N2, H10N3, and H11N2, exhibited a similar destructive efficiency by IONzymes ( &#x02265;2 mg/mL). If increased IONzymes up to 4 mg/mL for the treatment, H1N1, another threatening subtype which was from swine flu but infected many people in the world in 2009<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, was completely inactivated according to the data of HA titer and TCID<sub>50</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). In fact, IONzymes at 4 mg/mL abolished biological activity of most subtypes except H2N2, H6N2, and H12N5. Collectively, the above results demonstrated that IONzymes possess a broad-spectrum effect on various subtypes of IAVs.</p></sec><sec><title>IONzyme-loaded facemask protects against influenza</title><p>Given the fact that IONzymes effectively abolish virus activity, we hypothesized that it might represent a suitable candidate to prevent the spread of active influenza virus, especially for representative IAVs that have a serious threat to human, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype. To test this hypothesis, we added IONzymes as an antiviral component into facemasks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, in the control area, the HA titers (Log2) were 4.0&#x000b1;0.0 when allowing H1N1 virus sample (the titer at 6.0&#x000b1;0.0) to spray on the facemask for 0.5 or 1 h. Using a TCID50 assay, we measured the value of Log10 TCID50/0.1 mL as 2.2&#x000b1;0.2, which was comparable to the original H1N1 virus sample whose Log10 TCID50/0.1 mL was 2.4&#x000b1;0.1. These data and the results from H5N1 and H7N9 virus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C, D) demonstrated that IONzyme-unloaded facemasks only offer a limit virus interception. In comparison, the IONzyme-added area of facemask showed effective inactivation of H5N1 virus. When IONzymes were added at 0.1 mg/cm2, both HA titers and TCID50 titers became undetectable after 1 h. If IONzymes were added above 0.2 mg/cm2, we detected no viral titers after 0.5 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). If increased IONzymes up to 0.4 mg/cm2, both H1N1 and H7N9 virus were completely inactivated after 1 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, D). Together, our results show that IONzymes greatly improve the protective function of facemasks, namely by abolishing viral activity. Importantly, storing masks for up to four weeks failed to diminish antiviral efficacy (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S16</xref>). Therefore, IONzymes represent an ideal antiviral additive that improves the protective efficiency against IAVs in personal protective equipments (PPEs) such as facemasks, bioprotective suits, as well as air/water filters applied in high-risk areas.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work provided a promising antiviral strategy using IONzymes to inactivate IAVs. As a potential antiviral alternative, IONzymes demonstrate the following features: (i) IONzymes inactivate IAVs by catalyzing viral lipid envelope and neighboring structure proteins through lipid peroxidation. (ii) IONzymes possess a broad spectrum anti-IAVs activity. (iii) IONzymes can be integrated into facemask to improve protection efficacy. These features together provide potential advantages for practical applications of IONzymes in biomedicine and consumer healthcare.</p><p>This finding extended biomedical applications of iron oxide nanoparticles with enzyme catalytic property. The discovery of intrinsic enzyme-like activities enables iron oxide nanoparticles to be used as enzyme mimics in biological system, including stimulating stem cell proliferation, killing bacteria and antioxidant protection<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. In particular, although sporadic work observed that iron oxide nanoparticles showed certain antiviral effect on H1N1<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, it remains far from clear how and why iron oxide nanoparticles destruct virus. In our antiviral experiment, we found that natural lipoxidase (non-heme iron-containing enzyme) rather than peroxidase or catalase performed antiviral activity under neutral pH. IONzymes have been well known with peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities, which regulate ROS balance in cellular or bacterial system. However, the two activities were invalid in the antiviral reaction. Wang et al. has reported that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles induced lipid peroxidation by peroxidase-like activity which requires acidic pH and the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. However, in our work Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles could induce lipid peroxidation under neutral pH, indicating that the catalysis is distinct from the peroxidase process. Therefore, we deduce that IONzymes may possess the lipoxidase-like activity in the process of inducing lipid peroxidation to destruct virus.</p><p>We found that IONzymes themselves rather than their supernatants destroyed viral particles (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S17</xref>). In contrast, our recent study reported that Cys-nFeS Nanozymes release polysulfanes into supernatants for antibacterial activity<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In addition, we excluded the adsorption effect of IAVs on IONzymes in viral inactivation process. The non-specific adsorption of IAVs on IONzymes may provide false-positive antiviral data because we analyzed virus titers using the samples after IONzymes being removed. To check it, IONzymes were mixed with DyLight 488-labeled IAVs for 2 h and the supernatant and sediments were collected to perform immunofluorescence detection, respectively. We found that fluorescent-labeled viruses were largely existed in supernatants rather than in sediments (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S18</xref>), suggesting that the decrease of virus titer in supernatants was not due to that IONzymes adsorbed viral particles. Therefore, these analyses confirmed that the viral inactivation was from IONzymes themselves.</p><p>Importantly, IONzymes specifically act on viruses containing a lipid envelope, while showing little effect on non-enveloped viruses (PCV-2). In addition, it has previously been shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-containing phospholipids found in membranes that are highly vulnerable to lipid peroxidation attack<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Lipid envelope of influenza virus enriched with PUFA-phospholipids<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> might be more sensitive to lipid peroxidation of IONzymes. Hemagglutinin and NA are membrane proteins which are responsible for virus infection to host cells and M1 is a matrix protein to form a coat inside the viral envelope<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. The lipid peroxidation may directly damage the transmembrane counterpart of hemagglutinin and NA or cause a structure change due to envelope disintegration. The western blot analysis verified that the three proteins were destructed. In contrast, we found that peroxidation cannot impact nucleoprotein (NP), an internal influenza virus protein, encapsulating the virus genome to form a ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) for the purposes of transcription and packaging<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Therefore, our results indicated that the peroxidation damage ignited by IONzymes in viral envelope only passes on the transmembrane proteins and adjacent matrix protein. Previous a study reported that lipid peroxidation led to the disintegration of lipid membrane and the production of lipid-derived radicals, which ultimately damage the proteins<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, implying that IONzymes induce the lipid peroxidation of viral lipid envelope and may further locally produce an amount of radicals to destroy neighboring proteins.</p><p>Importantly, IONzymes inactivate a broad spectrum of influenza A viruses. IAVs can be classified into various subtypes on the basis of antigenic differences in two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and NA protein, at least 18 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1 to N11) have been detected<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. The common feature is that all subtypes of IAVs contain a typical lipid envelope. In addition, membrane-proximal cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA are highly conserved in sequence in all subtypes of influenza virus<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. IONzymes treatment remarkably disintegrate envelope and destruct hemagglutinin and NA, we hypothesize that IONzymes are active against other viruses containing a lipid envelope.</p><p>It has been well known that facemasks are very important to protect people from influenza infection in crowded spaces. For instance, live-poultry markets (LPMs) allows a high frequency of human-poultry contact and results in a five H7N9 influenza epidemic waves in China <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Therefore, such protective equipment is needed to intercept virus transmission from poultry to human. However, most facemasks only provide isolation protection for influenza virus but cannot inactivate the adsorbed virus. This may not only provide insufficient protection to the users, but also become a new contaminated source with high spreading risk because virus accumulated on facemasks still remains infectivity<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Our IONzyme-loaded facemask possesses an outstanding characteristic to fast inactivate multiple IAVs within the mask, implying potential broad applications of IONzymes in bioprotective PPEs against the emerging influenza threats, especially in high-risk places, such as hospitals and LPMs.</p><p>Although IONzymes demonstrated high antiviral activity in our study, the catalytic efficiency should to be further improved to allow its use in practical applications. Currently, high concentration of IONzymes and long incubation times are required in viral inactivation, indicating the activity may not be sufficiently high. Therefore, the activity of IONzymes need to be improved through adjusting nanoparticle size, component or surface modification, or designing a novel single-atom nanozyme<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> in the future study. In addition, biosafety of IONzymes must be assessed prior use for practical applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our findings reveal that IONzymes effectively induced lipid peroxidation in viral envelope and dysfunction of neighboring proteins responsible for host infection. IONzymes may perform lipoxidase-like activity in the antiviral process. This viral inactivation via liperoxidation may contribute to understanding antiviral property of iron oxide nanoparticles and other inorganic nanomaterials. In addition, as a typical nanomaterial, IONzymes exhibit features such as multifunctionality, high biocompatibility, high stability and low cost, which will render them competent for serving as a scalable biocidal part of equipment protective against viral infection. Therefore, we propose that IONzymes represent a general antiviral agent against influenza viruses and other enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Nipah virus, all of which represent considerable challenges to national healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All of the animal studies were approved by the Jiangsu Administrative Committee for Laboratory Animals (Permission number: SYXKSU-2007-0005) and complied with the guidelines for laboratory animal welfare and ethics of the Jiangsu Administrative Committee for Laboratory Animals.
