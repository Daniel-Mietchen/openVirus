<p>The isolates from CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 had the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimated in 2015 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2014 to 2016). The nucleotide sequences within CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 were identical to each other. When sequences within CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 were compared to sequences from other Brazilian isolates (collected during 2014-2016), a nucleotide similarity of 99.3% was observed. Analysis of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 compared to sequences belonging to others Brazilian CHIKV/ECSA genotypes, indicated a synonymous nt substitution characterized as synapomorphy (position 87 of the E1 gene of CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 sequences).</p>
