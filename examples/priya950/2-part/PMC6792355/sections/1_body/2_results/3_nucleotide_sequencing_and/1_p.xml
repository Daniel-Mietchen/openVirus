<p>The partial sequence of

 <italic>E1</italic> genes of 14 samples from 2016 and 2017 were determined (GenBank accession Nº MK510154-MK510181). The partial sequences of 
 <italic>E2</italic> (208 nt) and 
 <italic>E1</italic> (120 nt) genes were concatenated in frame (328 nt; corresponding to positions 8,804 to 8,923 and 10,253 to 10,460 compared to the nucleotide sequence of CHIKV strain BHI3745/H804709, isolated in Feira de Santana, Bahia (GenBank accession Nº KP164570). The phylogenetic analysis based on the Maximum likelihood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) and Bayesian methods revealed that all sequenced isolates belonged to the ECSA genotype and clustered together, forming a monophyletic group, called CHIKV/PI/2016-2017 (supported by a posterior probability (PP) equal to 0.96). This group clustered with other CHIKV isolates, circulating from 2014 to 2016, in Bahia
