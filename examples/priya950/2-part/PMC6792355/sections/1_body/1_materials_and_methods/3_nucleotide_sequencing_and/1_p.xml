<p>PCR amplicons of the 
 <italic>E1</italic> and 
 <italic>E2</italic> genes were sequenced using 0.5 uM of each specific primer (forward and reverse) and approximately 10 ng of each DNA sample. The sequencing was performed in a ABI 3130 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), using the Sanger sequencing platform of Rene Rachou Institute (Fiocruz, Minas Gerais, Brazil). Raw data were analyzed and final contigs were assembled using the Geneious R9 version 9.1.8

 </sup>. The partial sequences of 
 <italic>E2</italic> and 
 <italic>E1</italic> genes were concatenated in frame and aligned to 74 concatenated sequences of CHIKV genotypes retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using CLUSTALW, implemented on MEGA6
