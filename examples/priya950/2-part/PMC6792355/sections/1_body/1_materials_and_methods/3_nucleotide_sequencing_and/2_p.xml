<p>Bayesian inferences were performed using BEAST package 1.8.4
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
 </sup> with Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC). Input files for BEAST v.1.8.4 were created with BEAUTi v.1.8.4
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup>, using 88 concatenated 
 <italic>E2E1</italic> sequences. The best model was selected comparing the marginal likelihood estimations (MLE)
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup>. The estimates were performed using the nucleotide substitution model GTR, with gamma distribution (four categories), under the relaxed molecular clock and the Bayesian skyline demographic Model. Three hundred million chains were run, the first 30 million steps were discarded, and convergence of parameters was verified with Tracer v.1.5.0
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup>. The trees were sampled at every 10,000 steps and then summarized in a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator v.1.8.2
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
 </sup>. The final tree was visualized in FigTree v.1.4.3
