  <title>Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Chikungunya virus. A subtree of the ECSA genotype, from the maximum clade credibility tree inferred using 88 Chikungunya virus sequences (328 nt) is shown. The posterior probability values are represented by circles drawn in scale in the nodes. Clades containing strains from Piaui (2016/2017) and the Indian Ocean Lineage are shown in red and blue, respectively. Branch lengths are drawn to scale of years. The tree was reconstructed using the nucleotide substitution model GTR with gamma distribution (four categories), under the relaxed molecular clock and the Bayesian skyline demographic model. PI: Piaui. BR: Brazil. GECSA: Genotype East-Central South African. CHIKV: Chikungunya virus.</title>
