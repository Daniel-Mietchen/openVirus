  <p>Effect of cytoskeleton-modulating drugs on MARV NCLSs transport. 
   <bold>a</bold> Experimental setting to observe the effects of cytoskeleton modulating drugs on MARV NCLSs transport. Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmids as described in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, and treated at 15 h p.t. with either 0.15% DMSO (control), 0.15 μM nocodazole, or 0.3 μM cytochalasin D. After 3 h of treatment, observation of the cells began (18 h p.t.). 
   <bold>b</bold>-
   <bold>d</bold> Time-lapse images were acquired for each of the drug treated cells (b: DMSO, c: Nocodazole, d: Cytochalasin D). The pictures show the maximum-intensity projection of time-lapse images of cells, recorded for 90 s; images were captured every 2 s. 
   <bold>e</bold>-
   <bold>i</bold> Over 1000 selected signals were analyzed using Fiji plugin “TrackMate”. 
   <bold>e</bold>-
   <bold>g</bold> The length of the NCLS trajectories was evaluated in each of the drug treated cells (e: DMSO, f: Nocodazole, g: Cytochalasin D). The y-axis represents the number of signals in each range (x-axis). The numbers indicate mean ± SD (μm). 
   <bold>h</bold>-
   <bold>i</bold> The velocity of NCLSs transport was evaluated in each of the drug treated cells (h: DMSO, i: Nocodazole, 
   <bold>j</bold>: Cytochalasin D). The y-axis represents the number of signals in each range (x-axis). The numbers indicate mean ± SD (nm/s)
