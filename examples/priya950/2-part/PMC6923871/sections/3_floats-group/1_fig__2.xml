  <p>Live-cell imaging system of MARV nucleocapsid-like structures. 
   <bold>a</bold> The experimental setting for detection of NCLS transport. Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NP, L, VP35, VP24, VP40, GP, Marburg virus specific minigenome, T7 polymerase, and VP30-GFP. 
   <bold>b</bold> Plasmid-transfected Huh-7 cells were observed at 18 h p.t. The image shows the maximum-intensity projection of time-lapse images of cells, recorded for 90 s; images were captured every 2 s. 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold> Over 1000 selected signals were analyzed using the Fiji plugin “TrackMate”. 
   <bold>c</bold> The length of the NCLS trajectories was evaluated. The y-axis represents the number of signals in each range (x-axis). The numbers indicate mean ± SD (μm). 
   <bold>d</bold> The velocity of NCLSs transport was evaluated. The y-axis represents the number of signals in each range (x-axis). The numbers indicate mean ± SD (nm/s)
