<p id="Par18">Marburg virus (MARV), together with Ebola virus (EBOV), belongs to the family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, and has a roughly 19â€‰kb non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. It can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rates. MARV epidemics have occasionally been reported in Central Africa, with the largest one, having a 90% fatality rate, being reported in Angola between 2004 and 2005 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MARV infection was also reported outside Central Africa, such as in Germany, South Africa, Russia, and USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics available to prevent or treat MARV infection. Therefore, understanding the interplay between viral and host proteins during MARV replication is necessary to establish countermeasures for the diseases. For example, revealing the mechanisms for the assembly and transport of nucleocapsids, which are responsible for the transcription and replication of the viral genome, might contribute to the development of new therapeutic options.
