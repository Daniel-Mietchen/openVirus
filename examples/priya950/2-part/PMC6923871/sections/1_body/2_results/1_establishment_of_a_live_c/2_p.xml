<p id="Par27">At 18 h p.t., we detected a large number of moving signals with various shapes (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Movie S1). Over 1000 signals in the acquired movie sequences were analyzed. The representing sequence was expressed as the maximum intensity projection, in which the image projected maximum intensity of each time lapse. Among the signals, we focused on those signals showing long-distance and directional transport, which represent NCLSs trajectories [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). The direction of movement of each NCLS also varied, though the cause of this variation remains unclear. The speed of MARV NCLSs transport ranged from 10 nm/s to 500 nm/s, with a mean velocity of 167 ± 96 nm/s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d), which is comparable to the velocity of nucleocapsid transport in MARV-infected cells analyzed in BSL-4 laboratory (106 ± 96 nm/s at plasma membrane, 132 ± 59 nm/s inside filopodia, and 411 ± 87 nm/s in cytoplasm) [
