<p id="Par28">In MARV-infected cells, the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole does not alter the movement of nucleocapsids, whereas the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D arrests it [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. The culture medium was replaced at 15 h p.t. with Leibovitz’s medium containing either 0.15% DMSO (control), 0.15 M nocodazole, or 0.3 μM cytochalasin D (Fig.

Nocodazole treatment did not alter the trajectory length of NCLSs transport in comparison to the control, whereas cytochalasin D treatment induced immediate cessation of long-distance transport (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e-g). The mean velocity of NCLSs transport in the control or nocodazole-treated cells was 188 ± 98 nm/s and 219 ± 99 nm/s, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). The mean velocity of nucleocapsid transport in MARV-infected cells treated with DMSO and nocodazole was 379 ± 61 nm/s and 334 ± 55 nm/s, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A reduction in mean velocity is derived from the difference in the inclusion criteria for analysis, which was described in the Materials and Methods. Briefly, the trajectories of long-distance signals in the cytoplasmic region were analyzed in the previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], whereas we applied software-based quantitative analysis, including the signals in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and inside filopodia, in the current study. On the other hand, only a few non-specific NCLSs movements were detectable in cytochalasin D-treated cells, with a mean velocity of 2.73 ± 23 nm/s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i-j). These results confirmed that NCLSs transport is dependent on actin polymerization, as well as the suitability of our assay to test candidate drugs which target intracellular transport of nucleocapsid.
