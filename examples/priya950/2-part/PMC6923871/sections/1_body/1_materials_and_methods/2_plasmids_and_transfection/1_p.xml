 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The plasmid pCAGGS-VP30-GFP, coding for the green fluorescent protein-VP30 fusion protein, was produced as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The transfection was performed in 50 μL Opti-MEM without phenol red (Life Technologies) using TranSIT (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
