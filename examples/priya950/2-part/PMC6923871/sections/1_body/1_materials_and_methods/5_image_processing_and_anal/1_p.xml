<p id="Par25">Acquired pictures and movie sequences were processed using the Fiji plugin “TrackMate” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We used LoG detector, which enables detection of the targeted signals to the greatest possible extent. Subsequently, a Simple LAP tracker was used to follow trajectories of the moving signals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The majority of the detected signals were VP30-derived movement without formation of NCLSs, which can be differentiated by shorter trajectory length and random movement pattern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To avoid contamination of the signals derived solely from VP30, we omitted the signals demonstrating trajectory length less than 1 μm and velocity less than 10 nm/s, because they do not conform to the typical transport pattern of NCLSs/nucleocapsids, which is characterized by long-distance directional movement [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previously, we used manual tracking of signals, which primarily demonstrates trajectory length more than 5 μm, track duration over 30 s, and velocity of movement over 100 nm/s [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], although it was not optimized for quantitative analyses.
