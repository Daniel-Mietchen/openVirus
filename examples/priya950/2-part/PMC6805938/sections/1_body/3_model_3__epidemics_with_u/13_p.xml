<p id="Par34">We simulate the dynamics of this model with ODEs (Supplemental TextÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">C</xref>) similar to the ones in the previous sections. In addition to contact spreading dynamics, assortative and disassortative rewiring is performed according to the rules described above. We assume a well-mixed compartmental model with 
 <italic>N</italic> individuals and 
 <italic>E</italic> edges, in which we track the proportion of infected individuals 
 <italic>I</italic>, and the proportion of [
 <italic>II</italic>], [
 <italic>SI</italic>], and [
 <italic>SS</italic>] links. Neighborhoods (i.e. values of 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>) are assumed to be drawn with replacement from these compartments.
