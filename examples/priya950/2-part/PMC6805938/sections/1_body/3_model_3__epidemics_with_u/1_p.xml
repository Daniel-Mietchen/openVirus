<p id="Par22">The previous section considered how a bene spreads when its implicit benefit manifests in increased connections. Here, we consider the case when a bene has explicit consequences for an individual’s utility. We call an infectious trait a bene if becoming infected leads to an increase in utility. We consider how the utility conferred by the infection leads individuals to rewire strategically so as to influence infection dynamics and thereby increase their future expected utility. For example, if infected individuals can increase utility by growing the size of the infected population, they can ‘proselytize’ and spread the trait by seeking out new social connections to the susceptibles; on the other hand, if the infected gain utility from only being connected to other infected, the opposite rewiring dynamic can take hold.</p>
