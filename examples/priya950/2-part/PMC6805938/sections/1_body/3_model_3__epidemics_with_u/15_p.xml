<p id="Par36">The characteristics of these regimes vary with 
 <italic>β</italic>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the final reach of the epidemic and the cumulative rewiring for different values of 
 <italic>β</italic>. For the evangelizers case, the epidemic always spreads to the entire population. For the cool kids case, the reach of the epidemic increases gradually with 
 <italic>β</italic>, since faster spreading increases how many individuals get infected before the susceptible become disconnected. For the snobs case, larger 
 <italic>β</italic> increases the reach of the epidemic, with a rapid transition from minimal spread to full spread once 
 <italic>β</italic> passes a critical threshold. In all these cases, the total amount of rewiring decreases when 
 <italic>β</italic> is sufficiently large, since rewiring stops once the epidemic has swept through the population. Interestingly, the amount of rewirings for the snobs case also decreases with lower 
 <italic>β</italic>, peaking around the critical threshold. This occurs because when transmission is slow, equilibrium is reached very quickly: assortative rewiring by the infected and the susceptible quickly disconnects these two groups before the infection can spread.
