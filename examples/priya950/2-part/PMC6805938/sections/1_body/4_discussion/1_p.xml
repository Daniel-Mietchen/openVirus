<p id="Par38">In this paper, we model different scenarios of beneficial contagions, or benes. We investigate benes in several distinct systems, both biological and social. While the dynamics by which benes spread depend on the particular benefit conferred, we find commonalities across these systems. One interesting outcome is that all scenarios exhibit superexponential fixation in particular regimes, caused by both new regions of parameter space in traditional models (see Model 1) or by new mechanisms outside the scope of traditional models (see Model 2 and 3).</p>
