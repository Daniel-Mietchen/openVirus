<p id="Par40">The importance of horizontal transfer in evolutionary processes led us to consider a bene which increases interactions between individuals in a network. An example is new technologies with network effects, like the file-sharing service Dropbox, that incentivize users to actively recruit new members. We use an “SIS” epidemiological model to analyze the effects of these added network links. We find that added connections change how the epidemic threshold is determined by network density, allowing benes to break out despite lower transmissibility. We also find a much lower fixation time within the population. In fact, if new edges are added only with susceptible individuals, the bene sweeps the entire population in finite time. This result demonstrates that individual behavior is important in determining whether a beneficial epidemic occurs.</p>
