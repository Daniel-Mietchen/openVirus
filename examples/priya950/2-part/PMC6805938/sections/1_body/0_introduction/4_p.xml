<p id="Par5">We investigate epidemics of beneficial elements, which we call 
 <italic>benes</italic>, in three contexts (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our goal is to provide a breadth-first modeling exercise for beneficial epidemics in situations of differing dynamics and transmission structure. In many cases our analysis simply involves considering models in atypical parameter regimes. In each context, the bene always provides some benefit to individual hosts, yet the manifestation of the benefit is different and relevant to the specific scenario. In the first context we consider an evolutionary/population genetics model where the benefit is simply increased reproductive fitness. In the context of behavioral epidemiology, a relevant benefit must be manifested within the same generation and affect social behavior. We thus analyze a bene that causes the formation of new network links that preferentially target uninfected nodes. In the context of dynamic social networks with individual agent preferences, the concept of benefit must incorporate the opinions of individuals about what is beneficial to them. In this context, we investigate a family of benes that incite individuals to form new social ties and break existing ones. By studying different types of benefits across these contexts, we can identify features common to the dynamics of beneficial epidemics in general. Ultimately, we find that the spreading dynamics of benes is qualitatively different than in traditional epidemics.
