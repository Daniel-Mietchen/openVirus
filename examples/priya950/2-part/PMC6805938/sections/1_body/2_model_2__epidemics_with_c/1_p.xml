<p id="Par11">In the previous section, we considered benes whose beneficial effect occurs across generations in a well-mixed population, but in a heterogeneous population, the spread of a bene can be affected in the same generation by a change in the social behavior of infected individuals. Many modes of benefit manifest indirectly in an increased social connectivity of infected individuals: increased energy allowing more social connections, increased social desirability attracting new contacts, or conscious desire to spread the bene. Initially, we do not explicitly model the underlying benefit, but only consider its indirect effect on the network of social contacts in a population. We obtain a preliminary view of the spreading dynamics we expect for such benes. A more explicit consideration of how a contagionâ€™s benefit might induce a change in social behavior is the basis of the model analyzed in the next section.</p>
