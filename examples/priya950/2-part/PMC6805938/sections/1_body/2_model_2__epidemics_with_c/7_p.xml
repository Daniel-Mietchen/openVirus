<p id="Par17">We saw in the biological model that the steady state proportion of uninfected individuals can decrease toward zero superexponentially due to a combination of a fitness disadvantage and horizontal transmission. Using the present model, we find that such a superexponential decrease can also occur due to a combination of horizontal transmission and targeted link generation.</p>
