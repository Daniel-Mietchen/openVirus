  <p>Comparison of bene models. In the three schematics the black arrow represents one increment of time, the black circles are infected individuals, the red circles are newly infected individuals, and the open circles are susceptible individuals. In Model 1 H represents infection from horizontal transmission and V from vertical transmission. In Model 2 dashed red lines indicated new social connections and solid black lines indicated existing connections. The same holds for Model 3, with the addition of strategic rewiring, which includes both adding new links and severing certain existing ones.</p>
