<p>In this study, codetection of bacteria in the nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR was referred to as coinfection or colonization implying no difference in the meaning. The detection rate of any single viral pathogen of interest with any bacterial pathogen was 60%, in line with the previous studies of children with acute viral respiratory infections showing 23% to 83% of bacterial codetection.

 </sup> Colonization might directly influence transmission rate by the evolution of virulence factors, facilitated host adherence, and evasion from host immunity.

 </sup> Coinfections with viral pathogens enhance bacterial colonization of the airway, due to increased bacterial adherence facilitated by denuded airway epithelium during acute respiratory tract infections,

 </sup> pneumococcal coinfection in the upper respiratory tract was associated with reduced severity of viral LRTIs in this study, which might conflict with the known synergism between viral–bacterial coinfection. It can be partly explained by the small number of influenza cases; influenza cases diagnosed only by rapid influenza antigen test were not included in this study because no remnant frozen specimens were available for bacterial PCR assays. In addition, only seasonal influenza epidemics were observed during this study period, and none of the patients infected with influenza ended up with a severe clinical outcome.
