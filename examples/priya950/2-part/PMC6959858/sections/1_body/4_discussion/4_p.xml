 </sup> Our study also showed corresponding data supporting the patterns of polymicrobial dynamics, implying the complex competitive interactions during an acute respiratory infection might shift the association between bacteria from negative to positive. Except for 1 patient infected with RSV who showed cocolonization of both 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic> at the same time, those 2 bacteria were not detected together elsewhere. These findings were also concordant with the previous knowledge of negative associations between carriage of 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic>, which may be associated with immune-mediated interspecies inferences.
