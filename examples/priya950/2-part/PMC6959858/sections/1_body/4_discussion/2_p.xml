<p>This study over 2 consecutive influenza seasons showed that 60% of single respiratory viral infections including adenovirus, influenza viruses, and RSV occurred in the setting of coexistence of potentially pathogenic respiratory bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of young children. Frequently detected bacteria in the nasopharyngeal aspirates were different according to each viral infection regardless of upper or lower respiratory tract involvement. Although clinical severity of lower respiratory tract involvement from a single respiratory viral infection in young children was not affected by the presence of bacterial coinfection in the upper respiratory tract, codetection of any specific bacteria including 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> might affect the presence of wheezing and the clinical severity, respectively.
