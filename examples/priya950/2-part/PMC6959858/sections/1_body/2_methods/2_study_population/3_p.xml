<p>Patients with a respiratory infection were grouped into 3 severity subgroups, as mild, moderate, and severe infections; “mild” infection referred to no need for respiratory support, absence of tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt; 50/min at age of 2–11 mo and &gt; 40/min at age of 1–5 yrs),

 </sup> and no definite chest wall indrawing; “moderate” infection meant the presence of oxygen need (oxygen saturation &lt; 93% on room air), tachypnea or chest wall indrawing; “severe” infection was defined as need for advanced respiratory support due to respiratory failure (i.e., invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation), or need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission for reasons other than respiratory failure (i.e., hemodynamic instability, lethargy, reduced level of consciousness, convulsions), or cases of death.
