<p>Statistically significant risk factors associated with LRTIs were as follows: the presence of underlying diseases [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–7.75] and viral pathogen of RSV (aOR, 5.71; 95% CI, 2.02–16.1) (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, age was not an additional risk factor for progression to LRTIs among young children aged &lt; 5 years with respiratory viral infections (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.68–1.35). In addition, the presence of viral–bacterial coinfection and frequently observed pairs of viral–bacterial combinations did not have any significant influence on progression to LRTI.
