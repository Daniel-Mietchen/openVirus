<p>Among the 73 patients with LRTIs, age, underlying disease, and viral species did not affect the clinical severity (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">6</xref>); RSV infection itself had no association with the severity of LRTIs compared with adenoviral or influenza viral infections (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.26–3.68). Although codetection of 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> had a tendency to be associated with increased severity (aOR 3.14, 95% CI 0.92–10.0), the presence of viral–bacterial coinfection was not a risk factor for severe LRTIs (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.30–1.93). However, pneumococcal codetection itself was associated with reduced severity (aOR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07–0.89).
