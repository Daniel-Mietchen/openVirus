<p>Overall, 29 pairs of viral–bacterial codetections had ≥ 2 different bacteria simultaneously; dual or triple bacterial coinfection rate was not statistically different according to each virus, ranging from 27.8% to 30.8% (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The percent with ≥ 2 bacterial species was not statistically different between LRTI and non-LRTI [24.7% (18/73) and 37.9% (11/29), respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .180]. Although simultaneous detection of ≥ 3 different bacteria in the nasopharyngeal aspirates was not observed in adenoviral infection, 5 of the children infected with RSV or influenza virus were colonized with 3 different bacteria. However, none of the aspirates exhibited 4 different bacteria at once.
