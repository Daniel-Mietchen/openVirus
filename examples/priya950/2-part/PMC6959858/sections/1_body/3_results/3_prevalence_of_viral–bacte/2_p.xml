<p>Overall viralâ€“bacterial codetection rate was 59.8% (61/102); 
 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> was the most frequent bacteria in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (33.3%), followed by 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> (31.4%), 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> (21.6%), and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic> (7.8%) (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There was no significant difference in the distribution of 4 different bacteria in the upper respiratory tract according to the clinical diagnosis of LRTI and non-LRTI. Patients with influenza viruses showed higher bacterial coinfection rates (80.0%; 8/10) compared with those with adenoviruses (69.2%; 9/13) and RSV (55.7%; 44/79) even though there was no statistically significant difference. The most frequently observed pairs of viral and bacterial combination in each viral infection were as follows: adenovirus and 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> (46.2%; 6/13), RSV and 
 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> (34.2%; 27/79), and influenza viruses and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> (50.0%; 5/10). Pneumococcal coinfection rate was 50% in influenza viral infection, which was higher than that of adenovirus (15.3%) or RSV (18.9%).
