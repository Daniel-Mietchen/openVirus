<p>Although coexistence of bacteria does not have an apparent impact on progression to viral LRTI, the codetection of 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> was the protective factor for wheezing, and pneumococcal codetection was associated with reduced severity of viral LRTIs. Despite the small study population, influenza virus most frequently detected with 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, RSV with 
 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic>, and adenovirus with 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic>. Dual or triple bacterial coinfection rate was 28%, which was not statistically different according to each virus or progression to LRTIs. A future study with a larger study population and perhaps including lower respiratory tract aspirates might help to elucidate the active interaction mechanism between viralâ€“bacterial interactions and provide insight to the risk-stratified management of respiratory infections among young children.
