<p>In healthy children, the upper respiratory tract is colonized by several microorganisms which can become potential pathogens in certain circumstances. 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> is detected as a colonizer of 8% to15% of healthy, asymptomatic adults and adolescents, and 30% to 70% of children, which is responsible for most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, and meningitis.

 </sup> Evidence is accumulating that bacterial colonization or infection of the respiratory tract might modulate the viral infection by disturbing various steps of defense mechanism spanning to signal pathway and viral infection might also modulate the subsequent bacterial infection in similar context.
