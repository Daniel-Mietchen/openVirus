<p>Respiratory tract infections cause a significant morbidity and mortality in children, especially during infancy to preschool age. The majority of acute respiratory infections can be attributed to viral infection, possessing a self-limiting clinical course and often confined to upper respiratory tract involvement. Among diverse respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are the most common pathogens during the winter season in temperate countries. RSV is one of the most important causes of lower respiratory tract infections in infants leading to respiratory failure; internationally 200,000 deaths and 3,000,000 hospitalizations each year are attributed to RSV infection by either direct or nondirect impacts.

 </sup> Although influenza viruses are far less common than RSV infection, except for seasonal outbreaks, severe complications can occur when the elderly, children, and patients with underlying disease become infected. Adenovirus infection can manifest with diverse clinical presentations based on serotype all year round and is the causative organism in 5% to 10% of lower respiratory tract infections in children.
