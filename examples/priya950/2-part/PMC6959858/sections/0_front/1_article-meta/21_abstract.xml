 <p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of bacterial coexistence and the coinfection dynamics between bacteria and respiratory viruses among young children. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from children aged &lt; 5 years hospitalized with a community-acquired single respiratory viral infection of influenza, adenovirus, or RSV during 2 recent consecutive influenza seasons. Remnant respiratory specimens were used for bacterial PCR targeting 
  <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic>
 </p>
 <p>A total of 102 children were included; median age was 0.8 years and 44.1% had underlying comorbidities. Overall, 6.8% (7/102) of cases were classified as severe diseases requiring intensive care unit admission and/or mechanical ventilation and ranged from 8.8% for a patient with RSV and 7.6% for those with adenovirus to 0% for those with influenza viruses. The overall viral–bacterial codetection rate was 59.8% (61/102); 
  <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> was the most frequent (33.3%), followed by 
  <italic>H influenzae</italic> (31.4%). Influenza cases showed higher bacterial codetection rates (80.0%; 8/10) compared with those with adenoviruses (69.2%; 9/13) and RSV (55.7%; 44/79). 
  <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and 
  <italic>H influenzae</italic> codetections were associated with reduced severity (aOR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07–0.89), and reduced risk of wheezing (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13–0.98), respectively.
 </p>
 <p>We observed the interactions between respiratory viruses and bacteria and the clinical significance of viral–bacterial coexistence in upper airway on disease severity. Future study will be necessary to elucidate the active interactions between different viruses and bacteria and give clues to risk stratified strategy in the management of respiratory infections among young children.</p>
