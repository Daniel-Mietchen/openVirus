 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic trees of consensus influenza virus HA gene derived by Nanopore and Illumina sequencing. A maximum likelihood tree was generated using 500 bootstrap replicates in the RAxML v8.2.10 software. Bootstrap values of &gt;70 are shown. The scale bar shows the substitutions per site. Red and blue indicate sequences derived from Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Illumina sequencing, respectively. Reference sequences are shown in black.</p>
