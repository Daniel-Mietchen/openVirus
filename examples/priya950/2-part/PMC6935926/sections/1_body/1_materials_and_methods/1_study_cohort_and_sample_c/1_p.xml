<p>We collected respiratory samples from the clinical microbiology laboratory at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a large tertiary referral teaching hospital in Southeast England. We worked with anonymized residual material from throat and nose swabs generated as a result of routine clinical investigations between January and May 2018. Samples were collected using a sterile polyester swab inoculated into 1 to 3 ml of sterile viral transport medium (VTM), using a standard approach described on the CDC website (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). During the study, respiratory samples submitted to the clinical diagnostic laboratory were routinely tested by a PCR-based test using the GeneXpert assay (Cepheid) to detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The workflow is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Samples from patients in designated high-risk locations (hematology, oncology, and critical care) were tested using the BioFire FilmArray (bioMérieux) to detect an expanded panel of bacterial and viral pathogens. Quantitative data (cycle threshold [
