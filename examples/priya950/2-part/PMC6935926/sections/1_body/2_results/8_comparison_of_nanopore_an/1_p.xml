<p>We selected a subset of 15 samples from across the viral titer range and resequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The proportions of reads generated that mapped to the influenza virus genome were similar between the two sequencing technologies (Fig. S5). From 4 of the samples, nearly complete genomes were obtained. A comparison of consensus sequences derived from Nanopore and Illumina sequencing showed 100% concordance, except one sample that showed 7 nucleotide differences (identity, 99.94%) (Table S2).</p>
