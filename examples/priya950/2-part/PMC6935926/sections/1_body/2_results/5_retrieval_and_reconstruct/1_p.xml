<p>For the Hazara virus control (10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml spike), genome coverage was 81.4 to 99.4% (at 1× depth) for pools 1 and 2. Coverage in the high-background pool 3 was more varied (21.5 to 96.5%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Influenza A virus genome coverage at 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/ml was ≥99.3% for each segment in all samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). At 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml of influenza virus, a mean 1× coverage per segment was 90.3% for pools 1 and 2 but was substantially reduced in the high-background pool 3 to 5.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). At influenza virus titers of &lt;10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/ml, coverage was highly varied across genome segments. However, when present at 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/ml, 2/3 pools had sufficient data for correct subtyping as H3N2 (
