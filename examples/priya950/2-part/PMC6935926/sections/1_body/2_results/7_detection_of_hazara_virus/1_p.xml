<p>Detection of the control virus (Hazara virus at 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml) was highly varied, demonstrating that levels of background nontarget RNA are a major source of intersample variation. The number of Hazara virus reads per sample ranged from 0 to 13.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> (0 to 3.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> RPM), with a median of 70 reads (160 RPM) and mean of 706 reads (1.7 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> RPM) (Table S1). Four (8%) of 50 samples generated no detectable Hazara virus reads, two with high numbers of influenza virus reads (for sample 1,

 <sup>5</sup> influenza B virus reads, and for sample 6,

  <sub>T</sub>

 <sup>4</sup> influenza A virus reads) acting to dilute the control signal. The other two samples contained no detectable influenza virus reads (for sample 34, 
 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
