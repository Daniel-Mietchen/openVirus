<p>Nanopore sequencing of the triplicate SISPA preparations of the influenza A virus-positive pool produced mean ± standard deviation of 5.3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ± 3.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> RPM mapping to the influenza A virus genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Across the dilution series, the proportion of influenza virus reads was strongly associated with influenza virus titer (
 <italic>P</italic> value = 4.7 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) but was also influenced by which negative pool was used for dilution, consistent with the pattern observed for the Hazara virus control. Sequencing the negative controls (pools with no influenza virus spike) generated no reads mapping to influenza virus. At influenza virus titers of &lt;10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/ml, influenza virus reads were inconsistently detected across the samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that the limit of detection is between 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 10
 <sup>3</sup> influenza virus copies/ml.
