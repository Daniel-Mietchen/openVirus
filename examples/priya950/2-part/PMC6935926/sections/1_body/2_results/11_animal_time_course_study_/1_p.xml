<p>Finally, we used samples collected from a previous animal experiment (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) to test the reproducibility of our methods across a time course model of influenza A virus infection (three ferrets swabbed preinfection [day âˆ’3] and then sampled at days 1, 2, 3, and 5 following laboratory infection with influenza A virus). The proportion of viral reads present at each time point was highly congruent with viral titer (titer is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and sequencing reads in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). We generated consensus genome sequences from Nanopore data at days 2, 3, and 5 postinfection; these were 100% concordant with Illumina-derived consensus sequences from the same cDNA (Table S2).
