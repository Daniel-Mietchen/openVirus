<p>Our method protocol is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>. We first sequenced five influenza A virus-positive and five influenza virus-negative throat swabs, each spiked with Hazara virus control at 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml. Using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), followed by Nanopore sequencing, we produced metagenomic data dominated by reads that were bacterial in origin, with extremely few viral reads detected. Passing the sample through a 0.4-Î¼m filter prior to nucleic acid extraction increased the detection of viral reads by several orders of magnitude (Fig. S1). Filtration is relatively expensive, so we also assessed the alternative approach of adding a rapid-centrifugation step to pellet bacterial and human cells, followed by nucleic acid extraction from the supernatant. We used a pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples (concentration, 10
 <sup>6</sup> genome copies/ml) to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility, with the Hazara virus control spiked in at 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml. Enrichment for influenza virus and Hazara virus was similar for filtration versus centrifugation, based on read mapping to the viral genome (Fig. S2). As centrifugation is simpler and less expensive, we selected this approach for all further testing.
