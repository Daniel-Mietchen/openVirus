<p>Having demonstrated our ability to retrieve influenza virus sequences from pooled influenza virus-positive material diluted with negative samples, we next applied our methods to individual anonymized clinical samples, with 40 samples testing influenza virus positive and 10 samples testing influenza virus negative in the clinical diagnostic laboratory. Data yield varied between flow cells (range, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 13.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> reads from up to 12 multiplexed samples). Within flow cells, barcode performance was inconsistent when using a stringent, dual-barcode, demultiplexing method (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). From each clinical sample, the range of total reads generated was 1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 2.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> (median, 3.8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> reads) (Table S1).
