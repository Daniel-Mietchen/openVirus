<p>Reads mapping to either the influenza A or B virus genome were present in all 27 samples with a

  <sub>T</sub>

No reads classified as influenza virus were obtained from sequencing the 10 GeneXpert assay-negative samples (Table S1). Based on this small data set, sensitivity is 83% and specificity is 100% (95% CI, 67 to 93% and 69 to 100%, respectively). There was a strong correlation between 
 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> value and both the reads per sample classified as influenza virus (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.60) and the number of influenza virus reads per million reads (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.62) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The consensus genome sequences generated (at 10× minimum depth) covered over 90% of the influenza virus genome for 17 samples, with another two generating over 80% coverage. The highest 
 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> value of a sample from which &gt;90% of an influenza virus genome sequence was generated was 27.5 (Fig. S4).
