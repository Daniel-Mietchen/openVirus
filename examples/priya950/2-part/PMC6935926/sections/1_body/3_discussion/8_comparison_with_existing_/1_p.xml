<p>The current standard assay for influenza diagnosis employed within the large tertiary referral teaching hospital in which this study was performed is the GeneXpert assay (Cepheid), which detects influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Wider testing is performed on a subset of samples using the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel (bioMérieux), targeted at 20 common respiratory pathogens (17 viruses and 3 bacteria). These assays have the advantages over a metagenomic approach of higher sensitivity, shorter handling times, simpler laboratory workflow, and very rapid time to result (30 and 65 min, respectively). Compared to a metagenomic approach, their limitations are that no sequence data informative for molecular epidemiology and drug resistance typing are generated for the target pathogens, and that the assay will only detect the small number of pathogens targeted. Periodic refinement of such assays is required in the event of newly emergent pathogens or diverse strains of established pathogens leading to assay escape. This is not an issue affecting metagenomic sequencing, which has the ability to detect all RNA viruses in a sequence-independent manner. At the time of undertaking this laboratory work, the materials costs of the metagenomic sequencing were ∼£140 per sample when multiplexing six samples per flow cell and purchasing 48 flow cells together. The cost of the current influenza A/B and RSV GeneXpert test is ∼£56, and the BioFire RP panel costs ∼£139 per sample. The existing tests have the significant advantage of short handling times and simple processing, whereas the metagenomic sequencing requires ∼8 h and skilled laboratory staff.</p>
