<p>The current limitations of metagenomic methods are their sensitivity in the context of low-pathogen-titer samples. PCR-based methods measure the absolute count of viral genome copies present within a sample. Metagenomic sequencing measures the proportion of total RNA that is viral. Metagenomic sequencing is therefore affected by the level of nontarget RNA within a given sample, whereas PCR is not. As demonstrated here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), detection of as little as 10
 <sup>2</sup> genome copies per ml is possible from throat swab samples (a level comparable with PCR-based methods), but variation in the level of background nucleic acids between individual samples makes detection at this level inconsistent. Further development of methods to deplete host and bacterial RNA within the samples is required to improve the performance of the assay at

  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> values of &gt;30. Enrichment of pathogen sequences within libraries through either target capture or amplification is also an effective method to reduce the limit of target detection (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) but requires the same 
 <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of both which pathogens are to be targeted and the full range of circulating viral diversity as other targeted methods discussed above, albeit with increased tolerance for diversity over PCR-based methods. A further limitation compared to alternative sequencing technologies is the lack of confidence in determining the presence of minority variants due to the limited per-read accuracy, although we expect this to be addressed in future iterations of the ONT sequencing.
