<p>The correlation between

 </italic> value and Nanopore reads confirms semiquantitative output. Using samples from the ferret influenza virus model, collected under standardized laboratory conditions, we demonstrated excellent reproducibility of viral read proportions at a given viral titer across biological replicates. However, we observed heterogeneity in output between clinical samples as well as between Nanopore flow cells, suggesting that the current platform is not yet sufficiently reliable for reproducibly generating quantitative data. In addition, the detection of positive controls can be impaired in high-background samples.
