<p id="Par43">miRNA-based RNA interference has become a powerful new means to inhibit viral infection in a gene-specific manner, and diverse miRNA-based delivery system has been developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We believe that cellular natural miRNAs are more suitable for being developed as antiviral drugs than artificial siRNAs. Although their off-target effects cannot be totally avoided, endogenous miRNAs may have fewer side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and sometimes show a synergistic effect in the treatment of multiple diseases. Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] found that miR-188-3p might be a new potential therapy for atherosclerosis by inhibiting macrophage proinflammatory response and oxidation. Pei et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] found that miR-188-3p inhibited the cell proliferation and motility in breast cancer by targeting Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 3 (TMED3). Pichler et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] identified miR-188-3p as a novel prognostic marker and molecular factor involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. Our work expanded the insight into antiviral function of miR-188-3p.
