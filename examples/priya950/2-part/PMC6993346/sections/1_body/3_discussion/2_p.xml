<p id="Par40">In this study, only miRNAs that potentially target the polymerase genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) or the nucleoprotein (NP) gene were considered. PB2, PB1 and PA together formed the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein complexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and NP wrapped and protected the viral RNA. NP, viral RNA and the three polymerase proteins together formed ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) during the replication process of IAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The four proteins not only involved in the transcription and translation of the viral genes, but also played an important role in the nuclear export of viral RNA and protein and in the viral aggregation process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, the four genes were the relatively conservative segments of IAV.
