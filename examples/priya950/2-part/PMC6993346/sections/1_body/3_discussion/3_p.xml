<p id="Par41">The bioinformation prediction can help us to scale down time and cost by screening a few miRNAs which have surpassed the in-silico analysis for biological validation. However, high false positive rate existed in bioinformatics analysis. In this study, five broad-spectrum miRNAs were screened for further experimental verification. miR-15a-3p was excluded in the luciferase assay. All the other four miRNAs effectively repressed the expression of related target protein under plasmid transfection conditions. But, in the virus infection assays, miR-188-3p showed an obviously more effective virus inhibitory activity that the other three miRNAs. Therefore, a combination of bioinformation prediction and biological validation is an attractive strategy in enabling to propose new broad-spectrum therapeutic strategies to combat human IAVs in a very cost effective manner.</p>
