<p id="Par19">Influenza A virus (IAV) is a kind of single negative-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is the causative agents for both seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza, posing major public health challenges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The annual epidemics of seasonal influenza caused 3â€“5 million cases of severe illness worldwide. In addition, four influenza pandemics have been recorded since the twentieth century: the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu and the 2009 swine flu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], leading to an estimated 300,000 to 50 million deaths worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, parts of highly pathogenic avian IAVs acquired the ability to cross the interspecies barrier causing sporadic infections in humans with high fatality rate, such as H5N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], H5N6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and H7N9 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Vaccination and small-molecule antiviral drugs (such as M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors) are considered the best options for control of influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, because of the easily occurrence of antigenic drift and antigenic shift, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually and the number of reports of drug-resistant influenza strains keeps increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Particularly, more than 95% of the current circulating IAV strains are resistant to M2 ion channel blockers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The continued threat of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks and the limitations of current antiviral strategies underscore the urgent need for developing new influenza therapies.
