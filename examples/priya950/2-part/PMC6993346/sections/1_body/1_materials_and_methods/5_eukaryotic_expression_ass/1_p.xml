<p id="Par26">To determine whether miRNA could repress the expression of target viral protein. HEK-293 T cells were plated in 12-well plates. When the cells reached a confluence of 50 to 60%, they were co-transfected with viral protein expression vectors (1.5 μg) and miRNA (60 nM). After 48 h, the cells were collected and analyzed by a Western blot assay and real-time PCR.</p>
