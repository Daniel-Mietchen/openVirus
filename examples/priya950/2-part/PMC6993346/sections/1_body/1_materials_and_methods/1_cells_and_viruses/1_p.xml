<p id="Par22">The human renal epithelial cells (HEK-293 T) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were purchased from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator with humidified air. Influenza A viruses, A/FM/1/47(H1N1) (abbreviated as FM47), A/quail/Hebei/CH06–07/2018(H7N9) (abbreviated as QA07) and A/chicken/Hubei/XY918/2016(H5N6) (abbreviated as CK918), were propagated in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Specific Pathogen Free, Merial-Vital Laboratory Animal Technology, Beijing, China) for 48–72 h at 35 °C. The allantoic fluid was clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min and stored at − 80 °C until use. Virus production was titrated in MDCK cells and titers were calculated by the method developed by Reed and Muench. This study was approved by the Biosafety Committee and Ethics Committee of the Institute of Military Veterinary.</p>
