<p id="Par29">To determine the effects of miRNAs on the replication of Influenza A virus, A549 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. When the cells reached a confluence of 80%, miRNA mimics (60 nM) were transfection in cells. After 6 h, the cells were infected with influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. At 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 h post infection, supernatants were collected to measure 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in MDCK cells. At 48 h post infection, infected cells were harvested for total protein extraction and total RNA preparation.
