<p id="Par24">3′-UTR reporter analysis experiments were used to assess the potential miRNA targets on Influenza A virus. Fragments that containing potential miRNA target were amplified by PCR and directly cloned into pGL3-cm, in which the multiple cloning site of the pGL3-control vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was removed and placed downstream of the luciferase gene as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These constructed vectors were named pGL3-PB2–188-3p, pGL3-PB2–345-5p, pGL3-PB1–3183, pGL3-PA-15a-3p, and pGL3-NP-769-3p. For western blot assays, coding region of PB1, PB2, PA and NP were amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). For ease of detection, flag tag was added to the 3′ primer, generating pcDNA3.1-flag-PB2, pcDNA3.1-flag-PB1, pcDNA3.1-flag-PA and pcDNA3.1-flag-NP. In order to further confirm the binding between miR-188-3p and PB2, the nucleotide sequence of putative binding sites in the pGL3-PB2–188-3p was mutant by overlap PCR. The mutant fragment was cloned into pGL3-cm to generate pGL3-mut-PB2–188-3p.
