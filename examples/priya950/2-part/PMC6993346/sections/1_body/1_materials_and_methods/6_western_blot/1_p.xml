<p id="Par27">Total protein extracts of transfected cells were prepared for Western blot analysis in lysis buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche). For immunoblotting, protein exacts were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Bioscience). Membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in a purified primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:1000 dilution in 5% skim milk. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (TBST), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) at a 1:5000 dilution in 5% skim milk. Protein bands were visualized using the X-ray film, developing solution and fixing solution (Kodak) in darkroom. β-actin was used as a loading control.</p>
