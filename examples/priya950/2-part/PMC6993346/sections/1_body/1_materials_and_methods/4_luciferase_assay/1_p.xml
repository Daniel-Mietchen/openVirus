<p id="Par25">HEK-293 T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 200 ng of pGL3, 10 ng of pRL-TK (
 <italic>Renilla</italic>, Promega) and 60 nM miRNA mimics (Genepharma, Shanghai, China) by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). The scrambled miRNA was used as negative control. To ensure consistent transfection efficiency, we also added a control group that transfected FAM-labeled single-stranded negative control miRNA mimics in every experiment. The transfection efficiency was assessed by the fluorescent percentage at 24 h post transfection. Only experiments with transfection efficiency more than 70% were considered for further analysis. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μL of passive lysis buffer according to the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay protocol (Promega). After 10 min, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 12,000×
 <italic>g</italic> for 30s, and luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay systems (Promega) on the Luminometer TD-20/20 (Turner Designs). The relative luciferase expression equals the expression of firefly luciferase (pGL3) divided by the expression of 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (pRL-TK). All experiments were repeated at least three times.
