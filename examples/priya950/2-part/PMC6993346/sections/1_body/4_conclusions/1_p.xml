<p id="Par45">In summary, this work for the first time developed a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening strategy by using miRanda software, and found that miR-188-3p, potentially targeting 99.96% of human IAVs, could effectively repress IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) replication in infected A549 cells by targeting PB2 mRNA. This strategy can be extended to any other virus researches, which provided valuable insight into the development of miRNA-based therapies against viral infection.</p>
