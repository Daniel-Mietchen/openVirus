<p id="Par35">Since miR-188-3p, miR-345, miR-3183 and miR-769-3p can downregulate the expression of viral protein, we then investigated whether overexpression of these miRNAs affect influenza A virus replication. A549 cells were tranfected with miRNA mimics or the scramble control, followed by infection with FM47 at MOI = 0.01. Supernatant was collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post-infection (hpi) and the titers was determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. As showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, miR-188-3p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity on FM47 replication at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hpi compared to the negative control, especially at 48 hpi, titers were 0.91 units (8.1 times) lower than that of negative control. The other three miRNAs, miR-345-5p, miR-3183 and miR-769-3p, could also significantly repress FM47 replication at 24, 36, 48 and 60 hpi. However, they were not as effective as miR-188-3p. In addition, we detected the expression of viral proteins and mRNAs in A549 cells overexpressing miRNAs at 48 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b-e). The results were consistent with that of viral replication. All four miRNAs could inhibit the expression of viral proteins and mRNAs and miR-188-3p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity. In summary, these result indicated that miR-188-3p could effectively inhibit FM47 replication.
