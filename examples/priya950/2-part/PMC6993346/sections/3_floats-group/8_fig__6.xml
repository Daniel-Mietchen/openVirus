  <p>miR-188-3p inhibits the replication of IAV through targeting the potential binding sites on PB2. 
   <bold>a</bold> specific miRNA inhibitors were contransfected into HEK-293 T cells with the miRNA mimics and dual-luciferase reporter vectors to further confirm the inhibitory effect of miR-188-3p on PB2 expression. 
   <bold>b</bold> the potential binding sites of miR-188-3p seed region were mutant in the luciferase reporter vector. 
   <bold>c</bold> Luciferase assay to analyze the importance of binding sites of miR-188-3p in the PB2 gene to inhibit the relative luciferase activity from pGL3-PB2–188-3p and pRL-TK-control vector. * (
