    <bold>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</bold> miR-188-3p inhibits the replication of H7N9 and H5N6 influenza A virus in A549 cells. TCID
    <sub>50</sub> values were used to assess the effects of miRNAs on replication of H7N9 (A) and H5N6 (B) influenza A virus in A549 cells. The strains used were A/quail/Hebei/CH06–07/2018(H7N9) and A/chicken/Hubei/XY918/2016(H5N6). Data were determined in triplicate at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post infection. * (
