 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have used mass-spectrometry (MS)-based non-biased quantitative strategies to measure how IAV affects the host cell proteome. Each of these assays identified thousands of cellular proteins, and collectively, these studies have determined dysregulation of various pathways, such as acetylation, cell structure, defense responses, protein binding, responses to stress, stimulus and virus, alternative splicing, localization, transport, protein binding and nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism. However, these non-biased global types of strategies have a few limitations. First, since the more abundant proteins are likely to be identified by MS, the less abundant proteins, many of which play key functions, are more likely to be missed. In addition, there usually is less than 100% overlap between replicate MS-identified samples. Multiplex protein arrays have the potential to overcome such limitations, but most are antibody-based and currently limited to a few hundred analytes.
