<p>A newly developed proteomics technology, called SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup>, and developed by SomaLogics, Inc. (Boulder, CO, USA) provides an alternate strategy to simultaneously sample &gt;1300 specific proteins of interest [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in up to ~90 samples. SOMAmers
 <sup>®</sup> are chemically modified slow off-rate aptamers (short nucleotides) to stabilize protein binding capacity. We used this technology to complement our earlier quantitative MS-based studies and identified numerous low-abundant proteins, including cytokines and chemokines that are differentially dysregulated by IAV associated with no or mild human infection, compared to H5N1 and H7N9 strains associated with highly pathogenic human infection.
