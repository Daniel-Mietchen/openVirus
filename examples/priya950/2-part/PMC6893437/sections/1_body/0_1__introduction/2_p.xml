<p>Virtually all H/N combinations have been identified in water fowl [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the generally-accepted reservoir, except for the recent identification of H17N10 and H18N11 in bats [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but only a small number of H/N types are known to circulate or have circulated in humans; H1N1 (1918 “Spanish Flu” and the pandemic H1N1 2009 strains), H2N2 and H3N2. There has also been a sporadic but highly lethal spread of H5N1 and H7N9 from birds to humans [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several anti-viral strategies, including small molecule inhibitors and yearly re-formulated vaccines, have been developed to combat IAV, but the virus′ extensive genetic plasticity, caused by an error-prone polymerase and capacity to mix genetic content, often leads to resistance to virus-targeted anti-viral strategies. Because all viruses are obligate parasites, and must therefore make widespread use of host cell machinery, an alternate anti-viral strategy that is being explored would be to elucidate host factors that are required by, and modulated by, the virus, for its successful pathogenicity and propagation.
