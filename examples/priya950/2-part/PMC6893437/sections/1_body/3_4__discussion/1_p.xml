<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a significant human pathogen that is constantly emerging and re-emerging. The virus’ genetic make-up of eight segments of single-stranded RNA allows for significant genetic plasticity. Like other RNA viruses that lack genetic proof reading, the highly error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to a high mutation rate (=antigenic drift), and the segmented genomes allows for segment mixing during co-infections, leading to emergence of new isolates (=antigenic shift). Thus, vaccines need to be reformulated each year, and the process of attempting to anticipate future isolates often leads to vaccine mismatch [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, there has been increasing interest to identify host factors that the virus may require for replication and pathogenicity to complement strategies that only target the virus. A number of studies, including genome-wide RNAi screens, mRNA microarray screens and yeast 2-hybid assays have identified &gt;1500 cellular targets worthy of further analysis [
