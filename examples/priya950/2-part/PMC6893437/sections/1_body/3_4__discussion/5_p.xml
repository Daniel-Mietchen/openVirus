<p>Genome-wide RNAi screens and mRNA microarray screens identified &gt;1500 cellular genes and proteins influenza virus may depend upon [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, Konig and colleagues identified 295 genes that were required for influenza virus replication as defined by replicase activity [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Karlas and colleagues identified 287 genes required for replication of two different influenza viruses, including the pdm09 strain [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Collectively, these two RNAi screens, also carried out in A549 cells, identified 552 potential genes important for influenza replication, with 30 genes found in common. The low level of overlap between these various RNAi screens has been previously noted [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We assessed potential overlap between genes identified in the two Karlas and Konig A549 studies with proteins we could detect and measure in A549 cells with our SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> panel. Only four genes/proteins (JUN, KPNB1, MAP2K3 and MDM2) overlapped in all three datasets, and of these, only KPNB1 was significantly altered according to SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup>; downregulated 1.48-fold by H5N1 infection. Thirty-one additional genes identified by Karlas are in the SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> panel; of these, 14 were significantly dysregulated by at least one of our tested viruses. Seven proteins were significantly dysregulated by both H5N1 and H7N9, but &lt;1.35-fold. Only one protein, B2M, was dysregulated &gt;1.35-fold; it was upregulated 2.7-fold and only by PR8 infection. Forty genes identified by Konig, including the four found in all three datasets, are in the SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> panel; of these, 12 were significantly dysregulated by at least one of our tested viruses. FGFR4 was dysregulated, but less than 20%, by three viruses; pdm09, H5N1 and H7N9. Only two of the 14 proteins were dysregulated &gt;1.5-fold; APP was downregulated 3.7-fold by H5N1 and 8-fold by H7N9, and FGFR1 was downregulated 2.1-fold by H7N9 infection. The 71 genes/proteins identified by Karlas and/or Konig and that were present in our SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> panel represent proteins involved in numerous diverse functions, including cytokines, enzymes, growth factors, transmembrane receptors and many kinases, as do many of the proteins newly identified in this SOMAscan. Thus, these different methods identify a large number of cellular genes and proteins that should be more extensively analyzed as potential targets to ameliorate influenza virus infection.
