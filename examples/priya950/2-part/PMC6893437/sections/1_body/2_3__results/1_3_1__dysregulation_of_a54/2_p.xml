<p>Most of the dysregulated proteins were affected &lt;25%; thus, we considered more stringent parameters and chose fold-change cut-offs of 1.5-fold (=down-regulated to 0.667 of mock) along with significance. Thus, proteins that were dysregulated &gt;1.5-fold, but not considered significant by either 
 <italic>p</italic>-value or Z-score, because of a substantial variability in replicate values, were excluded from the subsequent analysis. Using these parameters, we identified 76 proteins that were significantly dysregulated by infection with any of the tested viruses (

Five or fewer proteins were significantly dysregulated by RV733 and the pdm09 strains, 15 were dysregulated by PR8, with all but one being significantly upregulated, and 38 and 47 were dysregulated by H5N1 and H7N9, respectively, with the vast majority of these proteins downregulated.
