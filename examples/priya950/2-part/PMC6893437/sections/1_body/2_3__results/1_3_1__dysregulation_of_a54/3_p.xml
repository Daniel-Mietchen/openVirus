<p>Several immune-regulating proteins, including ISG15, OAS1 and STAT1 were upregulated by PR8 infection (

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thrombopoietin and neural cell adhesion molecule L1 were the only proteins upregulated by RV733 and pdm09, respectively. Few proteins were upregulated by the avian IAV strains in the panel of 1310 SOMAmers. C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5) and IL-8 (CXCL8) were both upregulated by both H5N1 and H7N9 and a few other proteins were upregulated by PR8 and H5N1 (

 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.77 was determined when H5N1-dysregulated proteins were compared to H7N9-dysregulated proteins (
