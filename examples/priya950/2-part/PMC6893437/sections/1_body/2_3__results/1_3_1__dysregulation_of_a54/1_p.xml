<p>A549 cell lysates of IAV- and mock-infected cells were collected 24hpi from two (PR8 and RV733) or three (mock and all other IAV clones) biologic replicates and analyzed with a SomaLogic
 <sup>®</sup> version 1.3 platform. Each of 1310 protein analytes was examined and relative quantities determined. Values for each of the infected samples were normalized to the mock samples from the same replicates, and these comparative values were then analyzed. More than 500 proteins were significantly dysregulated by infection (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 and/or Z-score &gt; 1.96σ or &lt;−1.96σ), and far more proteins were dysregulated by both of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian strains than by any of the H1N1 strains (
