<p>These data imply that overall, the seasonal RV733 strain and the pdm09 strain have relatively mild effect, as measured by this small set of SOMAmers, the PR8 strain has an overall activation effect, primarily of immune-modulated and cellular movement molecules, and the H5N1 and H7N9 strains have dramatic inhibitory effects upon multiple cellular processes. IPA network analyses also revealed differences in how each virus affected common cellular networks. The four highest scoring Networks, based on numbers of focus molecules, were the Cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking, the Antimicrobial response, cell death and survival, inflammatory response, the Cardiovascular system development and function, embryonic development and organismal development and the Post-translational modification, protein degradation and protein synthesis networks. The Cellular movement, hematological system development and function, and the immune cell trafficking network was mildly affected by PR8. No proteins in this network were affected by RV733 or pdm09. Apart from CCL5 and CXCL8, which were both upregulated by both H5N1 and H7N9, many proteins in this network were significantly downregulated by the two avian IAV strains (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01028-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This network also was mildly affected by RV733 infection, but not by pdm09 infection. Three focus molecules in this network (CD207, ISG15 and IFNL1) were upregulated and three (IGFBP7, MICA and PGD) were downregulated by H5N1 infection. CD207 was also upregulated and MICA also was downregulated by H7N9 infection, and additionally, LGALS3BP and RSPO2 were downregulated by H7N9 infection. One or more proteins in the Cardiovascular system development and function, embryonic development and organismal development network were upregulated and one or more were downregulated by every virus tested. However, many more proteins (such as FSTL1, IGFBP4, NOTCH and STC) were downregulated by the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses than by any of the H1N1 viruses. Furthermore, HDL was slightly upregulated in every H1N1 network, but downregulated in both the H5N1 and H7N9 networks. Finally, there also were substantial differences in the Post-translational modification, protein degradation and protein synthesis network. Many more proteins (such as CTSA, CTSV, MFGE8 and TNFRSF21) were downregulated by the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses than by any of the H1N1 viruses. Furthermore, cathepsin was slightly upregulated in every H1N1 network, but downregulated in both the H5N1 and H7N9 networks.
