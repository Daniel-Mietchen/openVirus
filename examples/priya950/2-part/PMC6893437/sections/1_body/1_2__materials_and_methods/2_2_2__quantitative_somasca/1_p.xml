<p>Cell lysate protein concentrations were adjusted to 200 ng/μL, and 70 µL of each was analyzed in-house on a SomaLogics
 <sup>®</sup>-licensed SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> version 1.3 platform in the Manitoba Centre for Proteomics and Systems Biology as described [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> is a new proteomic tool that uses SOMAmers
 <sup>®</sup>, DNA Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers (22). These modified nucleotides are used because they bind to specific human proteins. SOMAmers
 <sup>®</sup> bind proteins in their native state, and are measured on DNA microarray chips. SOMAmers
 <sup>®</sup> measure fM–μM protein quantities. The SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> version 1.3 simultaneously measures 1310 distinct proteins in up to 88 samples [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Two biologic replicates of PR8 and RV733, and three biologic replicates of Mock-, pdm09-, H5N1- and H7N9-infected samples were collected at 24 hpi (=14 total samples) and were analyzed at the same time in a single SOMAscan
 <sup>®</sup> 96-well plate. Results are reported as relative fluorescent units (RFUs) for every protein, and these RFUs are directly proportional to the quantities of each target protein in the original samples, confirmed by standard curve generation for every protein-SOMAmer pair [
