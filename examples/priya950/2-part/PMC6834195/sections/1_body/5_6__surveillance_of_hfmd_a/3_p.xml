<p>EV-induced HFMD is recognized clinically as a syndrome; however, EV-induced CNS infections, such as encephalitis, are more frequently judged as encephalitis of unknown origin unless the pathogen is confirmed by laboratory methods. HFMD was identified as a distinct clinical entity 60 years ago, and since then has been a significant source of outbreaks [
