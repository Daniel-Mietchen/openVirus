<p>As vaccination efforts have almost eradicated poliovirus, EV-A71 has become the most frequently associated EV to cause severe CNS infections among the non-polioviruses and has emerged as the “new polio” in Asia [

In the period between 2011 and 2012, encephalitis or encephalopathy was reported in 23 out of 2471 cases (0.93%) by EV-A71 in the Infectious Disease Survey in Japan. On the other hand, encephalitis or encephalopathy was reported in 10 out of 3202 patients (0.31%) infected with CV-A16 during the same period. Although virus detection in patients with encephalitis does not definitively indicate the causative infectious agent, this figure suggests that CV-A16 may also cause encephalitis and encephalopathy and warrants further investigation.
