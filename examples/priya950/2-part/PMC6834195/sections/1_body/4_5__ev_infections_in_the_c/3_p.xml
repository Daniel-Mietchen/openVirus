<p>Human fatalities and mice experiments involving EV-A71 infections in the CNS suggest the virus traverses the blood-brain barrier via retrograde axonal transport along cranial or peripheral nerves [

CNS involvement in HFMD cases is typically seen 1â€“5 days after infection; early symptoms include headache, lethargy, suckling weakness, irritability, limb tremors, myoclonic twitches, vomiting, and myopathy. Despite this, most cases will resolve without consequence. However, in a proportion of clinical cases, after prolonged illness (&gt;5 days) with increased blood pressure, elevated heart and respiratory rates, severe cases can develop cardiopulmonary failure. Symptoms in this stage include tachycardia, tachypnoea, cyanosis, cough with bloody sputum and hypotension. The progression of these symptoms leads to high mortality without timely diagnosis and treatment that is also only effective during the early stages of infection therefore early diagnosis and treatment is critically important [
