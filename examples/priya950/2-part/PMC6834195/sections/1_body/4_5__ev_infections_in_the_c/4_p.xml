<p>CNS inflammation by EV-A71 is found in the grey matter of the spinal cord, throughout the medulla oblongata, the dorsal nucleus and ciliary body of the vagus nerve, hypothalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus. Although less severe than these, inflammation is also seen in the motor cortex of the cerebrum. On the other hand, there are no inflammatory changes in the cerebellar cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, peripheral nerves, and autonomic ganglia. In addition, histopathological changes, similar to effects caused by other viruses, include perivascular cellular invasion, edema, neuronophagia, and microglial nodules. However, the presence of viral particles is not observed, though viral antigens and nucleic acids have been identified in a small number of neurites and phagocytes [

It remains unclear whether increased vascular permeability or cytokine storm influences the outcome. The concomitant occurrence of encephalitis and HFMD is difficult to predict; moreover, encephalitis is often unclear and prospective studies are difficult.
