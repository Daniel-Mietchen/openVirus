<p>On the other hand, drugs targeting EV-A71 have been developed, but therapeutics principally employs immunological approaches with high-dose gamma-globulin which has limitations in its practical use: (1) the use of IVIG has yet to be supported by evidence from randomized clinical trials, (2) IVIG is not without risk, due to the use of human blood products and the significant infusion volume required, and (3) it is prohibitively expensive [

The use of glucocorticoids should be considered with prudence as reports suggest limiting their usage to cases in which antiviral therapy fail to control the clinical picture [
