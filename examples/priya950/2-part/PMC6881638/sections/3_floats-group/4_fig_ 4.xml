  <p>Levels of infectious virus and viral RNA at five days after inoculation in JEV-infected mice. Mice inoculated with Mie/41/2002 (n = 6), Muar (n = 6), rJEV-5NCM
   <sup>Muar</sup>-M41 (5NCM-Muar) (n = 6), or rJEV-E
   <sup>Muar</sup>-M41 (E-Muar) (n = 6) were euthanized at five days after inoculation, and serum, brain, and spleen samples were collected. Sera and tissue homogenates were tested for quantifying the infectious virus titer (PFU/mL or g) (A–C) and the viral genome (genome copies/mL or g) (D–F). Dotted line: detection limit; solid lines: mean values. Significance was analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test (*
