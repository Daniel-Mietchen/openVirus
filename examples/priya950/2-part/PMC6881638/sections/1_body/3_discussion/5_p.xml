<p id="p0150">In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to the E region, the prM region also possesses a site responsible for the high virulence of GV JEV. There are about 10% differences in prM amino acid residues between the Mie/41/2002 and GV strains. Little is known about how the prM protein contributes to the virulence of JEV. However, recent reports suggest that prM of

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). The prM protein interacts with the E proteins to form prM–E heterodimers, which are required for the folding of the E protein and the formation of immature virions (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Konishi and Mason, 1993</xref>) (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that the replacement of the prM region might influence the assembly and maturation processes of virus particles through the E protein. Identification of the sites responsible for increased pathogenicity of the prM mutant would provide new insights into the biology and pathogenesis of JEV.
