<p id="p0135">We have previously shown that the GV strain Muar is more pathogenic in mice than the GI strain Mie/41/2002. In this study, we attempted to determine which region is involved in the difference in pathogenicity in mice between the strains. It has been known that structural proteins, especially the E protein, are mainly involved in determining the virulence of JEV (

A French group showed that the GV XZ0934 strain is more pathogenic in mice than the GIII RP-9 strain and that the structural protein region of XZ0934 is involved in its higher pathogenicity (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">de Wispelaere et al., 2015</xref>). However, in this study we did not investigate which of the three structural proteins was associated with the high virulence. Herein, analyses of the intertypic viruses proved that the E and prM regions are involved in the higher pathogenicity of GV JEV.
