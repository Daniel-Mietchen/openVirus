<p id="p0145">The virulence of the E
 <sup>S123H</sup> mutant was slightly lower than that of Muar and intertypic 5NCME and E mutants. Moreover, the virulence of E
 <sup>Muar−H123S</sup> and E
 <sup>XZ0934-H123S</sup> mutants was similar to that of E
 <sup>Muar</sup> and E
 <sup>XZ0934</sup> mutants, respectively. These data imply that the histidine residue at E123 is not sufficient to explain the high virulence of GV JEV. Thus, not only the amino acid residue at E123, but other residues unique to GV JEV (for example, E120, E122, E128, E141, and E149 in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) may also be involved in the high virulence of GV JEV, and the residues may cooperate with each other to promote the high pathogenicity of GV JEV.
