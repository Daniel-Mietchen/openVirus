<p id="p0155">In this study, we did not produce an intertypic mutant that has only the 5′-NCR region of GV JEV. There are three and four nucleotide differences in the 5′-NCR between Mie/41/2002 and Muar, and between Mie/41/2002 and XZ0934, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). A previous report indicated that a single nucleotide substitution in the 5′-NCR of JEV influences the virulence of JEV in mice (
