<p id="p0055">For the plaque formation assay, Vero cells (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were plated in 12-well plates and inoculated with the viruses for 1h at 35–37 °C. A MEM-based overlay medium containing 1% methyl cellulose and 2% fetal bovine serum was added to the wells and the cells and then incubated for 5 days at 35–37 °C. The cells were fixed using a 10% formalin-PBS solution and subsequently stained with methylene blue as described previously (
