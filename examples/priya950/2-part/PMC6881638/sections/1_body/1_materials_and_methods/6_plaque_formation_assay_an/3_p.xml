<p id="p0060">The growth of the JEV strains was analyzed as described previously (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tajima etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, cells (N18 and IMR-32) were plated in 6-well culture plates and infected with the JEV in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell. Small aliquots of the media were removed at one-day intervals, and their infectious viral titers were determined by a plaque formation assay on Vero cells as described above.
