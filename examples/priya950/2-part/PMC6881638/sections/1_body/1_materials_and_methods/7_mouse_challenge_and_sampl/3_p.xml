 <sup>5</sup> PFU (100 μL) of JEV virus solution diluted with a 0.9% NaCl solution. The mice were observed, and the body weight of mice was measured every day for 18 days after inoculation to determine the survival rates. The survival curves were compared using BellCurve for Excel (Social Survey Research Information, Tokyo, Japan) employing the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. A
