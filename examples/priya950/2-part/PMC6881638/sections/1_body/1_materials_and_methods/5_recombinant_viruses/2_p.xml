 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the regions of the infectious cDNA clone rJEV (Mie/41/2002)/pMW119 were replaced with the corresponding regions of the Muar and XZ0934 genomes (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The cDNA fragments of Muar and XZ0934 were amplified by one-step RT-PCR using PrimeScript II High Fidelity RT-PCR kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. A partial cDNA fragment of the XZ0934 strain (5′-NCR-C-prM-E regions, 2412 nucleotides, GenBank accession no.

The amplified fragments were inserted into the corresponding regions by conventional molecular cloning methods using the In-Fusion Cloning system (Takara Bio). The single missense mutations, E

 <sup>Muar</sup>-M41/pMW119, and rJEV-E
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>-M41/pMW119 strains, respectively, by inverse PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (
