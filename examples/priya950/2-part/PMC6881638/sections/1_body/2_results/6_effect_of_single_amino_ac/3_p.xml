<p id="p0125">To investigate the possibility of involvement in higher virulence of amino acid locations in the GV JEV E protein other than E123, two additional mutant viruses, E
 <sup>Muar−H123S</sup> and E
 <sup>XZ0934-H123S</sup>, were produced and inoculated into mice (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse) (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 4). No significant differences in the survival rate and time to death were observed between the E
 <sup>Muar</sup>-infected and E
 <sup>Muar−H123S</sup>-infected mice, or between the E
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>-infected and E
 <sup>XZ0934-H123S</sup>-infected mice. These results suggest that not only E123, but other sites in the GV JEV E protein, contribute to the higher pathogenicity of GV JEV in mice.
