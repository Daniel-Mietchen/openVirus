<p id="p0105">Three novel mutant viruses, 5NCME
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>, 5NCM
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>, and E
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>, which contain the 5′-NCR-C-prM-E region, 5′-NCR-C-prM region, and only the E region of the recent GV isolate XZ0934, respectively, were produced and then inoculated into mice (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 2). All the eight mice inoculated with 5NCME
 <sup>XZ0934</sup> or 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup> died, and the mean time to death of 5NCME
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>-inoculated mice was very similar to that of the 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice. Six and seven out of eight mice inoculated with 5NCM
 <sup>XZ0934</sup> and E
 <sup>XZ0934</sup>, respectively, died, and the mean times of death in the two mice groups were similar. These results imply that the 5′-NCR-C-prM-E region in XZ0934 also has the ability to increase the virulence of Mie/41/2002.
