<p id="p0090">We previously showed that the GV strain Muar is significantly more pathogenic than the GI strain Mie/41/2002 (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2015</xref>). To specify the genomic region on GV involved in its high virulence phenotype, four intertypic mutant viruses incorporating the Mie/41/2002 backbone, 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup>, NS1-3
 <sup>Muar</sup>, NS4A-5
 <sup>Muar</sup>, and NS5-3N
 <sup>Muar</sup>, were produced (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with Mie/41/2002, Muar, and the four mutant viruses (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse) and observed for 18 days (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 1). None of the mice inoculated with Mie/41/2002 died, but all the eight mice inoculated with Muar died. All the eight mice inoculated with 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup> died, and the mean time to death of 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice was equivalent to that of Muar-inoculated mice. In contrast, in the case of both the NS1-3
 <sup>Muar</sup>- and NS5-3N
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice, two out of eight mice died. Although a loss in body weight was observed in some NS4A-5
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2), these mice did not die. These results indicate that the 5′-NCR-C-prM-E region of Muar is mainly responsible for its high virulence.
