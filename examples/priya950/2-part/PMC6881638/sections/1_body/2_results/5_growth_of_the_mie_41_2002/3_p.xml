<p id="p0115">At five days post infection, no infectious virus was detected in any of the serum and spleen samples (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and C). In contrast, higher titers of infectious virus were detected in the brains of mice inoculated with Muar, 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup>, and E
 <sup>Muar</sup> compared with Mie/41/2002 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). In particular, the titers were significantly higher for Muar- and 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice. Viral RNA was detected in most of the brain and spleen samples from the mice inoculated with the JEVs, and the levels of viral RNA were higher in the Muar and mutant virus-inoculated mice than in the Mie/41/2002-inoculated mice (
