<p id="p0095">Next, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth properties of the 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup> mutant were examined. Previously, we have shown that the growth ability of Muar in mouse neuroblastoma N18 cells is significantly lower than that of Mie/41/2002 (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2015</xref>). Although the growth kinetics of 5NCME
 <sup>Muar</sup> in N18 cells were very similar to those of Mie/41/2002, these were clearly higher than those observed for Muar (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). However, in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, no significant difference was observed in the proliferation rates among the three strains (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). These results suggest that the replacement of 5′-NCR-C-prM-E region of Mie/41/2002 by that of Muar does not affect the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth characteristics of Mie/41/2002.
