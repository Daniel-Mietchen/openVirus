<p id="p0020">All live attenuated and inactivated JE vaccines that are currently available are derived from GIII strains. Previous reports showed that these JE vaccines might have a reduced ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against GV JEV than against other genotypes (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, another report revealed that IgG antibodies raised against GV JEV XZ0934 had poor neutralizing ability against GIII JEV (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">de Wispelaere et al., 2015</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that GV JEV is distinct from other JEV genotypes in antigenicity, and the current GIII-derived JE vaccines might not provide adequate levels of protection against GV JEV. The low identity in the amino acid sequences between GV and GIII JEV may be involved in the weak efficacy of the GIII-derived vaccines against GV JEV (
