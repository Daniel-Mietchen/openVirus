<p id="p0025">Understanding the characteristics of GV JEV is essential for determining the response to emerging GV JEVs. However, the characteristics of GV JEV remain to be fully elucidated, as only two GV JEV strains have been isolated to date and only limited studies have been conducted on these strains. We previously showed that GV JEV Muar has unique features in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and exhibits increased pathogenicity in mice. The growth ability of Muar in cultured mammalian cells was clearly reduced compared to that of GI JEV Mie/41/2002, and conversely, the neuroinvasiveness of Muar was significantly higher than that of Mie/41/2002 (
