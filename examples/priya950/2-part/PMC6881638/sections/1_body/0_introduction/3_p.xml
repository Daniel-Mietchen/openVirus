<p id="p0015">JEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The JEV genome encodes three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) from one open reading frame, and it also has non-coding regions (NCRs) at its 5′- and 3′-terminal ends. JEV strains are classified into five genotypes (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, and GV) on the basis of genomic RNA homology (
