<p>The role of structural proteins in determining infectivity of human cells to ZIKV infection has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Zika viruses of historical or epidemic strains display differences in their abilities to bind host cells leading to differences in cell susceptibility to infection. To further characterise biological properties of contemporary ZIKV strains, which have been associated with recent epidemics and severe forms of human disease, we investigated the role of E-152/156/158 residues of the envelope protein, residues located around a unique 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site (E-154) in viral entry into host cells. Our mutagenesis data showed that E-152/156/158 residues are responsible for the differences we observed in the infectivity of the virus and progeny production kinetics, without affecting viral attachment and host-cell responses. Further characterisations identified the E protein conformational changes in the fusion loop, supported by E-152/156/158 residues, as a major event in virus fusion and release of viral RNA into cell cytoplasm.
