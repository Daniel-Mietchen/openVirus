<p>One interesting finding from this study is that chloroquine treatment results in less BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> entries than it does for BR15. This finding suggests that E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 increase pH sensitivity of E protein. To generate BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup>, its sequence was modified so that the coding region of the E protein IVNDTGH (amino acids 152 to 158) in BR15 was replaced with TVNDIGY motif from MR766, meaning that not only 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation motif was abrogated but also that histidine E-158 was changed into a tyrosine. Histidine residues have been described as pH sensors in flavivirus membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B48-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Fusion initiation is crucially dependent on protonation of conserved histidine residues at the interface between domains EDI and EDIII of E protein, leading to dissolution of domain interactions and to fusion peptide exposure. Given the fusion differences we observed between wild-type and mutant BR15 molecular clones, further investigations on histidine E-158 protonation are required to determine its exact contribution to membrane fusion.
