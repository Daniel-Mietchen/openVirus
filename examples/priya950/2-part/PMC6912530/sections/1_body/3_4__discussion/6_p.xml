<p>Altogether, our data indicate that the envelope residues E152/156/158 of Zika virus influence early stages of virus infection in human cells. This study highlights the importance of E-152/156/158 residues in ZIKV biology and specifically in their roles in supporting viral fusion. These new findings could potentially help to design innovative strategies for future ZIKV infection control.</p>
