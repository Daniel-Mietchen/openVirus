<p>Viral particle internalisation could occur through distinct routes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis or non-classical clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. These distinct entry modes depend not only on host cells but also on viral serotype or strain [
 <xref rid="B39-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Despite these differences in the internalisation process, genome release into the cytoplasm always occurs through E protein-mediated membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B40-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The low-pH environment within endosomes triggers a series of molecular changes within flavivirus E protein resulting in fusion of viral membrane with endosomal membrane and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid into cell cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="B14-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The initial step in membrane fusion involves protonation-dependent disruption of E protein rafts at viral surface, resulting in conformational changes and formation of a fusion pore from which the nucleocapsid is released into the cytosol. Evidences suggested that the glycan loop modulates the overall Flavivirus E protein conformation and, specifically, fusion loop exposure [

 <xref rid="B42-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Sevvana and colleagues proposed that, given the close proximity of ZIKV glycan and fusion loops, any interaction of the glycan loop with a receptor on a host-cell surface might promote exposure of the fusion loop and facilitate formation of fusogenic trimers leading to membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B43-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another study based on antibody neutralizing activities demonstrated that residues surrounding ZIKV E protein glycan regulate virus antigenicity [
 <xref rid="B44-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In a previous study, we also evaluated immunogenicity of a chimeric viral clone ZIKBeHMR-2, in which the region encoding envelope proteins of MR766 African strain backbone was replaced with its counterpart from BeH819015 epidemic strain [
 <xref rid="B45-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Amino-acid substitutions I152T, T156I, and H158Y were introduced in the glycan loop of the E protein, making chimeric ZIKBeHMR-2 a nonglycosylated virus. Those results suggest that, rather than just determining the glycosylation, amino-acid residues at position 152, 156 and 158 play a pivotal role on accessibility of neutralizing antibody epitopes on mature virus particles. In this study, we demonstrated that changes in the glycan loop can modulate accessibility to the fusion loop. Although these observations were made independently of the presence of a glycan, it is conceivable that E protein 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation could provide another level of regulation on the access of the fusion loop. The role of 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation on ZIKV E protein has also been investigated using pseudoviral particles, showing that reduced infectivity was observed with mutant viral particles lacking the N-glycan [
 <xref rid="B47-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Altogether, these studies suggest that conformational changes induced at the glycan loop most probably modulate fusion loop exposure and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes, which strongly supports our observations.
