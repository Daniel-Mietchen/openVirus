<p>Finally, our analysis of virus inocula generated in Vero cells showed differences in particle-to-PFU ratios indicating that E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 E protein facilitate release of more infectious particles. In addition, we demonstrated with recombinant proteins that E-152/156/158 residues of epidemic ZIKV E protein also facilitate production of more soluble proteins. These results are supported by works of Mossenta and colleagues [

However, in a study on flavivirus cross-reactive epitopes, Crill and Chang suggested that close packing of fusion peptide against its subunit partner and glycan on the upper surface protects the fusion loop from irreversible pH-induced conformational changes during maturation and secretion [
