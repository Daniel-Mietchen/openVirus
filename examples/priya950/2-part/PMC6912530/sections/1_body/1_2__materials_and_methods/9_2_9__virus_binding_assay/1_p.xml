<p>Cells were cultured at subconfluent density in 24-well plates. Cell monolayers were washed in cold PBS and cooled at 4 °C for at least 20 min in presence of cold MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Pre-chilled cells were incubated at 4 °C with ZIKV at MOI of 1 in 1.5 mL of cold MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After 1 h of incubation, virus inputs were removed and cells were washed with cold MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RT-qPCR analysis on viral RNA was performed using primers for ZIKV E gene as described above.</p>
