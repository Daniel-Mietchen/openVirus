<p>Cell damages were evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Supernatants of infected cells were recovered and subjected to CytoTox 96
 <sup>Â®</sup> nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. Absorbance of converted dye was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). Results of LDH activity in cell supernatants are presented with subtraction of values from mock-infected cells.
