<p>ZIKV molecular clones (MR766, GenBank accession number LC002520, and BR15, GenBank accession number KU365778) were designed and produced according to the Infectious Subgenomic Amplicon method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To introduce BR15 E-152/156/158 residues into MR766 (MR766
 <sup>E-152I/156T/158H</sup>), we used mutagenesis primers (forward primer: 5′-ggctcccagcacagtgggatgatcgttaatgacacaggacatgaaactg-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-cagtttcatgtcctgtgtcattaacgatcatcccactgtgctgggagcc-3′) to generate two overlapping fragments Z1
 <sup>MR766-E-MUT1</sup> and Z1
 <sup>MR766-E-MUT2</sup> from the Z1
 <sup>MR766</sup> fragment encoding the MR766 structural proteins in which encoding region of the E protein received the IVNDTGH motif (amino acids 152 to 158) from BR15. To generate BR15
 <sup>E-152T/156I/158Y</sup>, a new Z1
 <sup>BR15-E-I152T/T156I/H158Y</sup> fragment was synthesised in which the sequence was modified so that encoding region of the E protein received the TVNDIGY motif (amino acids 152 to 158) from MR766. Synthetic genes were cloned into plasmid pUC57 by GeneCust (Boynes, France). Fragments were amplified by PCR from their respective plasmids using a set of primer pairs that was designed so that fragments overlapped with each other of about 30 to 50 nucleotides.
