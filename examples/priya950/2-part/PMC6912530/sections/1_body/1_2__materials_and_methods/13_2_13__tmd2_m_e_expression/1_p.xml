<p>To express recombinant E proteins from ZIKV in mammalian cells, TMD2-prM (TransMembrane Domain II) and E genes from MR766 and BR15, as well as a mutant BR15 bearing residues E-152 to E-158 from MR766, were synthesised by GeneCust (Boynes, France). Recombinant proteins comprised aa 275 to aa 775 of polyproteins, which correspond to the very end of prM protein (TMD2, used as signal peptide for E proteins) and the entire E protein. As Flavivirus prM protein plays a role of chaperone to ensure the proper folding of the E protein, we expected that viral chaperone activity eviction would have exacerbate differences in E protein folding [
