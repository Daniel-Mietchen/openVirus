 <xref rid="B33-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Primary antibodies were used at 1:500 dilutions. Anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase and anti-rat immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were used as secondary antibodies (dilution 1:2000). Blots were revealed with ECL detection reagents (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).
