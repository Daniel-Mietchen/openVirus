<p>Molecular clones were produced as previously described [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, purified PCR fragments were electroporated into Vero cells. After 5 days, cell supernatants were recovered usually in absence of cytopathic effect and used to infect fresh Vero cells in a first round of amplification (P1). Viral clones were recovered at the onset of cytopathic effect and amplified for another round on Vero cells to produce a second round of amplification (P2), which was used for described studies. To produce MR766
 <sup>E-152I/156T/158H</sup> and BR15
 <sup>E-152T/156I/158Y</sup> mutant viral clones, Vero cells were respectively electroporated with PCR fragments Z1
 <sup>MR766-E-MUT1</sup>, Z1
 <sup>MR766-E-MUT2</sup>, Z2
 <sup>MR766</sup>, Z3
 <sup>MR766</sup>, and Z4
 <sup>MR766</sup> and with Z1
 <sup>BR15-E-MUT</sup>, Z2
 <sup>BR15</sup>, Z3
 <sup>BR15</sup>, and Z4
 <sup>BR15</sup>. Recovered mutant viruses MR766
 <sup>E-152I/156T/158H</sup> and BR15
 <sup>E-152T/156I/158Y</sup> respectively consist of viral sequence of MR766 in which E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 ZIKV strain were introduced and viral sequence of BR15 in which E-152/156/158 residues were replaced with its counterpart from MR766 ZIKV strain.
