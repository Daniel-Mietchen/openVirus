<p>We previously showed that historical and epidemic ZIKV strains display differences in their abilities to bind host cells, leading to differences in cell susceptibility to infection (18, 19). Here, we further investigated the ability of the described mutant clones to bind onto A549-Dual™ cells. Virus binding assays were performed and analysed by RT-qPCR to determine virus particle binding onto cell surface after an incubation period of 1 h. Panels A and B show no difference between mutant clones and their respective parental clones (
