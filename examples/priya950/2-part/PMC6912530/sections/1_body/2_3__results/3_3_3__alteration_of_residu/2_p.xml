<p>Instead, these results suggest that E-152/156/158 residues might influence ZIKV progeny production. Indeed, the progeny production of MR766
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> was modestly but reproducibly increased in comparison to that of MR766 (3 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> vs. 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 72 hpi [

 <sup>E-MUT</sup> progeny production were strongly altered compared to BR15 (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> vs. 4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 72 hpi, respectively [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Differences in progeny production were observed at as early as 24 hpi. Similar differences were also seen on the percentages of the infected cell at 48 hpi. Taken together, these results indicate that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 potentiate viral infectivity, independently of the virus binding to host A549-Dual™ cells.
