<p>To determine the contribution of E-152/156/158 residues in ZIKV E protein functions, we generated two mutant molecular clones: MR766
 <sup>E-152I/156T/158H</sup>, hereafter called MR766
 <sup>E-MUT</sup>, in which E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 epidemic strain were introduced, and BR15
 <sup>E-152T/156I/158Y</sup>, hereafter called BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup>, in which E-152/156/158 residues were replaced with their counterparts from the MR766 historical African strain (

The two recovered clones were viable and twice amplified on Vero cells. Titres of P2 working viral stocks were determined in Vero cells and were ranging from 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU·mL

 <sup>E-MUT</sup> and BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> gave plaque morphologies that resembled those of respective MR766 and BR15 parental clones (

 <xref rid="B27-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, we confirmed that the introduced mutations affected the electrophoretic mobility of ZIKV E proteins, suggesting that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 E protein might enable its glycosylation (
