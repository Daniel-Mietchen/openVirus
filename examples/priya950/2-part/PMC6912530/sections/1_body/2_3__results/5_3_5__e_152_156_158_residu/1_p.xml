<p>We showed earlier that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 have a growth advantage without apparent association with cellular attachment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f002">Figure 2</xref>) or specific host-cell responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f003">Figure 3</xref>). We then studied viral fusion to test whether it could explain the observed growth advantage. Viral fusion of flaviviruses is commonly triggered from endosomes upon low-pH by a series of molecular changes within the E protein, resulting in the release of the nucleocapsid into cell cytoplasm. Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, is a weak base that inhibits endosome acidification and consequently restricts viral replication of many viruses through inhibition of pH-dependent steps. Recently, chloroquine was shown to inhibit Zika virus infection in different cellular models [

 <xref rid="B37-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As BR15 and BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> showed significant differences in the percentage of infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f002">Figure 2</xref>f), we decided to focus on these two molecular clones for the following virus fusion experiments. We treated A549-Dual™ cells infected with BR15 or BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> with 100 µM of chloroquine 1 hpi for 2 h and then cells were moved back to regular medium. Intracellular viral RNA was quantified 30 hpi by RT-qPCR. BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> fusion was significantly restricted by chloroquine treatment compared to that of BR15 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f004">Figure 4</xref>). These data suggest that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 favour viral fusion with host-cell membranes.
