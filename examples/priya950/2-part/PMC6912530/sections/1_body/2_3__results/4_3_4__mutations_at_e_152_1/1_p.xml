<p>To determine whether differences described with the mutant viruses were associated with specific host-cell responses, we first analysed virus-induced cell death at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. No difference in cytotoxicity measured by LDH release was observed between wild-type and mutant viruses (MR766 and BR15) (

We then took advantage of the properties of A549-Dual™ cells to test whether mutant viruses can trigger different host cell innate immunity. A549-Dual™ cells were derived from A549 cells by stable integration of two reporter genes: 
 <italic>SEAP</italic> gene (Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase) and 
 <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase gene under the respective transcriptional control of an IFN-β minimal promoter, which is fused to NF-κB binding sites or an ISG54 minimal promoter in conjunction with interferon-sensitive response elements. We examined possible activation of the IRF pathway by monitoring production of 
 <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase at 48 dpi and 72 hpi. Similar responses were observed in both wild-type and mutant clones (

These results indicate that differences in the mutant virus properties could not be explained by specific host-cell responses, which are consistent with our previous observations suggesting a link between host-cell responses and ZIKV nonstructural proteins [
