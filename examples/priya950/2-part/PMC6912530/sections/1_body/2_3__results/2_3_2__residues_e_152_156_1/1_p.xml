<p>We first analysed infectivity of P2 virus stocks as described above. Particle-to-PFU ratios obtained from parental clones were around 900â€“1000 (

 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We then analysed particle-to-PFU ratios of the two E mutant clones. Addition of residues E-152/156/158 from BR15 to MR766 resulted in a 2.3-fold decrease in the particle-to-PFU ratio. In contrast, when residues E-152/156/158 from MR766 were introduced to BR15, the particle-to-PFU ratio was markedly increased with more than ten-folds. These results suggest that residues E-152/156/158 from BR15 potentiate virion infectivity.
