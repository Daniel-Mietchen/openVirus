<p>Mosquito-borne Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), Yellow fever (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses belonging to flavivirus genus (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family), are four enveloped RNA viruses of significant public health concern worldwide [

 <xref rid="B4-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent ZIKV global outbreaks, with Brazil at the epicentre, highlighted how a previously neglected flavivirus can turn into a severe threat for human health. While human ZIKV infections remained only sporadic and with a limited impact for decades [

 <xref rid="B7-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], recent outbreaks revealed that ZIKV caused clusters of severe congenital and neurological abnormalities in infants and peripheral nervous system impairments in adults [

 <xref rid="B12-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Considering the dramatic increase of severe human cases, strategies to efficiently control this virus, either in terms of antiviral therapies or vaccines, are urgently needed and a granted requirement for more extensive studies.
