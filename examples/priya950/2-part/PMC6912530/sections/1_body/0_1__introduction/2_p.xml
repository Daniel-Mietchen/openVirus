<p>Flaviviruses contain a genomic single-stranded positive RNA encoding a single large polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS5). The latter are responsible for virus replication, assembly and escape from host immune system, while structural proteins form the viral particle surrounding genomic viral RNA. Among structural proteins, the E protein is responsible for viral entry into host cells. Viral E protein first binds to cellular attachment factors and receptors, leading to virion internalisation primarily through a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway [
