  <p>Analysis of infection-induced cell death and immune responses. A549-Dualâ„¢ were infected with BR15
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and parental clones at MOI of 1. In (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>), LDH activity was measured at 48 and 72 hpi respectively. Values represents mean and standard errors of two independent experiments in triplicates. In (
   <bold>c</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>), analysis of IRF pathway activation in response to viral infection. Activity of secreted 
   <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase was measured using QUANTI-Luc substrate at 48 and 72 hpi. Results are expressed as raw data of luminescence arbitrary units. Error bars represent standard errors of two independent experiments in triplicates. 
   <italic>ns</italic>: not significant.
