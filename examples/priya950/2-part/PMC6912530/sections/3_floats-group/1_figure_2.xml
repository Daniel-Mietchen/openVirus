  <p>Analysis of virus binding and viral growth in A549-Dual™. In (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>), for virus binding assays, cells were incubated with viral clones at the MOI of 1 for 1 h at 4 °C. The number of virus particles bound to cell surface was measured by RT-qPCR. Values represent means and standard errors of three independent experiments. In (
   <bold>c</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>), A549-Dual™ were infected with BR15
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> at MOI of 1. Infectious virus released into the supernatants of infected A549-Dual™ cells were quantified at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. Error bars represent standard errors of at least two independent experiments. In (
   <bold>e</bold>) and (
   <bold>f</bold>), A549-Dual™ were infected with BR15
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and parental clones at MOI of 1. Percentages of ZIKV-infected cells were determined at 48 h by flow cytometry using anti-E mAb 4G2 as primary antibody. Error bars represent standard errors of two independent experiments in duplicates.
