 <caption>
  <p>ZIKV mutant molecular clones. In (
   <bold>a</bold>), schematic representation of mutant viral clones BR15
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and their respective parental clones. In (
   <bold>b</bold>), histograms showing viral titres. Values represent means and standard errors of three independent experiments. In (
   <bold>c</bold>), examples of infectious plaques developed for BR15
   <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766
   <sup>E-MUT</sup>, and parental clones, after plaque-forming assay on Vero cells. In (
   <bold>d</bold>), Vero cells were infected with parental and mutant molecular clones (MR766 and BR15) at a MOI of 1. 24 h post-infection (hpi), cells were then lysed and subjected to an immunoblot, in non-reducing conditions. Anti-ZIKV EDIII immunoblot shows differences of electrophoretic mobility associated with residue mutations.
