  <p>Schematic illustrating the experimental workflow.</p>
  <p>Note: The temperature regime selected for each region was based on a 2Â°C increase in the day and the night temperature at peak transmission season of each geographical sample origin [D30N26 (M); D32N28 (H) and D28N24 (L)]. The eggs were vacuum hatched after warming the water to the day time temperature and the immature and adult stages were reared at the stated temperature regime.</p>
