  <p>Viral load of ZIKV in 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes at 4 and 14 days post-infection (DPI).
  </p>
  <p>Note: The plot represents the absolute viral load of ZIKV in individuals of different populations of 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes utilized in this study. The distribution of the viral titre around the mean is represented by the error bar. The crossbars in the figure are indicative of a statistically significant heterogenous viral titres measured between populations. The viral load was determined by quantitative PCR for mosquitoes held at L (D28N24), M (D30N26) and H (D32N28) temperature regimes. Statistically significant differences were determined by 1-way ANOVA test indicated by *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 and ***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001.
