 <p>Rapid and significant range expansion of both Zika virus (ZIKV) and its 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> vector species has resulted in ZIKV being declared a global health threat. Mean temperatures are projected to increase globally, likely resulting in alterations of the transmission potential of mosquito-borne pathogens. To understand the effect of diurnal temperature range on the vectorial capacity of 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for ZIKV, longevity, blood-feeding and vector competence were assessed at two temperature regimes following feeding on infectious blood meals. Higher temperatures resulted in decreased longevity of 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [Log-rank test, Ï‡2, df 35.66, 5, 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001] and a decrease in blood-feeding rates of 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [Fisher's exact test, 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001]. Temperature had a population and species-specific impact on ZIKV infection rates. Overall, 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> reared at the lowest temperature regime demonstrated the highest vectorial capacity (0.53) and the highest transmission efficiency (57%). Increased temperature decreased vectorial capacity across groups yet more significant effects were measured with 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> relative to 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The results of this study suggest that future increases in temperature in the Americas could significantly impact vector competence, blood-feeding and longevity, and potentially decrease the overall vectorial capacity of 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the Americas.
