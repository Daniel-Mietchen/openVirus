<p>Colonies were maintained at 27°C under standard rearing conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] before the eggs were hatched. F23 AEG MX, F3 AEG MI and F15 ALB LI eggs were hatched under vacuum pressure in 1 l dechlorinated water initially incubated for 3 h at the three distinct diurnal temperature regimes (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were reared and maintained at high (H) (day 32°C/ night 28°C [D32N28]) and moderate (M) (day 30°C/ night 26°C [D30N26]) temperatures; 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> at M and low (L) (day 28°C/ night 24°C [D28N24]) temperature regimes. One population of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> Long Island, ALB LI) and two populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Mexico, AEG MX and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Miami, AEG MI) were used in this study. Baseline temperature regimes (L for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and M for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) were estimates of mean day and nighttime temperatures during peak transmission in regions from which populations were derived (
