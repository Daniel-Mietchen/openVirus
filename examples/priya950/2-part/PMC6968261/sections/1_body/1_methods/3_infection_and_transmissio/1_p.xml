<p>On days 4, 7 and 14 post-infectious blood meal, mosquitoes were immobilized by exposure to triethylamine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), the legs were removed from 30 mosquitoes of each population and species, and placed in 500 µl mosquito diluent (MD; 20% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline plus 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 2 µg/ml Fungizone [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA]) containing a 4 mm bead (Daisy Rogers, Arkansas). Saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis of the female mosquitoes into a capillary tube containing ∼20 µl foetal bovine serum plus 50% sucrose 1:1 for 30 min and subsequently ejecting the mixture into 125 µl MD. Mosquito bodies were then placed in individual tubes containing 500 µl MD and a bead. All samples were held at −80°C until assayed.</p>
