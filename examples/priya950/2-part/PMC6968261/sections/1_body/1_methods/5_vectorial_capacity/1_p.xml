<p>Vectorial capacity (VC), which is a calculation of the probability that an individual mosquito in a given population will transmit a pathogen, incorporates blood-feeding behaviour and vector longevity along with vector competence. In this study, VC was calculated using the following formula [

 <italic>h</italic> = host feeding rate (proportions of mosquitoes acquiring at least two artificial blood meals in their lifetime) and 
 <italic>p</italic> = the probability of daily survival. Death of each individual was plotted in days and a linear regression analysis with a runs test was used to determine if the relationship between time and mortality is linear. The slope of the best fit line is used to calculate 
 <italic>p</italic> as follows, 
 <italic>p</italic> = (100 − [ − slope]). 
 <italic>N</italic> = the mean extrinsic incubation period (EIP), calculated here as the mean days to the transmission and 
 <italic>b</italic> = vector competence (mean proportion of exposed mosquitoes transmitting days 7–14). The host feeding rate and the longevity were evaluated in a separate study using the same populations and temperature regimes. Briefly, six populations of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes were reared at similar temperature regimes and conditions as described above. Eggs were vacuum hatched as described before [1360 eggs AEG MI (hatched and reared at the H temperature regime); 1360 eggs AEG MI (hatched and reared at the M temperature regime); 1047 eggs AEG MX (hatched and reared at the H temperature regime); 952 eggs AEG MX (hatched and reared at the M temperature regime); 750 eggs ALB LI (hatched and reared at the M temperature regime) and 721 eggs ALB LI (hatched and reared at the L temperature regime)], and the larvae reared as described above.
