<p>The virus was diluted 1:1 with defibrinated sheep blood plus 2.5% sucrose; sodium bicarbonate was included to adjust pH to 8.0. The female mosquitoes were offered the infectious blood meal through a 37°C pre-heated Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Acrington, UK) with a porcine sausage casing membrane. After an hour, the mosquitoes were anaesthetized with CO
 <sub>2</sub> and immobilized on a pre-chilled tray connected to 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Engorged females were separated and placed in three separate 0.6 l cardboard cartons (30 individuals per carton). In addition, 1 ml of each blood meal was transferred to a 1.5 ml Safe Seal microtube (Eppendorf, Hamburg Germany) and stored at −80°C to allow for the determination of ZIKV titres. The engorged females were maintained on 10% sucrose solution provided
