<p>Overall, ALB LI (L) had the highest vectorial capacity (0.53), while AEG MI (H) had the lowest (0.09). Across all populations, increasing temperatures decreased vectorial capacity (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations at the same temperature regime (M), vectorial capacity was modestly higher for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (ALB LI (M) = 0.17, AEG MI (M) = 0.26, AEG MX (M) = 0.33; 
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The decreased transmissibility at a higher temperature in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can be wholly attributed to decreased feeding frequency while decreases in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are influenced primarily by decreased longevity, but additionally by decreased feeding, decreased competence and increased EIPs (
