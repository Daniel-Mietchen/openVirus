<p>Viral loads in

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is a competent vector for ZIKV in the laboratory [

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the vector competence has been shown to be influenced by the ZIKV strain and the geographic origin of the mosquito population [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The explosive spread of ZIKV in the Americas raised concerns that another vector in addition to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> might be involved in ZIKV transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our study confirms the potential for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to play a role in ZIKV epidemics in the Americas, although they have not been demonstrated to be significantly involved to date.
