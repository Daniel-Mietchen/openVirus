<p>Higher temperatures decreased the blood-feeding rates of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in this study, although this difference was only significant for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been shown to take several blood meals in a single gonotrophic cycle [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and the frequency of their blood feeding has been noted to be positively correlated with the temperature of the environment [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, this correlation has been attributed to indirect effects of environmental temperature on the mosquito development, energy storage and rate of blood meal digestion [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A caveat in our study is that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations were reared at a higher temperature of 32°C but the high temperature for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was 30°C. While this was done to model current (and future) temperatures in locations where these populations were derived, it is not clear how further increases in temperature above 30°C would affect this population of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Previous studies demonstrate that population differences have a highly significant effect on the influence of temperature on feeding behaviour [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In spite of this, our results suggest future climate change resulting in increased temperature may lead to a reduction in vectorial capacity of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes.
