<p>This study demonstrates that increasing temperatures decreased the vectorial capacity of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes for ZIKV. Measured decreases in vectorial capacity resulted from alterations to vector competence, blood-feeding frequency and /or longevity. While the magnitude of these effects was dependent on species, population and temperature regime, an overall decrease in ZIKV transmissibility was measured with all three populations evaluated following a 2Â°C rise in diurnal temperature cycle. A larger decrease in ZIKV transmission was measured for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes when modelling warmer current and predicted future temperature regimes of the southern US and Mexico. These results support the idea that future temperature increase could result in a northern shift in the suitability of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations for transmission of ZIKV and other invasive arboviruses.
