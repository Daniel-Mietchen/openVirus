<p>Overall, increased temperature of 2°C negatively impacted the longevity of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations while 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were not affected. The higher survival capacity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> both in the field and laboratory settings could contribute to these differences. Since [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed a wider temperature tolerance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> up to 40°C, the contribution of senescence may also play a role in the difference between our findings and [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
