<p>It is expected that the global increase in temperature [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] will lead to a geographical expansion of tropical disease, particularly vector-borne pathogens, throughout temperate regions [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Higher temperatures are known to accelerate biochemical reactions, yet heightened metabolism can come at a cost. While temperature increases might increase viral replication, decrease the length of extrinsic incubation and accelerate development rates, there could also be a negative impact on vector survival and alterations in host-seeking behaviour that could decrease their capacity to transmit pathogens [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref>]. As an ectothermic organism, the physiology [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], life history [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and vectorial capacity [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>] of mosquitoes will depend significantly on changes in temperature. Successful pathogen transmission depends on mosquito susceptibility, survivability during the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), and subsequent host feeding and transmission. Hence, the impact of varying temperature on survival, feeding behaviour, vector competence and EIP differentially affects the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, the infection rates of mosquitoes with pathogens may be dependent on the interaction between temperature and mosquito genotype [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
