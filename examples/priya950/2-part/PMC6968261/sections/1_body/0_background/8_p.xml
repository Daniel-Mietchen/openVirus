<p>Our study aimed to define differences in vectorial capacity of unique populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for ZIKV held under diurnal, fluctuating temperature regimes mimicking field conditions during peak transmission in regions from which the populations were derived. Given that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted a 2–4°C mean global temperature rise over the next century due to global warming [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we then modelled a 2°C increase over these baseline temperatures and assessed population and species-specific differences in the effect of rising temperatures on vectorial capacity. Insights into the impact of future increase in temperature in the Americas on ZIKV transmission dynamics of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will improve our understanding of potential influence of climate change on the epidemiology of this disease in the region.
