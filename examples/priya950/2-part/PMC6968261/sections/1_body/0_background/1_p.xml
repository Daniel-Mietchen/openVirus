<p>Zika virus (ZIKV; 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), which prior to 2007 was geographically limited to Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>], has undergone an unprecedented range expansion in recent years and evolved into a global health threat. ZIKV was first identified in Brazil in May 2015 and subsequently spread throughout the Americas [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref>]. The explosive spread of ZIKV from Asia to the Americas and the association with disease outcomes such as microcephaly among infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome among adults necessitates the need to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus and the potential impact of temperature increases on ZIKV transmission.
