<p>Comparing mosquito strains, a study by [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reared populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> derived from different ecological and climatic conditions under a single temperature and demonstrated high infection rates but low transmission of ZIKV for all populations. While a study by [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reared 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations at a different temperature from the temperature they were held during the extrinsic incubation period. Their results indicated inconsistent differences across treatments for both infection and dissemination rates of ZIKV, yet in nature, it is unlikely that there would be a sudden abrupt change in temperature from immature development to adult blood feeding.
