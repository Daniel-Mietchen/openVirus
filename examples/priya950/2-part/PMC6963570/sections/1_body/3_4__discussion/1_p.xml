<p>This study presents an integrated analysis of field and laboratory data on measles infection and population immunity in a typical European setting characterized by suboptimal vaccination coverage and the occurrence of relatively large measles outbreaks. In this context, this study analyzed changes in vaccination coverage and population immunity, described the clinical features and the molecular epidemiology of the measles outbreaks, investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of MeV within transmission clusters and the emergence of potential escape mutants, especially in cases of secondary vaccine failure, and, finally, it evaluated if measles vaccination provided cross-protection against epidemic strains of MeV genotypes B3, D4, and D8. The results of this study from field data provide a coherent picture that supports strengthening vaccination programs for measles eradication.</p>
