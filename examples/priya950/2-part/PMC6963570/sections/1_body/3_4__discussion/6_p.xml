<p>Another factor that might contribute to the reemergence of measles in vaccinated populations could be the progressive loss of vaccine protection over time [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To address this concern, we measured MeV IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in subjects who received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and demonstrated the persistence of protective antibody titers up to 30 years following vaccination in over 90% of subjects, in agreement with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, vaccine-induced immunity might wane with time in the absence of boosting by exposure to wild-type virus circulation. Therefore, population immunity to measles should be monitored, especially in adult age groups, to assess potential declines of protection.
