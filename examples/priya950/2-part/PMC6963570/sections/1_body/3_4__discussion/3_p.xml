<p>Measles outbreaks that occurred in the Veneto Region during the last decade were caused by the same MeV genotype B3, D4, and D8 strains that were circulating in other Italian Regions and European countries. Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease, and MeV strains rapidly circulate with traveling people, causing disease globally, such as in the case of the recently emerged MeV genotype B3 strain [

To get a more detailed picture of measles transmission networks, we sequenced the full viral genome from clinical samples collected from subjects involved in different transmission clusters. A phylogenetic analysis identified transmission patterns different from those indicated by conventional epidemiological investigation, thus supporting the utility of full viral genome sequencing for the epidemiological investigation of measles outbreaks [
