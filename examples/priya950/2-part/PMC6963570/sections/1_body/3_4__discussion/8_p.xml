<p>Our study has several limitations. Seroprevalence evaluation could have been biased since it was estimated from data already available in the laboratory and did not represent homogeneously the population of the regional territory. However, it was not biased by other factors, such as refusal or non-availability to participate in an organized study [

For the cases of secondary vaccine failure, sera collected before infection were not available to test neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibodies as a surrogate of protection against epidemic MeV strains. Pre-illness sera from twice-vaccinated measles cases were tested in an outbreak study in the Netherlands [
