<p>Reduced efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity against wild type MeV strains has been hypothesized to play a role in measles reemergence [

In the case of mumps, infection in fully vaccinated individuals are not uncommon, and serum samples from vaccinated individuals have been shown to neutralize the currently circulating mumps virus genotype G less efficiently than other genotypes and the vaccine strain [

 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that this is not the case for measles. In fact, sera from subjects who received two doses of measles-containing vaccine cross-neutralized the infectivity of wild-type MeV isolates from the recent epidemics, including genotypes B3, D4, and D8, with the same high efficiency demonstrated against the MeV vaccine strain. Accordingly, sequencing results confirmed the antigenic stability of MeV hemagglutinin protein from different genotypes, which is the target of neutralizing antibodies, thus supporting the use of the current measles-containing vaccines. The risk of emergence of MeV mutants that escape vaccine-induced antibody neutralization is negligible. In fact, neutralizing antibodies that are present in sera of vaccinees or subjects with previous wild-type virus infection recognize immunodominant epitopes located in a region of the hemagglutinin protein that is subject to strong structural constraints, since it interacts with different receptors in human cells, such as SLAM, nectin-4, and CD46 [
