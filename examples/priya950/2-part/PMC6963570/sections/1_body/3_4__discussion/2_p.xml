<p>Analysis of measles vaccination coverage, population immunity from serological surveys, and the demographics of measles outbreaks during the last decade in the Veneto Region identified immunity gaps in children aged 0–4 years and in young adults aged 20–39 years and a trend towards a decrease of measles immunity among young children and subjects older than 40 years. This trend is the result of the progressive reduction of vaccine uptake observed during the last decade, added to the lower circulation of the virus. These findings are partially in agreement with the results of a recent modelling analysis, which predicted an increase of the susceptible population among individuals older than 15 years, but no relevant changes in measles susceptibility in children aged 0–4 years in Italy, because it assumed that vaccination schedules and coverage remained unchanged [

The incidence of measles was higher in males than in females, but differences were small and not consistent in different age groups and years. In the literature, severe complications of measles have been reported more frequently in males than in females [
