<p>Decreased population immunity and low vaccine uptake due to hesitancy of the population toward vaccination represent key factors for the resurgence of measles epidemics in industrialized countries. In Italy, measles vaccination is recommended since 1979, but the Veneto Region suspended mandatory vaccination since January 2008. To evaluate if the suspension led to changes in population protection against measles during the last decade, we analyzed data on measles vaccination uptake and seroprevalence. Data on measles vaccination uptake were retrieved from reports of the Ministry of Health [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while data on MeV seroprevalence were obtained by a retrospective analysis of the results of routine MeV antibody testing in employees of the University of Padova and Padova University Hospital for preventive medicine evaluation. This cohort was not representative of the whole Veneto Region because it included mainly people from Padova province. However, since vaccination coverage in Padova is within the average of the Region, the investigated cohort can be considered an acceptable approximation of the situation in the Veneto Region.
