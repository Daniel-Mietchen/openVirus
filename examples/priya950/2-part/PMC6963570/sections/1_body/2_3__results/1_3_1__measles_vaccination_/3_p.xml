<p>Analysis of measles immunity was conducted on 11,506 subjects who were screened for MeV IgG antibodies in the 2009–2012 period and on 9892 subjects tested in the 2014–2017 period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00199-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The comparison of the data from the two periods showed a trend toward a general decrease in population immunity. Population protection with seroprevalence over 95% was observed only in groups of subjects older than 40 years (period 2009–2012) and 50 years of age (period 2014–2017), mainly representing people with naturally acquired immunity. In the other age groups, measles IgG seroprevalence ranged from 74% to 89%.
