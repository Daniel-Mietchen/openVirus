<p>MeV genotypes D4 and D8 co-circulated in the Veneto Region during the 2010–2011 outbreak and accounted for 53% and 45% of sequenced MeV strains, respectively, while MeV genotypes B3 (72%) and D8 (28%) co-circulated during the 2017–2018 outbreak. Within these MeV genotypes, phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of different variants in transmission clusters, which is consistent with multiple introductions of the virus (
