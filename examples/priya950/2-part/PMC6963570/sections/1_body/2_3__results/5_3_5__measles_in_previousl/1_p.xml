<p>Eleven cases of MeV infections in previously immunized subjects occurred during the 2017–2018 outbreak, including five subjects who received two doses of measles-containing vaccine, according to the immunization records of the Veneto Region (median time since last vaccine dose, 22 years; range 9–26 years), and six subjects for whom records on vaccination were not available (

At the time of diagnosis, these measles cases had low or absent MeV IgM antibodies, high titer and high avidity of MeV IgG antibodies, and MeV RNA detectable in body fluids. In these patients, MeV RNA loads in nasopharyngeal swabs and in urine were significantly lower than in a control group of 40 unvaccinated subjects with primary measles, who were selected based on matching for age and time since the onset of symptoms (nasopharyngeal swab, mean C
