<p>To assess if these measles infections were caused by MeV strains with mutations in amino acid residues targeted by neutralizing antibodies, we sequenced the MeV 
 <italic>H</italic> gene directly from biological samples. Sequencing of the full MeV B3 
 <italic>H</italic> gene was obtained from a patient who was previously vaccinated with two vaccines doses and from four subjects with unknown vaccination status. In all these cases, no amino acid changes were identified in the H protein compared to the H protein of the MeV B3 and D8 strains responsible for primary infections (
