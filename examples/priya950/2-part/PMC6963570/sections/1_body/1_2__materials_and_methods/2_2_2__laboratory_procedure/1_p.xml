<p>Cases were confirmed by the demonstration of MeV-specific IgM antibodies in serum or by the detection of MeV RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs and urine specimens. Laboratory tests were performed at the Subnational Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella in the Veneto Region (Microbiology and Virology Unit of Padova University Hospital), which is an accredited member of the Network of Italian Reference Laboratories for Measles and Rubella (MoRoNet). MeV RNA testing was performed by in house real-time RT-PCR. MeV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and avidity of MeV IgG antibodies were tested with the Enzygnost anti-Measles IgM e IgG kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Erlangen, Germany). MeV genotypes were determined by sequencing the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminus of the N gene, according to WHO guidelines [
