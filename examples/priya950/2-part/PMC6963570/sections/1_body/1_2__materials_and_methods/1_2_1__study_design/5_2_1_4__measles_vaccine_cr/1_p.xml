<p>To investigate if antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and the wild-type MeV epidemic strains might result in reduced efficacy of measles vaccination, we compared the titers of neutralizing antibodies against the MeV Edmonston A Schwarz vaccine strain and the MeV genotype B3, D4, and D8 strains, which were isolated during the outbreaks, in the sera collected from a group of asymptomatic individuals aged 18â€“25 years, who previously received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and had MeV IgG antibody titers ranging from 0.300 to 0.700 IU/mL.</p>
