<p>In line with the WHO 2012–2020 Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Elimination Plan and the Midterm Review, which recommended research on susceptibility profiles for measles and research related to outbreaks in high-vaccine-coverage settings [

More specifically, we analyzed changes in population immunity during the last two decades in the Veneto Region, described measles outbreaks and cases of MeV infection among supposedly immunized patients, investigated MeV genetic diversity within transmission clusters, and evaluated if measles vaccination provided cross-protection against MeV epidemic strains. The Veneto Region, located in the northeastern part of the country, is one of Italy’s richest regions. The health of the Veneto Region’s resident population of 5 million inhabitants compares favorably with that of the population of other regions in Italy and within Europe [

Like other European countries, this Region is facing the problem of growing public mistrust of vaccination and a decline in vaccine uptake, which increase the risk of population exposure to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases like measles [
