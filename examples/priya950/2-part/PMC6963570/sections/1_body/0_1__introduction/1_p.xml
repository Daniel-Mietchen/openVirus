<p>Despite efforts to improve surveillance and vaccination coverage, measles virus (MeV) continues to cause outbreaks not only in low-income but also in high-income countries [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During the last two years, Europe and neighboring countries reported a dramatic increase in the number measles cases, with 25,475 and 59,578 cases reported in 2017 and 2018, respectively, by the 53 countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) European region, compared with the 5273 measles cases reported in 2016 [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among European countries, Romania, Italy, Greece, France, and the United Kingdom have been the most affected, all characterized by a vaccination coverage below the 95% target defined by WHO for measles elimination [
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The increasing distrust of vaccination among people represents an important obstacle to the success of routine vaccination programs [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Combined with a decrease of the natural immunity of the population and waning antibody titers in vaccinated people, a low vaccination coverage generates immunity gaps in specific age groups, who remain susceptible to infection and can sustain transmission during outbreaks, as recently predicted by a modelling analysis [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another factor that has been hypothesized to account for the current resurge of measles is the emergence of new viral strains characterized by increased transmissibility and escape from vaccine-induced immunity [
 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Actually, the recent and ongoing measles outbreaks have been mainly caused by two MeV genotypes, i.e., genotype D8, which has been circulating in Europe during the last decade, and a genotype B3 strain, which has been introduced in Europe more recently [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This B3 strain has higher transmissibility than other MeV genotypes [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], is highly virulent in a macaque model [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and has been shown to be neutralized less efficiently than other MeV genotypes by sera of vaccinated individuals [
