  <p>Vaccine-induced cross-neutralization of epidemic MeV strains. Cross-neutralizing antibody titers against epidemic MeV strains were measured in serum samples obtained from subject who had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Serum samples were selected according to MeV IgG titers measured by enzyme immunoassay, in order to obtain five groups, each containing six samples with homogeneous MeV IgG titers of approximately 0.300 IU/mL, 0.400 IU/mL, 0.500 IU/mL, 0.600 IU/mL, and 0.700 IU/mL, respectively. The following MeV isolates were used in microneutralization assays: MeV vaccine strain Edmonston genotype A, two MeV genotype B3 strains isolated in the Veneto Region in 2017, one MeV D4 strain isolated in 2010, one MeV D8 strain isolated in 2011, and two MeV D8 strains isolated 2017. Neutralization titers are reported as 50% neutralizing dose (ND50) values. Geometric mean values and 95% confidence intervals are indicated in red.</p>
