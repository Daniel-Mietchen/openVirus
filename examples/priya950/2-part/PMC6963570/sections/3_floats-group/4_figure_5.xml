  <p>Analysis of hemagglutinin protein epitopes in epidemic MeV strains. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin protein epitopes of the MeV epidemic strains that were used in the neutralization assays and the reference MeV Edmonston A vaccine strain (indicated as Neutralization) and of MeV sequences obtained from cases of measles in previously immunized individuals (indicated as Secondary). The amino acid sequence of the prototype Edmonston A vaccine strain is also shown. The epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies are highlighted in bold. Amino acid variants compared to the reference MeV Edmonston A vaccine strain are shown. AA: amino acid; RBE: receptor-binding epitope; BH26, BH1: epitope recognized by the BH26 neutralizing antibody; NE: neutralizing epitope; LE: loop epitope; HNE: hemagglutinating and noose epitope; SSE: sugar-shielded epitope.</p>
