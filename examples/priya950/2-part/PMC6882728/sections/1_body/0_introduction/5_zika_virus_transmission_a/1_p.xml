Though ZIKV infections might be asymptomatic, the infected patients may have fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, conjunctivitis, retro-orbital pain, fatigue, and maculopapular rashes which are similar to that of Dengue and Chikungunya, but may cure within a week [

The most dangerous effects are microcephaly, neurodevelopmental injuries of fetus, and the congenitally infected baby may show hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem, ventriculomegaly, delayed myelination, enlarged cisterna magna, abnormalities of the corpus callosum, calcifications, and cortical malformations [
