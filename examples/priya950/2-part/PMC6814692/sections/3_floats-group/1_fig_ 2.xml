  <p>Viral plaque formation and expression of NP and M2e fusions in A549 cells infected by the recombinant vaccinia viruses. A549 cells were infected by RVJ1175 (viral vector control), RVJ-NPM2e, RVJ-M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNP, and RVJ-4M2eNPs. At 48 h post infection, the infected cells were immunostained by mouse monoclonal antibodies to detect β-galactosidase (β-Gal) (upper panel), influenza NP (middle panel), and M2e (lower panel), followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
   <sup>®</sup> 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse. Microscopic images were showed with 40-fold magnification.
