  <p>Humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with 10
   <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units of recombinant vaccinia viruses at weeks 0 and 4. Group 1 (G1) mice immunized with RVJ1175 were served as negative controls. 
   <bold>A</bold> Serum was obtained from three mice at 10 days post the second immunization and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the presence of IgG antibodies specific for NP (left) or M2e (right), as described in “
   <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>”. The columns show geometric mean antibody titers, and the bars indicate the 95% confidence interval in each group (n = 3 mice per group). Comparative results between two groups are shown in the upper table (
   <italic>ns</italic> not significant, *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 by one-way ANOVA). 
   <bold>B</bold>, 
   <bold>C</bold> Cellular immune response in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses. Cytokines secreted from stimulated spleen mononuclear cells (SMNCs) were measured by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay (
   <bold>B</bold>) and mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 CBA kit (
   <bold>C</bold>). All mice in each treatment group were sacrificed at 10 days post the second immunization. SMNCs were separated from mouse spleen samples, and 5 μg/mL NP55–69 (left 
   <bold>B</bold>), NP147–155 (middle 
   <bold>B</bold>), and M2e pooled peptides (right 
   <bold>B</bold>, and 
   <bold>C</bold>) were used as stimulants in the ELISPOT and CBA assays. After stimulation for 24 h, the numbers of SMNCs producing interferon (IFN)-γ (
   <bold>B</bold>) are presented as spot-forming cells (SFCs)/10
   <sup>6</sup> SMNCs. The columns show the average SFCs/10
   <sup>6</sup> SMNCs, and the bars indicate the standard deviation of each group. Lines above two or more groups indicate that there was no significant difference. *
