 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>) and the BD CBA Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Peptides NP55–69, NP147–155, or M2e pooled peptides were used in the ELISPOT and CBA assays. The sera were separated by centrifugation, and serum IgG titers were determined.
