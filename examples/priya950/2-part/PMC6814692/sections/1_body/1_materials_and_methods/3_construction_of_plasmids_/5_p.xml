<p id="Par10">To confirm the expression of NP and M2e by the recombinant vaccinia viruses using indirect immunofluorescence, A549 cells grown in 48-well culture plates were infected with each strain of virus at 30–40 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/well. At 48 h post infection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the expression of β-Gal, NP and M2e was confirmed using mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) against β-Gal (40-1a), mouse MAb against influenza A virus M2 (14C2), and mouse MAb against influenza A virus NP (5D8). The signals were then visualized using Alexa Fluor
 <sup>®</sup> 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse.
