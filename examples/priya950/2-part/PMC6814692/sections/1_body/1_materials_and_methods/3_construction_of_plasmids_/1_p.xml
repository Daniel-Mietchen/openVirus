<p id="Par6">Plasmid pJSC1175 contains two DNA fragments (
 <italic>TKL</italic> and 
 <italic>TKR</italic>) derived from vaccinia virus Tiantan strain to facilitate homologous recombination with vaccinia virus in host cells. Between the two homology arms, there are p11 late promoter of vaccinia virus to regulate the 
 <italic>lacZ</italic> gene and p7.5 early/late promoter of vaccinia virus to regulate the target genes. The pJSC1175 was linearized at a 
 <italic>Bam</italic>H I restriction enzyme site immediately downstream the p7.5 promoter and further treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase.
