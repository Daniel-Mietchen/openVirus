<p id="Par9">Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated via homologous recombination, as described by Wang
 <italic> et al. </italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Briefly, CEFs were infected with vaccinia virus Tiantan strain at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01â€“0.1, followed by transfection with recombinant pJSC1175 plasmids containing fusion genes of 
 <italic>NP</italic> and 
 <italic>M2e</italic>. Subsequently, recombinant vaccinia viruses were screened by blue-white selection. Viral DNA was isolated from each recombinant vaccinia virus to confirm the presence of fusion genes (
 <italic>NPM2e</italic>, 
 <italic>M2eNP</italic>, 
 <italic>4M2eNP</italic>, and 
 <italic>4M2eNPs</italic>) by PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The confirmed recombinant vaccinia viruses were produced on a large scale in CEFs. The control recombinant vaccinia virus 
 <italic>RVJ1175</italic> was generated using the same method with the empty pJSC1175 vector.
