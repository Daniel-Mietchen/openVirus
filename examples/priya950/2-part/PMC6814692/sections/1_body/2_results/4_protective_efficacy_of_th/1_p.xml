<p id="Par20">We assessed the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccinia viruses in the BALB/c mouse model. Two weeks after the second immunization, BALB/c mice were challenged with 20 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of influenza A virus PR8, and then weight loss and survival rates were monitored for 3 weeks. The weight loss curve (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) showed that mice immunized with RVJ1175, RVJ-NPM2e, and RVJ-M2eNP experienced rapid weight loss, and all mice died by 9 days post-challenge. Mice immunized with RVJ-4M2eNPs also experienced rapid weight loss; several of these mice died soon after the PR8 challenge, while others experienced maximum weight loss by day 9 post-challenge followed by gradual recovery. Mice immunized with RVJ-4M2eNP experienced the lowest average weight loss (5%) among the groups observed on day 6 post-challenge, followed by rapid recovery to the initial body weight at day 9 post-challenge. The survival rate results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) showed that mice immunized with RVJ1175, RVJ-NPM2e, and RVJ-M2eNP died on days 7–8, 7–9, and 7–10, respectively, post-challenge. In contrast, 1/12 mice in the RVJ-4M2eNP died on day 10 post-challenge, showing a final survival rate of 93%. Mice immunized with RVJ-4M2eNPs died on days 7–11 post-challenge with a final survival rate of 30%. Statistical analysis showed that mice immunized with RVJ-4M2eNP had significantly highest survival rate, and mice immunized with RVJ-4M2eNPs also had significantly higher survival rate than the remaining three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).
