<p id="Par18">ELISPOT analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) revealed that RVJ-NPM2e, RVJ-M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNP, and RVJ-4M2eNPs induced more NP147–155-specific spot-forming cells (SFCs) than NP55–69-specific SFCs. RVJ-M2eNP induced significantly more NP147–155-specific SFCs than RVJ-NPM2e (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and RVJ-4M2eNPs (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). RVJ-4M2eNP also induced significantly more NP147–155-specific SFCs than control virus, nevertheless there is no significant difference compared with RVJ-M2eNP. Except the control virus, all other recombinant vaccinia virus seemed to induce M2e-specific cellular immune responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). However, only M2e-specific SFCs induced by RVJ-M2eNP are significantly more than those induced by control virus (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and by RVJ-NPM2e (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
