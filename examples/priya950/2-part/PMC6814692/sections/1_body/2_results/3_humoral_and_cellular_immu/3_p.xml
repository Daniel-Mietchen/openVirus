<p id="Par19">Cytokine measurements (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) showed that M2e pooled peptides stimulated SMNCs to secrete several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor. However, only immunization with RVJ-4M2eNP induced significantly higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines than that with control (RVJ1175) when stimulation with the M2e pooled peptides.
