<p id="Par16">A549 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses, and expression of the target proteins (NP and M2e) was identified by immunofluorescence. As a selective marker, β-galactosidase (β-Gal) was expressed at similar levels in A549 cells infected by all recombinant vaccinia viruses. Except the control virus RVJ1175, all other recombinant vaccinia virus expressed M2e and NP in the infected cells. It seemed that RVJ-4M2eNPs showed lower expression of truncated NP than other recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length
