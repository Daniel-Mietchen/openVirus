<p id="Par15">To generate fusion antigens with the highest potency for inducing cross-protection, we designed a variety of fusion antigen configurations by adjusting the fusion order of NP and M2e, increasing the copy number of M2e (4M2e), and truncating the length of NPs. The 
 <italic>NP</italic> and 
 <italic>M2e</italic> gene fragments of influenza A virus A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2) were joined to create 
 <italic>NPM2e</italic>, 
 <italic>M2eNP</italic>, 
 <italic>4M2eNP</italic>, and 
 <italic>4M2eNPs</italic> using PCR (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each amplified fusion gene fragment was cloned into plasmid pJSC1175 under the regulation of p7.5 early/late promoter. The resulting plasmids pJSC1175-NPM2e, pJSC1175-M2eNP, pJSC1175-4M2eNP, and pJSC1175-4M2eNPs were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (data not shown). Each confirmed plasmid was transfected into CEFs infected by vaccinia virus Tiantan strain to facilitate homologous DNA recombination between plasmid and viral genomic DNA. Recombinant vaccinia viruses RVJ-NPM2e, RVJ-M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNP, and RVJ-4M2eNPs were screened by blue-white selection. The vaccinia virus DNA was extracted to amplify the target gene fragments using PCR. The inserted target genes were confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products.
