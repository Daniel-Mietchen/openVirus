<p id="Par25">In summary, immunization with a 4 × M2e and NP fusion antigen not only induced NP-specific humoral and cellular immune response, but also increased M2e-specific immunity, which together led to superior cross-protection against heterosubtypic PR8 at 20 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>. We concluded that the cross- protection potential correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP. However, the recombinant RVJ-4M2eNP containing 4 × M2e and full-length NP could not induce significant neutralizing antibodies, which help to reduce the severity and duration of the illness. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce conserved B-cell epitopes of HA to induce an enhanced cross-neutralizing response and protective potency (Koday
