 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>). In the present study, a truncated NP protein lacking 50 amino acids at the N terminal and ~ 70 amino acids at the C terminal was designated as NPs. Although NPs retaining the middle part of NP with multiple conserved epitopes, it showed weaker immunogenicity compared with full-length NP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, RVJ-4M2eNP, RVJ-4M2eNPs), and less protection in this experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, RVJ-4M2eNP 
 <italic>vs</italic> RVJ-4M2eNPs, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.01), probably because of less NP expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, middle panel), suggesting that full-length NP is critical toward inducing protective immunity at least in BALB/c mouse. Previous research proved that human MAb against influenza NP played an important role in fighting low-dose infection of influenza virus (Fujimoto
 <italic> et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>), and NP might exert a protective effect through ADCC (Kui

 <italic> et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). Moreover, NP contains numerous conserved CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes (MacLeod

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Roti
 <italic> et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>), which induce cross-T-cell immune and cross-protective responses (Hayward
 <italic> et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). The present study showed that NP-specific antibody and cellular response played important roles in protection. NP-specific antibody could not neutralize influenza virus just as M2e. However, it may protect animals against challenge by ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or antibody-dependent complement deposition, and NP cellular immune response may stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for protection (Guo

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; LaMere
 <italic> et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>); the related mechanism is worthy of further investigation.
