<p id="Par3">The vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) was developed in China as a vaccination agent against smallpox, as documented by WHO (Fenner

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1988</xref>). This strain was used to inoculate several individuals for ~50Â years, playing a key role in the eradication of smallpox in China (Ruan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). The Tiantan strain has favorable gene vector and vaccine characteristics, including a powerful multiplication capacity, wide host range, high capacity for insertion of a foreign gene, noncarcinogenicity, and induction of long-lasting immunity. Using the 
 <italic>TK</italic> gene system of the Tiantan strain, this vaccinia virus has been developed successfully as a viral vector for various vaccine applications (Ruan

 <italic> et al. </italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>). We have developed recombinant vaccinia viruses based on NP, M1, M2, and PB1 of influenza A virus (Huang

 <italic> et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Several of our NP-based recombinant vaccinia viruses have induced a protective immune response in BALB/c mice. To develop a vaccine with broader protection, we constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various combinations of NP and M2e to exhibit their maximal antigenicity. BALB/c mice were immunized with the recombinant viruses to measure NP- and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses as well as protective effect against lethal challenge with a heterologous influenza virus.
