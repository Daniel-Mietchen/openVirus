<p id="Par2">Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease that can cause serious health problems. Seasonal influenza epidemics caused by influenza A and B viruses result in 3–5 million severe cases and 290,000–650,000 deaths worldwide; 5%–10% of adults and 20%–30% of children suffer from flu annually (World Health Organization, WHO

Seasonal influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift, which makes the conventional seasonal vaccines ineffective when the vaccine strains mismatch with the epidemic strains. Therefore, seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated regularly for effective prevention of influenza. The production time for conventional influenza vaccines can be lengthy. It takes 1–2 months to obtain vaccine strains using conventional reassortment technology or reverse genetics technology, followed by several more months for large-scale expansion of influenza vaccine using an ample supply of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. Generally, influenza vaccine production takes 3–6 months from the prediction of the epidemic strain to the ultimate production of the vaccine (Emanuel and Wertheimer

The highly conserved internal protein nucleoprotein (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) can induce cross-protection against influenza A virus, showing promise as candidate antigens for the development of a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine (Erbelding

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). Previously, we expressed a fusion protein of NP and M2e (NM2e) in

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). Therefore, vaccination with recombinant NM2e fusion protein is a promising strategy for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. However, a new expression system is required to further optimize the NP- and M2e-based vaccine.
