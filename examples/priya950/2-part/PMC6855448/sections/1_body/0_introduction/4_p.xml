<p>DENV infections are simply classified as imported and autochthonous cases according to patients' recent travel records. Dengue epidemics refer to continued widespread outbreaks of dengue fever in areas where DENV affects a large population and is transmitted between people by the mosquitoes 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. To date, there are no other DENV foci in mainland China, except for the reported natural focus in Yunnan Province [

 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, DENV strains were isolated from blood samples drawn from DENV-infected patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018. We described the epidemiological characteristics of isolated DENV based on phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis using a dataset comprised of DENV sequences downloaded from the GenBank database and those obtained from genome sequencing.
