<p>The five sample clusters were compared with the genetic distances of the same genotype in clusters in 2014â€“2018. It can be seen from the table that the sequence of the DENV-2 two-cluster sample collected in this study differs greatly from the sequence of the same genotype. The sequence differences between other sample clusters and the same genotype are small. The data is presented in
