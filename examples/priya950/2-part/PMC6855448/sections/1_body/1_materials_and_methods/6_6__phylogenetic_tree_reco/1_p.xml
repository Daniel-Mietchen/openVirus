<p>In search of more information about the samples, we set up a global dataset that involved all samples and the DENV-1 and DENV-2 sequences available from the GenBank, except those being removed from the database as redundant sequences. Furthermore, ML trees were constructed with best-fit models in RAxML v8.0.9 [
