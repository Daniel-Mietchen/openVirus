<p>In the dataset, the new isolates and the sequences of DENV-1 and DENV-2 available from the GenBank database were aligned and adjusted using MAFFT v7.308 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Aliview to remove those without a sampling date or geographic location (The length of the E gene sequence is 1485). Recombination Detection Program (RDP v4.36) was employed in recombination analysis with a wide range of recombination detection methods, including RDP, Chi-maera, BootScan, 3Seq, GENECONV, MaxChi, and SiScan [
