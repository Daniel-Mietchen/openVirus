<p>According to the ML trees obtained from the global dataset, the newly isolated sample sequences in the DENV-1 and DENV-2 datasets were divided into different clusters (with the classification of clusters based on bootstrap values and the number of 70% as a cut-off for a "reliable" branch). A sample sequence was selected from each cluster for nucleotide BLAST on the NCBI web server, and 100 DENV sequences were downloaded from each BLAST run. On this basis, the sample sequence of Cluster III was set to match 1000 sequences to gather more biological information. The downloaded sequences and the samples were combined together and divided into four datasets for comparison on the MAFFT web server. Phylogenetic signals of these datasets were detected as described above.</p>
