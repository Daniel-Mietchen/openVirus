<p>The spatial diffusion of the time-scaled genealogy was modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process with the program BEAST v1.8.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The diffusion process along the phylogenies of the datasets for BLAST was estimated using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure. The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (ULRC) method was adopted to produce phylogenetic estimates. In addition, we chose a Bayesian skyline coalescent model to review the demographic history and ran the Bayesian MCMC chain for a bulk number of iterations to ensure process convergence. The BEAGLE package was used to speed up the calculation process [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The effective sample size (ESS) was calculated using TRACER [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with all parameters showing ESS values &gt; 200 after burn-in in the initial 10% iterations. The MCC tree was summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.8.2 at the burn-in rate of 10% and was visualized with FigTree v1.4. SPREAD v1.0.6 is used to generate the propagation path map. Import the files generated by the BEAST software into the SPREAD software, set the latitude and longitude of the location, and set the BF value to 3, and then generate the corresponding path map.
