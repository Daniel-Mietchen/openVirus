<p>Dengue virus was isolated from 55 positive blood samples. To increase virus titer, each patient's serum was inoculated into an Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line cultured in MEM with 10% FBS (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and diluted 1:40 in fresh MEM. Next, the medium was added to C6/36 cells and incubated at 30°C for 2 h. Then, the residual inoculum was replaced with fresh MEM containing 2% FBS; the cells were maintained at 30°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 to 7 days (until significant cytopathic effects (CPE) occurred). Simultaneously, the supernatants were collected for RNA extraction after centrifugation at 4000 rpm. These samples were stored at -80°C until needed.
