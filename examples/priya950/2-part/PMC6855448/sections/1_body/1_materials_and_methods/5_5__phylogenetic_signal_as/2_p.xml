<p>Models of nucleotide substitution allow for the calculation of probabilities of change between nucleotides along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. On this basis, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select a best-fit model and created a maximum-likelihood tree (ML tree) with the model. Additionally, a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was generated using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection. The best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were estimated with JModeltest v2.1.7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Subsequently, the IQ-TREE [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was employed to determine the best-fit models since a massive quantity of sequences were deposited in a global dataset, which was beyond the capacity of JModeltest.
