<p>Interestingly, the results from the traceability analysis showed that the most recent common ancestor of the sequences of cluster II emerged from Guangzhou, and Cluster II and the Guangzhou 2017 isolate are in the same branch without any other foreign sequences. Moreover, they shared a common ancestral lineage to the Malaysian 2014 isolate, the Singaporean 2014 isolate, and the Zhongshan 2015 isolate in other branches. Phylogeographically, there are two possible propagation paths. First, the virus originated in Singapore and became an epidemic in the country before 2014; during the next year, it was imported into Zhongshan, and then in 2017, the disease flowed into Guangzhou from other cities in Guangdong Province; the Guangzhou 2018 isolates came from the virus imported into the city during 2017 as a result of local transmission. Second, the virus emerged from Singapore and was not introduced into Zhongshan until 2015; during 2017 and 2018, the virus was continuously imported into Guangzhou from Singapore or other countries and regions; the sample sequences were not clustered into a branch with the isolates from other countries because no related sequences were available in GenBank or the database had no sufficient patient isolates. Regarding the sources of spread or propagation, some DENV strains were imported from endemic countries and regions and caused dengue fever without further propagation in China; some evolved from imported strains and led to local epidemics during the year; others were localized strains after vertical transmission. Although no substantial evidence was found in this study to prove vertical transmission of DENV in Guangzhou, previous phylogenetic analyses indicated possible local transmission of dengue fever in the city.</p>
