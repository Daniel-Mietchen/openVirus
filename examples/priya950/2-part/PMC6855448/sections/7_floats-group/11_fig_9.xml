  <title>Maximum clade credibility tree of the sequence of cluster V.</title>
  <p>A| A root-to-tip analysis was performed in TempEst v1.5. An ML tree was built using the sample dataset to determine the R2 value; R2 &gt; 0 indicates a positive correlation between the dataset and the molecular clock. B| Sequences from different geographic regions are represented by different colors. The location on the branch is the most recent ancestor position, and the value is the posterior probability. The purple branch indicates that Malaysia is the most recent ancestor of the sequences; the green branch corresponds to India; the blue branch corresponds to Taiwan province; and the red branch corresponds to Guangzhou. The dotted line box represents the sample sequence obtained in this experiment.</p>
