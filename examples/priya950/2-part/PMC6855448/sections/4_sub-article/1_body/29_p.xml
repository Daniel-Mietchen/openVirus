<p>Answer: The five serotypes have not been widely accepted and are only mentioned in a few articles, so we changed it to four serotypes.

Differences in the Transmission of Dengue Fever by Different Serotypes of Dengue Virus. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2019. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2019.2477. PubMed PMID: 31503521.” The changed part is in the 63-64 lines of the manuscript.</p>
