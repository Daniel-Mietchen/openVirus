<p>Answer: This is a very good suggestion. In order to let readers know more about the dengue virus that was popular in Guangzhou in 2018, we used MEGA to analyze their genetic distance. First, we differentiated the DENV-1 and DENV-2 data sets based on genotypes. In order to avoid the influence of the old virus on the calculation of genetic distance, we only extracted the sequence of Guangdong Province for the past five years for the genotype of the sample sequence. Experimental methods and results are provided in the manuscript. The changed part is in the 185-189 lines and 316-319 lines of the manuscript.</p>
