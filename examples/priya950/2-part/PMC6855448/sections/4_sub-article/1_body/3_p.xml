<p>Answer: We calculated the genetic distance between the sample cluster and the non-sample cluster sequences of Guangdong Province in 2014-2018 and defined them to be compared under the same genotype. The results show that their genetic distance differences are not very significant. The dengue virus has been imported into Guangzhou for a long time, and the genetic distance difference between the sample clusters is not obvious. The dengue virus that is popular in Guangzhou is still based on input. </p>
