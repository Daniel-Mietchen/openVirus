<p>Answer: Uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (ULRC) is a molecular clock model used by BEAST software to calculate phylogenetic trees. In the study, we examined the molecular clock for the data set. The structure shows that the data set does not exhibit a strict molecular clock shape, so we chose this model.</p>
