<p>The authors have carried out RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of E genes of 34 DENV strains isolated from DF patients at Guangzhou in 2018. Overall, the observation that DENV isolates in Guangzhou were mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries did not bring new insights to the field. The evidence of possible local DENV transmission in Guangzhou over the years was weak. Moreover, there several places in the introduction, methods and results need to be clarified. Several references were inappropriate or irrelevant. See specific comments. There should be addressed to improve this manuscript.</p>
