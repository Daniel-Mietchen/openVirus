<p>Herein we presented the first detection of a naturally HEV infected small rodent, a yellow-necked mouse, and a report of HEV-3 occurrence and prevalence (0.21%) in wild small rodents from 11 localities in continental mountainous and lowland Croatia. Detected prevalence in Croatian wild small rodents is lower than the prevalence in 
 <italic>Rattu</italic>s spp. rats from the United States (7.85%)[
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and than the prevalence in 
 <italic>Rattu</italic>s 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> from Germany (6.67%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The yellow-necked mice can have a role in HEV-3 maintenance and epidemiology, therefore small rodents should be further investigated. Since the derived strain showed to be genetically highly related to strains found in humans and wild and domestic animals from Croatia it indicates that mice can be a link in the viral transmission to other susceptible species, including humans.
