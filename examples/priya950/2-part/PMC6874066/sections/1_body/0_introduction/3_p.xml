<p>A high prevalence of seropositive rodents in the USA and Asia[

 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] provides strong evidence that rodents could be potential reservoirs of HEV [

 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, studies conducted on rodents, other than rats, are lacking, so the evaluation of rodents as competent reservoirs of HEV-3 still remains uncertain even though HEV-1 and HEV-3 have experimentally been derived from human liver chimeric mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, a successful infection of 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> mouse liver cell culture with HEV-3, supports the hypothesis that rodents may be competent hosts [
