<p>PCR product was purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega, USA) and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Amsterdam, Netherlands). The sequence of 242 base pairs was submitted to GenBank (accession no. MK456392). Phylogenetic grouping and clustering were based on comparison with sequences retrieved from the GenBank, using algorithm BLAST (
