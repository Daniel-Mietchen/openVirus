<p>This study showed that some species of small mammals should be further investigated to evaluate their role as an epidemiological ‘link’ within the wildlife/domestic animal cycle and even a potential public health risk and reservoir of HEV-3 since the strain has been found to be genetically identical to previously detected strains derived from humans, wild boars, and swine. To confirm the true role of rodents as reservoirs or vectors of HEV-3, prolonged surveillance of HEV-3 in rodents and small mammals in Croatia and elsewhere is needed. However, our finding of the first naturally infected small rodent definitely opens a new window within the epidemiology and environmental sustainability of HEV.</p>
