<p>Rodents and small mammals are hosts and vectors of a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Rodent-borne agents can be transmitted to humans directly, mostly through rodent bites and indirectly by contact with their contaminated excretions or by arthropod vectors including ticks, fleas, and mites. Few studies showed simultaneous multiple infections in rodents and small mammals in Croatia and Austria [

 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Seroprevalence studies done in the United States and Asia in the 1990s identified many rat species positive for HEV antibodies [

 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but the role of wild rodents and small mammals as reservoirs in HEV epidemiology is still unclear [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Whether HEV-3 can be added to the rodent-borne pathogens list awaits further research. Low genetic diversity of HEV-positive samples detected across the United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], suggest that only a limited number of HEV genotype 3 strains may be capable of infecting 
 <italic>Rattus</italic> spp. rats and other rodents (i.e., 
 <italic>Mus</italic> spp.). Since there are no published reports of investigation for the presence of HEV-3 in rodents and small mammals in natural conditions in general, this report brings new knowledge on the HEV-3 host range and its zoonotic potential.
