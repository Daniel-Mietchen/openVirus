<p>The detection of hepatitis E infections is arising in Croatia, with the occasional appearance of sporadic infections in humans. A high prevalence of HEV RNA and anti-HEV antibodies in swine and wild boars has also been observed. Therefore the detection of a naturally infected forest mouse as a competent host of a HEV-3 genotype that has been previously derived from humans, swine and wild boars may present an epidemiological interspecies ‘‘link” between wildlife and domestic swine and have an important role in obtaining the virus in the environment.</p>
