<p>Viral RNA was detected in only one liver sample (0.21%, 1/483) derived from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>flavicollis</italic> (yellow-necked mouse) from Medvednica mountain (Zagreb County). The mouse was captured in 2014, near a mountain cottage, a favourite hiking site. Ct-value of the positive rodent liver sample was 31. Other tissues and organs of the positive animal were negative for HEV. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial 242ntORF1 obtained sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225583.g002">Fig 2</xref>) showed that the HEV sequence derived from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>flavicollis</italic> grouped into genotype 3 of 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> A species, subtype 3a (clade 3abchij) defined by Smith et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The obtained sequence from Medvednica is strongly genetically related to other Croatian sequences, as those derived from humans in 2012 (KT583123, Zagreb county, 98.38%), 2014 (KY910801, Zagreb county, 86.58%; KY910803, Zagreb county, 90.65%) and 2017 (KY910802, Dubrovnik-Neretva county, 98.78%), wild boar from 2016 (KY910824,Vukovar-Srijem county, 98.78%) and a domestic swine from 2013 (KT583117, MeÄ‘imurje County, 92.27%). The predominant strains in Croatia belong to subtypes 3a and 3c and thus, can be considered endemic [
