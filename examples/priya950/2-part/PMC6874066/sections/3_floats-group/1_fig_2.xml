  <title>Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree obtained by the analysis of the partial 242nt sequence of the ORF1 region of HEV-3 isolate derived from yellow-necked mouse sample from Croatia (MK456392).</title>
  <p>Genetic distances were calculated using the Kimura two-parameter method. Bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates are presented next to the tree nodes. The bar represents 0.05 nucleotide substitutions per site.</p>
