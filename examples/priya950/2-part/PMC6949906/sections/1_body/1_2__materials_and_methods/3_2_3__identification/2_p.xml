<p>Only insects of medical importance of the Diptera order, belonging to Culicidae, Ceratopogonidae, and Psychodidae families, were considered for identification. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> males and females were used in virological analyses. Females from other species were identified and quantified only for fauna characterization inside the residences. Female mosquitoes were segmented into head and body (which included thorax, abdomen, and annexes [wings and legs]) with the aid of individual tweezers and a stylet to avoid cross contamination for analysis of viral spread inside the mosquito. Males were analyzed entirely for the verification of transovarian viral transmission. After counting, mosquitoes with separated head and body were grouped in 2 mL microtubes in pools of up to 30 specimens, by species, sex, collection location and date, and whether they were engorged or not. This separation was used to determine if the infection was disseminated or whether it was from the blood retained in the intestine of the engorged mosquito. The pools were identified with an exclusive registration adopted in the SAARB/IEC, which is composed of the initials AR (of arthropod), followed by a sequel number.
