<p>Overall, this study contributes important information about the circulation of arboviruses of medical importance in the interior of the Maranh√£o, a transition area between the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, besides monitoring the dispersal of mosquito vectors occurring in urban areas. In that scenario, entomovirological surveillance is a useful tool for arboviral control programs, and may be effective to predict epidemics, confirm viral circulation, and provide information on the vectors involved in the transmission cycles, important for understanding the disease transmission dynamics.</p>
