<p>Swine have both sialic acid (SA) receptors (SA α-2,3-galactose and SA α-2,6-galactose) present in the respiratory tract; thus, swine are susceptible to infection with both human and avian influenza virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, the human respiratory tract mainly contains the SA α-2,6-galactose receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Several studies have reported that human-origin H10N8 influenza viruses shows a strong preference for the avian receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>], indicating that the current human-origin H10N8 isolates are poorly adapted for human-to-human transmission. However, the human-origin H10N8 strain was inefficiently transmitted between swine through direct contact in this study. Notably, whether H10N8 acquires adaptive mutations and if the receptor binding properties are altered during virus evolution remains unclear; thus, continuous epidemiological monitoring of H10N8 influenza virus in different animal species (such as avian and swine) should be further conducted.
