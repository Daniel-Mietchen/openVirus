<p>In summary, we detected a specific antibody for H10N8 influenza virus in swine herds in southern China for the first time, and further confirmed that human-origin H10N8 strain could infect swine, causing clinical signs, virus shedding, and seroconversion. More importantly, human isolates could be transmitted between swine inefficiently through direct contact. This study provides a new perspective regarding the ecology of H10N8 influenza virus and highlights the importance of epidemiological monitoring of influenza viruses in different animal species, which will be helpful for implementing prevention and control measures.</p>
