<p>Rapid mutation and continuous reassortment are important features of influenza virus, which accelerate adaptation and interspecies transmission in new hosts. Numerous zoonotic influenza viruses that cause human infection have been documented in recent years, such as high-pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infections in Hong Kong in 1997 [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], H1N1/2009 as a worldwide pandemic in 2009 [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], H7N9 avian influenza infection in China since 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and novel reassorted H5N6 avian influenza virus infection in humans in 2014 [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In December 2013, human infection with H10N8 avian influenza virus was first reported in China, which resulted in three deaths [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and H10N8 influenza virus infection of human origin from LPMs was subsequently confirmed by several research groups [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During serological monitoring of influenza virus in swine herds in 2016â€“2017 in southern China, we detected a specific antibody for H10N8 influenza virus for the first time and confirmed the result by MN assay. Serological analysis indicated that H10N8 influenza virus infection occurs in swine herds in nature. Su et al. also reported H10N8 influenza virus infections in feral dogs in LPMs before the first H10N8 infection cases were recognized [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that other mammals (such as swine and dog) are potential hosts of H10N8 influenza viruses. However, it is important to identify the origin of the H10N8 virus that caused seropositivity in these pigs. Based on previous studies on H10N8 strains, the most likely source of the virus is an avian species. Firstly, human infection with H10N8 has been confirmed to have originated in poultry from LPMs [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with patients having visited LPMs and being exposed to the poultry a few days before the onset of illness. On the other hand, animal workers occupationally exposed to poultry may be at high risk of H10N8 infection, and antibodies against H10N8 virus among animal workers have been documented before the first human H10N8 case recognized [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, there have been reports that H10N8 was circulating among poultry in southern China at the time of the prior studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which provide a possible source of the swine infections. However, based on present study, avian-origin H10N8 virus can only ineffectively infect swine. It is unknown whether these viruses have undergone adaptative mutations during the infection process as has been seen in human infections.
