<p>Both the HI and MN assays were performed according to standard protocols provided by the World Health Organization. For the serological survey, all serum samples were treated with sialic acid receptor-destroying enzyme to remove nonspecific inhibition factors, and then tested by HI assay against strain JX346 using fresh chicken red blood cells. Samples with HI titers ≥ 1:40 were further evaluated by MN assay against JX346. In addition, HI and MN assays against GD-E1 were also performed for the serum samples that positive to JX346. The positive samples were also subjected to HI and MN assays against H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza viruses. In this serological study, serum samples with HI titers &lt; 1:40 were considered to be negative, while samples with HI titers ≥ 1:40 were considered as being infected by H10N8 virus; only samples with both HI and MN titers ≥ 1:40 were considered as having previously been infected with H10N8 virus.</p>
