<p>Human-origin H10N8 influenza virus strain A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346-1/2013 (JX346) and duck-origin strain A/duck/Guangdong/E1/2012 (GD-E1) were kindly provided by Professor Ming Liao and Professor Wenbao Qi, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University. Swine influenza virus A/swine/Guangdong/SS1/2012 (H1N1 Eurasian avian-like lineage) and A/swine/Guangdong/L22/2010 (H3N2) were isolated and preserved in our lab. Viruses were propagated in 9- to 11-day-old specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and stored at −80°C until use. A total of 2050 serum samples were collected from swine farms that were non-immunized for swine influenza virus from July 2016 to June 2017 in southern China.</p>
