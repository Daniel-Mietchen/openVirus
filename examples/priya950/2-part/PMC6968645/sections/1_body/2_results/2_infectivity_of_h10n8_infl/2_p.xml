<p>Sera were collected at 7 and 14 dpi to evaluate for antibody specific to H10N8 by HI and MN assay. All four pigs (one necropsied at 3 dpi) inoculated with JX346 in group A were seroconverted at 7 dpi, with the highest HI and MN titer reaching 1:320 and 1:1280, respectively, at 14 dpi (

Although pigs inoculated with GD-E1 in group B did not shed virus and showed no virus proliferation in the lung and trachea, two of the four pigs (one necropsied at 3 dpi) inoculated with GD-E1 in group B showed seroconversion at 7 dpi and one pig also seroconverted at 14 dpi (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The HI titer was obviously lower than that of group A at 14 dpi, MN titer also was detected at a range from 1:80 to 1:320 in group B (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Seroconversion was not observed in the control group. These results showed that swine can be infected with JX346, causing clinical signs, virus shedding, and seroconversion, with virus replication occurring in the lung and trachea tissues. In contrast, GD-E1 could not effectively infect swine and only induced seroconversion with low antibody levels. Thus, epidemiological monitoring of H10N8 influenza virus in swine herds should be further conducted to determine whether interspecies transmission of H10N8 influenza viruses has occurred in swine herds.
