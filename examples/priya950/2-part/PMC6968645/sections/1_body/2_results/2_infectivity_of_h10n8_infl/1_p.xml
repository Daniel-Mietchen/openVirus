<p>To investigate whether H10N8 influenza virus can infect swine, two groups of pigs were intratracheally and intranasally inoculated with JX346 or GD-E1 at a titer of 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, respectively. All five pigs in group A infected with JX346 developed a fever at 2 days post-infection (dpi), which persisted for 2–3 days, and 2 of the 5 pigs developed clinical signs of infection (running nose). No pigs in group B infected with GD-E1 or control pigs in group C exhibited fever or any other clinical signs. Virus shedding was detected from the nasal swabs of pigs inoculated with JX346, which started as early as 1–3 dpi and lasted for 2–6 days, mostly peaking at 3–4 dpi (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A)). The highest titer of virus shedding from nasal swabs was 10
 <sup>4.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL in group A. However, no virus shedding from nasal swabs was detected in pigs inoculated with GD-E1 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(C)). The viral titers of the lung and tracheal tissues collected from A5 and B4 at 3 dpi were determined; lung and tracheal tissues from A5 in the JX346 group showed titers of 10
 <sup>4.75</sup> and 10
 <sup>2.8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, respectively. However, no viral titers were detected in the lung and tracheal tissues from B4 in the GD-E1 group.
