<p>To investigate whether H10N8 influenza virus can be transmitted between swine through physical contact, three pigs were commingled with infected pigs at 2â€…dpi in the JX346 and GD-E1 groups. No virus shedding was detected from the pigs in either group (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B,D)), and no seroconversion was observed from contacted pigs in the GD-E1 group at 7 and 14 days post-contact (dpc) (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, one contacted pig in the JX346 group was seroconverted at 14 dpc with an HI and MN titer of 1:40 and 1:80, respectively (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that this pig had contracted an H10N8 infection and further indicating that JX346 has the potential to be transmitted between pigs, though the efficiency is limited. These results show that avian-origin H10N8 virus cannot be transmitted between swine, while human-origin H10N8 virus could be transmitted between swine inefficiently by direct contact.
