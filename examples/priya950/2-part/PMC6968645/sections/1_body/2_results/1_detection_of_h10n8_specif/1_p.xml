<p>In the serological survey, a total of 2050 serum samples collected from swine farms in southern China were tested by HI assay against H10N8 strain JX346. A total of eight (8/2050) serum samples collected from four farms tested positive (HI titers of ≥1:40) for JX346, with HI titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:160 (

Additionally, to exclude the possibility of cross-reactions with other swine influenza viruses, HI and MN assays for the H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza viruses were conducted for the eight positive serum samples. The results showed that all samples were negative for H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza virus (HI and MN titer &lt; 1:10,
