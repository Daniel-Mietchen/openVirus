  <p>Virus shedding from nasal swabs in different groups. (A) JX346 inoculated group, (B) JX346 contact group, (C) GD-E1 inoculated group, and (D) GD-E1 contact group. Nasal swabs were collected from inoculated and contact pigs in different groups at 1–14 dpi/dpc, and viral titers were determined as the TCID
   <sub>50</sub> in MDCK cells; no virus was detected after 8 dpi. The dotted lines indicate the lower limit of detection.
