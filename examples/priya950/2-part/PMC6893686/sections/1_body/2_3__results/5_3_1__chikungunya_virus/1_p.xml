<p>Chikungunya virus (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, family Togaviridae) was reported for the first time in 1952–1953 in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The original anthroponotic cycle allows the virus to circulate from 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to non-human primates. Outbreaks occur when an anthropophilic or opportunistic mosquito (e.g., 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) completes the bridge between zoonotic and anthroponotic cycles. The girst reported outbreaks occurred in the southern hemisphere during the 1960s [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Since then, three lineages have been identified: West-African, East-Central-South-African, and Asian lineages. During the 2000s, a new variant harboring a point mutation at the 
 <italic>E1</italic> glycoprotein gene (E1-A226V) was isolated during the outbreak in the islands of the Indian Ocean, making 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> more efficient for the transmission of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In Europe, the autochthonous transmission of CHIKV was first reported in Italy in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In our area of interest, the first autochthonous cases of CHIKV occurred in 2010 in Southern France [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. According to the ECDC, the six countries in this study reported 214 imported cases (Switzerland excluded) in 2012–2016 [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. An autochthonous circulation of CHIKV was observed in France 2014 and 2017 [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. An autochthonous outbreak of CHIKV also occurred in Italy in 2017 [
