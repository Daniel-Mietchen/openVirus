<p>Detailed vector competence studies by species are presented in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01059-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Positive and negative results reported here are related to our area of study. Vector competence is defined as the ability of a mosquito to ingest, replicate and transmit a virus by biting. Firstly, species are considered to be competent if viral replication and detection of viral particles in saliva have been demonstrated. On the other hand, we do not consider the detection of viral RNA in mosquito pools as a relevant indication of vector competence. This information, however, may suggest an active virus circulation which could warrant further vector competence studies to identify potential vectors.
