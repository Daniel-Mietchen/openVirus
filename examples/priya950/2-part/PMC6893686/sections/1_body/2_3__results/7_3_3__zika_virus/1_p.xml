<p>Zika virus (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family Flaviviridae), was first isolated in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. There are three main lineages: two from Africa and one from Asia [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is transmitted to humans (urban cycle) and primates (sylvatic cycle) by mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. In North-Western Europe, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (France, Germany) and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> (Germany) are competent mosquitoes [
