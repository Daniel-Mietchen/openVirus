<p>Our area of interest is defined as the “Cfb” climate of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cfb defines a temperate oceanic climate (C) without a dry season (f) but with a warm summer (b) [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mainland France was investigated although the south of France is characterized as a “Csa” (temperate with a dry and hot summer) or “Csb” (temperate with a dry and warm summer) category. The island of Corsica categorized as “Csb” was excluded from our analysis [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mosquito inventories were then selected in our area of interest. The last European global inventory compiled by Schaffner et al. in 2001 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was used, completed with more recent national sources and finally compared with the last review available [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For invasive species, updated European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maps were used (

The vectorial status of mosquitoes was inferred from experimental data using infections in laboratory and/or viral detections in field-collected populations.
