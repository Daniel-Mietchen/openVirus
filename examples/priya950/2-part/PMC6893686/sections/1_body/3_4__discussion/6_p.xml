<p>For USUV and WNV, the entanglement of mosquito populations with avian populations is necessary for sustaining the enzootic cycle. Recent years have shown a sharp increase in WNV cases [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], the screening of mosquito populations is less systematic. Also, WNV antibodies are more prevalent in migratory birds, while USUV are more prevalent in resident birds [
