<p>This work highlights that invasive species represent the most probable candidates for the circulation of CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV in our area of interest. To date, three species are established in our area of interest: 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>koreicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>japonicus</italic>. 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was first introduced in France in 1999 and has been established since 2004 [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is now widespread and abundant in the southern part of the country. It is also reported as established in the north-eastern part of France, in Germany, in Switzerland, in The Netherlands, and occasionally found in Belgium and the UK [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> is well established in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae. koreicus</italic> is implanted in Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. While invasive species benefit from globalization (increased transportation of goods and people) to expand, native species are also experiencing ecological upheavals and contribute to increase the risk of arboviral emergences. Recently, 
 <italic>An. plumbeus</italic> has switched from natural breeding sites to man-made sites [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] leading to consider its potential role as a vector for WNV [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
