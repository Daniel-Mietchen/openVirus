<p>North-Western Europe is at risk for emerging or re-emerging arboviruses. The epidemiology of arboviruses such as DENV, ZIKV or CHIKV is very different in Europe as compared to tropical or sub-tropical countries. In the latter countries, the existence of sylvatic cycles involving wild animals as reservoir hosts and arboreal canopy dwelling mosquitoes as vectors sustain a viral circulation of viruses all year long [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Epidemics only occur when anthropo-zoophilic mosquitoes act as bridge vector for the transmission of the virus from animals to humans. In Europe, in the absence of any sylvatic cycle, autochthonous transmission is only caused when a competent vector becomes infectious after feeding on an imported human case.
