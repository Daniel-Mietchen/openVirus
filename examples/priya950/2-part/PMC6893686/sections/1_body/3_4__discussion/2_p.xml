<p>The number of imported human cases of CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV peaks in January, March–April, and September–October [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], corresponding to vacations in Europe. The last two peaks may allow the launch of local transmissions. Regarding the January peak, there is no mosquito activity at that time in the considered area. Consequently, this peak will probably have no consequences regarding a local transmission. During the March–April peak, DENV and CHIKV can be transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and ZIKV by 
 <italic>Ae. vexans</italic> if European mosquitoes appear to be competent (such as Canadian ones do) [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The summer peak is highly correlated with the activity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The competence of native populations has been characterized for CHIKV and ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Outbreaks have already occurred in southern European countries such as the occurrence of chikungunya in Italy [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Established vectors 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are also competent for transmitting ZIKV in Italy and Spain [
