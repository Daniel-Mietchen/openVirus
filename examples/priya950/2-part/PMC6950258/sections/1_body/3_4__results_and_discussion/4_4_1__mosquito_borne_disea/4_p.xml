<p>Despite their epidemic potential, the clinical picture of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV is often mild, and symptoms often go unrecognized [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mild presentation of all three viral infections includes flu-like symptoms, with fever, rash, and malaise, which often results in misdiagnosis when laboratory confirmation is missing [

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Most people recover fully, however, in rare cases infection may cause severe health complications such as encephalitis, neurological disorders, infantile malformations (ZIKV), severe and long-lasting arthralgia (CHIKV), or hemorrhagic manifestations (DENV), leading to hospitalization or fatal complications. Yet, the interaction between the different pathogens is poorly understood. At present, for all three mosquito-borne viral diseases there is no antiviral treatment [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], however, there are advances for the control of these diseases, e.g., the first licensed dengue vaccine and other vaccine candidates [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Personal protection, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, application of insect repellents, insecticides spraying, bed nets application, as well as consequent cleaning of mosquito breeding sites remain the primarily prevention strategies. However, to implement such strategies successfully, the continuous mobilization of affected communities is required [
