<p>In the Pacific region, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes have been identified as the main disease vector species. Mainly causing dengue epidemics linked to a single DENV serotype throughout the past, recent research identified the co-circulation of not only different dengue virus serotypes (types one to four), but newly emerging 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne Zika and chikungunya transmission [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Regular DENV outbreaks had been reported since 1960s from the Pacific region. Since then, DENV has established endemic and epidemic circulation. In the early 21st century, ZIKV (since 2007) and CHIKV (since 2011) epidemics occurred for the first time [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The most important mosquito-borne viral genera in the Pacific region include 
 <italic>Alphaviruses</italic> (family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), e.g., chikungunya virus, and 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), e.g., Zika and dengue virus. Those viruses could primarily be linked to the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, which is mainly present in human residential areas, and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, mainly found in peri-urban or rural areas [
