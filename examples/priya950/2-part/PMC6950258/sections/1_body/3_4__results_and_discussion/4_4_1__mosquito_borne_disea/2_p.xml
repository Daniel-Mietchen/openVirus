<p>DEN, ZIKV, and CHIKV are tropical mosquito-borne viruses that share biological similarities with other viral agents such as Ross River virus (closely related to CHIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus (closely related to DENV and ZIKV). They primarily spread through the bite of disease-carrying female mosquitoes of the genus

 <italic>Aa. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The main reservoir hosts include human and non-human primates and may further be present in other wild and domestic animals. The incidence and severity of mosquito-borne arbovirus infections that can be maintained in human-vector-human-cycles (with no involvement of animals in the transmission cycle) such as DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV, has increased in the Pacific regions during the past years [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Especially in populations with poor herd immunity (high susceptibility due to low seroprevalence levels in the population) and lacking resilience capacities, the (re-)emergence of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) is particularly hazardous to human health, often leading to major outbreaks.
