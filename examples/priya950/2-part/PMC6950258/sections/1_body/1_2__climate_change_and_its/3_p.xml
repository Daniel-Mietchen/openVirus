 <italic>Heatwaves:</italic> Periods of extreme increased temperature are occurring more often and affect health and well-being in various ways [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exposure to extreme heat can result in dehydration, heat cramps, heatstroke, as well as chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Moreover, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition will increase due to droughts and shifts in agriculture. Furthermore, increased temperatures are known to accelerate the activity of infectious agents and expand their geographical range while reducing human immunity, thus, increasing morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some populations are more susceptible to the effects of temperature, including athletes and outdoor workers. Besides, children, older people, pregnant women, and those unable to control their body temperature due to pre-existing medical conditions, are among the most vulnerable to increased temperatures [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Studies have furthermore demonstrated that exposure to more extended periods of heat had more severe adverse health effects compared to instantaneous increases in temperature, explaining elevated mortality in urban areas due to heat accumulation and urban heatwaves than suburbs and rural areas [
