 <title>Acknowledgments</title>
 <p>This study was made possible by the producers who allowed us to visit their farms. Over the 30-year study period, we worked with many technicians and veterinarian peers. Researchers from all over the world have written about myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease; they have also helped us to gain a better understanding of these diseases. Cathy R. Martin supported us with the English language editing. Lastly, the anonymous referees contributed to improving the manuscript. Our gratitude goes to all of them. This article is dedicated to the memory of José Luis Argüello (1952–2018).</p>
