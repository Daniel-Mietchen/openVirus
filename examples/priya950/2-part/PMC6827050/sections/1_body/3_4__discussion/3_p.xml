<p>In relation to RHD diagnosis, we did not score the clinical events in all of the affected rabbits, which would be more recommendable when examining smaller colonies [

 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], described as typical of RHD caused by the classic virus (RHDV GI.1). This finding is of interest for two reasons. Firstly, because according to our observations, serosanguinous nasal discharge is not a pathognomonic sign of RHD caused by GI.2; we coincide with [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Evidently, the most serious fact is that rabbit producers rule out the presence of RHD when serosanguinous nasal discharge is not observed. Secondly, we observed the presence of blood on the nose in cases of myxomatosis, rhinitis and pneumonia, acute mastitis, in rabbits affected by mucoid enteropathy (similar to epizootic rabbit enteropathy) [
