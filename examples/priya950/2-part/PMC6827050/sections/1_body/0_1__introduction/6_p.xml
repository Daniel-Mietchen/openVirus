<p>RHD is caused by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV now termed RHDVG I.1 [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). In Spain, the first cases of RHD were identified in domestic rabbits in June 1988 [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and soon after the causative agent was identified by Parra and Prieto [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A specific vaccine against this RHDV strain was used in Spain from January 1989, with protection shown to last over one year [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During the following years, different RHD genogroups (e.g., GI.1a-d) were identified mainly in other European countries [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but had no serious effects on farms as the available vaccines proved effective (review in [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). This could explain why the occurrence of RHD in domestic rabbits, was only serious at the start of the 1988â€“1989 epidemics, coinciding with when the vaccine was not available [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since 1999, a combined vaccine with MYXV and GI.1 virus [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has been available. Additionally, a bivalent recombinant vaccine of homologous attenuated MYXV, which expresses GI.1 capsid protein (VP60) has been on the market since 2012 [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In 2010, a novel RHDV was identified in France [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and subsequently in Spain: originally RHDV2 or RHDVb now termed RHDV GI.2, affecting rabbits under 35 days old [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and vaccinated rabbits. The occurrence of disease due to GI.2 in Spain was serious from 2011 until July 2013, when vaccines against it were first used [
