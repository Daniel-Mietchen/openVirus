<p>Our 30-year study lasted from 11 September 1988, when we visited our first farm affected by RHD, to 11 September 2018. We obtained information from a total of 13,467 visits to 1714 commercial farms. The information gathered was used to generate a dataset with the number of adult breeding rabbits per farm, and rabbit health management. Animal Care and Use Committee approval was not obtained for this study because data were obtained from rabbits raised under commercial conditions, fulfilling European, Spanish and regional recommendations and laws on animal welfare, food safety and environmental protection.</p>
