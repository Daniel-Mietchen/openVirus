<p>The analyses were carried out using the SAS statistical package, and the CATMOD, FREQ, or MEAN procedures, depending on the analyses we used [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The statistical model (CATMOD procedure) used was the following:
 <disp-formula>Y
  <sub>ijk</sub> = Âµ + YE
  <sub>i</sub> +MO
  <sub>j</sub> +e
  <sub>ijk</sub>
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Y
 <sub>ij</sub> were the dependent categorical variables, occurrence of myxomatosis or RHD on each visit-farm, YE
 <sub>i</sub> was the year effect (30: from September 1988 until September 2018), MO
 <sub>j</sub> was the month effect (12), and e
 <sub>ijk</sub> was the residual effect. We have not analyzed covariates.
