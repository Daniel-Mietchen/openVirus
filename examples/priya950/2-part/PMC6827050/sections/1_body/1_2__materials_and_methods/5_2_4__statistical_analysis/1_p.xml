<p>The database used contains 13,467 records (farm visits). The variables recorded were occurrence of clinical myxomatosis and RHD (categorical variable) on each farm visit. The relative occurrence was calculated dividing the number of myxomatosis or RHD cases by the total number visits. Following the same procedure as in a preliminary study [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we only used one visit per farm and calendar month, at most, for these calculations; thus, the database for the analyses comprised a subset with 13,326 visits. Concerning measures of disease occurrence, we followed the criterion of Thrusfield [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the case of clinical myxomatosis, we calculated relative annual and monthly relative prevalence; the reason for this was that we visited farms where the disease could have been an enzootic pattern. In the case of RHD, we analyzed the incidence because in the preliminary assessment of the time between the first visit to each case of RHD and the first day with compatible losses on each farm, the results were as follows: 50.5% of the 109 first-visits during 2011â€“2018 were made on the first 7 days of the apparent start of each outbreak of RHD.
