<p>This retrospective study included all the 1714 farms visited by the first author in Spain. They housed females with or without males or weaned rabbits, only males, or only weaned rabbits. The target populations included all types of rabbits because they were all at risk. Farms in Spain are inscribed in the official database 
 <italic>Registro General de explotaciones ganaderas</italic> (REGA). According to the 
 <italic>Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci√≥n</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the number of farms varied greatly throughout the 30-year period, with a marked decrease in those housing &gt;20 does; e.g., over 5000 farms in 1999, whereas in 2017 it had decreased to fewer than 1000. In a preliminary paper [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we provided a detailed explanation of the farms registered in the REGA database and those visited between 2001 and 2017 (opus cit., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00780-f001">Figure 1</xref>). At the same time, the average size (number of does) of the farms increased. In addition, we have used a subset of 200 farms housing does, that we have visited since the end of 2014 until the end of 2018, to describe the vaccination programs, among other factors. In our case, a doe was a female that had been serviced once or more.
