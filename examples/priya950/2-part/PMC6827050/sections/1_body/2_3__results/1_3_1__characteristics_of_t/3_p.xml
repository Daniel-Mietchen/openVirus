<p>We visited farms in 47/50 provinces. Most were meat production farms (1704 of the 1714), 4 farms housing Rex rabbits for fur production, 3 with dwarf rabbits and 3 with New Zealand rabbits for laboratory purposes. Most farms housed does (1677 of the 1714), mainly with weaned rabbits in the same farm, and often in separated barns. In addition, there were 14 farms with weaned rabbits only and 23 with males only. On all of the farms visited during the 30 years, the rabbits were kept in conventional individual housing without elevated platforms; however, on the 200 doe farms visited from the end of 2014 to 2018, approximately 77.5 % had installed footrests.</p>
