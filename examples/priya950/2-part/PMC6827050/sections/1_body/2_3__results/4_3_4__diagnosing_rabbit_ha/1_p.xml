<p>During the 344 visits and in necropsies we made due to RHD, we observed different degrees of evolution of the disease based on the contents of the stomach (full or empty). We have related a full stomach with an acute process; according to Cooke [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]: “(sick) rabbits…may even continue to eat sporadically a few hours or sometimes minutes before death”. During the first years of the study, we found affected adults and weaned rabbits (&gt;35 days old), with few 23–25-day old rabbits being affected, as observed in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In January, 2011 we observed a particularly interesting case of affected young rabbits (25-days old) due to RHDV GI.1. Months later, we started to diagnose disease due to RHDV GI.2 infection. During the 2011–2013 GI.2 epidemics, vaccines produced with classic GI.1 strains were not effective and the number of calls to farms increased. Unlike during the previous GI.1 epidemics (1988–2010), during the GI.2 outbreaks we necropsied adults [

We also examined samples from on-farm suspected but somewhat unclear cases and several specimens were sent to the laboratory, some of which were confirmed to be bacterial septicemia, or bacterial pneumonia and RHD, simultaneously. From 2011 onwards we decided to take serosanguinous nasal discharge into consideration. Between July 2011 and September 2018 we performed 1404 necropsies on 102 farms, the apparent cause of death being RHD caused by GI.2. We observed serosanguinous nasal discharge in 18.6 % of cases (261/1404).
