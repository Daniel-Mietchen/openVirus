<p>Mean relative annual prevalence of clinical myxomatosis on the farms was 6.5% throughout the 30-year study period. There were apparently three prevalence peaks (rolling average): 1997, 2005, and 2013; we did not analyze the causes, e.g., the climate variables. Annual prevalence decreased from 12.6% in 1989 to 5.3% in 1995 (rolling average). Our hypothesis is that vaccination schedules were improved. Vaccines made with attenuated homologous virus strains were not used extensively until the 1990’s. Thus, on 95.5% of 200 farms housing does visited from the end of 2014 to 2018, future breeders and adult females were vaccinated against myxomatosis; “homologous” vaccines were used on 90.6% of them. We paid particular attention differentiating to which groups of does the booster should be applied; for example, taking into account variables such as a) the type of farm, e.g., in selection farms, the does were not revaccinated, (b) we asked when females were last vaccinated with “homologous” vaccine (in general, we recommend revaccination from 6 to 8 months onwards). Furthermore, we considered cases where the maternal or the vaccinal immunity might have waned or the immune system was affected, due to predisposing risk factors such as gastroenteric diseases, or enabling risk factors, e.g., overexposure to vaccine antigens. In the case of predisposing risks, we recommended revaccination, but in other situations (e.g., overexposure) we did not suggest revaccination.</p>
