<p>We made 13,467 visits to farms during the 30-year study. Our assessment of relative annual and monthly occurrences of clinical diseases was based on one visit per farm and calendar month, at most, as we have explained in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-animals-09-00780">Section 2.4</xref> (statistical analysis); hence the figure 13,326. In total, 862 visits were made due to myxomatosis, 817 without repeated visits in the same month (–5.2%), to 394 farms. For RHD, 344 visits were made, 253 also without monthly repetitions (–26.5%), to 156 farms. 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00780-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of visits for all the months.
