<p>There were two serious epidemics, during 1988–1989 and 2011–2013, with different mean relative incidences, reaching maximum levels of 5.5% in 1989 and 11.3% in 2013. The GI.1 epidemic occurred due to lack of protection as there was no vaccine available; while the GI.2 epidemic occurred demonstrating a lack of cross protection of the GI.1 based vaccines. With regard to vaccination against RHD, on the 200 doe farms visited from the end of 2014 to 2018, 97.5% of the does were systematically vaccinated against RHDV GI.2 or against RHDV GI.1 as well. In June 2019, GI.1 or GI.2 based vaccines were available. In our vaccination schedule against RHD, following the criterion of Capucci et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we suggested vaccinating future breeders against 
 <italic>classic</italic> RHDV (GI.1) and against new RHDV (GI.2); boosters were only recommended against GI.2 in adults. Following the serious 2011–2013 epidemics, the incidence of RHD remained higher than during 1990-2010. In our opinion, this was due to the recurrent outbreaks of RHD on the same farm, mainly in non-vaccinated weaned rabbits or runts.
