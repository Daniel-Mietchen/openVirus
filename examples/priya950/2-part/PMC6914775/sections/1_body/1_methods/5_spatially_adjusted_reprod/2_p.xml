 </sup>. Thus, unlike the generation interval, which is typically marked with a temporally lagged effect because of the latency period of infectiousness, the spatial weighting function decreases monotonically as distance increases, which means people would be easily get infections if they live near each other. It reflects people in the nearby neighborhood may share common environmental sources of dengue infection. There are several kinds of spatial kernels used in the literature, including exponential decay

 </sup> and power-law decay
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. In the context of dengue transmission, we adopted an exponential decaying kernel with mean = 125 m

 </sup>. This approach accounts for both temporal and spatial relationships when estimating individual-level reproductive numbers. Apart from the component of the generation interval inherited from the previous method, the distance-decayed spatial weighting function captures the spatial risk of dengue infection.
