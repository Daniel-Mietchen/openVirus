 <italic>R</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is that the value of 
 <italic>R</italic> does not depend on the assumption that the population is completely susceptible, which is often violated in later stages of an outbreak or in a situation in which the population has been exposed to the pathogen previously. Therefore, 
 <italic>R</italic> aims to characterize the progression of an epidemic in a realistic scenario. Intuitively, counting the branches of infection on transmission trees (i.e., who infects whom
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>) precisely quantifies the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>; however, doing this is impractical in most circumstances except for confined outbreaks where contact tracing is feasible
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. The epidemic curve (an illustration of the number of new infections) does not encode transmission dynamics and cannot be used to infer 
 <italic>R</italic> directly. The 
 <italic>renewal equation</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, which describes the temporal transmission relationship between propagating generations of infected cases, is therefore proposed to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic> from incidence data in different epidemic periods. More specifically, the renewal equation estimates the values of the time-varying effective reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>), defined as the population-level transmission potential at time 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. In a fully susceptible population, early values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> should approximate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, but 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> is more informative in that it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission potential during the course of an outbreak. The values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> can also reveal the time when an outbreak was contained by monitoring the epidemic threshold. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> captured a distinct temporal pattern of transmission potential in different countries, signaling the different levels of control measures needed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. As the change in transmission potential is highly correlated to control measures, public health practitioners can evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by determining the change in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> after implementation. For example, sudden drops in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> (from 3 to approximately 0.7) after the issuance of a global alert during the 2003 SARS outbreak indicated the effectiveness of the alert
