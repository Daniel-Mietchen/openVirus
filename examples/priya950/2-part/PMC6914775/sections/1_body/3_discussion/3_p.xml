 </sup>. These models considered spatial distribution of farms, however, it was difficult to capture FMD disease transmission process among animals. In other words, the time-varying reproductive numbers in these models are difficult to reflect nature course of FMD transmission in terms of implementing general interval and renewal equation. Furthermore, farm-level models for FMD outbreaks can be categorized the farms into infected and susceptible ones to determine relative transmissibility of each farm at a specific time. It may be difficult to estimate the amount of susceptible persons living around the infected cases for human infectious diseases, such as influenza and dengue fever. Other studies have also explored spatial heterogeneity by performing stratified analysis of

 </sup>. These studies used a spatial weighting function to emphasize the interregional transmission process but still assumed a homogeneous-mixing model within each region. Thus, these studies did not address the spatial heterogeneous mixing issue when estimating reproductive numbers. Our study considered individual-level spatial heterogeneity and used the spatially adjusted reproductive number to measure the transmission potential of each individual.
