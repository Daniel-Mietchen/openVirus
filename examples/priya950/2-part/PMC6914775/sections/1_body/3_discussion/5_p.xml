 </sup>. The significance of the study is to introduce the perspective of individual-level transmission potential to disease risk mapping. We found that locations of individuals with high transmission potential are usually located at the edges of growing disease clusters, which can easily be neglected when intervention resources focus on epidemic clusters. A previous study found that urban villages that were originally at the edge of the city but are now enclosed by urbanized lands act as transfer stations for dengue outbreaks

 </sup>. In this study, we further provide a better understanding of outbreak expansion by categorizing different types of spreaders. Early spreaders with high transmission potential may initiate new source of infection at the edges of the main cluster, resulting in geographic expansion at the exponential growing stages of the outbreak. Therefore, the edge of the outbreak should be a priority of spatial targeting to contain the outbreak regarding both range and magnitude. Succeeding spreaders are indeed still important in tallying morbidity and fatality. However, their high-density clustering patterns make them prone to the depletion of local susceptible populations and degenerating transmission potential. In summary, the center and edges of epidemic clusters play different roles in developing epidemic progression in terms of different types of spreaders (succeeding vs. early) and different patterns of epidemic growth (intensifying vs. expanding). These findings provide important insights for implementing different interventions in the center and on the edges of epidemic clusters.
