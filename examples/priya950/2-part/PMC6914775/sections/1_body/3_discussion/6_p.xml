<p id="Par31">There are several limitations to this study. First, the method of estimating time-varying effective reproductive numbers is a retrospective procedure that uses observed infectee generation to estimate the

 </sup> of the infector generation. In other words, it cannot be used for predicting future epidemic progression in real time. Nonetheless, the method is helpful for understanding the course of an epidemic and studying the possible mechanisms of geographical expansion. Second, this study considers only geographical distance as a factor in transmission potential. Other factors influence the spatial spreading of dengue. Among these, host heterogeneity (including variations in density

 </sup>) strongly modulates the transmission dynamic

 </sup> and should be considered in further studies. Finally, the spatial weighting function reflects the assumption of distance-decayed properties (neighborhood transmission). However, the assumption may not reflect long-distance transmission

 </sup>. The question of how to develop more detailed spatial weighting schemes that capture realistic mobility patterns warrants further investigation.
