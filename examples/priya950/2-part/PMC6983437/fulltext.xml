We performed comparative qualitative and quantitative analyses of lipid peroxide between mock-infected and virus-infected cells treated with or without daidzein, as it had been reported that daidzein was an antioxidant and lipid peroxide levels increased upon virus infection. Contrary to our belief, lipid peroxides were not elevated in virus-infected cells and no decrease in lipid peroxides was observed in daidzein-treated cells. In daidzein-treated cells, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, the 5-lipoxygenase product derived from arachidonate, was significantly elevated compared to other lipid peroxides. Zileuton (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) and 5-lipoxygenase knockdown reduced the daidzein-induced antiviral effect. Moreover, virus replication was regulated by treatment with 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a precursor of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 5-lipoxygenase primary product. These results suggest that daidzein regulates virus replication via signal transduction through 5-lipoxygenase products.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>daidzein</kwd><kwd>lipid peroxide</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>lipoxygenase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses, particularly A viruses, cause epidemics and pandemics in human populations, resulting in enormous suffering and economic losses.<sup>(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> Influenza virus infections can cause severe complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis and can increase the rate of hospitalization and mortality, particularly in young children and elderly people.<sup>(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> The M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir have been used to treat influenza virus infections.

We then measured the influenza virus titer in the culture medium. In control siRNA-transfected MDCK cells, daidzein inhibited virus replication by approximately 50.8% [flu: flu&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;daidzein, inhibition rate&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;4.91&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>/9.99&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> (%)] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). In contrast, following knockdown of 5-LOX, daidzein reduced virus replication to 26.5% [flu: flu&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;daidzein, inhibition rate&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 7.07&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>/9.62&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> (%)] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). The difference in the viral titer between daidzein-treated control siRNA MDCK cells (4.91&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 1.18&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;FFU/ml) and daidzein-treated 5-LOX knockdown MDCK cells (7.07&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.53&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;FFU/ml) was significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These results indicate that 5-LOX is involved in the inhibitory effect of daidzein on virus replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of 5-HpETE administration on viral replication in virus-infected MDCK cells</title><p>Because 5-LOX was found to be involved in daidzein-induced inhibition of virus replication, we confirmed whether 5-LOX product inhibits virus proliferation. Administration of 5-HpETE, a precursor of 5-HETE and 5-LOX primary product derived from AA, inhibited virus proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 204.0&#x000a0;ng/ml (606.3&#x000a0;nM). 5-HpETE showed nearly no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 1,250&#x000a0;ng/ml (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). These results indicate that 5-HpETE or its metabolite regulate virus replication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study clarified the mechanism of daidzein-induced inhibition of influenza virus replication. Daidzein showed no antioxidant activity under our experimental conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A&#x02013;F); however, it enhanced 5-HETE production (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). Based on the effects of zileuton, a direct inhibitor of 5-LOX (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B), and knockdown of 5-LOX (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D), we observed that 5-LOX is involved in daidzein-induced 5-HETE production and daidzein-induced anti-influenza activity. Additionally, 5-HpETE, the primary product of 5-LOX, inhibited influenza virus replication (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).</p><p>This is the first study to demonstrate that daidzein activates 5-LOX and regulates viral replication. No previous studies have reported exogenous compounds that can increase 5-LOX activity, although 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) is well known as an endogenous 5-LOX activator.<sup>(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup> The food component daidzein enhances 5-LOX activity and can be used to prevent and treat influenza. Liu <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup> reported the effect of soy isoflavone administration to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model rat. And they showed that soy isoflavones affected the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b1;.<sup>(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup> There may be potential signal transduction pathways to enhance 5-LOX activity by daidzein.</p><p>It has been reported that oxidation products derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have various functions such as causing and resolving inflammation and are involved in signal transduction as lipid mediators.<sup>(<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</sup> Morita <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup> reported that the omega-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediator protectin D1 (PD1) attenuates influenza virus replication. They performed a screen of PUFA-derived lipid metabolites in human lung epithelial (A549) cells infected with influenza A virus (PR8 virus) by using bioactive lipid libraries containing prostaglandins, resolvins, protectins, and other PUFA-derived metabolites.<sup>(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup> They evaluated the antiviral effect by influenza virus nucleoprotein mRNA expression at 8&#x000a0;h after infection and found that 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 17-hydroxy-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,10<italic>Z</italic>,13<italic>Z</italic>,15<italic>E</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-docosahexaenoic acid, or PD1 treatment of PR8-virus-infected A549 cells inhibited nucleoprotein mRNA expression.<sup>(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup> Results of their report indicate that there are several PUFA-derived metabolites, which have anti-influenza activity, produced by lipid-metabolizing enzymes such as lipoxygenase. We demonstrated the antiviral activity of 5-HpETE in the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A); however, the mechanism remains unclear. 5-HpETE is further metabolized to leukotrienes by leukotriene-converting enzymes and leukotrienes exert physiological functions in the pathophysiology of asthma and inflammation.<sup>(<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup> Additionally, there is another 5-LOX associated arachidonate-derived metabolite: lipoxin A4.<sup>(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)</sup> It is possible that daidzein-induced enzymatic activation of 5-LOX produced 5-LOX-associated PUFA-derived metabolites other than 5-HpETE and that these metabolites exert antiviral activity. Further studies are needed to determine whether 5-HpETE or another 5-LOX-associated PUFA-derived metabolite exerts antiviral functions and how these lipid metabolites suppress viral replication.</p><p>Zileuton, a direct inhibitor of 5-LOX, significantly reduced the antiviral activity of daidzein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). However, the reduction effect of zileuton on daidzein-induced 5-HETE production was not significant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, the inhibition rate of viral replication was elevated sharply at low concentrations of 5-HpETE (&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;ng/ml). This indicates that even a slight reduction in 5-HETE by zileuton addition can affect viral replication. Additionally, 5-HETE is produced in cells not only by 5-LOX-mediated enzymatic oxidation, but also by oxidation by ROS. Although we did not determine the proportion of 5-HETE generated by ROS relative to the total 5-HETE level, zileuton did not effectively suppress 5-HETE production because zileuton did not suppress ROS-mediated 5-HETE generation. This may be because zileuton could not significantly reduce 5-HETE generation without daidzein administration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). As shown in Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>, MK-886, an inhibitor of 5-LOX, did not suppress 5-HETE production. MK-886 inhibits FLAP, which is thought to facilitate the transfer of phospholipid-derived AA to 5-LOX.<sup>(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup> It is thought that MK-886 cannot inactivate FLAP in MDCK cells.</p><p>The addition of daidzein showed anti-influenza activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 51.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). King <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)</sup> reported the pharmacokinetics of the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein in humans. Subjects consumed single soybean flour-based meal (0.84&#x000a0;g flour/kg body weight) and plasma concentration of isoflavones were analyzed throughout the 35-h post-meal period. This soybean flour-based meal provided 2.7&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/kg body weight of daidzein. Daidzein concentration in plasma reached maximum values of 3.14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.36&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L.<sup>(<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)</sup> A subject weighting 60&#x000a0;kg would have consumed 41.2&#x000a0;mg (162&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol) of daidzein. Based on the results of this report, in order to increase the plasma concentration of daidzein to 51.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, the IC<sub>50</sub> for anti-influenza activity, it is estimated that 667.4&#x000a0;mg of daidzein must be consumed. On the other hand, Cheng <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)</sup> reported the effect of a high dose of isoflavones (300&#x000a0;mg/day) on coagulation function in postmenopausal women. After 1-year treatment with a high dose of isoflavones, the changes in liver function, hematological parameters, and coagulation test were not different from those of the control subjects.<sup>(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)</sup> The dose of isoflavones administered in this clinical study corresponds to less than half of the estimated dose of daidzein that can exert anti-influenza activity. The duration of daidzein administration for the treatment of influenza infection is thought to be 5 days. Further research is necessary to examine the safety of short-term high dose administration of daidzein.</p><p>The inhibitory mechanism of daidzein against influenza replication does not involve the inhibition of viral enzymes, such as neuraminidase and cap-dependent endonuclease, which are encoded by the influenza virus genome, but rather involves enzyme activation in infected host cells. The results of the present study provide a foundation for developing anti-influenza treatments with a novel mode of action, as well as for developing preventive strategies against influenza infection using food ingredients.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YH, RS, MS, NI, and RM performed experiments and analyzed the data; AO provided new tools and reagents; YI conceived and supervised the study; YI designed experiments and wrote the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (grant numbers 24501017, 18K11117, and 19K11659) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI).</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>7&#x003b2;-OHCh</term><def><p>7&#x003b2;-hydroxycholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFRA</term><def><p>focus-forming reduction assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFU</term><def><p>focus-forming unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FLAP</term><def><p>5-lipoxygenase-activating protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HETE</term><def><p>hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HODE</term><def><p>hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HpETE</term><def><p>hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>8-iso-PGF2<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub></term><def><p>8-iso-prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC-MS/MS</term><def><p>liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5-LOX</term><def><p>5-lipoxygenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDCK</term><def><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOI</term><def><p>multiplicity of infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD1</term><def><p>protectin D1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PUFA</term><def><p>polyunsaturated fatty acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p>reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>siRNA</term><def><p>short interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>tHODE</term><def><p>total hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Fiore AE, Uyeki TM, Broder K, et al.; Centers for Desease Control and Prevention (CDC). <article-title>Prevention and control of influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2010</article-title>. <source>MMWR Recomm Rep</source>
