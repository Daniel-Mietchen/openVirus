<p>The present study clarified the mechanism of daidzein-induced inhibition of influenza virus replication. Daidzein showed no antioxidant activity under our experimental conditions (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A–F); however, it enhanced 5-HETE production (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). Based on the effects of zileuton, a direct inhibitor of 5-LOX (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B), and knockdown of 5-LOX (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D), we observed that 5-LOX is involved in daidzein-induced 5-HETE production and daidzein-induced anti-influenza activity. Additionally, 5-HpETE, the primary product of 5-LOX, inhibited influenza virus replication (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).
