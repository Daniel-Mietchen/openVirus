<p>The inhibitory mechanism of daidzein against influenza replication does not involve the inhibition of viral enzymes, such as neuraminidase and cap-dependent endonuclease, which are encoded by the influenza virus genome, but rather involves enzyme activation in infected host cells. The results of the present study provide a foundation for developing anti-influenza treatments with a novel mode of action, as well as for developing preventive strategies against influenza infection using food ingredients.</p>
