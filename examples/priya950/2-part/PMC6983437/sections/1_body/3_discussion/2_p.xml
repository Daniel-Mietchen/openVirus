<p>This is the first study to demonstrate that daidzein activates 5-LOX and regulates viral replication. No previous studies have reported exogenous compounds that can increase 5-LOX activity, although 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) is well known as an endogenous 5-LOX activator.

 </sup> reported the effect of soy isoflavone administration to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model rat. And they showed that soy isoflavones affected the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î±.
