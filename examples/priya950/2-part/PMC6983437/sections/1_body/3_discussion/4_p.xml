<p>Zileuton, a direct inhibitor of 5-LOX, significantly reduced the antiviral activity of daidzein (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). However, the reduction effect of zileuton on daidzein-induced 5-HETE production was not significant (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, the inhibition rate of viral replication was elevated sharply at low concentrations of 5-HpETE (&lt;200 ng/ml). This indicates that even a slight reduction in 5-HETE by zileuton addition can affect viral replication. Additionally, 5-HETE is produced in cells not only by 5-LOX-mediated enzymatic oxidation, but also by oxidation by ROS. Although we did not determine the proportion of 5-HETE generated by ROS relative to the total 5-HETE level, zileuton did not effectively suppress 5-HETE production because zileuton did not suppress ROS-mediated 5-HETE generation. This may be because zileuton could not significantly reduce 5-HETE generation without daidzein administration (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). As shown in Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>, MK-886, an inhibitor of 5-LOX, did not suppress 5-HETE production. MK-886 inhibits FLAP, which is thought to facilitate the transfer of phospholipid-derived AA to 5-LOX.

 </sup> It is thought that MK-886 cannot inactivate FLAP in MDCK cells.
