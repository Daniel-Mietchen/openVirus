<p>Virus-infected cells for analysis of lipid peroxidation products were prepared by infecting monolayer sheets of MDCK cells (1 ml, MOI 0.001) in 10-cm dishes for 1 h as described above. The inoculum then was removed and washed once with serum-free MEM, after which FBS-free DMEM supplemented with or without 275 µM daidzein was added. After 24 h, the dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were harvested into 1.5-ml tubes containing 500 µl of ice-cold PBS using a cell-scraper. The samples were placed on ice immediately after collection. The cells were obtained by centrifugation at 12,500 ×
