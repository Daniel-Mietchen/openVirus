 </sup> A 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) (sense 5'-GCAAGAAGCUACCCGAGAAUU-3', and antisense 5'-UUCUCGGGUAGCUUCUUGCUU-3') was prepared from corresponding oligonucleotides provided by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MDCK cells were transfected with siRNA (5 nM final concentration) using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h after siRNA transfection, the cells were placed in fresh medium. At 48 h after siRNA transfection, viruses (MOI 0.001) were infected for 1 h, and the inoculum was removed, washed once with serum-free MEM, and replaced with FBS-free DMEM supplemented with or without 275 µM daidzein.
