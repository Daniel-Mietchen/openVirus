<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 70 ml/L fetal bovine serum (FBS). The influenza A virus H1N1 (PR/8/34) was used throughout the experiments. For cell infection, the virus was diluted in serum-free MEM supplemented with 0.4 g/L bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), which was adsorbed to cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 for 1 h at 37°C. The inoculum then was removed and replaced with FBS-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 g/L bovine serum albumin and acetyltrypsin (2 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for the remainder of the infection period.</p>
