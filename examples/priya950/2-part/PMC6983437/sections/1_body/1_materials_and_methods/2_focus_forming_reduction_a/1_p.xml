<p>Sample influenza viruses used in the virucidal activity assay were prepared by infecting monolayer sheets of MDCK cells with viruses (100 µl, MOI 0.001) in 24-well plates for 1 h as described above. The inoculum was removed, washed once with serum-free MEM, and FBS-free DMEM supplemented with daidzein was added (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan). After 24 h, the supernatants were harvested and used as the influenza virus samples for focus forming reduction assay (FFRA).</p>
