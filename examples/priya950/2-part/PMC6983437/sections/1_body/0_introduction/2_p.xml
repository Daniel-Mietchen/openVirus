 </sup> reported the effect of soy isoflavones, including daidzein (61.7%), glycitein (21.5%) and genistein (16.2%), on diabetic rats. They showed that an improvement in postprandial blood glucose levels and a significant suppression of blood lipid peroxide can be achieved by single or long-term administration of soy isoflavones, respectively.

 </sup> Additionally, soy isoflavones act as phytoestrogens and interact with animal and human estrogen receptors and produce non-hormonal effects.

 </sup> We found that daidzein and glycitein inhibited influenza virus replication and suggested that the regulation by daidzein is not directly associated with viral enzymes but rather with host-cellular metabolism (unpublished data).
