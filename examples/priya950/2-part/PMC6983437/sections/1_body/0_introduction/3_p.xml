<p>In this study, we first confirmed whether daidzein exerts antiviral activity through its antioxidant function by measuring lipid peroxide levels. Furthermore, we identified a lipid oxidation product specifically increased in daidzein-treated cells as a lipid mediator that induces antiviral activity and analyzed its production mechanism.</p>
