<p>The contents of lipid peroxide in the cells are shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A–F. Lipid peroxide was not elevated in virus-infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A–F). Although daidzein is known as an antioxidant, lipid peroxide was not decreased in daidzein-treated cells (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A–F). These results indicate that daidzein did not exert antiviral activity through its antioxidant function under the conditions of this experiment. In contrast, 5-HETE content in the cells significantly increased in daidzein-treated cells both with and without virus infection (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F), although the contents of 7β-OHCh (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), tHODE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), 8-iso-PGF
 <sub>2α</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C), 12-HETE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D), and 15-HETE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E) were not significantly increased in daidzein-treated cells.
