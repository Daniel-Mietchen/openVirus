<p>As daidzein addition specifically induced a significant 5-HETE production in MDCK cells, we hypothesized that daidzein activated 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), which converts arachidonic acid to 5-HpETE, a precursor of 5-HETE. We analyzed the 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX activities in MDCK cell lysates. The cell lysates were obtained from mock-treated MDCK cells or those treated with daidzein and incubated with 120 µM arachidonic acid (AA). After 180 min incubation, 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE concentrations in the reactants were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, 5-HETE production in the daidzein-treated cell lysate was significantly higher than that in the mock-treated cell lysate. In contrast, daidzein treatment did not activate 12-HETE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) and 15-HETE (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C) production. These data indicate that daidzein enhances the enzymatic activity of 5-LOX.
