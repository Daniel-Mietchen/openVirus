<p>Because 5-LOX was found to be involved in daidzein-induced inhibition of virus replication, we confirmed whether 5-LOX product inhibits virus proliferation. Administration of 5-HpETE, a precursor of 5-HETE and 5-LOX primary product derived from AA, inhibited virus proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 204.0 ng/ml (606.3 nM). 5-HpETE showed nearly no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 1,250 ng/ml (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). These results indicate that 5-HpETE or its metabolite regulate virus replication.
