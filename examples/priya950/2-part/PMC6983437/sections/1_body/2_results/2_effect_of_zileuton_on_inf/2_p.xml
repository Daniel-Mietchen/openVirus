<p>In contrast, when MK-886 was used to indirectly inhibit 5-LOX, daidzein-induced antiviral activity was not inhibited (Supplemental Fig.

 <bold>*</bold>). Additionally, MK-886 did not affect 5-HETE production in daidzein-treated cells (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>B). This suggests that MK-886 does not inhibit 5-LOX activity in MDCK cells.
