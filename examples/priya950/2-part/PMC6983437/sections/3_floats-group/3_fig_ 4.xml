  <p>Effect of 5-LOX inhibitor, zileuton, and 5-LOX siRNA transfection on multiplication of influenza virus and production of 5-HETE. MDCK cells were inoculated with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus at a MOI of 0.001. Viral titers were determined at 24 h post-infection by focus-forming assays. (A) Effect of zileuton on the titer of influenza virus. (B) Effect of zileuton on 5-HETE production. (C) Effect of 5-LOX siRNA on 5-LOX expression in whole cell lysate of MDCK cells treated with or without daidzein and with or without influenza virus infection. (D) Effect of 5-LOX siRNA on daidzein-induced inhibition of virus multiplication. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
