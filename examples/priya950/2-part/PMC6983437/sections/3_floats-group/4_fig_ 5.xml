  <p>Effect of 5-HpETE on multiplication of influenza virus. MDCK cells were inoculated with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus at a MOI of 0.001. (A) Concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of 5-HpETE on virus multiplication. The inhibition rate of the virus titer was determined at 24 h post-infection by focus-forming assays. (B) Cytotoxicity of 5-HpETE. The survival rate of MDCK cells was determined at 24 h post-infection by WST-8 assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Data are representative of three independent experiments.
