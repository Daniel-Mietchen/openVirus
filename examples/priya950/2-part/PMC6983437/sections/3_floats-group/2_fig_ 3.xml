  <p>Effect of daidzein on lipoxygenase activity in MDCK cell lysate. The cell lysates were obtained from MDCK cells treated for 24 h with or without daidzein. AA was added to cell lysates to a final concentration at 120 µM and incubated for 180 min at 37°C with gentle mixing. After 180 min incubation, lipids were extracted and 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE and AA were measured by LC-MS/MS. The 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX activities in MDCK cell lysates were evaluated as the ratio of each HETE to AA. (A) 5-LOX activity was evaluated as 5-HETE/AA, (B) 12-LOX activity was evaluated as 12-HETE/AA, and (C) 15-LOX activity was evaluated as 15-HETE/AA. Data are presented as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Data are representative of three independent experiments.
