  <p>Effect of daidzein on multiplication of influenza virus and on proliferation of MDCK cells. MDCK cells were inoculated with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus at a MOI of 0.001. (A) Concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of Daidzein on virus multiplication. Viral titers were determined at 24 h post-infection by focus-forming assays. (B) Cytotoxicity of daidzein. The cell viability of MDCK cells was determined at 24 h post-addition of daidzein by WST-8 assay. The dotted lines indicate a daidzein concentration of 275 µM. Data are presented as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Data are representative of three independent experiments.
