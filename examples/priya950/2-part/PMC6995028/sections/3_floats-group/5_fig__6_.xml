  <p>H84T reduces influenza virus uncoating. MDCK cells were pretreated for 1 h with 0.1, 1, or 10 μM H84T, 10 μM D133G, or 40 μM of the fusion inhibitor ARB and infected with A/WSN/1933 (MOI 0.5) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Representative immunofluorescent micrographs of M1 antigen staining (green) and nuclei (blue) 2.5 h postinfection. Scale bars indicate 50 μm. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Micrographs of single cells from 
   <italic>A</italic>, as denoted by the boxes in 
   <italic>A</italic>. Scale bars indicate 5 μm. Data for 
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>B</italic> are representative of 15 independent experiments. (
   <italic>C</italic>) Quantitation of the number of cells with diffuse cytoplasmic M1 staining per field, as assessed by a trained observer in a blinded fashion. Statistical analyses were performed by 
   <italic>t</italic> test. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, as compared to the infected, untreated group. Error bars represent the SEM.
