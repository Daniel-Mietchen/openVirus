<p>At present, although there are a number of antiinfluenza agents currently in phase II or III clinical trials (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), only three classes of drugs are approved to treat influenza virus infection in the United States: Adamantanes, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, and as of October 2018, a new class with the sole member baloxavir marboxil, a cap-dependent endonuclease protein inhibitor (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Adamantanes are obsolete in practice due to overwhelmingly high levels of resistance to them among circulating influenza A strains and due to their intrinsic inactivity against influenza B strains. The current standard of care treatment is oseltamivir, a member of the NA inhibitor class. Oseltamivir is associated with a moderate decrease in mortality among adults hospitalized for influenza, but it must be initiated within 48 h of illness onset to be effective and only shortens the duration of symptoms by about 1 d in otherwise healthy adults (

 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although oseltamivir resistance among circulating strains has generally been low since the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1, resistance does occur and can be high in certain seasons (
