<p>With the twin threats of another influenza pandemic and emergence of antiviral resistance ever present and a paucity of new classes of antiinfluenza drugs introduced since the NA inhibitors in 1999, there is a strong unmet need for new antiinfluenza therapeutics, particularly ones that are broad-spectrum given the high genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza. Lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, have been proposed as potential antiviral agents due to their propensity to specifically bind the types of glycans present at high densities in glycoproteins on the surfaces of viruses. Indeed, influenza viruses are potential targets of lectins because they possess two major glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and NA, which mediate key steps of the viral life cycle, including attachment to sialic acid-containing cellular receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane (HA), assembly of new virus particles (HA and NA) (
