<p>Paralleling the reduced mitogenicity of H84T compared to WT BanLec that we previously demonstrated in vitro, systemic administration of H84T does not result in the robust inflammatory response seen after administration of the WT lectin, indicating that we have truly removed mitogenicity from H84T by substituting one specific amino acid for another. Mitogenicity has primarily been addressed as an in vitro concept, with studies examining mitogenicity of lectins in vivo focusing on local rather than systemic effects (

Lessening mitogenic activity of BanLec via the H84T mutation has removed a major hurdle in the development of an antiviral lectin for clinical use, since mitogenicity has been viewed as the biggest drawback for most lectins (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) showing that it is also safe when administered intranasally.
