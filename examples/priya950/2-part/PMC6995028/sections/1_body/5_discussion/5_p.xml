<p>H84T treatment, regardless of infection status, enlarges the LAMP1
 <sup>+</sup> compartment, consistent with the observation that many lectins are internalized by endocytosis and that some induce the formation of large lysosomes (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). H84T, and to a much lesser extent D133G, localize to the late endosome/lysosome. Although H84T is internalized into the endosomal compartment and enlarges it, the fact that fusion at the plasma membrane is inhibited by H84T (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), in addition to uncoating at the endosomal membrane, suggests that the antiinfluenza activity of H84T does not depend primarily on alteration of the endosomal compartment. Consistent with these observations, preconditioning of the endosomal compartment with H84T is not required for viral inhibition, since either cells or virus can be pretreated with H84T and the lectin is still highly active against uncoating. We therefore posit that binding of H84T to HA is important for the inhibitory effect of H84T. We propose a model in which H84T, internalized in both the presence and absence of virus, likely by endocytosis, accumulates in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where fusion occurs and is thus positioned at a key watch point to interact with HA and thereby prevent entry of virus into the cytoplasm. Since H84T disrupts fusion of the virus and prevents its release into the cytoplasm, it is reasonable to think that the virus might be degraded once it reaches the lysosome, accounting for the ability of H84T to decrease influenza virus replication overall.
