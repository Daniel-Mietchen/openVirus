<p content-type="flushleft">Due to their ability to bind to glycan structures, especially high-mannose preferentially expressed on the surface of pathogenic viruses, lectins have been considered as potential antiviral therapeutics (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In the case of influenza, cyanovirin-N (CV-N), surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and mannose-binding lectin are among the lectins shown to have activity in vitro or in vivo (

 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We have demonstrated that an engineered banana lectin, H84T BanLec, is highly active against an array of influenza virus strains. While it is somewhat difficult to compare the overall sensitivity of influenza viruses to the different lectins without head-to-head comparisons, H84T BanLec would appear to be similar in vitro and equal to, or perhaps better than most previously tested lectins (e.g., CV-N EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.005 to &gt;10 μg/mL against tested influenza virus strains). It is notable that H84T is quite broad-spectrum, capable of inhibiting multiple oseltamivir-resistant as well all other influenza virus strains tested in this and our previous study (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); H84T inhibits both influenza A and B type viruses and a representative of the currently circulating 3C.2a clade of H3N2 viruses, which proved especially deadly in the 2017 to 2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The finding that there is some synergy between H84T and oseltamivir raises the possibility of combination therapy, which might be more effective than single agents alone and limit the development of resistance.
