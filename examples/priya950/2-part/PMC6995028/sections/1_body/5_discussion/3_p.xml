<p>H84T delivered systemically by the intraperitoneal route possesses a long terminal half-life, indicating that infrequent or even single dosing could potentially be efficacious, which would be clinically advantageous. However, intravenous administration, which is largely analogous to intraperitoneal administration in the mouse, would not be ideal for all clinical situations (e.g., treating outpatients with influenza virus infections). Oral administration is not a feasible clinical strategy, as it is known that alimentary lectins do not effectively distribute to the blood (

Thus, H84T BanLec shows promise for use in both hospitalized patients and outpatients. It is notable that administration of H84T can be delayed for up to 72 h and still offer 80% protection by the intraperitoneal route and 50% protection by the subcutaneous route. People have antibodies against banana lectin (

It is worth pointing out that the class of antibody that people develop against bananas is IgG4 (
