<p content-type="flushleft">Influenza viruses pose a major threat to public health worldwide, causing both seasonal epidemics, which infect millions and kill ∼500,000 people annually, and pandemics, which are unpredictable and have the potential to kill millions, as was illustrated most recently in 2009 with the “swine flu” pandemic and most dramatically in 1918 with the emergence of the “Spanish flu” that resulted in 50 million deaths. Unfortunately, current prevention and treatment modalities, although helpful, suffer from distinct limitations and are at best only moderately effective. Although it clearly reduces both the number and severity of cases, vaccination is often underutilized and its effectiveness varies from year to year (
