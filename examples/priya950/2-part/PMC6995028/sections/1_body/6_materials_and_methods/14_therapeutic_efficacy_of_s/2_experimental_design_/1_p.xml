<p>For the intraperitoneal efficacy study, groups of 10 mice were treated by the intraperitoneal route, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>. Control groups included mice treated with 10 mg/kg/d oseltamivir twice daily for 5 d beginning 4, 24, 48, or 72 hpi, or treated with PBS as placebo (15 mice) twice daily for the first 5 d postinfection, then once daily for the next 3 d to match treatment beginning at 4 and 72 hpi. For the subcutaneous efficacy study, mice were treated by subcutaneous injection using a 50-mg/kg dose of H84T either once or twice within 4 d postinfection. A group of 10 mice was given oseltamivir by oral gavage twice daily for 5 d with 10 mg/kg of oseltamivir, starting 48 hpi. Control mice treated with PBS as placebo were dosed according to the same regimen as H84T. Further details are provided in
