<p>Virus was incubated with 0, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 nM H84T or with 10 μg/mL H17-L19 monoclonal antibody for 30 min at room temperature, after which the virus-H84T mixture was incubated with MDCK cells for 1 h at 4 °C, allowing only for attachment. Following three washes with cold virus growth buffer, cells were collected in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and whole-cell RNA extracted. To measure the relative amount of cell-associated virus normalized to 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> expression, qRT-PCR was performed using primers specific to influenza A 
 <italic>M1</italic> and to
