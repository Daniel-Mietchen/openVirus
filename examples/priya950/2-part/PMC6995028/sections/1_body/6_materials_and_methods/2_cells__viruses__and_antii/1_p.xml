<p>MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 Â°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Influenza virus infection was performed on monolayers of MDCK cells in virus growth buffer (DMEM supplemented with 0.187% BSA and 25 mM Hepes). Supernatant from 293T cells transfected with eight influenza gene plasmids was used to propagate A/WSN/33 (H1N1) on MDCK cells, as previously described (
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Recombinant virus containing HA and NA genes from A/Colorado/15/2014 (H3N2) and other genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was engineered by reverse genetics and propagated on MDCK-SIAT1 cells to limit adaptation and glycan changes. Additional strains and antiinfluenza antibodies are indicated in figure legends and in
