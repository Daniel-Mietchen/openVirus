<p>MDCK cells were plated in eight-well chamber slides, pretreated for 1 h with 0.05 to 10 μM H84T, 10 μM D133G, or 40 μM ARB, and infected at 37 °C with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1), A/Perth/2009 (H3N2), or A/Florida/2006 (H1N1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 in the presence of H84T, D133G, or ARB. Where indicated, virus alone (rather than cells) was pretreated with H84T, D133G, or ARB and uncoating examined. M1/LAMP1 colocalization studies were performed as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>. Spreading infections of B/Brisbane/60/2008 were performed following pretreatment, removal of excess virus following 1 h of incubation, and replacement of treatment-containing medium at MOI = 0.05 for 16 to 18 h. Infected cells were washed twice in virus growth buffer and once in PBS before fixation in 2% PFA/PBS. Immunofluoresence assays were then performed as described in
