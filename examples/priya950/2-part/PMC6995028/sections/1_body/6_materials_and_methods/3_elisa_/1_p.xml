<p>For ELISA, 96-well ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight with 100-ng recombinant H1 or H3 HA proteins from Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and Influenza A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), respectively, produced in baculovirus, for determination of H84T binding to HA. To determine whether human sera contained anti-H84T antibodies, 100 ng of H84T were used to coat plates. ELISA experiments were performed as described in
