<p>If fusion of influenza virus is inhibited by H84T, we reasoned that the next step in the virus life cycle would also be inhibited, namely uncoating of the viral ribonucleoproteins. With uncoating, the viral matrix protein (M1), which forms the scaffolding between the viral membrane and the viral ribonucleoproteins, dissociates from its prefusion location beneath the membrane and disperses throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. Detection of diffuse M1 by immunocytochemistry has thus been used at early infection time points (2.5 h, before protein translation leads to the production of more M1) to determine in which cells uncoating, and thus fusion immediately before it, has occurred (

 </xref>). As expected, the number of cells with diffuse M1 staining was significantly decreased by treatment with ARB. H84T also reduced the number of cells with diffuse M1 staining in a dose-responsive manner, indicating that H84T prevents events (such as fusion) that occur before (or at) uncoating of the virus (

 </xref>). Instead of diffuse M1 staining, virtually all of the ARB-treated infected cells and increasing numbers of infected cells treated with H84T in a dose-dependent manner exhibited perinuclear, punctate staining of M1 (

 </xref>), consistent with localization in the late endosome. The reduction in diffuse staining of M1 was observed both when the cells were pretreated with H84T and when only the virus was pretreated with H84T, suggesting that preconditioning of cells is not required for H84T to exert its antiinfluenza activity. We performed these studies with two more recently circulating strains, A/Florida/3/2006 (H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and again observed the same decrease in diffuse M1 staining and increase in perinuclear punctate M1 staining with H84T treatment (

 </ext-link>). These results suggest that H84T prevents exit of influenza viruses from the endosome. Indeed, colocalization between M1 in the M1
 <sup>+</sup> punctae and the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1 is high in H84T-treated cells as compared to untreated infected cells (
