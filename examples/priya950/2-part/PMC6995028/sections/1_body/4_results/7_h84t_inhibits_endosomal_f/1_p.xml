<p>Given that inhibition of attachment does not appear to be the major mechanism of action of H84T, we next investigated whether fusion is decreased by H84T (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Dequenching of the fluorescent membrane probe R18 from R18-labeled virus was measured in MDCK cells pretreated with the fusion inhibitor ARB, as a positive control, or H84T. When incorporated into the viral membrane at a high molarity, R18 quenches itself, but when fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane is induced by a low pH fusion buffer, R18 diffuses laterally across the much larger plasma membrane, becoming dequenched and fluorescing (

Labeled virus was allowed to attach to cells in the presence of ARB or H84T before the addition of fusion buffer, after which fluorescence dequenching was measured. In cells incubated with virus, fusion buffer alone increased fluorescence to levels near to those from Triton X-100–treated cells, indicating that fusion with the plasma membrane had occurred. Treatment with 40 μM ARB or 1 and 10 μM H84T significantly reduced fluorescence dequenching upon exposure to low pH, which suggests that H84T may act by inhibiting viral fusion.
