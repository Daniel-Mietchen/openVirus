<p>Since influenza B infections cannot be distinguished clinically from influenza A infections (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), antiinfluenza agents that have activity against both influenza A and B are particularly attractive for empiric treatment of influenza-like illnesses. We therefore sought to evaluate whether H84T is efficacious against influenza B virus infection. We found that H84T has EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations by neutral red assay of 0.15 and 0.33 μg/mL (∼4.8 and 11 nM) against influenza B viruses B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) and B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata lineage), respectively, and reduces spreading infection of B/Brisbane/60/2008 in MDCK cells (
