<p>Because H84T inhibits fusion between the virus and the endosomal membrane, we hypothesized that it might be internalized into the endosome in infected cells, but not in uninfected cells, via binding to HA. However, interestingly, H84T treatment alone increases the size of LAMP1
 <sup>+</sup> punctae in cells relative to untreated cells (

 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). As predicted, immunofluorescent staining for BanLec revealed that H84T is internalized into punctae that resemble late endosomes/lysosomes (

 </ext-link>) in both infected and uninfected cells; D133G is internalized into cells to a dramatically lesser extent. To examine whether H84T is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment in the absence of influenza virus infection, we next treated cells with His-tagged H84T or D133G and performed immunofluorescent staining for the His tag and LAMP1. Colocalization between the His tag and LAMP1 was high in H84T-treated cells (

 </ext-link>), indicating that H84T localizes to the late endosome/lysosome, whereas D133G-treated cells exhibited minimal His tag staining, consistent with the low degree of BanLec staining in D133G-treated cells (

 </ext-link>). In rare D133G-treated cells, His tag staining resembled that in H84T-treated cells and colocalization between the His tag and LAMP1 was high (

Given that both M1 and LAMP1, as well as H84T and LAMP1, colocalize to a high degree in H84T-treated cells, it is likely that H84T and the virus also colocalize in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, ideally positioning H84T for inhibition of fusion.
