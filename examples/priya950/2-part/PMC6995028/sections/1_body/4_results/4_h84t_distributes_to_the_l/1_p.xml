<p>We next determined the pharmacokinetic profile of H84T in mice dosed intraperitoneally with 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg of the lectin in a single injection by measuring the concentration of H84T postinjection in both the plasma and lung (

 </ext-link>). Total exposure levels (AUC
 <sub>last</sub>) of H84T in the lung, a key target organ for influenza treatment, exceed plasma levels significantly, but in a nonlinear fashion, with an ∼200-fold increase at 5 mg/kg, ∼100-fold at 15 mg/kg, and ∼30-fold at 50 mg/kg. Lower doses deliver a greater portion of H84T to the lung and might allow for minimizing systemic exposure if proven efficacious. Furthermore, H84T remains in the lung for greater than 72 h at the dose levels tested (

 </ext-link>). The long terminal half-life and prolonged presence of H84T in the lung raises the possibility that H84T could be administered as a single-dose treatment, or at least be given at long intervals. In a parallel assessment of the distribution of H84T, we found that H84T distributes to the lung, as well as the liver and spleen, but not to the brain or kidney in mice dosed intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg of H84T (
