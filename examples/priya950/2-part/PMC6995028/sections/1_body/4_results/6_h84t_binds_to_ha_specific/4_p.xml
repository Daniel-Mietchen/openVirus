<p>We next sought to further delineate the step at which H84T inhibits influenza virus replication, hypothesizing that H84T would inhibit influenza virus at the attachment or fusion steps, since we previously found that those (especially the former) are the steps at which WT BanLec inhibits HIV infection (

To investigate whether attachment was decreased by H84T, we infected MDCK cells for 1 h at 4 Â°C with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) that had been preincubated for 30 min with concentrations of H84T from 1 to 10,000 nM, the timing and temperature allowing the virus only to attach but not progress to postattachment steps. After washing cells to remove excess virus, we collected the cells and extracted whole-cell RNA. We then measured the amount of cell-associated virus, which represents the amount of virus that has undergone attachment, by qRT-PCR. We observed that cells infected with virus that had been preincubated with H84T showed a minor decrease in the amount of cell-associated virus, to a much lesser extent than did cells infected with virus that had been preincubated with the monoclonal antibody H17-L19, known to inhibit attachment of this strain (
