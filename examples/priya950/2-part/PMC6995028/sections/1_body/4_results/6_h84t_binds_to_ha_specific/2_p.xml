<p>The above experiments suggested that H84T does indeed bind to HA, but given the differences between insect and mammalian glycosylation, we sought to determine whether H84T could also bind to viral-derived HA produced in mammalian cells, and furthermore, to which subunits it might bind. Influenza HA is comprised of two subunits; HA0 is the full-length peptide that, upon activation of the virus by cellular proteases, is cleaved into HA1, which forms the head group, and HA2, which forms most of the stalk. We performed lectin blot analysis with viral lysates from three strains (A/Florida/3/2006 [H1N1], A/Perth/16/2009 [H3N2], and B/Brisbane/60/2008) produced in chicken egg culture (

Lectin blot analysis is similar to Western blot analysis, except that blots are probed first with lectins, after which primary and secondary antibodies are directed against the lectins in order to determine with which blotted proteins a particular lectin interacts. Viral proteins from the lysates were incubated overnight with either PNGase F, a bacterial enzyme that cleaves all 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans from glycoproteins, or PBS (mock), after which the lysates were resolved by reducing SDS/PAGE and blotted. Blots were then probed with H84T prior to antibody detection of BanLec (

In contrast, when the proteins were incubated with PNGase F, the proteins migrated faster, demonstrating that deglycosylation had occurred, and there was a marked reduction of H84T binding to HA0 and HA1, indicating that H84T binding to HA is carbohydrate-dependent. The percentage of binding of H84T to HA1 in the PNGase F- versus mock-treated group for each strain was calculated by comparing band intensity, with mock-treated set at 100% (

 </xref>). Not all binding was abolished, likely due to incomplete deglycosylation by PNGase F, although some lectins are also known to interact with molecules in a nonglycan-mediated manner (
