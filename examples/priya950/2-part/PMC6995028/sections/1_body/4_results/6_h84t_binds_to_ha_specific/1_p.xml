<p>A detailed mechanistic understanding of H84T’s ability to inhibit influenza replication is key to developing it as a potential new therapeutic (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). H84T is known to bind to high-mannose structures and perhaps other types of 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans such as can be found on the influenza virus glycoproteins HA and NA. To ascertain whether H84T interacts with HA, we performed ELISAs using recombinant HA from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) derived from baculovirus, with the D133G BanLec mutant as a control, as it does not bind carbohydrates. Insect-derived glycoproteins are glycosylated in a distinct manner as compared to mammalian glycoproteins, in that they lack high-mannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans and instead contain paucimannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, it should be noted that high-mannose and paucimannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans are structurally similar, with paucimannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans containing terminal mannose residues like high-mannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans, although fewer of them. Furthermore, BanLec is known to interact with paucimannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), although not as strongly as with high-mannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans. Therefore, we reasoned that determining whether H84T could bind to baculovirus-derived HA would be an informative first step. We observed that H84T binds HA in a concentration-dependent manner, and D133G shows much reduced binding to HA (

 </ext-link>), which suggests that H84T could potentially inhibit HA-mediated steps and that carbohydrate binding activity is important for binding to HA. To further assess whether binding to HA was dependent on carbohydrate binding, we performed a series of competition ELISAs with several different carbohydrates. The known H84T ligand methyl α-
 <sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside was able to inhibit binding of H84T to HA in a concentration-dependent manner (

  <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9

 </ext-link>). Unsurprisingly, it took a relatively large concentration of the sugar to compete for HA binding since there are predicted to be a large number of interaction sites for H84T on the HA glycans (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A higher concentration of the sugar was required to inhibit binding to H3 than to H1 HA. The binding to HA was specific, since galactose, known to not be a ligand for H84T (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), was not able to inhibit binding to HA (

 <sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), was able to inhibit binding to HA at 10-fold lower concentrations (
