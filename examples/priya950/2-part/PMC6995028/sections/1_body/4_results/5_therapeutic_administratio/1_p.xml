<p>To assess the therapeutic potential of H84T delivered systemically, we inoculated BALB/c mice intranasally with a lethal dose of influenza and treated them with H84T delivered intraperitoneally once daily for 5 d beginning 4 h postinoculation (

 </xref>). All mice treated with H84T at 5 mg/kg once daily survived, as compared to &lt;10% of placebo-treated animals. Furthermore, mice treated at 5 mg/kg once daily up to 24 h postchallenge all survived, as compared to âˆ¼90% treated with oseltamivir twice daily and &lt;20% treated with PBS. Strikingly, 80% of mice were still protected when treatment began 48 or 72 h postchallenge (

 </ext-link>). However, even mice with anti-H84T antibodies generated at a time of prior H84T administration are 100% protected from lethal influenza infection by H84T treatment (
