We show that a molecularly engineered banana lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) has broad-spectrum activity against all influenza strains tested, including drug-resistant and currently circulating strains; is safe upon repeated administration in mice; and, moreover, is efficacious at treating lethal influenza infection via clinically pertinent routes of administration. We demonstrate that the lectin binds to the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein and exerts its primary antiviral effect via inhibition of an early stage of the viral life cycle, viral membrane fusion to the host endosomal membrane. Our findings indicate that this engineered lectin, which has a mechanism of action quite distinct from the presently available agents, has potential as an antiinfluenza agent.</p></abstract><abstract><p>There is a strong need for a new broad-spectrum antiinfluenza therapeutic, as vaccination and existing treatments are only moderately effective. We previously engineered a lectin, H84T banana lectin (H84T), to retain broad-spectrum activity against multiple influenza strains, including pandemic and avian, while largely eliminating the potentially harmful mitogenicity of the parent compound. The amino acid mutation at position 84 from histidine to threonine minimizes the mitogenicity of the wild-type lectin while maintaining antiinfluenza activity in vitro. We now report that in a lethal mouse model H84T is indeed nonmitogenic, and both early and delayed therapeutic administration of H84T intraperitoneally are highly protective, as is H84T administered subcutaneously. Mechanistically, attachment, which we anticipated to be inhibited by H84T, was only somewhat decreased by the lectin. Instead, H84T is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and inhibits virus&#x02013;endosome fusion. These studies reveal that H84T is efficacious against influenza virus in vivo, and that the loss of mitogenicity seen previously in tissue culture is also seen in vivo, underscoring the potential utility of H84T as a broad-spectrum antiinfluenza agent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>lectin</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">DOD | Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000774</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">HDTRA1-15-1-0067</award-id><principal-award-recipient>David Markovitz</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">T32 GM07863</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Evelyn M Cov&#x000e9;s-Datson</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">T32 AI007528</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Evelyn M Cov&#x000e9;s-Datson</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">1F31AI136615-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Evelyn M Cov&#x000e9;s-Datson</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5">University of Michigan (U-M)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100007270</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">Michigan Translational Research and Commercialization (MTRAC) Life Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient>David Markovitz</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Influenza viruses pose a major threat to public health worldwide, causing both seasonal epidemics, which infect millions and kill &#x0223c;500,000 people annually, and pandemics, which are unpredictable and have the potential to kill millions, as was illustrated most recently in 2009 with the &#x0201c;swine flu&#x0201d; pandemic and most dramatically in 1918 with the emergence of the &#x0201c;Spanish flu&#x0201d; that resulted in 50 million deaths. Unfortunately, current prevention and treatment modalities, although helpful, suffer from distinct limitations and are at best only moderately effective. Although it clearly reduces both the number and severity of cases, vaccination is often underutilized and its effectiveness varies from year to year (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Effectiveness was estimated in the 2017 to 2018 United States season to be only &#x0223c;25% against influenza A subtype H3N2 viruses, which comprised &#x0223c;69% of infections (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>At present, although there are a number of antiinfluenza agents currently in phase II or III clinical trials (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), only three classes of drugs are approved to treat influenza virus infection in the United States: Adamantanes, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, and as of October 2018, a new class with the sole member baloxavir marboxil, a cap-dependent endonuclease protein inhibitor (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Adamantanes are obsolete in practice due to overwhelmingly high levels of resistance to them among circulating influenza A strains and due to their intrinsic inactivity against influenza B strains. The current standard of care treatment is oseltamivir, a member of the NA inhibitor class. Oseltamivir is associated with a moderate decrease in mortality among adults hospitalized for influenza, but it must be initiated within 48 h of illness onset to be effective and only shortens the duration of symptoms by about 1 d in otherwise healthy adults (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although oseltamivir resistance among circulating strains has generally been low since the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1, resistance does occur and can be high in certain seasons (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>With the twin threats of another influenza pandemic and emergence of antiviral resistance ever present and a paucity of new classes of antiinfluenza drugs introduced since the NA inhibitors in 1999, there is a strong unmet need for new antiinfluenza therapeutics, particularly ones that are broad-spectrum given the high genetic and antigenic diversity of influenza. Lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, have been proposed as potential antiviral agents due to their propensity to specifically bind the types of glycans present at high densities in glycoproteins on the surfaces of viruses. Indeed, influenza viruses are potential targets of lectins because they possess two major glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and NA, which mediate key steps of the viral life cycle, including attachment to sialic acid-containing cellular receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane (HA), assembly of new virus particles (HA and NA) (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and release of virus particles by cleavage of sialic acid residues (NA). However, the development of lectins for clinical use has been limited by their mitogenicity and hence potential for inflammatory side effects (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that mitogenicity can be removed from a banana lectin (BanLec), while maintaining broad-spectrum antiviral activity, by engineering a single amino acid mutation at position 84 from histidine to threonine (H84T BanLec, H84T) (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). H84T is highly efficacious against pandemic, epidemic, and avian influenza in vitro and against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo when administered intranasally, yet its safety and efficacy via other clinically important routes of administration remain to be determined. In addition, although H84T is known to bind high-mannose type <italic>N</italic>-glycans, these glycans are abundantly present on both HA and NA (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and thus it is not clear whether HA or NA is the key viral component antagonized by H84T. We therefore set out to determine the efficacy of systemically and subcutaneously delivered H84T, as well as the mechanism of action of H84T. Here, we report that in a lethal mouse model, H84T is indeed nonmitogenic as predicted by the in vitro data, and both early and delayed therapeutic administration of H84T intraperitoneally are highly protective, as is H84T administered subcutaneously. Mechanistically, attachment is only somewhat inhibited by H84T, incommensurate with the overall inhibitory effect of H84T, which was unexpected based on our observation that wild-type (WT) BanLec inhibits HIV attachment to cells. Instead, H84T, which can bind to HA, is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and inhibits the HA-mediated step of fusion with the endosome. Taken together, these studies reveal that H84T is efficacious against influenza virus in vivo, even when given up to 72 h after challenge, and that it inhibits virus&#x02013;endosome fusion, underscoring its potential use as a new broad-spectrum antiinfluenza agent with a mechanism of action that is quite distinct from that of the currently available inhibitors.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>H84T Is Active Against Oseltamivir-Resistant and Influenza B Viruses and Synergizes with Oseltamivir In Vitro.</title><p>Our previous work demonstrates that H84T has robust activity against diverse influenza viruses in vitro, including A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/New York/18/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), A/Duck/MN/1525/1981 (H5N1), and the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain, with half-maximum effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of 1 to 4 &#x003bc;g/mL (&#x0223c;32 to 130 nM) versus H1N1 virus, 0.06 to 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL (&#x0223c;2 to 3 nM) versus H3N2 virus, and 5 to 11 &#x003bc;g/mL (&#x0223c;160 to 350 nM) versus H5N1 virus (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Antiinfluenza activity is dependent on carbohydrate binding, as the D133G BanLec mutant lacking carbohydrate-binding activity has no antiinfluenza activity. Because influenza strains resistant to the standard-of-care therapy, oseltamivir, do circulate in certain years (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we sought to evaluate whether H84T is effective against oseltamivir-resistant viruses. Indeed, H84T inhibited replication of A/Mississippi/3/2001-H275Y (H1N1), a strain reported to be oseltamivir-resistant (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, with an EC<sub>90</sub> value of 0.074 &#x003bc;g/mL (2.4 nM), as compared to &#x0003e;100 &#x003bc;g/mL for oseltamivir. H84T treatment also decreased spreading infection of two other oseltamivir-resistant viruses in tissue culture, A/Texas/12/2007 (H3N2) and A/Louisiana/08/2013 (H1N1)pdm09 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>), in which NA inhibitor resistance is conferred by the E119V and H275Y mutations, respectively, and adamantane resistance conferred by the S31N mutation (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, H84T is highly effective even against oseltamivir- and adamantane-resistant strains.</p><p>As combination therapy with both oseltamivir and H84T could be a potential strategy to treat oseltamivir-susceptible strains, we sought to determine whether synergy exists between oseltamivir and H84T. Treatment of MDCK cells infected with A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), A/Duck/MN/1525/1981 (H5N1), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 with both oseltamivir and H84T resulted in a virus yield reduction that exceeded one log<sub>10</sub> when compared to either individual drug alone, identifying possible synergy between oseltamivir and H84T for all four viruses tested (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Tables S1&#x02013;S4</ext-link>). We further examined the effect of the drug combination using 3D analysis (MacSynergy II) (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and found that the combination of oseltamivir and H84T has minor but significant synergy against both A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S2 and S3</ext-link>). Thus, H84T shows some, but not striking, synergy with oseltamivir.</p><p>Since influenza B infections cannot be distinguished clinically from influenza A infections (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), antiinfluenza agents that have activity against both influenza A and B are particularly attractive for empiric treatment of influenza-like illnesses. We therefore sought to evaluate whether H84T is efficacious against influenza B virus infection. We found that H84T has EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations by neutral red assay of 0.15 and 0.33 &#x003bc;g/mL (&#x0223c;4.8 and 11 nM) against influenza B viruses B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) and B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata lineage), respectively, and reduces spreading infection of B/Brisbane/60/2008 in MDCK cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4</ext-link>), indicating that H84T is indeed active against influenza B viruses and has promise as an antiinfluenza A and B agent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Intranasal Administration of H84T Protects Against Lethal H3N2 Influenza Virus Infection.</title><p>We previously reported that intranasal administration of H84T protects mice against otherwise lethal H1N1 influenza virus infection (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To assess whether H84T is also efficacious against another influenza virus strain in vivo, we inoculated C57BL/6J mice via aerosol with a lethal dose of A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (H3N2) influenza virus and treated them with 0.1 mg/kg of H84T intranasally once daily for 5 d beginning 4 h postinfection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5</ext-link>). Greater than 80% of H84T-treated mice survived otherwise lethal influenza virus infection, as compared to &#x0003c;10% of placebo-treated animals, extending the results of our previous study and indicating that H84T has robust activity against the two major contemporary subtypes of influenza A in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>H84T, but Not WT BanLec, Is Well-Tolerated In Vivo.</title><p>Given that H84T is highly efficacious against influenza infection in vitro and in vivo via intranasal administration, we sought to further characterize its safety and efficacy in vivo when administered systemically. In BALB/c mice, we found that intraperitoneal administration of WT BanLec in two 50-mg/kg doses 1 mo apart resulted in prolonged injection site lesions, characterized as erythematous papules up to a centimeter in size, in 60% of the mice lasting for up to 23 d postinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>); piloerection of back hair for up to 4 d postinjection in all of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>); and reversible but notable weight loss of an average of &#x0223c;10% of body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). These findings support in vivo the in vitro finding that WT BanLec is mitogenic and give a stark description of how mitogenicity manifests in vivo. In clear contrast, intraperitoneal administration of H84T was very well tolerated, resulting in no injection site lesions, no piloerection of back hair, and no weight loss upon administration of either dose, similar to administration of D133G BanLec, which in vitro lacks both mitogenicity and antiviral activity due to a mutation in the carbohydrate-binding site and so was not expected to elicit an inflammatory reaction. Thus, H84T appears to be nonmitogenic both in vitro and in vivo, in contrast to WT BanLec, which is poorly tolerated in mice, consistent with its mitogenicity in vitro.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Systemic H84T is very well tolerated in mice.

H84T is known to bind to high-mannose structures and perhaps other types of <italic>N</italic>-glycans such as can be found on the influenza virus glycoproteins HA and NA. To ascertain whether H84T interacts with HA, we performed ELISAs using recombinant HA from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) derived from baculovirus, with the D133G BanLec mutant as a control, as it does not bind carbohydrates. Insect-derived glycoproteins are glycosylated in a distinct manner as compared to mammalian glycoproteins, in that they lack high-mannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans and instead contain paucimannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, it should be noted that high-mannose and paucimannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans are structurally similar, with paucimannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans containing terminal mannose residues like high-mannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans, although fewer of them. Furthermore, BanLec is known to interact with paucimannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), although not as strongly as with high-mannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans. Therefore, we reasoned that determining whether H84T could bind to baculovirus-derived HA would be an informative first step. We observed that H84T binds HA in a concentration-dependent manner, and D133G shows much reduced binding to HA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), which suggests that H84T could potentially inhibit HA-mediated steps and that carbohydrate binding activity is important for binding to HA. To further assess whether binding to HA was dependent on carbohydrate binding, we performed a series of competition ELISAs with several different carbohydrates. The known H84T ligand methyl &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside was able to inhibit binding of H84T to HA in a concentration-dependent manner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Unsurprisingly, it took a relatively large concentration of the sugar to compete for HA binding since there are predicted to be a large number of interaction sites for H84T on the HA glycans (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A higher concentration of the sugar was required to inhibit binding to H3 than to H1 HA.

Yeast mannan, which contains more mannose residues than does methyl &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), was able to inhibit binding to HA at 10-fold lower concentrations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10</ext-link>).</p><p>The above experiments suggested that H84T does indeed bind to HA, but given the differences between insect and mammalian glycosylation, we sought to determine whether H84T could also bind to viral-derived HA produced in mammalian cells, and furthermore, to which subunits it might bind. Influenza HA is comprised of two subunits; HA0 is the full-length peptide that, upon activation of the virus by cellular proteases, is cleaved into HA1, which forms the head group, and HA2, which forms most of the stalk. We performed lectin blot analysis with viral lysates from three strains (A/Florida/3/2006 [H1N1], A/Perth/16/2009 [H3N2], and B/Brisbane/60/2008) produced in chicken egg culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Lectin blot analysis is similar to Western blot analysis, except that blots are probed first with lectins, after which primary and secondary antibodies are directed against the lectins in order to determine with which blotted proteins a particular lectin interacts. Viral proteins from the lysates were incubated overnight with either PNGase F, a bacterial enzyme that cleaves all <italic>N</italic>-glycans from glycoproteins, or PBS (mock), after which the lysates were resolved by reducing SDS/PAGE and blotted. Blots were then probed with H84T prior to antibody detection of BanLec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S11</ext-link>). When the proteins were incubated with PBS, H84T bound to both HA0 and HA1 in all three strains, but did not appear to bind to HA2 in any of the strains. In contrast, when the proteins were incubated with PNGase F, the proteins migrated faster, demonstrating that deglycosylation had occurred, and there was a marked reduction of H84T binding to HA0 and HA1, indicating that H84T binding to HA is carbohydrate-dependent. The percentage of binding of H84T to HA1 in the PNGase F- versus mock-treated group for each strain was calculated by comparing band intensity, with mock-treated set at 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Not all binding was abolished, likely due to incomplete deglycosylation by PNGase F, although some lectins are also known to interact with molecules in a nonglycan-mediated manner (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). D133G showed dramatically less binding than did H84T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), underscoring that the ability to bind carbohydrates is important for binding to HA.</p><fig id="fig03" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>H84T binds to virus-derived HA.

Instead of diffuse M1 staining, virtually all of the ARB-treated infected cells and increasing numbers of infected cells treated with H84T in a dose-dependent manner exhibited perinuclear, punctate staining of M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), consistent with localization in the late endosome. The reduction in diffuse staining of M1 was observed both when the cells were pretreated with H84T and when only the virus was pretreated with H84T, suggesting that preconditioning of cells is not required for H84T to exert its antiinfluenza activity. We performed these studies with two more recently circulating strains, A/Florida/3/2006 (H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and again observed the same decrease in diffuse M1 staining and increase in perinuclear punctate M1 staining with H84T treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S14</ext-link>). These results suggest that H84T prevents exit of influenza viruses from the endosome. Indeed, colocalization between M1 in the M1<sup>+</sup> punctae and the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1 is high in H84T-treated cells as compared to untreated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>).

To examine whether H84T is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment in the absence of influenza virus infection, we next treated cells with His-tagged H84T or D133G and performed immunofluorescent staining for the His tag and LAMP1. Colocalization between the His tag and LAMP1 was high in H84T-treated cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S17</ext-link>), indicating that H84T localizes to the late endosome/lysosome, whereas D133G-treated cells exhibited minimal His tag staining, consistent with the low degree of BanLec staining in D133G-treated cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S16</ext-link>).

Given that both M1 and LAMP1, as well as H84T and LAMP1, colocalize to a high degree in H84T-treated cells, it is likely that H84T and the virus also colocalize in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, ideally positioning H84T for inhibition of fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s10"><title>Discussion</title><p content-type="flushleft">Due to their ability to bind to glycan structures, especially high-mannose preferentially expressed on the surface of pathogenic viruses, lectins have been considered as potential antiviral therapeutics (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In the case of influenza, cyanovirin-N (CV-N), surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and mannose-binding lectin are among the lectins shown to have activity in vitro or in vivo (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We have demonstrated that an engineered banana lectin, H84T BanLec, is highly active against an array of influenza virus strains. While it is somewhat difficult to compare the overall sensitivity of influenza viruses to the different lectins without head-to-head comparisons, H84T BanLec would appear to be similar in vitro and equal to, or perhaps better than most previously tested lectins (e.g., CV-N EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.005 to &#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;g/mL against tested influenza virus strains). It is notable that H84T is quite broad-spectrum, capable of inhibiting multiple oseltamivir-resistant as well all other influenza virus strains tested in this and our previous study (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); H84T inhibits both influenza A and B type viruses and a representative of the currently circulating 3C.2a clade of H3N2 viruses, which proved especially deadly in the 2017 to 2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The finding that there is some synergy between H84T and oseltamivir raises the possibility of combination therapy, which might be more effective than single agents alone and limit the development of resistance.</p><p>Paralleling the reduced mitogenicity of H84T compared to WT BanLec that we previously demonstrated in vitro, systemic administration of H84T does not result in the robust inflammatory response seen after administration of the WT lectin, indicating that we have truly removed mitogenicity from H84T by substituting one specific amino acid for another. Mitogenicity has primarily been addressed as an in vitro concept, with studies examining mitogenicity of lectins in vivo focusing on local rather than systemic effects (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, through our study, we have been able to characterize in vivo the effects of a systemically delivered mitogenic versus nonmitogenic lectin. Lessening mitogenic activity of BanLec via the H84T mutation has removed a major hurdle in the development of an antiviral lectin for clinical use, since mitogenicity has been viewed as the biggest drawback for most lectins (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, we have shown that H84T BanLec is very safe when delivered by the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes, with this and our previous study (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) showing that it is also safe when administered intranasally.</p><p>H84T delivered systemically by the intraperitoneal route possesses a long terminal half-life, indicating that infrequent or even single dosing could potentially be efficacious, which would be clinically advantageous. However, intravenous administration, which is largely analogous to intraperitoneal administration in the mouse, would not be ideal for all clinical situations (e.g., treating outpatients with influenza virus infections). Oral administration is not a feasible clinical strategy, as it is known that alimentary lectins do not effectively distribute to the blood (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), but as we have shown, subcutaneous and intranasal administration are efficacious and have potential as eventual treatments in the outpatient setting. Thus, H84T BanLec shows promise for use in both hospitalized patients and outpatients. It is notable that administration of H84T can be delayed for up to 72 h and still offer 80% protection by the intraperitoneal route and 50% protection by the subcutaneous route. People have antibodies against banana lectin (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which means that they would potentially develop or already possess antibodies against H84T, but this is not expected to limit activity given that the efficacy of H84T against influenza infection was not lessened in mice with anti-H84T antibodies. It is worth pointing out that the class of antibody that people develop against bananas is IgG4 (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which is widely thought to be tolerogenic and so potentially less likely to disrupt therapeutic efficacy of H84T. Of course, whether humans develop therapeutically limiting antibodies to H84T would ultimately need to be determined in humans.</p><p>Our work indicates that H84T binds to HA specifically, as binding to baculovirus-derived HA can be inhibited by a known ligand of BanLec but not by a noninteracting monosaccharide and as carbohydrate digestion by PNGase F reduces binding to virus-derived HA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that H84T functions as an antiinfluenza agent primarily via fusion inhibition. Carbohydrate binding is essential for both binding and fusion inhibition, as the carbohydrate binding site mutant D133G does not bind as efficiently and is not inhibitory to fusion. A key question to address was where HA might be bound by H84T, as both its head (HA1) and stalk (HA2) regions are glycosylated with high-mannose type <italic>N</italic>-glycans (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), among other glycans, which are ligands for H84T. Neutralizing antibodies that function as fusion inhibitors typically bind the stalk of HA (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), which contains the fusion peptide and other components necessary for fusion (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, work by others indicates that an inhibitor that binds to the head of HA can target fusion (<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and it is known that the antiinfluenza lectin cyanovirin-N binds HA1 (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), so it was not wholly unexpected that H84T would bind HA1. A potential limitation of H84T is that it may require that its target be glycosylated and pandemic strains are sometimes less heavily glycosylated than seasonal strains, but some glycosylation is virtually always present, even in pandemic strains (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, the number of glycosites that a certain strain possesses seems to correlate with the EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of H84T against that strain. Contemporary H3 viruses have more glycosites than contemporary H1 viruses (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and H84T has a lower EC<sub>50</sub> concentration against the former strains, which correlates with the higher amount of methyl &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside needed to compete for binding to H3 versus H1 HA. In addition, the amount of binding to strains as determined by lectin blot generally correlated with the EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of H84T against those strains, with the most binding to the H3N2 strain, followed by binding to influenza B, then the H1N1 strain. Of course, multiple other strains of each subtype would need to be evaluated to further clarify this issue. It is presently not possible to assess whether binding of H84T correlates with the number of high-mannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans in particular on certain HA molecules, as the number of high-mannose glycans on specific HAs cannot be predicted by the sequence of the protein and has to be empirically determined (<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), but overall it appears that binding to HA by H84T correlates with the number of glycans on HA.</p><p>H84T treatment, regardless of infection status, enlarges the LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartment, consistent with the observation that many lectins are internalized by endocytosis and that some induce the formation of large lysosomes (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). H84T, and to a much lesser extent D133G, localize to the late endosome/lysosome. Although H84T is internalized into the endosomal compartment and enlarges it, the fact that fusion at the plasma membrane is inhibited by H84T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), in addition to uncoating at the endosomal membrane, suggests that the antiinfluenza activity of H84T does not depend primarily on alteration of the endosomal compartment. Consistent with these observations, preconditioning of the endosomal compartment with H84T is not required for viral inhibition, since either cells or virus can be pretreated with H84T and the lectin is still highly active against uncoating. We therefore posit that binding of H84T to HA is important for the inhibitory effect of H84T. We propose a model in which H84T, internalized in both the presence and absence of virus, likely by endocytosis, accumulates in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where fusion occurs and is thus positioned at a key watch point to interact with HA and thereby prevent entry of virus into the cytoplasm. Since H84T disrupts fusion of the virus and prevents its release into the cytoplasm, it is reasonable to think that the virus might be degraded once it reaches the lysosome, accounting for the ability of H84T to decrease influenza virus replication overall.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that H84T BanLec has potential as a new antiviral against influenza viruses. It is very well tolerated and nonmitogenic in vivo and is highly efficacious against otherwise lethal influenza virus infection via three distinct routes of administration, even when treatment is delayed. H84T is highly broad-spectrum in that it inhibits replication of all oseltamivir-resistant and -sensitive strains and all influenza A and B strains tested, highlighting its promise as an empiric drug for influenza illness, which will be critically needed in the event of a new pandemic influenza virus or increasing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. H84T is broad-spectrum not only in its antiinfluenza activity, but also in the sense that it inhibits HIV and hepatitis C virus as reported previously (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and Ebola (<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), among other viruses. The present study, along with our previous work, underscores the value of engineering antiviral lectins to be nonmitogenic and safe in vivo, as H84T and perhaps eventually other similarly engineered lectins could be leveraged as a therapeutic arsenal against a diverse array of viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>H84T and D133G BanLec Purification.</title><p>Recombinant His-tagged H84T and D133G were prepared from <italic>Eschrichia coli</italic> as previously described (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), except that non&#x02013;His-tagged H84T, which was used in experiments unless otherwise stated, was prepared using a Sephadex G-75 column instead of a Ni-NTA agarose column, as described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1915152117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Cells, Viruses, and Antiinfluenza Antibodies.</title><p>MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 &#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
