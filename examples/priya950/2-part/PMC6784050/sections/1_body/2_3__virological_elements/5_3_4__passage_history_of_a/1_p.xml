<p>Perhaps the most critical point to consider in the design of vector competence experiments from a virological perspective is the passage history of the arbovirus in question. It is well-documented that repeated cell culture or animal passage of a virus can dramatically alter its phenotype [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. While this phenomenon has not been directly tested for ZIKV (i.e., identical strains with differing passages being subsequently analyzed for vector competence), the initial description of ZIKV from the late 1940s utilized multiple mouse brain passages, which adapted ZIKV from merely sickening the animals to producing neurologic symptoms and lethality following 17 mouse brain passages [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A more direct correlate of passage history with mosquito infectivity was demonstrated via the comparative analysis of four ZIKV strains (MR766, ZIKV-PR, ZIKV-FLR (Columbia, 2015), and ZIKV-PAN (Panama, 2015)) that had been amplified on either Vero or C6/36 cells. Utilizing multi-step replication kinetics, all four viruses reached peak titers more quickly when the virus used was derived from the same cells used for infection (mammalian versus C6/36 mosquito cells) [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], suggesting a potential trade-off in fitness for mammalian versus arthropod hosts. In another study, in-depth analysis of ZIKV-PR provided even more evidence supporting the major effect of passage history; two nonsynonymous mutations (E-V330L and NS1-W98G) were identified in Vero passage 3 viral stocks as well as ZIKV FLIC
 <sup>PR</sup> that were not present in the original patient’s serum [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. These mutations were associated with the attenuation of ZIKV infection of AG129 (mice lacking receptors for α/β/γ interferons), with the E-330L mutation alone significantly increasing median survival time and causing reduced weight loss compared to the re-engineered wild-type virus (E-330V/NS1-98W). Follow-up analysis via competition assay in Vero cells where wild type (E-330V/NS1-98W) was mixed in a 10:1 ratio with either the single (E-330L/NS1-98W) or double mutant (E-330L/NS1-98G) demonstrated that the single mutant and wild type persisted through three cell culture passages, while the double mutant began to outcompete the wild type by the third passage [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Examples from DENV, SLEV, WNV, and VEEV arboviruses also support a major role for passage history in the outcome of vector competence evaluations. Both a sylvatic (P8-1407) and endemic (IQT-1950) strain of DENV-2 that underwent 10 passages in a human liver cell line (Huh7), or in C6/36 mosquito cells, or that underwent alternating passages between these two cells showed adaption to the cell line used for passage with decreased fitness in the bypassed cell line, compared to the parental virus. In contrast, alternately passaged viruses demonstrated either fitness gains in both cell lines [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Work on SLEV and WNV utilized serial passages in C6/36 mosquito cells that bypassed an avian cell line (chicken embryonic fibroblasts; DF-1), found both viruses demonstrated enhanced replication in C6/36 cells, following serial passage in that cell line when compared to unpassaged virus, with no significant differences observed in kinetics on DF-1 cells for either virus [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The use of competition assay to determine relative fitness supported these results, as both viruses demonstrated increases in C6/36 replication following serial passage, although in this modality, C6/36-passaged viruses also demonstrated some decreases in fitness in the bypassed DF-1 cells [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similar work conducted on VEEV (ID and IC serotypes) utilized an in vivo passaging strategy (mammalian: mouse or hamster, arthropod: 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes) with fitness losses and gains determined via mosquito infectivity and mammalian viremia. Unsurprisingly, p10 viruses that passaged exclusively in mosquitoes demonstrated decreased viremias in their respective mammalian host when compared to the parental virus, while simultaneously increasing in mosquito infectivity. Reciprocally, p10 viruses passaged solely in mammals demonstrated increased peak viremias while decreasing in mosquito infectivity. Both ID and IC viruses, when passaged alternately between mammalian host and mosquito vector, exhibited no significant increases or decreases in fitness in either system when compared to parental viruses [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, it is quite clear that in an ideal setting, investigators should strive to utilize viral strains with minimal cell culture passages, or perhaps avoid those passaged multiple times on a single cell line; alternating vertebrate and insect cells may be a good compromise. In the case of vector competence work conducted in the context of ZIKV for example, the use of the MR766 prototype strain (which underwent over 140 suckling mouse brain passages [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]) may not be entirely appropriate to use to draw conclusions about more contemporary strains with a shorter passage history.
