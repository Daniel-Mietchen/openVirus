<p>In addition to the role of the virus strain/genotype, some consideration toward experimental bloodmeal preparation is warranted. Although these considerations will be discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-viruses-11-00867">Section 5</xref>, Experimental Elements, the use of freshly harvested versus frozen virus will be discussed here, given the underlying principals are physical characteristics of the virion proper. In the case of ZIKV, the effect of frozen virus in the preparation of infectious bloodmeals has been demonstrated in two separate analyses to reduce the infectivity of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Specifically, long-term freezing (defined as viral stocks frozen for greater than one week) of ZIKV PRVABC59 (human isolate, Puerto Rico, 2015, hereafter referred to as ZIKV-PR) was found to infect 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rico, Mexico, F11–13) less efficiently as assayed 7 and 14 days post-oral exposure compared to freshly harvested virus, or virus that was frozen for only 4 hours prior to use in bloodmeal preparation as determined by a cell culture-based infectious assay. The 7 days post-oral exposure time point also demonstrated that even a short-term freeze adversely affected the ability of ZIKV to disseminate compared to fresh virus, although this phenotype was not seen 14 days post-oral exposure [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This effect of freezing was independently verified in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from La Plata, Argentina (F7–F8), in which a freshly cell culture-harvested ZIKV-PR at a titer of ≈9.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL was found to infect (96% versus 16%), disseminate (88% versus 0%), and transmit (52% versus 0%) more efficiently than the same stock after freezing [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mosquito assays. This phenomenon is not limited to ZIKV; previous work on a YFV isolate from a human patient in Peru (1899/81) was utilized to orally infect 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Rexville, Puerto Rico. Virus was propagated in BHK-21 cells, clarified, and either frozen at −70 °C or held at 4 °C. Frozen stocks were thawed and diluted alongside fresh virus to encompass a range of titers (≈5, 6, and 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL); then, they were mixed with washed human erythrocytes, and engorged mosquitoes were incubated for 12 days prior to immunofluorescence assays. At each tested titer, both infection (96% versus 63%; 44% versus 15%; 17% versus 0% at 7, 6, and 5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively) and dissemination (52% versus 20%; 28% versus 2%; and 8% versus 0% at 7, 6, and 5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL respectively) were significantly higher in the fresh virus condition, despite a relatively “short-term” freezing of viral stocks [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This general finding was corroborated dramatically in a separate analysis of both St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively. These studies revealed that frozen SLEV failed to infect or disseminate in over 100 mosquitoes, while the fresh equivalent infected 97% of mosquitoes and was disseminated in 78%; frozen DENV-2 only infected 1 out of 100 mosquitoes and failed to disseminate, while the fresh virus infected 56% of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and was disseminated in 30% of infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Finally, while the disparity between the infectivity of fresh versus frozen virus is most widely reported for flaviviruses, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, Genus: 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>) showed similar trends in both 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (
 <italic>Ochlerotatus</italic>) 
 <italic>taeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquitoes, with both mosquito species becoming more efficiently infected when taking a bloodmeal from viremic hamsters, compared to pledgets soaked in the fresh or frozen blood from the same hamsters [
