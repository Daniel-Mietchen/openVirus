<p>The genotypic variability of arboviruses in experimental vector infection/transmission is an oft-reported finding in the vector competence literature. For example, the NY99 genotype of West Nile virus (WNV) that was introduced in the United States was later displaced by a new genotype called WN02, which was characterized by a single amino acid substitution in the envelope protein (V159A) [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This single envelope mutation was found to mediate a substantially shortened EIP in laboratory vector competence analyses in both 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], abruptly shifting the vectorial capacity for this genotype compared to NY99 strains. In addition, experimental evidence suggests that the major enzootic host, the house sparrow (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>), developed resistance to NY99 lineage WNV viremia over time, which taken in the context of the higher peak viremias observed in the WN02 and SW03 genotypes, was posited as contributing to the NY99 genotypeâ€™s disappearance [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Likewise, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) exists as seven different species and multiple subtypes. Within subtype I (the most characterized subtype), there exist both enzootic (Subtypes ID, IE, IF), and epizootic (IAB, IC) serotypes. Enzootic VEEV viruses circulate predominantly between 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) spp. vectors and rodent reservoir hosts, and go largely unnoticed as human pathogens, because most infections are easily confused with dengue in the absence of laboratory diagnostics [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Mutations in the E2 protein of sylvatic precursors allow for the significant amplification of VEEV in equids, and are additionally associated with shifts in vectors toward 
 <italic>Aedes taeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic> spp., which tend to bite large mammals such as horses, leading to epizootic outbreaks/transmission [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Ultimately, such considerations in viral evolution and lineage in vector competence experiments are highly contingent on the experimental questions or hypotheses at play.
