<p>A common methodology of studying arboviruses is the use of reverse genetic systems. This technology allows for the cultivation of stock viruses based on defined consensus sequences, negating the necessity for subsequent cell culture passage (discussed below). Although several ZIKV full-length infectious clones (FLIC) exist, for the purposes of this discussion, three will be examined. The first of these was based on the Asian lineage ZIKV FSS13025 (human isolate, Cambodia, 2010), hereafter referred to as ZIKV-FLIC
 <sup>FSS</sup>. Clone-derived virus demonstrated some differentiation from the parental isolate, first and foremost being a homologous small plaque phenotype, compared to the heterologous plaque sizes seen in the parental strain, which were hypothesized to be due to the restriction of the clone to the homogenous population of virus born from the viral consensus, as opposed to the genetic heterogeneity present in the parental isolate [

Similar alterations were noted in mouse virulence (delayed disease course) and mosquito infectivity (increased infectivity and dissemination compared to parental virus), which were also posited to be due to the restriction of genetic diversity from the cloning strategy employed [

Likewise, the ZIKV infectious clone system based on the 2015 isolate from Paraiba Brazil (called ZIKV-ICD) demonstrated significant attenuation in multi-step replication kinetics in seven of nine tested cell lines (Vero, C6/36, human foreskin fibroblasts, SH-SY5Y, BeWo, HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblasts, and JAR human placenta cells), compared to the parental virus [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Deep sequencing analysis demonstrated a 2.3-fold increase in overall mutational frequency in WT ZIKV-Paraiba compared to ZIKV-ICD, with 61 nucleotides in the wild-type demonstrating polymorphisms at a frequency of over 1%, while ZIKV ICD demonstrated only a single nucleotide with a polymorphism (1.37%) [

 <sup>PR</sup>, performed comparably to the parental isolate in various outputs, including growth kinetics (Huh7, JAR, Aag2, Vero, SH-SY5Y, NTERA2 cI.D1 C6/36, and BHK), mosquito infectivity, and animal pathogenesis. However, when examined for genetic diversity, ZIKV FLIC
 <sup>PR</sup> proved less rich in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity in several measures (distance, complexity, and nucleotide diversity) compared to the parental strain [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. While undoubtedly an invaluable tool, it is therefore critical to consider the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing infectious clones as opposed to arbovirus isolates. However, even in experimental paradigms where infectious clones may not be entirely appropriate, they may be the only option available to investigators, as ready access to relevant isolates is not uniform.
