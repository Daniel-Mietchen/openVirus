<p>Laboratory vector competence determinations require a marriage between the underlying microbiology and entomology. Therefore, to properly design and execute vector competence analyses for arboviruses, some consideration of the virological underpinnings are critical. Considered here are the contributions of viral evolution/genotype/strain, storage/freshness, identity as an isolate or as part of an infectious clone-derived population, and cell culture passage history.</p>
