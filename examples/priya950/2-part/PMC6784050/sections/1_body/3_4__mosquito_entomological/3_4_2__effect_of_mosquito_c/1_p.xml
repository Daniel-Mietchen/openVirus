<p>As previously indicated, the abundance of vector competence experiments using 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> reflect its ease of rearing and colonization in laboratory settings [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, commonly used laboratory “reference” strains exist, such as the Rockefeller (ROCK) colony, Higgs White Eye (HWE), and Rexville (RED), with the former established in Cuba in 1930 [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The widespread use of these lines underscores the concern that long-term colonization may impart phenotypic and genotypic changes, some of which can modulate competence. This has been empirically demonstrated in a comparative analysis of field-derived populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Iquitos (Peru, F2) and McAllen (Texas, US, F3), which were compared to ROCK 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for their competence for DENV-2 from either Southeast Asia or the Americas. Both field populations demonstrated increased susceptibility to disseminated infection by the Southeast Asian DENV-2 strains, compared to American DENV-2 (McAllen: 81% versus 67%, Iquitos: 69% versus 41%), while the ROCK 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> exhibited no significant difference in susceptibility between virus strains (SE Asia: 60%, American: 67%) [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Although the mechanistic underpinnings of how colonization affects a given mosquito population’s susceptibility to infection are not fully understood (although growing evidence indicates a role for the microbiome, as reviewed below), colonization has been reported in the literature for decades to affect vector competence. In an analysis of Egyptian 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, the susceptibility to infection by, and transmission of RVFV was compared across 16 mosquito generations in laboratory settings. While susceptibility to infection increased with colonization (F1 infection rate = 67%, F16 infection rate = 84%, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 58.1 + 0.94x, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.67, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), transmission competence decreased (F1 transmission rate = 48%, F16 transmission rate = 21%, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 41.3 − 1.0x, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.76, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Similar work conducted on an 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> colony from Vero Beach, Florida, which also demonstrated an overall decrease in disseminated YFV infections with colonization (F1 = 54.5%, F10 = 12%) [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. While there is undoubtedly value to be derived from utilizing widely available reference strains (e.g., ROCK, HWE, RED, etc.), these studies highlight that laboratory-colonized mosquitoes do not necessarily reflect their feral counterparts, underscoring the value of vector competence studies with relevant field populations of vector mosquitoes as well.
