<p>The role of vector mosquitoes in the design and implementation of vector competence experiments cannot be understated. Conversely, many of the parameters considered herein are more difficult and/or labor intensive to control, as investigators may be limited by mosquito populations available locally and in the laboratory. Herein, we consider the roles of mosquito species/genus/population, colonization, microbiome, and immune status, as well as insect-specific viruses on vector competence.</p>
