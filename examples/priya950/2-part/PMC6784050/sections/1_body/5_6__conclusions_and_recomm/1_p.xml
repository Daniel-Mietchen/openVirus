<p>While the ZIKV epidemic led to substantial strides in understanding vector competence, research has in some ways been hampered by a lack of concordance and standardization of methods. Despite many publications reporting the vector competence of various populations of potential vector mosquitoes using several strains of ZIKV, this lack of standardization precludes a large-scale meta-analysis on the subject. Due to continued increases in global trade/travel, the increasing urbanization of previously rural and sylvatic biomes, coupled with climate change, arbovirus emergence, and reemergence will undoubtedly continue to be a major public health challenge [
