<p>Despite some challenges with the standardization of experimental vector competence evaluations (e.g., lack of information on critical parameters, expense, access to resources), some elements that can more feasibly be standardized should be targeted. For example, given that ISVs are known to impact vector competence [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], it would not be unreasonable to expect investigators to routinely screen long-standing mosquito colonies for their presence via cell culture-based or PCR-based methodologies. Given that many vector competence analyses are performed in the context of local mosquito populations [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and commonly used reference mosquito strains have existed for decades [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], often as disparate populations in various insectaries, the potential for variation in competence as a function of such ISVs should be ignored. The use of arbovirus strains that are unavailable to most investigators through repositories such as BEI, ATCC, or the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA), should be carefully considered. Additionally, some degree of terminology standardization should be considered to avoid confusion in the literature [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, transmission competence should be used only to indicate the presence of virus in the saliva [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Virus detected in head squashes, or viral RNA detected in salivary glands [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while suggestive, do not necessarily indicate transmission capability.
