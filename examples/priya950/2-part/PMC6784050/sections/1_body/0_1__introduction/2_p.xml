<p>Beginning in 2007, Zika began to emerge outside of endemic areas in a series of outbreaks beginning on the Island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, and in Gabon [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Following these outbreaks, ZIKV spread across the South Pacific, causing epidemics in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Easter Island, and the Cook Islands [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There, the virus was initially undetected, which was possibly due to it being overshadowed by an outbreak of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the outbreaks taking place in the South Pacific, the capacity for ZIKV to cause some of the unique clinical outcomes and sequalae (e.g., Guillain–Barré syndrome, congenital malformations, and shedding of the virus in several biological fluids/sexual transmission) was first appreciated, or subsequently elucidated via retrospective analyses [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The severity of these sequalae, as well as the explosivity of the spread in the Americas (reaching estimates of between 400,000–1,300,000 infected individuals in Brazil alone, and emergence/spread into 50 countries or territories in the Americas by March of 2016) [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] led the World Health Organization to declare the ongoing transmission of ZIKV in the Americas to be a public health emergency of international concern, which was a status that had been rescinded as the outbreak began to taper in the later summer and fall of 2016 [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Substantial efforts were rapidly undertaken for the development of ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], culminating in several vaccine candidates reaching various stages of clinical testing [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite the relatively expeditious advancement of these candidates, none has yet overcome the hurdle of clinical licensure; as such, the best methodologies for combating ZIKV outbreaks remain public education and mosquito abatement.
