<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. It was originally discovered in 1947 from the blood of a febrile sentinel rhesus macaque placed in a treetop platform in the Ziika forest in Uganda [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although it was not associated with reports of human illness. Similar to the related flaviviruses yellow fever (YFV) and dengue (DENV), ZIKV demonstrates evidence of an African enzootic, or sylvatic transmission cycle, circulating between forest canopy-dwelling mosquitoes such as
