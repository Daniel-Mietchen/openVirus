<p>Given the role of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the transmission of many of the most important epidemic arboviruses such as ZIKV, DENV, YFV, and CHIKV [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], it is not surprising that substantial efforts have been expended to examine multiple populations of this mosquito. Unfortunately, its widespread use in laboratory vector competence experiments and the need for tightly controlled protocols often ignores critical elements of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti’s</italic> natural behavior, some of which are paramount to its role as an efficient vector. Of these, the tendency of this mosquito to take multiple bloodmeals in a single gonadotrophic cycle [

 <xref rid="B154-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>,

 <xref rid="B156-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>] is perhaps the most important for enhancing vectorial capacity through multiple host contacts to enhance infection, and to increase transmission to multiple susceptible individuals [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Despite this well-known trait of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti’s</italic> biology, laboratory vector competence experiments typically involve mosquitoes that fully engorge on infectious blood, and then are maintained on sucrose over the course of the EIP. Armstrong et al. recently demonstrated the role of multiple bloodmeals on the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for ZIKV, DENV-2, and CHIKV. By exposing mosquitoes to a second, noninfectious bloodmeal 3–4 days following feeding on infectious blood [
 <xref rid="B158-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], they showed that dissemination was significantly increased for all three viruses compared to mosquitoes that were not given the second noninfectious bloodmeal. The second bloodmeal did not affect initial infection, and its effect disappeared by 10 days of ZIKV extrinsic incubation. Nevertheless, the observed decrease in the EIP could have a major impact on vectorial capacity, since the EIP is treated exponentially by the equation discussed above. This finding highlights how laboratory competence assessments should strive to capture as many elements as possible of field conditions.
