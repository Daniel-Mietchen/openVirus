<p>One of the most important determinants of mosquito infectivity, and subsequently transmission, is the orally available dose (i.e., the bloodmeal titer), or as described by Kuno and Chang, “Theoretically, the higher the concentration of virus in the blood and the longer the duration of viremia, the greater the probability of a vector acquiring a virus from infected vertebrates” [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of laboratory vector competence data support this finding in multiple combinations of virus species and mosquito species. With respect to ZIKV, multiple populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have demonstrated increasing levels of infection, dissemination, and transmission when exposed to increasing oral doses [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>], as has 
 <italic>Ae. notoscriptus</italic> for infection (however, not transmission) with ZIKV strain MR766 [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Likewise, the vector competence of various 
 <italic>Culex spp.</italic> mosquitoes for WNV is highly dependent on oral doses [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Despite these repeated findings, the importance of viremia magnitude should be interpreted with caution, as the data from many of these ZIKV analyses suggest that this virus requires oral doses that are higher than those indicated by human viremia estimates [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. This is well illustrated in the recent work conducted in Iquitos, Peru, in which naturally DENV-infected volunteers allowed naïve 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to feed directly, or exposed mosquitoes to feed indirectly, on these doses via venipuncture, and the use of anticoagulated blood or unmanipulated blood for artificial bloodmeals. A subset of the volunteer population demonstrated no detectable viremia, yet were still capable of infecting 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (direct bloodmeals: 8/18, 44%, indirect anticoagulated bloodmeals: 7/14, 50%, and indirect bloodmeal with no additives: 6/20, 30%) [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Similar work in nonhuman primate models of both DENV and ZIKV infection have shown direct oral infection of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> at low to undetectable titers (DENV-2: undetectable to 3.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL; ZIKV: 4.4 log
 <sub>10</sub> genome copies/mL) [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Given that fully engorged mosquitoes generally imbibe 5–10 μL of blood [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], a bloodmeal containing 3.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> infectious units per milliliter would contain few if any infectious virions, assuming a random distribution of virus throughout the circulation [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Considered in the context of previous work in the VEEV/
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> system, which illustrated that only ca. 100 midgut epithelial cells are susceptible to infection, and often infection is initiated in 1–5 cells [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], these results suggest that a large proportion of wild mosquitoes feeding on viremic hosts fail to become infected and perpetuate transmission cycles. The roles of only infrequently transmission-competent infections—offset by huge numbers of transmission chains, persistent vertebrate infections, or vertical transmission in vectors—in arbovirus maintenance deserve more investigation.
