  <p>Sequential steps required for a female mosquito to transmit a virus biologically. (
   <bold>1</bold>) The virus in question is imbibed by a female mosquito from an viremic host, (
   <bold>2</bold>) the virus infects and replicates in midgut epithelial cells (overcoming the midgut infection barrier), (
   <bold>3</bold>) the virus escapes from midgut epithelial cells into the mosquitoâ€™s hemolymph within the hemocoel (overcoming the midgut escape barrier to develop a disseminated infection), (
   <bold>4</bold>) the infection of and replication in peripheral tissues/organs such as nerves, muscle fibers, or fat body, (
   <bold>5</bold>) the infection of salivary glands (this step can potentially occur in the absence of infection/replication of peripheral tissues/organs, overcoming the salivary gland infection barrier), and (
   <bold>6</bold>) shedding into the apical cavities of acinar cells and presence in the saliva for inoculation into subsequent hosts upon feeding [
