<p>Initially, the immunization with rSHNP and rJHNP elicited a high cross reactivity, once that the immunizations results in similar recognize of recombinant proteins, rSHNP and rJHNP, by both immunized groups, immunized with rSHNP and immunized with rJHNP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007915.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Despite this, considering the cut off value equal 3times the mean of non-immunized mice values, the epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> were highly specific to SHNP (Optical densities of 2.53 ± 0.17 and 1.3 ± 0.14, respectively) once that non-immunized mice (Optical densities: 0.08±0.011, p&lt;0.0001 and 0.084±0.013, p&lt;0.0001, respectively.) and mice immunized with rJHNP (Optical densities: 0.16±0.09, p&lt;0.0001 and 0.084±0.006, p&lt;0.0001, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007915.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Besides, there no were statistical differences in response to SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> between non-immunized mice and rJHNP immunized mice.
