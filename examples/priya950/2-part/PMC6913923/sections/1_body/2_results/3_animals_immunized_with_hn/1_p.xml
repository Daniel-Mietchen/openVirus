<p>After 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analyzes, sequences of epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> were synthetized as linear peptides and tested by ELISA against sera sample from BALB/c mice immunized with rSHNP. This step aimed to validate experimentally epitopes with low (SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub>) and intermediary (SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>) conservation degree among orthohantavirus associated to HCPS. Firstly, we confirmed that rSHNP is immunogenic in animal models because immunized mice presented specific antibodies against it at 28 days after the first immunization (IgG titer: 336829 ± 92407) and presented an increase of 2.5-fold in the IgG serum title against rSHNP after the third immunization (IgG titer: 855671 ± 118257). In relation to the specific humoral response against predicted peptides, mice immunized with rSHNP elicited specific antibodies against peptides SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub>. Both peptides, were specifically recognized, presenting similar levels of antibodies level in the first (anti-SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> IgG titer: 5925 ± 2747; anti-SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> IgG titer: 1604 ± 1212) and second bleeding (anti-SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> IgG titer: 7550 ± 1474 and anti-SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> IgG titer: 1911 ± 1119). On the other hands, we did not observe any humoral response against SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> peptide (
