<p>Among hantavirus associated to HFRS, the SEOV is spread worldwide by 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>, two rodent species present on the five continents, which are also implicated in leptospirosis outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Americas, we highlight that SEOV has already been detected in both rodents, 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>rattus</italic>, in Argentina [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], United States [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nonetheless, few cases of HFRS have been reported in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], where this syndrome could be misdiagnosed as other tropical infectious diseases like dengue, yellow fever and leptospirosis. This data combined with the absence of a specific surveillance for SEOV and others HFRS- associated orthohantavirus in Western countries, and with the inability to confirm cases on site, by laboratory diagnosis, make urgent the development of new diagnostic tools.
