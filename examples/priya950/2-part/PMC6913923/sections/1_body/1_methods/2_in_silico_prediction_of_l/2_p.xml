<p>Firstly, the prediction of linear B-cell epitopes was carried out using the web server Bepipred 2.0, which uses a Random Forest algorithm trained on epitopes and non-epitope amino acids determined by crystal structures from a protein sequence. For each FASTA input sequence, the server outputs a prediction score for each amino acid. To determine potential B-cell linear epitopes, we utilized the recommended cutoff of 0.5, ensuring a specificity of 57% and sensibility of 59% [

Sequences with BepiPred score above 0.5 were considered as potential linear B-cell epitopes and analyzed by Vaxijen.
