<p>Mice IgG serum titration were assayed at 21 and 35 days after initial immunization using indirect ELISA against rSHNP or rJHNP or B-cell epitopes (SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub>). Briefly, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated with PBS containing 10 μg/mL of rSHNP or rJHNP or synthetized peptides (SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub>). After overnight incubation at 4°C, the plates were washed and blocked for 1 h at 37°C with PBS 5% non-fat dry milk (PBS-5%M). Mice plasma samples were three-fold serial diluted in PBS-5%M, starting at 1:50, and added in duplicate wells. After 2 h at 37°C and three washings with PBS-5%M, bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (Sigma, St. Louis; 1:10000 dilution) and followed by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Optical density was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The IgG serum title was calculated interpolating the value of optical density unit of three times the pre-immune serum (3xPIS) on a linear regression graphic of serum dilution, using the mean optical density of each diluted sera in duplicate.
