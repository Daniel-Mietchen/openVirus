  <title>Kinetic of IgG serum title against rSHNP and predicted peptides after experimental immunization with rSHNP.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice (n = 3) were immunized with rSHNP emulsified with CFA at day 0 and rSHNP emulsified with IFA at day 14 and 28. IgG serum titer was evaluated by specific ELISA at days 21 and 35 (first and second bleeding). The IgG serum title was calculated interpolating the value of optical density unit of three times the pre-immune serum (3xPIS) on a linear regression graphic of serum dilution, using the mean optical density of each diluted sera in duplicate.</p>
