<p id="p0005">The worldwide burden of viral hepatitis in terms of death and disability is enormous. In 2015, viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths, the majority of which imputable to the effects of chronic HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. An estimated 5% of HBV-infected persons are also co-infected with HDV (hepatitis delta virus), which worsens the clinical outcome compared to HBV monoinfection 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Less than 5% of overall hepatitis mortality is caused by HAV (hepatitis A virus) and HEV (hepatitis E virus), that are usually associated with acute, self-limiting disease 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, the case fatality rate of HEV is particularly high in specific groups, notably pregnant women and elderly individuals 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although rare, infection with HAV can also cause acute liver failure and death, and the risk increases with age 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the existence of a safe and effective vaccine, HAV remains a common cause of acute viral hepatitis in many regions of the world
