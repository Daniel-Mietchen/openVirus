<p id="p0125">Genetic heterogeneity among strains is quite high for HDV, which is thus classified in eight different genotypes (from 1 to 8), although a three major genogroup classification was recently proposed (group 1 for previous genotype 1, group 2 for genotypes 2 and genotypes from 4 to 8, and group 3 for previous genotype 3) 
 <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref> HDV genetic diversity is highest in Africa, suggesting that the defective virus emerged in and spread from this continent 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. The evolutionary origin of HDV is nonetheless unknown. HDV-like circular RNAs were only recently described in birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects

 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. However, these HDV-like elements were not found to be associated with hepadnavirus infection, reinforcing the idea the HDV is not necessarily only transmitted in conjunction with HBV-related viruses, at least in these animals 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. Current evidence suggests that HDV evolved from the human cellular transcriptome
