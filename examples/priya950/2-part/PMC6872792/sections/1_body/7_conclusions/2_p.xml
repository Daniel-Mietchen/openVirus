<p id="p0170">By allowing the large-scale identification of novel viral species, as well as the sequencing of viral genomes from archaeological samples, technological advances have largely expanded our knowledge on the evolution and origin of human hepatitis viruses. These insights have been paralleled by the development of computational tools and theoretical frameworks to analyze and mine viral sequence data (e.g., the above-mentioned recognition of the TDRP and the development of approaches to correct for it). The overall picture emerging from these studies clearly indicates that, with the possible exception of HDV, viruses related to human hepatitis viruses infect several other mammalian and non mammalian vertebrates. The specific events that originated these human pathogens remain, however, largely unknown. For HCV and HEV, the evolutionary history of the human viruses is likely intertwined with that of related viruses that infect domestic animals. Conversely, in the case of HAV and HBV, the closest relatives of the human viruses are found in NHPs. In general, these observations indicate that a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of human viruses has a relevance not only to improve our ability to treat and prevent present infections, but also to gain insight into the ecological contexts that may fuel the emergence of novel human pathogens, with particular reference to zoonotic ones.</p>
