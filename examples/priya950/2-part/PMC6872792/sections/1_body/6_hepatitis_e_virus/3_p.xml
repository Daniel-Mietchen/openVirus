<p id="p0135">HEV is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In common with all other members of this viral family, the HEV genome comprises three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 and ORF2 encode a non-structural polyprotein and the viral capsid, respectively, whereas ORF3 codes for a small phosphoprotein. A fourth ORF (ORF4), overlapping the helicase domain in ORF1, was recently described but seems to be specific for some HEV genotypes (HEV genotype 1, HEV-1)
