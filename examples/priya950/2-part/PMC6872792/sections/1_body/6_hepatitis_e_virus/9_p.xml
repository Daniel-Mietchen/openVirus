<p id="p0165">It should also be noted that the ultimate origin of orthohepevirus A remains unknown. Humans may have acquired HEV through cross-species transmission from other animals. However, known orthohepeviruses that infect mammals and birds are distantly related to orthohepevirus A, indicating that none of them represents the source of human-infecting HEV. Likewise, the origin and evolutionary relationship between the moose virus and human-infecting orthohepeviruses remain unclear.</p>
