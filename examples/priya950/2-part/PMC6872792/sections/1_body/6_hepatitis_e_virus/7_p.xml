<p id="p0155">Molecular dating using a selection-informed method inferred that the ancestor of extant orthohepeviruses A existed ∼6800 to ∼3200 years ago, most likely in East Asia 
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. These inferences well correlate with historical circumstances that may have favored HEV emergence and host range expansion. In this period, sedentary agriculture promoted the appearance of large human settlements in several Asian regions and pig husbandry practices started to intensify in East Asia

 <xref rid="b0645" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0650" ref-type="bibr">[130]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Crowded living conditions and poor sanitation possibly favored the emergence and spread of the waterborne, human-specific HEV strains. The close contact between humans and pigs most likely promoted HEV zooanthroponotic transmission and emergence of the enzootic strains (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Additional reverse zoonotic transmissions may have also originated the camel-infecting and rabbit-infecting strains. In fact, the estimated timing of HEV-7/8 emergence (4055 BCE to 1192 BCE) 
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref> encompasses the time of domestication of Bactrian and dromedary camels 
 <xref rid="b0655" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0660" ref-type="bibr">[132]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0665" ref-type="bibr">[133]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). As for HEV-3ra, it was estimated to have diverged from HEV-3 around 600 CE, in Europe 
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. This time frame corresponds to the Middle Ages, when historical evidence indicates that rabbits were kept in warrens and bred for meat 
 <xref rid="b0670" ref-type="bibr">[134]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Of course, these estimates do not necessarily imply that camels and rabbits acquired HEV from humans, as the domestication process may have exposed these animals to various viral sources, including other domestic (e.g., pigs) and peridomestic mammals.
