<p id="p0025">HAV is mainly transmitted via the faecal-oral route through exposure to contaminated food or water, or through direct contact with infected people. HAV is a single-strand, positive RNA virus with a genome of approximately 7.5 kb in length (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The HAV genome contains a single ORF flanked by a relatively long 5′ UTR and a 3′ UTR. The 5′ UTR harbors an internal ribosome entry site that directs the cap-independent translation of HAV proteins. The ORF encodes a polyprotein processed in 11 mature proteins: 5 structural proteins involved in capsid formation (VP4, VP2, VP3, VP1, and pX, deriving from P1 segment) and 6 non-structural proteins with a role in RNA genome amplification (2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol, deriving from P2 and P3 segments)
