<p id="p0050">The phylogenetic relationships among hepatovirus that infect small mammals only partially reflects those among their hosts, suggesting multiple, non-recent cross-species and cross-order host switches during hepatovirus evolution 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This observation is supported by recombination events observed in hepatoviruses that have been identified in genetically and geographically distant hosts 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These cross-species transmission events also involved the opossum hepatovirus, which most likely originated from an ancestral host switch from rodents into marsupials 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Conversely, hepatovirus phylogenies suggest no host switch involving a primate donor. This evidence, the absence of recombination events between HAVs and non-primate hepatoviruses, as well as the observation that primate hepatoviruses form, regardless of the genomic region considered, a monophyletic group in the topology of hepatovirus phylogenies, support the hypothesis that humans and NHP have acquired hepatoviruses from other animal reservoirs relatively recently 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, if and when this hypothetical host-jump occurred into primates remains to be clarified.
