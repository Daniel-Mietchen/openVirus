<p id="p0040">For a long time, it was thought that hepatoviruses were restricted to humans and non-human primates (NHPs), with genetically distinct variants classified as six main different genotypes 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>: three isolated from humans (HAV, genotype I–III) and subclassified in 6 subgenotypes (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB) and three of simian origin (SHAV, genotype IV–VI). However, despite genetic heterogeneity, HAV viruses belong to a single common serotype.
