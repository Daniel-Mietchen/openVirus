<p id="p0055">Phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction suggested a likely cricetid rodent origin for primate HAVs and marsupial hepatoviruses, whereas a laurasiatherian host origin was proposed for all mammalian hepatoviruses

 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, the supposed origin of hepatoviruses in insectivorous laurasiatherian mammals, as well as the preservation of some structural and functional characteristics similar to present-day insect picorna-like viruses (

 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> led Drexler and colleagues to hypothesize a more ancient evolutionary origin of HAVs, with an ancestry in a primordial insect-borne virus
