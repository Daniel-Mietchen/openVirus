<p id="p0045">In recent years, the advent of new sequencing approaches has led to an exponential increase in the identification of new viral species, including highly diverse non-primate hepatoviruses. Several HAV-related viruses were identified in different mammalian orders. In particular, a number of HAV-like viruses were recovered in placental mammals, mainly in bats and rodents, but also in tree shrews, hedgehogs, seals and Chinese woodchucks
