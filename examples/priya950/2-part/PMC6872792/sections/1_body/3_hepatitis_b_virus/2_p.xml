<p id="p0065">HBV was the first human hepatitis virus to be isolated and identified in 1970 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. HBV transmission varies depending on the prevalence of infection. In areas with a low prevalence (&lt;2%), the most common mode of transmission is through infected blood or high-risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sex or injecting drug use). In high- and intermediate- prevalence areas, HBV is commonly spread through perinatal and horizontal (especially among children) routes 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. HBV belongs to the 
 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic> family, which comprises two genera: 
 <italic>Orthohepadnavirus</italic> (mammal-infecting viruses) and 
 <italic>Avihepadnavirus</italic> (bird-infecting viruses) (

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), is composed of four overlapping frameshifted open reading frames (ORFs) 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Viral replication is carried out by a reverse transcriptase with no proofreading ability and considerable variability exists among strains. Thus, at least nine genotypes (A–I) plus a tentative one (J), with a heterogeneous global distribution, have been described to date
