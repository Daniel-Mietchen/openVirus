 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Hepadnaviruses were detected in several mammals, including NHPs, rodents and bats, birds, fish, and reptiles

 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; this finding, together with the discovery of endogenous hepadnavirus elements integrated in the genome of birds and reptiles
