  <p>HCV genetic diversity and relationships with other hepaciviruses. (A) Worldmap showing the areas where endemic transmission of different genotypes was reported (data from Ref. 
   <xref rid="b0690" ref-type="bibr">[138]</xref>). Graphical representation of genotype (GT) diversity. The number of distinct recognized subtypes is represented on the Y axis. Circle size is proportional to the average pairwise distance between subtypes. Genotype 7 is marked with an asterisk as only two subtypes are known. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the RdRp domain of known hepaciviruses. The tree was obtained using RaxML with 1000 bootstrap replicates 
   <xref rid="b0695" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>. Nodes with support equal to or higher than 0.7 are marked with a black dot. (C) Hypothetical viral phylogenies that illustrate the effect of viral lineage extinction on the evolutionary inference about the origin of HCV and EHV/CHV. In the left panel, a horse-to human transmission event is hypothesized, with the following extinction of the transmitted EHV lineage. In the right panel, a reverse zoonosis introduces a HCV-like virus in horse populations; the following extinction of several EHV lineages accounts for the low genetic diversity of extant strains.
