  <p>Hepevirus diversity and geographic distribution. (A) A maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the RdRp domain of known hepeviruses was generated with PhyML 
   <xref rid="b0680" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>. The Piscihepevirus branch is in red, Orthohepevirus branches are in blue. The enlargement shows phylogenetic relationships for viruses belonging to the 
   <italic>Orthohepevirus A</italic> species, with representative hosts. (B) Geographic distribution of anthropotropic (HEV-1 and HEV-2) and enzootic (HEV-3â€“HEV-4) HEV strains. Genotypes were assigned to countries irrespective of their prevalence. Thus, even if a single case was reported in a given country, the genotype was recorded as present. Cases that could be clearly ascribed to migration/travels were excluded. Data derive from Forni et al. 
   <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>, with updates from 
   <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="b0700" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="b0705" ref-type="bibr">[141]</xref>,

   <xref rid="b0750" ref-type="bibr">[150]</xref>, 
   <xref rid="b0755" ref-type="bibr">[151]</xref>. (C) Time-scaled phylogenetic tree of a non-recombing ORF1 region 
   <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. Branch lengths represent evolutionary time. The time-frames of historical events mentioned in the text are reported. The rabbit and camel silhouettes mark the split of the rabbit-infecting and camel/dromedary-infecting genotypes. The pig silhouette marks the human-restricted/enzootic genotype split.
