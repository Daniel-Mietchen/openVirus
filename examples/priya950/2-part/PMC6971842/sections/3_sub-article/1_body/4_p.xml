<p> Abstract: “Introduction” - The authors mention that yellow fever vaccine provides “life-long immunity following a single dose vaccination”. My suggestion is to mention the results of some cross-sectional studies (conducted by Collaborative Group for Studies of Yellow Fever Vaccine in Brazil) which show a decrease in humoral and cellular immunity a few years after vaccination in children and adults.</p>
