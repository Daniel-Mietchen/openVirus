<p>All screening procedures will be similar for all participants, regardless of HIV status. On the screening visit, participants will be assessed by a clinician to check the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a rapid HIV test done according to national guidelines. Relevant demographic information and baseline characteristics will also be collected. HIV-positive volunteers will undergo a CD4 count test during the screening. Screening will also involve assessment for acute febrile disease and other vaccine contraindications, and a urine pregnancy test for female volunteers.</p>
