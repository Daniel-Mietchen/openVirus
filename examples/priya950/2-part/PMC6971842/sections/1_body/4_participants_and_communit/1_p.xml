 </sup>. The studies aim to recruit healthy volunteers, and as such will use locally adapted strategies to inform communities about the study and we will involve district officials or local sub-national health management teams, local administration and community members. A community engagement plan specific for the study was developed at each site. Potential participants will be sensitized for the trials, willing volunteers will be consented before any study specific procedures are undertaken. They will then be screened, enrolled and vaccinated. In Kilifi participants will be recruited in the local community in North Kilifi, while in Mbarara participants will be recruited from communities in Mbarara district.
