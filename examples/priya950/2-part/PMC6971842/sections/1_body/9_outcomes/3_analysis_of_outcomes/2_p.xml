<p>The primary analysis will be a pairwise statistical comparison of the rate of seroconversion at day 28 between full dose and fractional dose of each vaccine manufacturer for the YEFE trial, and between the standard dose and each lower dose of vaccine for the NIFTY trial using a non-inferiority test with a margin of non-inferiority of 10% in the PP population. Seroconversion will be defined as a â‰¥4-fold rise in PRNT 
 <sub>50</sub> titre between day 0 and day 28 samples. Any PRNT 
 <sub>50</sub> value reported as below the limit of quantification (LOQ) (e.g. &lt;1:10) will be converted to LOQ/2. Thus a 4-fold rise for a subject who is &lt;1:10 at baseline, is a titre of 20. Each immunogenicity assessment will be a pairwise comparison of the full dose and fractional (1/5 
 <sup>th</sup>) or full dose and each lower dose within one study population (i.e. YEFE or NIFTY).
