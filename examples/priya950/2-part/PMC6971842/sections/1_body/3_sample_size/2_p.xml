<p>For the adult studies (YEFE and NIFTY), we assumed a 95% seroconversion rate, 90% power, 2.5% alpha for a one-sided test and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, which gave a sample size of 100 per arm. The 10% non-inferiority margin was chosen in consideration of the public health consequence of a loss of protection but a potential increase in vaccine dosages in a situation where vaccine stocks are insufficient to respond to an epidemic. The sample size was increased by 20% to account for losses to follow up and unevaluable participants with a positive serological response for YF virus at baseline. For the YEFE trial, there are four pairwise comparisons being made for non-inferiority (i.e. full standard dose vs 1/5 
 <sup>th</sup> dose for each vaccine manufacturer). Hence the overall sample size was 960, requiring 480 participants in Kenya and 480 in Uganda. For the NIFTY study a total sample size of 480 will be required for the four vaccine dose groups (i.e. full standard dose, 1000 IU, 500 IU and 250 IU;
