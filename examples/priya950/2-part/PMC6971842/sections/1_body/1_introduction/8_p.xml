<p>Using vaccines from each of the four WHO-prequalified manufacturers, the first trial (termed YEFE) aims to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a fifth of the dose to the respective standard vaccine dose. The vaccine potencies used in the YEFE trial are as close to the minimum release specifications as possible. Data from the YEFE trial will inform WHO recommendations on the use of a fifth of standard dose of vaccine for immunisation. The second trial (termed NIFTY) aims to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three low vaccine doses (1000, 500 and 250IU/dose) to the standard vaccine dose (&gt;1000IU/dose) using vaccine produced by Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal. The data generated in this study will provide information regarding the definition of the minimal dose and potency requirements of the vaccine with more precision. The study will also provide further confidence in the use of fractional doses of YF vaccine during epidemics.</p>
