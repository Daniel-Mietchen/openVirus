<p>A review conducted by PATH identified a number of factors that limit the production of YF vaccines and the relatively long-time period required for vaccine production

 </sup>. The first is related to the small number of YF vaccine manufactures, owing, in part, to the absence of a stable demand. Competition for production capacity with other vaccines that are economically more attractive is also an issue. Other limiting factors are related to the production process and include the limited number of specific-pathogen-free egg suppliers, gradual depletion of existing seed stocks and a lyophilisation process that can take several days per cycle. These factors together with limited epidemiological surveillance and incomplete national-level reporting, make vaccine need forecasting very difficult
