The seed virus, derived from the 17D strain, is inoculated into specific-pathogen-free chicken embryonated eggs and after 3–4 days the embryos are aseptically harvested, homogenized and centrifuged to produce bulk vaccine before stabilizing the product. This process is laborious and current capacity to produce increased stock in response to epidemics is limited
