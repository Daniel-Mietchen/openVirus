 <p>The HIV-1 pandemic remains a major burden on global public health and a vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection is highly desirable but has not yet been developed. Among the many roadblocks to achieve this goal, the high antigenic diversity of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is one of the most important and challenging to overcome. The recent development of broadly neutralizing antibodies has considerably improved our knowledge on Env structure and its interplay with neutralizing antibodies. This review aims at highlighting how the genetic diversity of HIV-1 thwarts current, and possibly future, vaccine developments. We will focus on the impact of HIV-1 Env diversification on the sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies and the repercussions of this continuous process at a population level.</p>
