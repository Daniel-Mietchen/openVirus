  <p>The diversification of HIV-1 over the course of the epidemic is associated with increased resistance to bnAbs. Panels (
   <bold>A</bold>â€“
   <bold>D</bold>) illustrate this phenomenon for two subtypes, by studying T/F viruses sampled shortly after seroconversion in HIV-1 infected individuals from 1987 to 2012 in France [

   <bold>B</bold>) The genetic distance of subtype B (
   <bold>A</bold>) and CRF02_AG (
   <bold>B</bold>) T/F variants from a consensus B or CRF02_AG, respectively, correlates with calendar year and increases over time. Sequences were codon-aligned with CRF02_AG consensus sequence (Los Alamos database). After exclusion of hypervariable regions, evolutionary divergence was estimated by distance matrix using MEGA software. Pearson correlation. (
