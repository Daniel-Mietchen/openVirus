  <p>Schematic representation depicting the co-evolution between the virus and NAbs in an HIV-1 infected individual. (Top): Among a diverse population of variants from the transmitter, only a single variant (red) is sexually transmitted to the receiver in most of the cases. It gives rise to autologous NAbs (red) that exert a selective pressure. An escape variant becomes predominant (green), which induces, in turn, a specific autologous neutralizing response, and so on as the phenomenon continues. Progressively, this evolution at the individual level has a repercussion on the diversification of the HIV-1 species leading to an increasing resistance to NAbs at the population level (bottom).</p>
