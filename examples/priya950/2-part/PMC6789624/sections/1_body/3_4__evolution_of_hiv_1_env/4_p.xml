<p>It seems also that the magnitude of increase in resistance to bnAbs is variable depending on the strains, subtypes, and bnAbs. For subtype B viruses, between the two periods of 1988–1991 and 2007–2010, the mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> increased four-fold for PG9 (V1V2g), six-fold for PGT121 (V3g), four-fold for VRC01 (CD4bs), and nine-fold for 3BNC117 (CD4bs), but did not for 10-1074 (V3g) [

 <sub>50</sub> remained below 1 μg/mL for PGT121 and 3BNC117, a reasonably achievable serum concentration by bnAbs infusion, it is important to note that a greater number of viruses had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 10 μg/mL, hence were highly resistant to these bnAbs. This was due to single or combined point mutations in the HIV-1 Env, such as the loss of PNGS at position 332 for V3g bnAbs [

In the future, the drift of HIV-1 towards an increasing resistance to NAbs could compromise the use of bnAbs in prophylaxis or treatment. It is interesting to notice that this rising resistance has happened while these drugs have not yet been largely utilized in the human population, illustrating once again the ability of HIV-1 to be one step ahead. In addition, resistant variants rapidly emerged in HIV-infected individuals during clinical trials using monotherapies of bnAbs [
