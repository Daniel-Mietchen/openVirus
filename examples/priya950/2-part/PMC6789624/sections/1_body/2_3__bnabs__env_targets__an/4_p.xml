<p>Focusing on T/F viruses, the sensitivity to bnAbs seems associated with HIV-1 subtypes [
 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Extensive data are available for subtypes B and C, while those on non-B/non-C viruses are more limited. V1/V2g bnAbs are less potent against subtype B viruses [
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], whereas bnAbs targeting the gp120-gp41 interface are more potent against this subtype [
 <xref rid="B57-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The breadth of V3g bnAbs depends on the presence of a PNGS at position N332, whose frequency is variable both intrasubtype and intersubtype [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. HIV-1 subtype B is more sensitive to CD4bs and MPER bnAbs than subtype C [
 <xref rid="B60-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, the neutralization breadth of bnAbs depends on the subtype, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00074-f002">Figure 2</xref> for a selection of bnAbs against three panels of T/F viruses. Several factors may account for this variability. The efficacy of a particular bnAb against viruses from various subtypes may depend in part on the subtype infecting the individual from whom this bnAb was isolated [
 <xref rid="B63-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The molecular patterns on the Env surface may differ between subtypes and also explain these differences [
 <xref rid="B64-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As a consequence, extensive comparisons of Env structures across viral subtypes are necessary to identify signature sequences that might be associated with conserved sensitivity to neutralization in order to overcome viral diversity. Data have been generated by bioinformatic methods to trace the viral signatures associated with sensitivity to bnAbs [
 <xref rid="B64-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. They suggest that bnAbs with similar specificities show recurrent signature patterns [
 <xref rid="B50-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Bricault et al. have defined signatures for four bnAbs classes (CD4bs, V1V2g, V3g, and MPER bnAbs) [
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In a proof-of-concept exploration of signature-based epitope targeted (SET) vaccines, a trivalent vaccine with bnAb signatures defined for the V2 loop was employed to inform immunogen design in a guinea pig model. An increased neutralization breadth was observed, suggesting a key role of these Env molecular determinants [
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Although the magnitude of the neutralization response remained low to moderate, these data can help guide the rational design of an effective HIV vaccine.
