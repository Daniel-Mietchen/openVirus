<p>The breadth and potency of bnAbs have been reviewed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The data inform us of the impact of the HIV-1 genetic diversity on the susceptibility to bnAbs. Transmitted-founder (T/F) viruses identified at the time of acute infection, or at least viruses isolated very early after primary infection, have specific properties that provide them a specific advantage for transmission [
 <xref rid="B51-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Indeed, many studies have described a genetic bottleneck in the receiver at time of primary infection, suggesting that T/F viruses are those that must be preferentially targeted for protection. Thus, they are the most suited for evaluation of neutralization potency.
