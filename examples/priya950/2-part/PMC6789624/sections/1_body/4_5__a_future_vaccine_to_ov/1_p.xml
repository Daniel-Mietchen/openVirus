<p>Over the last several years, many vaccine strategies have been explored to elicit broad neutralizing responses, based on the exceptional and promising capacity of bnAbs to prevent HIV-1 infection. These strategies aim to overcome two major roadblocks to successfully induce bnAbs: Engaging the correct precursor B cell of such antibodies and guiding their steps towards breadth, which requires very specific and unusual features such as extensive somatic hypermutation or CDR H3 length [

 <xref rid="B96-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. To date, two main complementary visions of immunogen designs have been inspired by the bnAbs characteristics. First, the lineage-based design is aimed at the activation of precursor B cells followed by sequential maturation of intermediate B cells to recapitulate the lineage of a bnAb. The second approach is to engineer epitope-based immunogens based on a tight knowledge of the sites of vulnerability [

 <xref rid="B98-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. If one of these approaches succeeds in the future—an already complicated task—it appears crucial to focus the effort on inducing antibodies which have the characteristics of the recent near-pangenotypic bnAbs N6 and VRC07-523, in order to tackle Env diversity [

However, as previously noticed, the induction of a single bnAb specificity is unlikely to provide full protection at the population level and could lead to the emergence of escape variants. Therefore, the design of a combined vaccine inducing two or more bnAb lineages with complementary neutralizing spectra would be mandatory. Several examples of HIV-1 infected individuals who developed NAbs targeting distinct sites of vulnerability have been described [
