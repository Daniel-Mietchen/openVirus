<p>The molecular basis of HIV-1 escape from autologous neutralization involves multiple diverse mechanisms. Autologous NAbs target mainly the surface-exposed regions, in particular the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops of gp120, which could explain their narrow specificity [

 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The general mechanisms leading to resistance to NAbs include single amino acid substitutions, insertions/deletions in the variable regions of Env, and an increased number and/or changes in positions of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) at its surface (called glycan shield) [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The effect of these mechanisms on the emergence of antibody resistant variants within the viral quasi-species seems highly variable and heterogeneous according to the strains studied [
