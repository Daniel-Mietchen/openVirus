<p>At the individual level, during the early months of HIV-1 infection, most of the patients develop autologous NAbs directed against the gp120 and gp41 subunits of the transmitted/founder (T/F) variant. The breadth of the neutralizing response is relatively narrow, as illustrated by its inability to neutralize heterologous isolates [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These antibodies do not seem to protect against disease progression but exert a selective pressure that drives the viral evolution and leads to the rapid selection of escape variants [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result, autologous NAbs are effective against variants of the viral quasi-species present several weeks or months earlier but appear to be unable to neutralize the contemporary variants [

 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The viral quasi-species varying in Env composition in each patient ultimately gives rise to a highly diverse virus population which coevolves in parallel with the antibody response [
