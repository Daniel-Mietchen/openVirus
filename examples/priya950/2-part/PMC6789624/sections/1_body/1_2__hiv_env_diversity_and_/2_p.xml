<p>Cross-species transmission events from nonhuman primates to humans have generated four HIV-1 groups: M (major), O (outlier), N (non-M, non-O) and P. HIV-1 group M, responsible for the current pandemic, exhibits the most important viral diversity in the

 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Globally, the subtype C predominates worldwide (representing 50% of HIV-1 viruses), followed by subtypes B and A, which account for about 10% of infections each. CRF02_AG, CRF01_AE, and subtype G are responsible for 5–8% of infections each and many other recombinant forms, which emerge regularly, generate diverse sub-epidemics [

Furthermore, viruses within the same clade differ by 8–17% (maximum 30%) in amino acid composition in the viral Env glycoprotein, whereas this difference is 17–35% between isolates from different subtypes, illustrating the outstanding variability of HIV-1 [
