<p>Some studies have also reported that, in adults, the factors associated with severe dengue fever are age over 40 years [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], comorbidities [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we could not rule out the relationship between mortality and aging population and underlying diseases. This issue needs a further study in the future. However, we could not differentiate the mortality rate among patients with early admission (before 4 days of illness) and late admission (after 4 days of illness).
