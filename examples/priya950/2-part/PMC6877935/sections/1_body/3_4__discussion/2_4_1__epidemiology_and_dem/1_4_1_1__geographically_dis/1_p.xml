<p>In Vietnam, the first cases of dengue fever were recorded in 1959 in the North and in the South in 1960. Until 1996, the disease was reported to spread to all provinces in Central and Southern Vietnam. However, the disease only occurred in 2/3 of the provinces and cities in the highlands and 15/23 (65%) of provinces and cities in the North which was not common in mountainous provinces [

However, during the outbreak of dengue fever in 2017, dengue fever patients were present in 4/5 of the provinces, cities in the Highlands, and 19/25 (76%) of the provinces, cities in Northern. Dengue fever has occurred in the midlands and northern mountains, such as Son La and Lai Chau, where the economy and transport are growing rapidly. In this study, we identified the living address of patients based on medical records. It should be noted that not only the mosquitoes control but also human activities such as tourism and urbanization are the main factors contributing to the spread of dengue virus [
