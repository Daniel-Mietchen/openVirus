Most patients in this study admitted to hospital at around day 4 to day 6 of illness, which could be refer as “critical phase” or “with warning signs” according to Vietnam dengue prevention program guideline. Similarly, some studies have shown that dengue fever was only reported in patients under 60 years of age, focusing mainly aged under 40 due to expose to dengue virus in daily activities [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our findings showed that dengue fever has affected all ages, especially in the age group above 80 years, the oldest being 85-year-old. Along with the aging population, the issue of dengue infection was started to be seen more frequently in aging population in Vietnam.
