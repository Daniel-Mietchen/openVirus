<p>Although the disease is now endemic in Vietnam, the knowledge of adult dengue virus infection is still limited and therefore requires a nationwide extensive analysis of clinical and epidemiological results. Such data will also provide useful information for establishing the dengue fever prevention program in Vietnam. In the early year of 2017, an outbreak of dengue fever transmitted throughout the country with much higher number of cases than in previous years. This study was undertaken to examine the clinical and laboratory profile of dengue infection in adult patients and to determine any new insights into the 2017 outbreak.</p>
