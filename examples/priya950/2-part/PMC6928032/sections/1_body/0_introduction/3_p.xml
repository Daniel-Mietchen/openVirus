<p>Licensed influenza vaccines are currently available as inactivated (whole inactivated virus vaccine, split virus vaccine or subunit vaccine), live attenuated, and recombinant vaccines (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12697-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These vaccines are produced in eggs or cell cultures and mainly induce antibodies against strain‐specific HA.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Today, research is more focused on the development of subunit vaccines, as they are safer and easier to produce. With recombinant technology, the production of epitopes of interest, such as the conserved stalk domain of HA, can be done. In addition to vaccine antigens, adjuvants are also sometimes added to vaccines to boost immunogenicity. Adjuvants are particularly important in the development of influenza vaccines for the elderly population who has decreased immune capacity and during pandemics, where a rapid antibody response is required.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In addition, adjuvants are also required in the development of novel peptide‐based influenza vaccines, which are known to have low immunogenicity. There are currently six types of adjuvants that have been included in licensed influenza vaccines; alum, AS03, AF03, MF59, heat labile enterotoxin, and virosome, which is a nanoparticle (NP).
