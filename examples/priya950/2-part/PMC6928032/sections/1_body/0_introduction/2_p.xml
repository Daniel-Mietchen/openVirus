<p>Influenza virus infection is a global public health problem, causing a huge morbidity and mortality burden due to annual epidemics and pandemics. Worldwide, annual epidemics cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza infection. Current influenza vaccines mainly rely on hemagglutinin (HA) proteins as antigens to induce neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit virus infection and replication in humans. These antibodies are mostly targeting the immunodominant epitopes of the influenza virus that are highly variable between different virus strains. Each year, new variants of influenza virus may emerge due to antigenic drift, which necessitates the reformulation of influenza vaccines on a yearly basis.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Previously, mismatches between predicted and actual circulating strain have resulted in reduced vaccine protection and increased clinical cases.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> A “universal” vaccine that targets the conserved regions of influenza viruses and induces a broadly protective immunity may dramatically improve protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. Antibodies that target conserved sites in the HA stalk have been isolated from humans and shown to confer protection in animals challenged with various influenza virus strains and subtypes.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> However, it is noteworthy that antibodies specifically targeting the conserved HA2 region can also increase disease severity by enhancing viral fusion to target cells, hence should be given sufficient consideration during universal vaccine design and evaluation.
