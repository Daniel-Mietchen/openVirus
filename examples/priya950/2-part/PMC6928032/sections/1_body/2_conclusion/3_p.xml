<p>While there are clear advantages in using NPs as vaccine carrier and adjuvant, it is not known if results from pre‐clinical studies will translate into success in human clinical trials. To maximize the chance of success, the design of these new generation NP‐based vaccines needs to be guided by comprehensive scientific knowledge on their mechanisms of action. More studies are needed to investigate the specific ways by which different NPs interact with immune cell populations that are involved in antibody production and memory generation. The downstream immune responses such as cytokine production and complement activation should also be characterized in detail, as these responses can be protective but pathological when in excess. In addition, it should be explored if different routes of immunization can impact on the generation of long‐term immunity induced by these NP‐based vaccines. Future studies can also investigate the potential use of several types of NPs in one vaccine formulation to enhance immunogenicity. By enhancing our understanding on these issues, a safer, highly immunogenic and affordable influenza vaccine can be expected in the near future.</p>
