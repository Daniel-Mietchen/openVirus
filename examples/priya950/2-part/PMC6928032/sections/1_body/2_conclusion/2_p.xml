<p>There is great potential in the use of NPs in influenza vaccine development as they can be used to deliver antigens to target cells, improve antigen stability, promote slow release of antigens, and increase immunogenicity. The availability of recombinant technology allows these nanomaterials to be further modified to achieve and boost the desired immune responses. For example, additional molecules such as TLR ligands can be added to the NPs to allow better stimulation and activation of antigen‐presenting cells. NP‐based vaccines are also safer compared to live attenuated vaccines, which pose a risk to the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals.</p>
