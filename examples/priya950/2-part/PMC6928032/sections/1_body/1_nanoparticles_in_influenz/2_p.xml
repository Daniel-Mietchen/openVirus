<p>NPs are comparable to pathogens in terms of their size (1‐1000 nm), and thus, they can be efficiently recognized by immune cells and can therefore act as carriers to induce desirable immune‐activating effects. NPs can facilitate the delivery of loaded antigens to the primary antigen‐presenting cells (APCs).

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> For efficient protection against influenza, influenza vaccines are required to induce specific antibody responses, such as antibodies belonging primarily to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass that can block the function of HA, either via blocking host receptor binding or preventing fusion.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> To promote vaccine immunogenicity, various types of NPs have been employed in the design of influenza subunit vaccines such as bacterial spores, virus‐like particles (VLPs), bacteriophages, polysaccharides, liposomes, virosomes, immune‐stimulating complexes (ISCOM), and inorganic NPs, which are reviewed here under “Natural” and “Synthetic” nanoparticle categories.
