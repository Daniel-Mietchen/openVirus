<p>Live and heat‐inactivated spores of 
 <italic>B subtilis</italic> can also be directly used in vaccine production due to their ability in binding to influenza virions. In a previous study, mice that were intranasally immunized with killed spores adsorbed to H5N1 virions (NIBRG‐14) were fully protected even after being challenged with a lethal dose of the virus (˃20 times LD
 <sub>50</sub>). Particularly interesting was the observation that in the absence of influenza antigens, the killed spores alone were able to confer about 60% partial protection in the animals, suggesting that the spores themselves are immunogenic in nature.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> This type of protection however was short‐lived and has been attributed to the recruitment of natural killer cells into lungs in response to the killed spores.
