<p>Virus‐like particles (VLPs) are self‐assembling and non‐replicating particles that are devoid of infectious genetic material.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> VLPs can be produced from different host cells, which include bacteria, yeast, insect, and animal cell lines. They can be used as both particulate carriers and immunopotentiators in vaccine development due to their immunogenic characteristics such as having similar size to original pathogen, repetitive surface geometry, and ability to induce innate and adaptive immune responses.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The main advantage of VLP‐based vaccines is that the immune system of the host can recognize VLPs in a similar way to the original virus to promote a robust immune response.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> They have been primarily designed to promote B‐cell activation and induce potent antibody responses following activation of T helper cells.
