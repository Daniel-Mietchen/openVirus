<p>A few VLP influenza vaccines have been tested in humans with promising results. For example, VLP vaccines against influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) was tested in adults and showed good safety and immunogenicity profiles, where 82%‐92% of individuals who received a single dose of vaccine achieved ≥40 hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titer.

In the phase I clinical trial, 80.6% of subjects receiving adjuvanted H7N9 VLP vaccine developed HAI responses compared to 15.6% in the group who received a higher dose of non‐adjuvanted vaccine.
