 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> spores have been used in the design of an oral influenza vaccine, where the spore coat protein of 
 <italic>B subtilis</italic> PY79 (CotB) was fused with three copies of conserved matrix protein (M2e). M2e is the ectodomain of M2 protein, a proton channel of the influenza virus, that is highly conserved across all human influenza virus A strains, thus making it one of the main targets for universal influenza vaccine development. The authors reported that M2e was successfully displayed on the spore surface and the recombinant spore (RSM2e3) exhibited significant immunogenicity in mice. Repeated immunization was shown to elicit M2e‐specific IgG (titer of 1:12,800 at week 17 post‐1st immunization), as well as strong cellular immune responses. When immunized mice were further challenged with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus, lung specimens revealed significantly lower levels of the virus titers compared to the control group, in addition to a 100% survival rate.

 <italic>B subtilis</italic> spore coat proteins and stably expressed on the spore surface. Oral immunization of mice with the recombinant spore carrying M2eH‐A‐S‐H was reported to elicit specific antibody production in the absence of any other adjuvant. However, the levels of antibody titers were relatively low, suggesting that the induced immunity was inadequate for protection and some modifications in vaccine preparation may be required to increase immunogenicity.
