<p>Interestingly, VLPs can be modified via recombinant technology to contain additional adjuvant, such as bacterial proteins to further enhance immunogenicity. Wang et al studied the effect of adding a modified 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellin protein to influenza VLPs associated with HA and M1 proteins. They reported that these chimeric VLPs induced higher IgG2a and IgG2b levels and cytokine responses when compared to control VLPs without the flagellin protein. The chimeric VLPs not only conferred full protection against the homologous PR8 virus strain, but it also showed significant cross‐protection by having a 67% survival rate when challenged with a lethal dose of heterosubtypic H3N2 strain.

 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin type 2 protein fused to M2e protein was tested in healthy, young individuals and reported to be safe and immunogenic at low doses (0.3‐1.0 μg).
