<p>Phage VLPs are not pathogenic, and there is no pre‐existing immunity against them in humans; consequently, they are safer than other VLPs.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> Barfoot et al showed that T4 phages can be taken up by DCs as efficiently as the influenza virus.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> Bacteriophage VLP systems employ phage capsid proteins to display peptides or proteins on the surface of the phage. The cargo size is usually dependent on the types of phage. For example, bacteriophage T7 capsid proteins 10A and 10B can accommodate about 400 copies of peptide or protein with 50‐1200 amino acids. Gene VIII protein of Ff phage possesses higher display valency of up to 8000 copies on its filamentous body; however, only peptides and small proteins can be displayed. The gene III protein of Ff phage with low copy number tolerates larger displays, more effectively.
