<p>Synthetic polymers have unique characteristics such as biocompatibility and versatility due to their chemical structure.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">105</xref> They can be modified in terms of size, surface properties, and composition, which results in a controlled release and protection of drugs. PLGA (poly D,L‐lactide‐co‐glycolide) is a FDA‐approved, biodegradable synthetic polymer used for drug delivery in humans.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0106" ref-type="ref">106</xref> They are tuneable and flexible, and their outer surface can be modified to incorporate other polymers such as chitosan for more effective mucosal vaccine delivery.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">108</xref> When encapsulated in PLGA NPs, antigens can be prevented from degradation for over four weeks under physiological conditions. Moreover, they can promote antigen internalization by APCs.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">109</xref> PLGA NP‐based vaccines have been reported to improve the immunogenicity of several conventional and recombinant vaccines targeting human and veterinary pathogens.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">111</xref> Molecules that can target mucosal APCs can be covalently attached to PLGA NPs for the induction of long‐lasting and potent immune responses.
