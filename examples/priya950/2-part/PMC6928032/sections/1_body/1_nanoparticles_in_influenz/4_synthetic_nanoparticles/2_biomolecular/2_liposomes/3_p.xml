<p>Studies have shown that the dose of liposomes used in vaccines can determine the types of immune response generated. Vaxfectin, which is a commercial liposome‐based adjuvant, induced strong humoral responses in mice when used at a high dose (900 µg) with trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), while at 30 µg of Vaxfectin, antibody responses were not induced but the amount of interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) secreting T cells was increased up to 18‐fold.
