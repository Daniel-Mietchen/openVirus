<p>There is now increasing interest in the use of inorganic NPs as adjuvants in vaccine development. An example of inorganic NPs is gold NPs (AuNPs), which have properties that allow conjugation of target antigens or adjuvant at high densities onto their surface.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref> Being a natural element, synthetic AuNPs will not induce carrier‐specific immunity following immunization.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref> It has been shown that a vaccine candidate made of immobilized M2e on AuNPs and soluble cytosine phosphoguanine‐oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG‐ODN) as an immunopotentiator was able to induce strong M2e‐specific antibody responses and achieve 100% survival rate in mice that were lethally challenged with influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">103</xref> The immunogenicity of these NPs can be further enhanced when used together with a bacterial component as immunopotentiator, as shown by Wang et al When both AuNP‐HA (A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2)) and TLR5 agonist flagellin (FliC)‐coupled AuNPs were co‐delivered, stronger cellular immune responses were recorded. In addition, compared with the AuNP‐HA alone group, the addition of AuNPs‐FliC improved mucosal B‐cell responses, as characterized by elevated influenza specific IgA and IgG levels in nasal, tracheal, and lung washes. AuNP‐HA/AuNP‐FliC also stimulated antigen‐specific IFN‐γ secreting CD4+ cell proliferation.
