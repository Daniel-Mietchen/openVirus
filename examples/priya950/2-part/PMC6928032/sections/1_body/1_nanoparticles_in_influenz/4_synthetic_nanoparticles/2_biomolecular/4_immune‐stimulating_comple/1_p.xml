<p>Immune‐stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) are particulate adjuvant systems composed of antigen, cholesterol, phospholipid, and saponin.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref> They are hollow, cage‐like particles of around 40 nm in diameter.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref> ISCOMs combine the advantages of a particulate carrier system with the presence of an in‐built immunopotentiator (Quil A) and consequently have been found to be more immunogenic than liposomes.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">90</xref> They also required substantially less antigen and other adjuvant to induce immunity in the host than vaccination with simple mixtures of free antigen and saponins.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">91</xref> The use of ISCOM in vaccine formulations needs standardized procedures to produce high‐quality finished vaccines with assured batch‐to‐batch consistency. Heterogeneous mixture of ISCOM components can be separated and purified by reversed phase HPLC to eliminate potential toxic fractions in the vaccine preparation.
