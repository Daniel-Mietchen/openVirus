<p>Virosomes are biodegradable, non‐toxic and do not induce antiphospholipid antibody responses.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> Influenza virus is most commonly used for virosome production, with each virosome averaged at approximately 150 nm in diameter. Almeida et al was the first to generate lipid vesicles containing NA and HA proteins derived from influenza.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref> Virosomes are better adjuvants compared to liposomes because they can protect pharmaceutically active substances from proteolytic degradation at low pH within the endosomes before reaching the cytoplasm.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">84</xref> In addition, virosomes are good adjuvant candidates as they can specifically target APCs and effectively stimulate host B‐ and T‐cell responses against attached antigens, as well as surface HA proteins.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">85</xref> When used at 10‐fold lower dose, a virosome/DNA vaccine complex (consisting of NP‐encoding plasmid attached to influenza virosomes) was reported to induce comparable T‐cell responses in mice that were vaccinated with NP plasmid without virosomes.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">86</xref> Inflexal® V, a trivalent virosome subunit vaccine suitable for use in all age‐groups, is an example of a commercially available virosome‐based influenza vaccine.
