  <p>Levels of serum chemokines and cytokines in acute-phase OROV fever- patients with early and late seroconverters. Serum biomarkers (CXCL8, CCL21, CXCL9, CXCL10, IFN-α, IL-6, IL-17, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-5 and IL-10) were measured by CBA assay, as described in methods, in acute-phase OROV fever patients classified as early (n = 48, read circles) or late (n = 27, orange circles) seroconverters during disease onset and healthy donors (HD = 60, grey circles). Data are expressed as scattering of individual values (pg/mL). Multiple comparisons amongst groups were carried out by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-test for sequential pairwise comparisons and significant differences depicted as asterisks and connecting lines. Colored backgrounds highlighted increased (light pink), decreased (light blue) and unaltered (gray) levels of serum biomarkers in OROV subgroups as compared to HD, and differences are underscored by asterisks. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001.</p>
