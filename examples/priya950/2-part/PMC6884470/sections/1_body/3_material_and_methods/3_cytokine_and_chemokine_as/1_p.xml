<p id="Par23">The plasma levels of chemokines (CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10) and cytokines (IFN-α, IL-6, IL-17A, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-5, and IL-10), of the sera from the patients selected for this research, were quantified using the Cytometric Bead Array (BD, Pharmingen, USA), which employs a mixture of polystyrene beads of discrete and distinct fluorescence intensities and coated with antibodies specific for human chemokines and cytokines. This methodology allows the simultaneous evaluation of several soluble biomarkers in the same assay using small sample volumes. Plasma and human cytokine standards were assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and immediately acquired on a FACScalibur
 <sup>TM</sup> flow cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA, USA). The FCAP Array software, v1.0 (San Jose, CA, USA) was used for data analysis. An adjustment model through the curve of the 4
 <sup>th</sup> logistic parameter, which allows the adjustment of the best non-linear curve for detectable data, was employed and the results were expressed in pg/mL.
