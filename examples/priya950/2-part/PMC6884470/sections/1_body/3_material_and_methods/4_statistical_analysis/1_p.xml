<p id="Par24">Conventional statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software v.8.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). Multiple comparisons amongst groups were carried out by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-test for sequential pairwise comparisons. In all cases, the differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.001 (***), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.05 (*). The biomarker signature analysis was plotted as described previously by Luiza-Silva

 </sup>. Briefly, the global median values of cytokine and chemokine plasma concentrations were calculated and employed as the threshold to identify the proportion of subjects as low (below global median) or high producers (above global median) of each biomarker. The cutoff of 50% was considered to define biomarkers, which are universal, present during early and late seroconversion.
