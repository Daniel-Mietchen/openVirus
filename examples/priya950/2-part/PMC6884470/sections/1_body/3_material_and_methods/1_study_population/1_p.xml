<p id="Par21">The present study is a cross-sectional observational study that includes a total of 135 serum samples obtained from the blood bank at the Foundation Center of Hemotherapy and Hematology of Pará (HEMOPA) and Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC). Sixty healthy donors (HD - HEMOPA) and 75 Oropouche-exposed patients (OROV - IEC) were enrolled. HD specimens were triaged for several blood-borne pathogens and classified as fully suitable for donation of blood. OROV fever group was composed of patients clinically investigated by researchers of the Evandro Chagas Institute during the OROV fever outbreaks that occurred in 2006 at Magalhães Barata (Latitude: 0° 47′ 53″ S, Longitude: 47° 36′ 10″ W) in Pará State, and in 2009 at Mazagão (Latitude: 0° 6′ 58″ S, Longitude: 51° 17′ 10″ W) in Amapá State Brazil. OROV fever patients were enrolled upon disease onset, and symptoms were assessed according to Vasconcelos
