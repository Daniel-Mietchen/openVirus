<p id="Par4">In general, viral infections trigger the immune system resulting in activation of innate and adaptive cells toward the production of a strong inflammatory response mediated by several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferon (IFN), that are essential for antiviral defense. In general, type I IFN signaling is well known to be able to trigger expression of several hundred of genes, involved in the blockage of viral entry, replication, translation and assembly, as well as modulate inflammation and adaptive immunity
