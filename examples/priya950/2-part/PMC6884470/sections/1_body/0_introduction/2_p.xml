 </sup>. Despite the fact that seroconversion, detected by IgG and/or IgM ELISA upon OROV infection, is the “gold standard” method in epidemiological survey, in our clinical experience a time-dependent divergence in seroconversion after disease onset has been frequently observed. Indeed, while some patients already present IgM/IgG seropositivity upon disease onset, others exhibit late seroconversion profile, which may yield false negative diagnosis of OROV infection during the acute-phase disease. Little is known on the immunological events triggered during the infection that lead to early and late seroconversion after OROV fever. The analysis of immunological biomarkers may contribute to understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
