<p id="Par20">Aiming at determining whether the distinct seroconversion profile as well as chemokine/cytokine patterns were somehow associated with symptoms, we have performed several data mining approaches, but no association could be identified between single or combined clinical records and serum biomarkers. In fact, during OROV disease, the mechanisms underlying protection and pathogenesis have not been yet clearly defined. All in all, the present study has identified IFN-α as a universal biomarker of human OROV fever, while CXCL8 &amp; IL-5 and CXCL10 &amp; IL-17 were observed consistently in early and late seroconverters, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that production of IFN-α and CXCL10 precede the seroconversion bringing novel insights on disease pathogenesis i.e. the immunological events triggered by the OROV fever.</p>
