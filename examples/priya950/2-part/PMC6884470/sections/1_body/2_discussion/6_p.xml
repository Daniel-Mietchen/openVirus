<p id="Par19">The reasons for the different seroconversion profiles may be attributed to idiosyncratic events intrinsic to the divergent and miscegenated genetic background of the Brazilian population residing in the Amazon region, as well as to the abundant and diversified plethora of arboviruses, including different orthobunyaviruses with capacity to infect and cause disease in humans to which this population is under risk of exposition. It is plausible to hypothesize that preceding contact to different orthobunyavirus antigens may influence the immune response at least to acute-phase OROV fever. In fact, patients included in this study reside in an endemic area to several

 </sup>. Viremia is an interesting biomarker that would contribute to understand the different seroconversion profiles. However, no clear association was found amongst the viremia level and neither the chemokine/cytokine profile, nor the seroconversion status observed for the samples included in the present investigation (data not shown).
