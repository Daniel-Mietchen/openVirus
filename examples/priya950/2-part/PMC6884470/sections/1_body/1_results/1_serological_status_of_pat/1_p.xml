<p id="Par6">In order to identify the profile of circulating IgM/IgG anti-OROV in patients with acute infection, serum samples from patients at different days upon disease onset were evaluated by MAC ELISA. Patients who were diagnosed as positive for OROV disease by RT-qPCR were subdivided as positive (IgM/IgGPos, n = 48) or negative (IgM/IgGNeg, n = 27) according to serology at baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, top panel). The results demonstrated a profile characteristic of early and late seroconversion. Two clusters were observed when IgM/IgG titers were evaluated: (i) patients displaying high titers since the beginning of disease onset, classified as early seroconverters and (ii) patients showing high titers around 8 days after disease onset, considered as late seroconverters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, middle panels). These two clusters were again subdivided into 4 groups according to days of disease onset: 1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11. IgM/IgG titers in early seroconverters were higher than late seroconverters at 1–3 and 4–7 subgroups.
