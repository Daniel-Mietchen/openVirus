Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">In the present study, patients with acute OROV fever were classified as early seroconverters (IgM/IgG positive at baseline) or late seroconverters (IgM/IgG negative at baseline) and the timeline kinetics of the production of chemokines and cytokines were assessed at 1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11 days after patients have reported the first symptoms. Regardless immunoglobulin profile, all OROV fever patients presented higher levels of CXCL8, and IFN-α and lower levels of TNF and IL-10 at baseline as compared to healthy donors (HD). Lower levels of CCL2, CXCL10, and IFN-γ and higher levels of CCL2, CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-17A were detected in early and late seroconverters, respectively, as compared to HD. While early seroconverters presented the increasing levels of CCL2 along the timeline, late seroconverters displayed decreasing levels of CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-6 following days of disease onset. Noteworthy was that IFN-α was revealed as universal biomarker of human OROV fever, while CXCL8 &amp;amp; IL-5 and CXCL10 &amp;amp; IL-17 were consistently observed in early and late seroconverters, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that the production of IFN-α, CXCL10, and IL-17 precede the seroconversion bringing novel insights on the immunological events triggered by the OROV disease.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par2"><i>Oropouche virus</i> (OROV) belongs to one of the largest and most diversified families of RNA virus, the <i>Orthobunyaviridae</i>, which include several Arboviruses responsible for many important acute but self-limiting febrile illnesses in humans and also hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>,<a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. In regard to the epidemiologic aspects, a recent review reported that over the past 60 years, more than 30 outbreaks, comprising more than half a million clinical cases, have been attributed to OROV fever including affected areas in Brazil, Peru, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago. In Brazil, the Amazon region has been stricken for the largest OROV fever epidemics and is the largest endemic area for OROV<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a>,<a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. In fact, until recently, OROV fever was the second most frequent arboviral infection in Brazil, surpassed only by dengue. Now due the recent <i>Chikungunya and Zika viruses</i> epidemics, OROV fever is considered the 4<sup>th</sup> most prevalent arbovirus disease in the country. OROV is raising public agencies concern due to its prospective to spread geographically and emerge in naïve areas, which calls to its importance at an international panorama. The OROV disease starts by an infected arthropod bite, frequently by the midge <i>Culicoides paraensis</i>, its main urban vector, allowing for viral entry and replication in the muscle cells, followed by systemic dissemination to several organs and blood that results in high viremia detected between 2–4 days of symptoms onset<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. Clinically, OROV fever can be characterized as acute febrile disease, with common symptoms and signs such as skin rash, headache, fever, muscle and joint pain<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. The virus may cause meningitis, resulting in typical clinical manifestations of meningeal irritation; then it crosses the blood-brain barrier and infects neurons, producing encephalitis in more susceptible individuals<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. Nevertheless, OROV fever is usually not diagnosed because of its mild and self-limited manifestations or eventually mistakenly diagnosed due to its similar clinical features with dengue, chikungunya, zika, other arboviral diseases and even malaria<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par3">Usually, serologic tests, using distinct antigens have been employed for the diagnosis of OROV infection based on the detection of specific IgG and IgM antibodies<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. Despite the fact that seroconversion, detected by IgG and/or IgM ELISA upon OROV infection, is the "gold standard�? method in epidemiological survey, in our clinical experience a time-dependent divergence in seroconversion after disease onset has been frequently observed. Indeed, while some patients already present IgM/IgG seropositivity upon disease onset, others exhibit late seroconversion profile, which may yield false negative diagnosis of OROV infection during the acute-phase disease. Little is known on the immunological events triggered during the infection that lead to early and late seroconversion after OROV fever. The analysis of immunological biomarkers may contribute to understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</p> <p id="Par4">In general, viral infections trigger the immune system resulting in activation of innate and adaptive cells toward the production of a strong inflammatory response mediated by several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferon (IFN), that are essential for antiviral defense. In general, type I IFN signaling is well known to be able to trigger expression of several hundred of genes, involved in the blockage of viral entry, replication, translation and assembly, as well as modulate inflammation and adaptive immunity<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>. Type I IFN response is triggered at early stages of virus replicative cycle and its importance has being demonstrated in the mouse model of OROV disease<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> experiments have shown that IFN-β mRNA levels increase in the first hour post-infection and drop rapidly reaching very low levels at 24 hours post infection<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. However, how cytokine kinetics develops during human OROV fever has not yet been reported.</p> <p id="Par5">Thus, the present study aimed at investigating soluble immunological biomarkers including circulating cytokines and chemokines in early and late seroconverters along days after OROV fever onset. The results show conspicuous differences in the cytokine and chemokine levels between these two groups, which suggest that the innate immune response pattern harnessed by OROV is closely associated to seroconversion.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Serological status of patients with acute-phase OROV fever according to disease onset</div> <p id="Par6">In order to identify the profile of circulating IgM/IgG anti-OROV in patients with acute infection, serum samples from patients at different days upon disease onset were evaluated by MAC ELISA. Patients who were diagnosed as positive for OROV disease by RT-qPCR were subdivided as positive (IgM/IgGPos, n = 48) or negative (IgM/IgGNeg, n = 27) according to serology at baseline (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, top panel). The results demonstrated a profile characteristic of early and late seroconversion. Two clusters were observed when IgM/IgG titers were evaluated: (i) patients displaying high titers since the beginning of disease onset, classified as early seroconverters and (ii) patients showing high titers around 8 days after disease onset, considered as late seroconverters (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, middle panels). These two clusters were again subdivided into 4 groups according to days of disease onset: 1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11. IgM/IgG titers in early seroconverters were higher than late seroconverters at 1–3 and 4–7 subgroups. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Serological profile of circulating IgM/IgG in acute-phase OROV fever patients at different days upon disease onset. IgM/IgG titers were measured by MAC-ELISA and OROV patients classified as positive (n = 48) or negative (n = 27), according to the IgM/IgG serology at baseline (top graph). Antibody titers were determined along the days after disease onset and displayed in scatter plot as the continuous-time to depict two clusters of OROV fever patients classified as early and late seroconverters (middle graphs). Bars charts represent the mean titers with standard errors (reverse of serum dilution) of 4 subgroups of early and late seroconverters, according to days of disease onset (1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par14">Oropouche virus (OROV) stands out as the utmost prevalent <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> contagion in some northern South American countries and specially in the Amazon region. In these areas, OROV is endemic, nonetheless scarce information exists about the inflammatory response induced by OROV fever. The present study is the first comprehensive investigation on the chemokine and cytokine profile in early and late seroconverters with OROV fever. In regard to the initial responses triggered by OROV, the innate antiviral response induced by OROV is mediated by induction of type I IFN pathway through Interferon Regulatory Transcription Factors (IRF3 and IRF7), as well as interferon-α/β receptor, and Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein (MAVS), as evidenced in animal model-based studies<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. The OROV fever pathogenesis was in fact described as restricted by the IFN pathway-related signaling molecules MAVS, IRF-3, IRF-7 in non-myeloid cells<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. In line with these findings, a very elegant study demostrated that several <i>Orthobunyaviruses</i>, including: <i>Tacaiuma (TCMV), Guama (GMAV), Guaroa (GROV) and Caraparu (CARV)</i> viruses in addition to OROV are vulnerable to the antiviral attack mediated by Interferon-α in time and dose-dependent fashion<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a></sup>. In fact, OROV fever is restrained by the IFN pathway in wild-type mice. This is exemplified by the fact that IFN-α knockout mice display increased hepatic injury, significantly superior mortality and rapid progress of the disease<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>, as similar as previously observed into immunocompetent Syrian golden hamsters<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. It is important to underscore that although IFN-α is a useful universal biomarker for OROV fever, it should be considered together with other clinical and laboratorial records since several other viruses can also elicit IFN-α production.</p> <p id="Par15">In addition to IFN-induced responses, TNF signaling components such as TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) seem to be important for OROV innate immunity-mediated control. Conversely, as the infection progresses, these mediators are down-modulated in a virus-dependent manner. Possibly, the virus tries to escape the antiviral cellular pathways by increasing the expression of short non-coding cognate miRNAs<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. Thus, the only cytokine ever assessed during OROV fever was type I IFN and it has been demonstrated to be essential for resistance in mouse model.</p> <p id="Par16">In agreement with these findings, OROV patients presented higher levels of IFN-α indicating strong activation and lower levels of TNF and IL-10 than those by HD, regardless of antibody profile at baseline. IFN-α was the sole cytokine presented in higher levels in both early and late converter patients, as evidenced by the biomarker signatures. In fact, IFN-α was the only mediator present in all time-points upon disease onset and in both early and late seroconverters, indicating possibly that the type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses may not be directly connected to antibody production.</p> <p id="Par17">In the present study, we demonstrate that OROV fever patients with early and late seroconversion profile display divergent pattern of inflammatory response as assessed by measuring circulating chemokines and cytokines. The early seroconverters display high levels of CXCL8 and IL-5 in all time-points. The high production of IL-5 observed in early seroconverters is consistent with the role of this cytokine in inducing B cell activation and differentiation into antibody producing-plasma cells. This finding may suggest that these patients are ahead in the timeline of infection or this may reflect an intrinsic ability of certain hosts to mount a more robust immune response to OROV. Another possibility is that these early seroconverters may display a distinct serological pattern due to cross reactivity generated by previous infection with other <i>Orthobunyavirus</i>. The later hypothesis is less likely probable, considering that during serological screening at baseline seronegativity was observed for <i>Caraparu</i> and <i>Catu</i><i> viruses</i> (titers &amp;lt;1:40) for these patient subgroup and during follow up developed a strong seropositivity to OROV (titers from 1:640 to 1:1,280).</p> <p id="Par18">High producers of CXCL10 and IL-17 were a hallmark of OROV fever late seroconverters. However, as the levels of IL-17 were particularly low in all OROV patients tested, it is a challenge to validate this molecule as a biomarker for laboratorial follow up of OROV fever. On the other hand, substantial levels of CXCL10 were observed in late but not in early soroconverters. High levels of CXCL10 have been already reported in other virus infection<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. Similar pattern of production was observed for CCL2, a chemokine associated with monocyte recruitment, essential for viral clearance<sup><a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. In fact, CXCL10 and CCL2 are both closely associated with innate immune events that could support type I IFN responses. Taking into account these results herein obtained, it is clear that CXCL10 and CCL2 are also closely associated with immune response after a natural acquired <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> disease and could represent complementary biomarkers for OROV fever follow up in clinical practice.</p> <p id="Par19">The reasons for the different seroconversion profiles may be attributed to idiosyncratic events intrinsic to the divergent and miscegenated genetic background of the Brazilian population residing in the Amazon region, as well as to the abundant and diversified plethora of arboviruses, including different orthobunyaviruses with capacity to infect and cause disease in humans to which this population is under risk of exposition. It is plausible to hypothesize that preceding contact to different orthobunyavirus antigens may influence the immune response at least to acute-phase OROV fever. In fact, patients included in this study reside in an endemic area to several <i>Flaviviruses</i> such as <i>Dengue virus</i>, <i>Yellow fever</i><i>virus</i> and <i>Zika virus</i>, and potentially also to different <i>Orthobunyaviruses</i> such as groups C, <i>Guamá, Anopheles A, California</i>, and others, which have caused several seasonal and non-seasonal outbreaks with co-circulation of different arboviruses<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. Viremia is an interesting biomarker that would contribute to understand the different seroconversion profiles. However, no clear association was found amongst the viremia level and neither the chemokine/cytokine profile, nor the seroconversion status observed for the samples included in the present investigation (data not shown).</p> <p id="Par20">Aiming at determining whether the distinct seroconversion profile as well as chemokine/cytokine patterns were somehow associated with symptoms, we have performed several data mining approaches, but no association could be identified between single or combined clinical records and serum biomarkers. In fact, during OROV disease, the mechanisms underlying protection and pathogenesis have not been yet clearly defined. All in all, the present study has identified IFN-α as a universal biomarker of human OROV fever, while CXCL8 &amp;amp; IL-5 and CXCL10 &amp;amp; IL-17 were observed consistently in early and late seroconverters, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that production of IFN-α and CXCL10 precede the seroconversion bringing novel insights on disease pathogenesis i.e. the immunological events triggered by the OROV fever.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
