<p>Two different aberration detection algorithms were compared: Holtâ€“Winters generalized exponential smoothing (HW) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Ten different detection limits, or alarm thresholds, were tested for both algorithms. To avoid contamination of the baseline with cases from gradually increasing epidemics, a guard-band of 2 weeks was used between the baseline and the current value being evaluated.
