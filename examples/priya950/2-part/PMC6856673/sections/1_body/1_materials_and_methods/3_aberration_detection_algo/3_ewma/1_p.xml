<p>EWMA is the simplest form of exponential smoothing and it relies on cumulative differences between observed data in a time window and a threshold. It is based on the equation: E
 <sub>t</sub> = (1 – λ)
 <sup>t</sup> E
 <sub>0</sub> + Σ
 <sub>ti = 1</sub> (1 – λ)
 <sup>t</sup> λI
 <sub>t</sub> where λ is the smoothing parameter (&gt;0) that determines the relative weight of current data in relation to past data, I
 <sub>t</sub> is the observed value at time t, and E
 <sub>0</sub> is the starting value. EWMA is recommend only for stationary and normally distributed TS (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A 1 week differencing (i.e., computation of the difference between consecutive weekly time points) was used to remove the largest temporal effects present in the raw data. The differenced residuals were saved as a new TS. Autocorrelation and normality in the TS of residuals were assessed using ACF, PACF and normality Q-Q plot in order to evaluate whether pre-processing enabled transformation of the weekly auto-correlated TS into stationary and normally distributed TS. EWMA was then applied to the residual TS using a smoothing parameter λ of 0.2. The same constant values that were used for HW were also used for calculating the alarm thresholds for the EWMA algorithm.
