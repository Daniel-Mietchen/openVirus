<p>Three databases containing data from the Swiss national cattle population were used: (1) the 
 <italic>Swiss Animal Movement Database</italic> (AMD), (2) the database owned by the 
 <italic>Association of Swiss Cattle Breeders</italic> (ASR), and (3) the 
 <italic>Swiss Laboratory Information System</italic> (ALIS). The AMD has been studied and reported to have potential value for SyS because of its relatively high quality in terms of population representativeness and reporting timeliness (
