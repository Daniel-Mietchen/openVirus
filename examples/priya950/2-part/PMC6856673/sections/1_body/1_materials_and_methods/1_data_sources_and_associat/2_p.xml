<p>The AMD contains data on cattle mortalities, including stillbirths, reported by farmers to the Swiss national system for the identification and registration of cattle. All reported on-farm deaths and stillbirths for the period from January 1st 2009 to September 28th 2016 were extracted from the AMD. Since the reporting of on-farm deaths was mandatory, we can assume a high population coverage from this source over this period excepting for stillbirths. Stillbirths were defined as non-living fetuses expelled before the end of gestation, or calves born dead within 24 h following birth since mid-2014. Before that date, no official definition of a stillbirth existed in Switzerland. It is not mandatory to report every stillbirth to the AMD and the population coverage of this syndrome TS is unknown at the time of writing. Four syndrome TS were created from the AMD database. One was based on stillbirths (

 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves</italic>), 6 monthsâˆ’2 years (
