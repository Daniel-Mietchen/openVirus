<p>The ALIS database contains data from laboratory tests performed by the 25 accredited laboratories involved in the diagnosis of epizootics in Switzerland on behalf of the FSVO. All laboratory tests performed for the 70 notifiable epizootics of interest in Switzerland are collected in ALIS. The reporting timeliness (time between the sampling date and the date when the sample was received by a laboratory) was on average of 1 day. Data were analyzed from November 1st, 2013 to July 27th, 2016. All laboratory tests performed for mandatory reasons without any clinical suspicion were excluded (e.g., mandatory surveillance programs, importation, vaccination, research activities). One syndrome TS was created containing counts of stillbirth samples sent to the accredited laboratories

 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic>) and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic>). Suspicious cases were individual cattle and they were always confirmed (or negated) with an FSVO approved laboratory test.
