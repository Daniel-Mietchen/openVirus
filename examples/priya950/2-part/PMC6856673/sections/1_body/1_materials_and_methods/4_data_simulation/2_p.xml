<p>Twenty five different epidemics types were simulated based on five different epidemic shapes and five epidemic magnitudes (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Appendix 1</xref>). Five epidemic shapes representing different temporal progressions of an epidemic within a population were created, based on (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>): single spike, flat, linear, exponential, and log normal. The length of all simulated epidemics was fixed at 12 weeks except for the epidemic shape “single spike” which lasted only 1 week. We choose an epidemic length of 12 weeks (3 months) because we were interested in evaluating the syndrome time series for early epidemic detection. We were not interested in alarms after 12 weeks as in our opinion these would not qualify as early detection. Epidemic magnitude represents the severity of the epidemic and was defined as the maximum number of additional cases added to the weekly epidemic-free baseline during the epidemic time period. In this context a case equals a diseased animal reported in the data. Five different epidemic magnitudes were tested: 25, 50, 150, 300, and 500 corresponding, respectively, to very small, small, medium, large, and very large epidemics. The magnitudes represented the maximum number of extra cases added per week to the epidemic-free baseline during the epidemic time period. As an example, for an epidemic with a magnitude of “150”; 150 cases were added to the epidemic-free baseline at the peak of the epidemic which was on week number 12 of the epidemic time period. Smaller numbers of epidemic cases were also inserted for each of the 11 weeks prior to the epidemic peak. The exact number of extra cases added to the epidemic-free baseline for the pre-peak weeks was calculated according to the different epidemic shapes (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for details). For the “single spike” epidemic, which lasted 1 week, the epidemic magnitude always represented the total number of cases in the epidemic.
