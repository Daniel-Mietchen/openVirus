<p>We simulated epidemic-free baseline TS for each syndrome using the model predictions obtained from the best fitting HW model that was developed using the data available before 2016. The mean fitted value for each week of the year was used as the mean of weekly Poisson distributions (one for each week of the year). We then randomly sampled from each weekly Poisson distribution to simulate 300 epidemic-free baseline TS for each syndrome.</p>
