<p>Three hundred epidemics of each type were simulated and randomly inserted within the 300 simulated baselines. Only one epidemic was inserted per simulated baseline to avoid epidemic overlap. Each simulated baseline was used 25 times to detect 25 different epidemics types characterized by different epidemic shapes and magnitudes. In other words, to assess the algorithms and time series capacities to detect a certain epidemic shape of a certain magnitude, 300 different simulated baselines were used. The process and resulting syndrome TS are presented in
