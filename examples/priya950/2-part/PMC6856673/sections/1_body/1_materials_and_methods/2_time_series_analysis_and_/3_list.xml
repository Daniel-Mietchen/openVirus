  <p>Annual seasonality: none when no monthly effect identified. When there was a monthly effect, the strength of the seasonality was assessed based on the value of F
   <sub>s</sub> (
   <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) calculated as equal to 1–Var (R)/Var(S + R). Var (R) is the variance of the remainder component of the syndrome TS and Var (S + R) is the variance of the detrended syndrome TS. Seasonality was considered to be weak when F
   <sub>s</sub> was below 0.5, and strong when it was ≥0.5;
