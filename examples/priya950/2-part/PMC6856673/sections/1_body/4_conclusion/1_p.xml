<p>Our study results demonstrate that syndrome TS are not all of equal value for early epidemic detection. Event detection performance is dependent on the characteristics of the syndrome TS, the nature of the epidemic being targeted, and the event detection algorithm. Final selection of specific syndrome TS for inclusion in an operational SyS system will be dependent on the performance characteristics of the syndrome TS and also on the goals of the surveillance initiative. It is not possible to set specific decision rules that can apply to all situations. However, the results of our study suggest that surveillance system designers should carefully assess each candidate syndrome TS before including it in their early epidemic surveillance system. The assessment should include fitting an optimal event detection algorithm to the syndrome TS and then evaluating the detection performance of the syndrome TS-algorithm pair on a variety of epidemic types. Only those syndrome TS which have acceptable performance for epidemics types that are similar to epidemics of the disease under surveillance should be included in the SyS system. Evaluating the ability of syndrome TS for early detection of epidemics is essential for selecting syndrome TS for a syndromic surveillance system, as early epidemic detection is the central task of syndromic surveillance.</p>
