<p>Seven of the syndrome TS in this study had a linear trend and all 16 syndrome TS had seasonality, however, the syndrome TS peaked in different seasons (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The main differences between these syndrome TS were the length of historical data available, which ranged from slightly less than 3 years to more than 7 years; and the average number of reports per week that varied from a low of 2.6 for 
 <italic>ASR_OTHER_calves</italic> to a high of 891 for 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves</italic>. An interesting observation was that in general the coefficient of variation (CV) was greater for syndrome TS with smaller average weekly counts. All syndrome TS with counts &gt;100 counts/week had on average a CV of &lt;0.30. All syndrome TS with average weekly counts around or &lt;100 had CV values of &gt;0.39.
