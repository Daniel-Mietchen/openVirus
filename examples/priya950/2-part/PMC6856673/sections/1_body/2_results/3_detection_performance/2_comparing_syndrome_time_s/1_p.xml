<p>The optimal alarm threshold for the optimal algorithm previously selected for each syndrome TS was estimated as the alarm threshold where 
 <italic>Se</italic> and 
 <italic>Sp</italic> were at a maximum. This assumes equal costs for false negative and false positive alarms. The detection performances obtained at the optimal alarm thresholds are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>,
