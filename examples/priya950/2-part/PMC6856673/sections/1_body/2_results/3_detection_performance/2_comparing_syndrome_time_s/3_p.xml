<p>Small epidemics were detected earlier on average than very small epidemics but with a higher number of cumulative cases. This is consistent with the method used for simulating the epidemics. The three syndrome TS with the largest weekly baseline counts (i.e., 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves, ASR_adults, AMD_stillbirth</italic>) tended to detect small and very small epidemics later and with a higher average cumulative number of cases at the time of detection than syndrome TS with smaller weekly baseline counts. Only half of the syndrome TS were able to detect very small epidemics (i.e., magnitude 25) with a sensitivity above 85%. However, all syndrome TS except 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves</italic> detected more than 85% of the small epidemics (i.e., magnitude 50). Time-series with high weekly counts were very poor for detecting very small and small epidemics. Only syndrome TS with small weekly counts detected more than 90% of the very small epidemics. The syndrome TS with the highest average number of reports per week, 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves</italic>, detected only 60.6% of these epidemics. Only the syndrome TS with &lt;200 counts per week on average could detect more than 90% of the small epidemics
