<p>To test the theory that changing the alarm threshold may increase detection performance, we modified the alarm threshold for the 11 aberration detection algorithm-syndrome TS pairs that did not detect more than 90% of the very small epidemics. The smallest alarm threshold able to provide a sensitivity for very small epidemics equal to or above 90 % was defined as the optimized alarm threshold. The new detection performances obtained with this optimized alarm threshold are presented in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Most of the syndrome TS were able to detect more than 90% of the very small epidemics by using the optimized alarm threshold. However, three time series 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves, ASR_adults</italic>, and 
 <italic>AMD_stillbirth</italic> were never able to reach this level of detection performance even when using a very low alarm threshold (i.e., 0.05 times the standard error of the prediction). In addition, increasing the sensitivity for very small epidemics reduced the overall specificity of the detection. For example the specificity of 
 <italic>AMD_Stillbirth</italic> dropped from 90.2 to 82.1% when the alarm threshold changed from 0.5 to 0.05 times the standard error of the prediction, resulting in more than 7 false alarms per year.
