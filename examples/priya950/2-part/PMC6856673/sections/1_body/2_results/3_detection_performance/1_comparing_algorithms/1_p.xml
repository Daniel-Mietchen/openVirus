<p>As expected, both aberration detection algorithms performed better with large epidemics as compared to small epidemics (i.e., higher sensitivity, specificity, and detection timeliness). Flat epidemics were always detected with higher sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness than log normal and linear increases. Single spikes and exponential increases had the worst performance and were the epidemic shapes most difficult to detect for both algorithms. There was no difference in the performance of the two algorithms for different epidemic shapes (see
