<p>The HW algorithm performed better detection for the following time series: 
 <italic>AMD_stillbirth, AMD_mortality_calves, AMD_mortality_adults, ASR_OTHER_adults, ALIS_abortion, ASR_GI_calves, ASR_calves, ASR_RESPI_calves, ASR_RESPI_adults, ASR_GI_adults</italic>, and 
 <italic>ASR_adults</italic>. This algorithm was thus considered to be the optimal algorithm for these syndrome TS, and was used for all further analyses of these syndrome TS. Whereas, the EWMA algorithm demonstrated better detection performance with the syndrome TS: 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_young</italic> and 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic>. The detection timeliness of 
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic> were equivalent for both HW and EWMA, but the overall sensitivity and specificity was slightly better with HW. HW was chosen as the most appropriate aberration detection algorithm for 
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic>.
