<p>The fitting and prediction performance of HW for each syndrome TS is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Appendix 2.A</xref>. The HW method removed most of the autocorrelations present in the raw data but sporadic autocorrelations remained. The HW method correctly predicted the values of the validation dataset. However, the accuracy of the predictions varied a lot depending on the syndrome TS evaluated (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Appendix 2.A</xref>).
