<p>Autocorrelation function plots of the 1 week differencing for the 16 syndrome TS are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Appendix 2.B</xref>. All the syndrome TS had similar results and 1 week differencing removed most of the autocorrelations present in the raw syndrome TS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Appendix 2.C</xref>). Some autocorrelations remained, especially at lag 1. One-week differencing did not remove this residual autocorrelation and even produced some residual TS with a higher number of significant autocorrelations. The syndrome TS created with 1 week differencing were used to implement the aberration detection algorithm EWMA.
