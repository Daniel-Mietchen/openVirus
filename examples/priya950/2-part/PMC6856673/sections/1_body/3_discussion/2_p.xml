<p>The two detection algorithms used in this study were selected because they are easy to automate and they can be implemented on short baseline TS and (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We expected to see differences in detection performance between the two algorithms for the different epidemic shapes. The EWMA algorithm has been reported to perform well for detecting small but repeated differences between observed and expected values, as seen in flat or linear epidemics (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Holt-Winters method has been reported to be more effective for detecting large epidemics with a sudden increase in cases such as in single peak or exponential epidemics (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These performance differences were not supported by the results of our study. Somewhat unexpectedly, we identified optimal algorithms for each syndrome TS that performed equally well across all epidemic shapes. The HW algorithm outperformed the EWMA algorithm for most of the syndrome TS (i.e., 14 out of 16 syndrome TS) which confirms reports from previous studies (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, the EWMA algorithm outperformed the HW algorithm on the 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_young</italic>, and 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic> syndrome TS. This may partially be explained by the high mean weekly counts in these syndrome TS combined with the poor data forecasting performance of the HW algorithm. The latter may be at least partly due to the complex temporal patterns observed in these syndrome TS (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) which has been reported to make the HW algorithm less well-adapted to TS (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). There are many other methods available for aberration detection and some of these could also be used for TS selection [see for example (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)]. Adding information about the total cattle population under surveillance and working with proportions instead of count data could also be tested to take into account shifts in submissions and possibly improve detection performance. In addition, testing different values of the smoothing parameters for the EMWA algorithm could be explored for improving detection performance. However, longer historical syndrome TS would be needed to develop better models, especially for syndrome TS in the ALIS database which had &lt;3 years of data.
