<p>The objective of the SyS system currently being developed in Switzerland is to detect an epidemic of any disease in the Swiss cattle population. Based on our approach and results, most of the syndrome TS considered in this study may have value for this SyS system. Indeed, it was possible to accurately and timely detect small changes occurring in most of the syndrome TS considered. Our results also indicated that some syndrome TS should be excluded from an early detection SyS system because of their poor detection performance. This is the case for the syndrome TS 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic> and 
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic>. However, they may have value for other surveillance purposes. The syndrome TS extracted from the AMD dataset also performed poorly and their usefulness for early epidemic detection is questionable. Except for the 
 <italic>AMD_stillbirth</italic>, syndrome TS, all other syndrome TS from the AMD dataset consisted of counts of cattle mortalities. Cattle mortalities may not be the best indicator for early disease detection. To obtain a detectable signal in these syndrome TS, the excess mortality from an epidemic in the population would have to be high. High mortality is easily noticed by veterinarians or farmers and would likely be reported through traditional passive surveillance. Smaller epidemics caused by diseases with low mortality could remain unnoticed or signals may not be generated in these syndrome TS until late in the course of an epidemic. However, cattle mortality syndrome TS may be of interest for investigating the consequences of an epidemic. The objective of our study was to present a method that surveillance practitioners could use to help select syndrome TS-event detection pairs for inclusion in a surveillance system. The method estimates the minimum size of various types of simulated epidemics that could potentially be detected in syndrome TS-event detection pairs. We wish to point out that this is not the only evaluation criterion that should be used to select TS for inclusion in a SyS system. Before drawing any final conclusion regarding which syndrome TS to include in the Swiss SyS system, other selection criteria such as the representativeness and quality of the data should be carefully considered (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For example, the ASR data that we used did not contain data about the Swiss beef cattle population, which might reduce the benefit of this data sources for disease early detection. Assessing the population coverage of this data source would be essential before including this data source in a national surveillance system. The lack of consistency in the definition of stillbirth in the AMD data may also be an issue and might lead to inconsistent data reporting. We recommend a holistic approach that considers all TS characteristics. The criterion “the minimum size of event that could be detected in syndrome TS-event detection pairs” that we presented in this study should be only one of the criteria considered. In addition, in this study TS were evaluated individually but in future studies it would be interesting to evaluate TS together using multivariate aberration detection algorithms.
