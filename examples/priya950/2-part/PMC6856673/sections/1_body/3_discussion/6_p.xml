<p>The epidemics used in our study were simulated as vectors containing a fixed number of extra epidemic cases, which were added to all epidemic free baseline syndrome TS. This method proposed by Lotze et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) was chosen because it allows the creation of standardized simulated epidemics that are constant for all syndrome TS being evaluated. Using standardized epidemics allows for the direct comparison of the performance of different syndrome TS. For example, a “small” epidemic will have the same number of epidemic cases when it is inserted into either a small (having a small mean number of cases per unit of time) or large (having a large mean number of cases per unit time) baseline syndrome TS. The size of the inserted epidemic will also be constant for baseline syndrome TS, which have small or large variation in the number of cases per unit of time. The other commonly reported method for epidemic simulation defines the number of epidemic cases as a multiple of the standard deviation of the baseline syndrome TS [see for example (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)]. Both approaches are perfectly suitable for epidemic simulation and the choice of one or the other depends on user preferences (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the second method may not be as easy to use for the direct comparison of syndrome TS that have different standard deviations. Difficulty arises because the size of the simulated epidemics inserted into syndrome TS with different standard deviations will not be the same. For example, a simulated epidemic with a magnitude 2 times the standard deviation will produce 20 epidemic cases for a syndrome TS with a standard deviation of 10, and 200 epidemic cases for a syndrome TS with a standard deviation of 100. Computationally the two methods are comparable because transforming a multiple of the standard deviation into the corresponding number of extra cases and vise versa is quite straightforward. However, interpreting epidemics based on multiples of standard deviations is more difficult and may in some situations result in misleading interpretations of detection performance. For example, consider the case where an algorithm has been shown to detect more than 90% of small simulated epidemics and where the small simulated epidemic magnitude equals 2 times the standard deviation of the syndrome TS being evaluated. This detection performance may appear sufficient for detecting small epidemics, but if the standard deviation of the syndrome TS was quite large, it could mean that only large epidemics were being detected. When the objective of syndrome TS evaluation is to operationalize a SyS system for field use, we recommend the approach used in our study, where each type of simulated epidemic has a constant number of cases for all syndrome TS being evaluated. This approach more closely resembles field situations where we expect the size of an epidemic to have no relationship to the standard deviation of a syndrome TS. It also closely aligns with the way that surveillance practitioners characterize epidemics, which is by counting cases to map epidemic growth and geographic spread. They do not characterize epidemic growth in terms of increases in the number of standard deviations of the baseline case TS.
