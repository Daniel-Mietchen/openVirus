<p>In Switzerland, a cattle disease SyS system is currently being designed to meet the goals of the “Swiss Animal Health Strategy 2010+,”

 </xref> which aims to maintain and improve the high standard of animal health in the country. The purpose of the SyS system is to detect abnormal health events such as disease epidemics occurring in the Swiss cattle population by monitoring syndrome TS extracted from a central database maintained by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). The objective of our study was to evaluate different syndrome TS as candidates for inclusion in the system. Data quality and population coverage should be always carefully assessed before including a TS into a SyS system (

Since the goal of SyS is early detection of epidemics, our study focused on estimating the minimum size of simulated epidemic that can be detected in syndrome TS-event detection pairs, as a criterion for inclusion in a SyS system. To standardize the comparisons between syndrome TS-event detection pairs, we created a standard set of simulated epidemics of various shapes and sizes and used this standard set to compare the performance of all syndrome TS-event detection pairs. Our study objective differs from other studies that focus on evaluating the performance of event detection algorithms only. For practical purposes, the combined performance of an event detection algorithm operating on a specific syndrome TS should be more useful to surveillance system designers.
