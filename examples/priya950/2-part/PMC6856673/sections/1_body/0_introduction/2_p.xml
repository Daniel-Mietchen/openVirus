<p>Constant improvements in data science and computer technology have favored the development and implementation of SyS systems by facilitating data acquisition, and analysis. The number of operational SyS systems has constantly increased during the last decades in both human and veterinary medicine (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). By simultaneously assessing information from different data sources related to different populations and/or symptoms, one can improve epidemic detection and in particular, the sensitivity and the specificity of epidemic detection (

Defining which syndromes to monitor in order to maximize detection performance is very challenging and has been recently identified as one of the research priorities in SyS (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, when the objectives are broad, for example to detect not only known diseases of interest, but also new, emerging, exotic or unknown endemic diseases, they are of little help for selecting the most appropriate syndrome TS.
