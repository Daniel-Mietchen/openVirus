   <p>This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial.</p>

   <p>The pragmatic trial design more accurately reflects routine clinical care in a hospital setting.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>This is a highly relevant clinical question currently given the variable use of influenza testing and neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical practice, the ongoing threat of further influenza pandemics, the recent development of novel influenza antivirals and the undefined role of influenza point-of-care testing in acute respiratory illness during seasonal influenza.</p>

   <p>The inclusion, of some patients lacking capacity and older patients often with multiple comorbidities, makes the trial population generalisable to a secondary care population.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>There is ongoing uncertainty however as to how the suggested ‘test-and-treat’ strategy could be best implemented in clinical practice.</p>
