<p>Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are recommended by Public Health England (PHE) and WHO guidelines for all hospitalised adults with suspected and proven influenza infection.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although there have been no randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of NAIs in this group, well-controlled observational data suggest that the treatment of influenza with NAIs reduces mortality in hospitalised adults, especially when commenced rapidly.
