<p>The FilmArray respiratory panel 2 (BioFire Diagnostics, Utah, USA) uses nested real-time PCR to detect around 20 respiratory viruses. The FilmArray requires only 2 min of ‘hands on’ time and produces a test result in around 45 min.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The FilmArray respiratory panel 2 is both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared and CE in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) marked. The viral pathogens detected by the FilmArray respiratory panel 2 include: influenza A (H1 and H3), influenza B, adenovirus, coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43) human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (types 1–4) and respiratory syncytial virus.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> The FilmArray respiratory panel is broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, and has been validated on nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, lower respiratory tract samples and on samples from immunocompromised patients.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–30</xref> These studies also show high reliability, ease of use and short turnaround times.
