<p>In addition to being focused on patient and healthcare organisation outcomes, this clinical research is strongly aligned with several global research priority initiatives including WHOâ€™s Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and the UK national report into antibiotic resistance.
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The BRaVe initiative aims to catalyse multidisciplinary research on strategies to prevent and treat medically important respiratory virus infections with the goal of timely integration of research advances into public health practice. Priority areas identified include improving diagnostic tests for viral respiratory illness and improving the clinical management of patients with acute respiratory viral illness, both addressed by this study. With the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to global public heath, there is increasing need for the research and development of interventions which can help avoid unnecessary antibiotics use.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The data that will be generated by this trial regarding the impact of influenza POCT on antibiotic prescribing is highly aligned with this global initiative.
