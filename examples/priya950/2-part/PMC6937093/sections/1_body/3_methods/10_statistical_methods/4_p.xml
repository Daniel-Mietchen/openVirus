<p>Summaries of all baseline characteristics will be presented using means and SD, medians and IQRs, or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. The intervention and control groups will be compared using ORs and differences in proportions for equality of proportions for binary data (eg, proportion of cases of influenza detected) and using independent-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate for continuous data (eg, duration of antibiotics, test turnaround time, etc).</p>
