<p>The study will recruit up to 840 patientâ€“participants: about 280 per season for three consecutive influenza seasons. With 1:1 allocation to groups, there will be 420 patients per group. On the conservative assumption of a 25% positivity rate for influenza during influenza season (ie, ~100 influenza-positive patients in each group), the group sizes would give a 90% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a difference of 20% in appropriate NAI use (from 65% to 85%) and an 80% power to detect a difference of 17%. In our previous work, 91% of influenza-positive patients randomised to POCT were appropriately treated with NAI versus 65% with routine clinical care, a difference of 26% (95%CI 10 to 43). We suspect that the difference may be larger in this study as there will likely be a number of undiagnosed (and therefore untreated) cases in the control group revealed by testing them with the FilmArray at a later date. In the event of higher numbers of influenza-positive patients being recruited in the first two seasons, the study may be stopped prematurely (once ~100 influenza-positive patients have been recruited to the intervention group).</p>
