<p>Certain secondary outcome measures will be measured both in the entire cohort (ITT population) and in the influenza-infected cohort (the ITTI population) while others will only be measured in the ITTI population, as detailed in the outcome section. The intervention and control groups will be compared as per the primary outcome for equality of proportions for binary data and using t-tests and non-parametric equivalent tests for continuous data (eg, turnaround time) as appropriate.</p>
