<p>Participants are identified in the AMU and ED according to eligibility criteria by research staff. Following gaining written consent, participants are immediately randomised to the intervention group or the control group. For those patients randomised to the intervention group, a nose/throat swab is collected by a study doctor or research nurse and this is tested on the FilmArray machine. If the patient is able to produce a sputum sample, this sample will also be tested on the FilmArray machine. Results are generated in approximately 45â€‰min and are immediately communicated to the clinical team. Clinical data are collected prospectively and retrospectively for both groups. Further nose/throat swabs, sputum samples and blood tests may be collected from patients who remain inpatients on serial follow-up visits up to day 14.</p>
