<p>These patients will be managed according to standard clinical care as directed by their treating clinicians. Laboratory respiratory virus testing will be at the discretion of the responsible clinical team and where performed will be using laboratory PCR (in the onsite laboratory). The respiratory samples collected at enrolment will be stored at −80°C and subsequently tested by the FilmArray respiratory panel at least 30 days after collection. This will allow direct comparison of pathogens between the groups (ie, an estimate of missed diagnoses in the routine clinical care group) but will not influence participant care.</p>
