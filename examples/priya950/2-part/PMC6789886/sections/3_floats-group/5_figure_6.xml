  <p>Vaccine-induced antibodies do not cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A schematic figure representing a specific response against a virus that has been completely opsonised by neutralizing antibody (
   <bold>a</bold>) and when ZIKV is recognised by non-neutralizing antibodies, the antibody binding will not be to neutralise the 
   <italic>flavivirus</italic>, but instead it will help the viral uptake without destruction via phagolysosomes allowing cellular infection (
   <bold>b</bold>). The ADE assay was conducted with stimulated (
   <bold>c</bold>) as well as unstimulated THP-1 cells (
   <bold>d</bold>). Note: for ADE test, two independent experiments were performed.
