  <p>CuMVtt-EDIII formulated in DOPS indices highest total IgG responses. The figure shows IgGs level of three different groups of mice vaccinated with EDIII alone formulated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), with vaccine formulated by coupling EDIII to VLP (CuMVtt-EDIII) or formulating CuMVtt-EDIII plus DOPS adjuvant. The assessment was done with sera collected three weeks after each vaccination. The results were analysed using GraphPad Prism software applied to assess the means of three groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values observed in the negative control group (vaccinated with only PBS) were subtracted from the titres of the other experimental groups. Note: *
