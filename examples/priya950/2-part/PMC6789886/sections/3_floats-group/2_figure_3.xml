  <p>Subclasses of IgG. The figure shows the specific subclasses of IgG induced by each vaccine from samples collected three weeks after the third vaccination (Day 63). The group of mice vaccinated with only EDIII predominantly produced IgG1 while EDIII coupled to VLP (CuMVtt-EDIII) also induced IgG2a and IgG2b. When DOPS adjuvant was ad-mixed, this skewing towards IgG2a and b was even more pronounced. The results were analysed using GraphPad Prism software applied to assess the means of three groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values observed in the negative control group were subtracted from the titres of the other experimental groups. Note: **
