<p>The CuMVttVLP production was previously described in detail [
 <xref rid="B31-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Concisely, the CuMVttVLP was expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> BL21 (DE3) Star (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and purification was done by using the soluble part of the cell lysates. The purified CuMVttVLP was covalently conjugated with E-DIII protein by previously adding 1 mg/mL of VLP in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, and 30% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) sucrose, at pH 7.2 (PES buffer) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. At the same time, the chemical cross-linker SMPH (succinimidyl-6-(b-maleimidopropionamido) hexanoate) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added at a concentration of 10-fold molar excess. Afterward, the unreacted SMPH was removed by diafiltration. In parallel to linking CuMVttVLP with SMPH, the E-DIII protein was incubated with 
 <italic>N</italic>-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) for 30 min at room temperature. The SATA excess that did not react with E-DIII was removed by diafiltration and then hydroxylamine was added and incubated for three hours at room temperature to induce reactive sulphydryl residues in the E-DIII protein. After that, the protein was once more diafiltrated and covalently linked to CuMVttVLP-SMPH by mixing with an equimolar amount and incubated for four hours at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained with CuMVttVLP only and with E-DIII displayed on it. For that, the AFM imaging was carried out in an ambient environment at room temperature employing Nanosurf FlexAFM scan head (100 Î¼m scan range) with C3000 controller using PPP-NCHAuD cantilevers (Nanosensors) in dynamic mode. Obtained images were processed using Gwyddion software.
