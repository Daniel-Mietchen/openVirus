<p>The production of IgG antibodies was analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific, Nottingham, UK) were coated with 100 µL of E-DIII protein at a concentration of 1 µg/mL previously diluted in 50 mM carbonate buffer (CBB) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day the ELISA plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and subsequently coated with 200 µL of PBS Casein 0.5% as a blocking agent. After two hours of blocking, the sera mice samples were added and a serial dilution was performed, first with a 1 in 100 dilution and then eleven 1:3 dilutions. As a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse total IgG HRP conjugate (ThermoFisher, Paisley, UK) was added. The specific IgG subtypes used were goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b HRP coupled (ThermoFisher, Paisley, UK). The antibody dilution was 1:2000 and incubated for two hours at room temperature. The reaction was developed by adding 100 µL per well of TMB substrate (Sigma-Aldrich/ Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 10 min in the dark, and then stopped with 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid) before reading the plates using a microplate reader at 450 nm. The antibody titers are shown as dilutions leading to half-maximal OD (OD
 <sub>50</sub>) and the values observed in the negative control group were subtracted from the titres of the vaccinated groups.
