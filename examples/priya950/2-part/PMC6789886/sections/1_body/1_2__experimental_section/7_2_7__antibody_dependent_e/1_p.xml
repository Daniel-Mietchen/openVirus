<p>The ADE test was performed using THP-1 cells, obtained from ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> and cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 μM beta-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 U/mL, Lonza), streptomycin (100 μg/mL, Lonza), and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco/ ThermoFisher, Paisley, UK) (R10F) at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. The ADE assay was conducted with unstimulated as well as with stimulated/differentiated THP-1 cells. The mature macrophage-like state was induced by treating THP-1 cells (10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) for 72 h. Subsequently, the cells were maintained for 48 h in fresh R10F lacking PMA. After that, serial two-fold dilutions of the sera from vaccinated mice were made and dengue virus type 2/NGC strain (P7) was added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1. The pan-
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> monoclonal antibody and pool of serum from mice infected with rabies virus were used as controls. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with unstimulated (10
 <sup>5</sup>) and stimulated cells. After an incubation period of 2 h, the mixture was removed, cells washed twice with R10F and further incubated in fresh medium for another 48 h. To measure ADE, RNA was isolated from the supernatant and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted as previously described [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, a one-step qRT-PCR was performed using primers and probes directed against the 3′UTR, derived from Drosten et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix (4×) was used with 15 pmol of primers and 10 pmol of probes and an additional 25 mM of MgCl2 was added. The cycling program consisted of 5 min at 50 °C, then 20 s at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The RNA copy numbers in each sample were calculated from a standard curve generated from run-off 3′-UTR transcripts.
