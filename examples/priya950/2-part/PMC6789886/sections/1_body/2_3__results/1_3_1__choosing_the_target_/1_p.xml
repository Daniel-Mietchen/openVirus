<p>The development of vaccines against flaviviruses represents a particular challenge, as antibodies that are poorly neutralizing but cross-reactive between different 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> species and/or serotypes may cause enhanced viral replication. Therefore, it is essential to use epitopes for immunization that maximize neutralization and minimize cross-reactivity. It has been shown for DENV that domain III of the envelope proteins (EDIII) is a target for strongly neutralizing and poorly cross-reactive antibodies. Consequently, EDIII-specific antibodies should not cause ADE. The same observation has recently been made for ZIKV, where again the EDIII-domain was recognized by highly neutralizing, but poorly cross-reactive antibodies not causing ADE [

 <italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV), another 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, induced highly neutralizing and protective antibodies in mice when displayed on VLPs [
