<p>We therefore expressed the EDIII of ZIKV with a small linker containing a free Cys for chemical coupling in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). We analysed CuMVttVLP alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), as well as CuMVttVLP coupled to E-DIII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) by Atomic force microscopy (AFM). To further enhance immunogenicity, the vaccine-candidate was formulated in DOPS, which has previously been shown to enhance immunogenicity of CuMVtt-based vaccines [
