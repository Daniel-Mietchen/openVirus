<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the group of mice vaccinated with VLP-EDIII+DOPS developed antibody responses able to neutralise the ZIKV after two vaccinations (Day 42). In contrast, mice vaccinated with VLP-EDIII without adjuvant generated humoral immunity able to neutralise the virus only after three vaccinations; at a similar level seen with DOPS formulated vaccine after two injections. Thus, DOPS enhances both the speed and the magnitude of the response. In addition, EDIII protein alone without VLP-conjugation and adjuvant was not able to induce measurable levels of neutralizing antibodies.
