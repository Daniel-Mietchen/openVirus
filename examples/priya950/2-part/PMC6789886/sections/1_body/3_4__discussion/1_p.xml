<p>The widespread outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas and its causal association with severe congenital disease stimulated research on the development of save and effective vaccines. Several platforms were evaluated especially for their ability to stimulate ZIKV-specific, non-enhancing antibodies. Several studies have shown that immune responses to ZIKV were similar to responses induced against other flaviviruses such as DENV or WNV. Specifically, it has been shown that neutralising antibodies are directed primarily against the E protein and are associated with protection against infection [

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, due to the extensive cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, cross-reactive antibodies may result in enhancement of infection or disease with ZIKV or DENV [

 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study we have shown that a VLPs vaccine candidate carrying ZIKV E-DIII induced neutralizing antibodies, but no enhancement against DENV-2 was observed.
