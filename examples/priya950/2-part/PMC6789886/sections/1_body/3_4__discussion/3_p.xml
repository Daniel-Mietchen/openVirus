<p>Immunogenicity of the candidate ZIKV vaccine was tested in Balb/C mice. We wanted to understand the subclass distribution since that would indirectly indicate the type of Th cell (Th1 versus Th2) response induced by the vaccine. IgG1 responses are usually associated with Th2 responses, whereas high levels of Ig2a and IgG2b are believed to reflect Th1 responses [
 <xref rid="B50-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The response elicited by the CuMVttVLPs-EDIII candidate vaccine showed high levels of multiple IgG1 subclass, indicating a Th2 response, whereas the presence of the adjuvant (DOPS) appeared to strongly regulate IgG2b production, reflecting adjuvant-dependent Th1 responses. It is interesting to note that IgG1 represents the predominant subclass generated by most adjuvants independent of the mouse strain. Our data support a modulatory effect of the adjuvant on the Th1/Th2 balance.
