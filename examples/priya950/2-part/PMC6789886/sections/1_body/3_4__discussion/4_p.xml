<p>The differential potential of different IgG subclasses to bind and activate the complement system is well described [
 <xref rid="B51-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Several studies have shown that complement could neutralize several flaviviruses in an antibody-dependent and independent way [
 <xref rid="B52-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that certain IgG subclasses could trigger complement-dependent neutralization and therefore result in higher neutralizing titers. We have shown that complement alone can inactivate ZIKV and DENV (unpublished) and, therefore, we did not study complement-dependent neutralization in our study. Clearly, more efforts should be deployed to develop assays, which allow discrimination of IgG subclass dependent and independent complement activation and neutralization.
