<p>There are many different adjuvant classes available. A recently described adjuvant is derived from Phosphatidylserine (PS), which is a natural and degradable component found on the inner side of plasma membranes and are translocated to the outer side when apoptosis occurs. PS serves as a surface signalling molecule that can flag apoptotic cells for recognition by phagocytic cells [
