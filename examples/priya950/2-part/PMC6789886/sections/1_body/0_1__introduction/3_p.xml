<p>Most preclinical and clinical programs aimed to develop vaccines against ZIKV have focused on attenuated or inactivated viruses as well as viral and DNA-vectors [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Use of recombinant proteins or specific epitopes for vaccine development has gained less attention. The best example of antigens causing cross-reactive antibodies are the non-structural (NS), pre-membrane (PrM) and part of envelope (E) proteins, in particular the domain I (E-DI) and II (E-DII). In contrast, the E-DIII domain may be the best target for ZIKV vaccine development, as antibodies recognising this domain are largely specific for each

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, like other subunit antigens, E-DIII has a low inherent immunogenicity. For that reason, optimal epitope display and the use of adjuvants is crucial, as these factors play an important role in the potentiation of immunological responses induced by vaccines [

 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Repetitive display on virus-like particles (VLPs) is a potent way to enhance the immunogenicity of epitopes [

 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Recently we described a novel vaccine platform consisting of VLPs derived from 
 <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CuMV), which was modified to incorporate a universal Th cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin (CuMVtt) to enhance antibody responses in individuals previously immunized against tetanus [
 <xref rid="B31-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Immunogenicity of antigens displayed on VLPs is further enhanced due to the packaged RNA, which serves as a ligand for TLR7/8, stimulating B cells directly and driving IgG responses towards higher levels and more protective subclasses [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as more potent secondary plasma cells [
