<p>ZIKV shares considerable genetic and structural similarity with other flaviviruses, for example, 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV) [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which is also transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Consequently, it might be presumed that the best strategy would be to develop a vaccine against all flaviviruses that circulate within the same ecological niche. However, this endeavour is complicated by the fact that poorly neutralizing antibodies that cross-react between several 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> types can cause a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Such cross-reactive antibodies that induce ADE are particularly well described for DENV. They are poorly neutralizing but can enhance viral uptake and infection by the Fc receptor (FcR+) cells and consequently contribute to virus replication, which may lead to enhanced infection in vitro [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Clinically, it is well established that previous infection with a different DENV serotype may predispose to a more serious disease such as haemorrhagic fever. Even so, the mechanism that causes such disease enhancement is not completely clear, cross-reactive antibodies causing ADE in vitro and in preclinical mouse models are likely candidates. In addition, it is thought that secondary infection activate memory T cell responses, which may cause a cytokine storm and a more severe form of the disease, in particular in the presence of enhanced viral replication caused by cross-reactive ADE antibodies [
