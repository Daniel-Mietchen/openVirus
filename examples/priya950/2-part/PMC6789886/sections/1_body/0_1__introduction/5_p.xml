<p>In this study, we developed a vaccine-candidate against ZIKV by coupling E-DIII to CuMVttVLP and formulating the product with DOPS adjuvant. This vaccine was able to induce antibodies efficiently and neutralise the virus without predisposing for ADE with DENV infections. ZIKV and DENV are flaviviruses that circulate mostly in the same environmental niche and avoidance of disease enhancing antibodies is of critical importance. Therefore, this new vaccine candidate warrants further development.</p>
