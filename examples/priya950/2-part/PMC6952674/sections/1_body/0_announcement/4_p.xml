<p>Illumina sequencing yielded 10,299,664 and 16,336,098 reads for Bangladesh 2017 and Thail 2019, respectively, and raw sequence reads were processed using Geneious R10 version 10.2.6 software (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Complete genome sequence assembly was achieved by mapping to a reference CHIKV genome sequence (strain CHIK31, GenBank accession number 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU564335" assigning-authority="genbank" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU564335</ext-link>) that included 5′ and 3′ untranslated terminal sequences, using default parameters and the low-sensitivity setting. For Bangladesh 2017 (11,812 nt with 50.1% G+C content), a total of 4,908,657 reads with an average coverage depth of 45,504× were mapped to strain CHIK31. Similarly, a total of 8,240,564 reads with an average coverage depth of 78,217× were mapped to strain CHIK31 for Thail 2019 (11,812 nt with 50.1% G+C content).
