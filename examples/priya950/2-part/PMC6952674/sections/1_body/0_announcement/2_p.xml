<p>In July 2017, a febrile male patient traveled to Brisbane, Australia, from Bangladesh. Similarly, in September 2019, a female patient with fever and joint pains arrived in Brisbane after recent travel in Thailand. Acute-phase sera were analyzed using a specific CHIKV reverse-transcription real-time PCR assay (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) which detected CHIKV RNA in each patient sample. The same patient sera were inoculated onto 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> C6/36 cell monolayers. Two CHIKV isolates, namely, Bangladesh 2017 and Thail 2019, were recovered and subsequently used for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis.
