<p>Here, we analyzed all available influenza B genomic data (&gt;12,000) in combination with 158 genomes sequenced from Singapore to investigate the processes enabling the recent resurgence of epidemics due to influenza B virus (see global epidemic activity in

Our results show that both lineages have undergone selective sweeps prior to resurgence that follow long periods of HA divergence; however, Victoria and Yamagata viruses showed significantly different strategies for epidemiological success. The Victoria viruses resurged through drastic changes in the HA, including nucleotide deletions, and coevolution of the neuraminidase (NA) and internal gene segments, whereas Yamagata viruses experienced stronger seasonal fluctuations that are driven by antigenic drift of the NA protein. In sum, our results show that increases in epidemic dominance by influenza B viruses is determined by a diverse set of evolutionary mechanisms, including HA nucleotide deletions, HA-NA functional balance, reassortment, epistatic interactions between segments, and antigenic drift of NA to compensate for HA stasis.
