<p>Between 2010 and 2014, a number of amino acid mutations accumulated sequentially on the backbone of the Yamagata clade 3 virus HA phylogeny (

 </xref>). These HA mutations occurred at the antigenic sites (I150S, Y165N, S202N, and K116N) and surrounding regions (G229S, D229G, E298K, Q172L). Similarly, from 2008 to 2013, 10 sequential amino acid substitutions were observed in the NA (

 </xref>), whereas in contrast, the NA has accumulated at least 7 significant amino acid substitutions (

 </xref>), indicating that immune selection on the HA has played a limited role in the recent evolution of Yamagata viruses. The first of these NA mutations (D342N) is estimated to have emerged in April 2014 (mean TMRCA: 2014.31; 95% HPD: 2013.92–2014.63), ∼1 y before the global epidemics in late 2014 to mid-2015. Five of these substitutions occurred at the surface of the NA protein, whereas 2 substitutions (I49M and R65H) are located in the NA stalk (
