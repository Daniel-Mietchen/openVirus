<p>Individuals infected with the Victoria lineage 2-aa deletion viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref>) were similar in age to those without the deletion, however, infections with the 3-aa deletion viruses (median age = 15) were found to occur in marginally older individuals than those caused by viruses lacking deletions (median age = 11, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013), but were not significantly different to those due to 2-aa deletion viruses. The causes of differences in age are difficult to explain but are unlikely to be due to antigenic differences of the viruses as hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays show that the antisera raised to a no deletion vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) did not discriminate strongly between 3-aa and 2-aa deletion viruses (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The presence of different NA substitutions between Victoria clade 1A.1â€“1A.4 viruses further complicates explanations for the observed age differences between deletions variants.
