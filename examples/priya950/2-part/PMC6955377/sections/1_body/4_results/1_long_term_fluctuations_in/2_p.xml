<p>The HA gene phylogeny shows that both the Victoria and Yamagata lineages experienced a series of selective sweeps since the early to mid-2010s, resulting in single dominant clades emerging in both lineages (

 </xref>), clade 3 (B/Wisconsin/1/2010- and B/Phuket/3037/2013-like) viruses emerged in 2016 as a single dominant lineage that have been subject to repeated selective sweeps (see below). Clade 2 (B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like) viruses have not been detected since 2015. Similarly, for Victoria, clade 1A viruses emerged as a predominant clade since 2015 when clade 1B ceased to circulate. However, since then clade 1A viruses have undergone extensive diversification in which clades with and without multiple amino acid HA deletions emerged to cocirculate globally. While the most recently recommended Northern hemisphere vaccine strain, B/Colorado/06/2017, protects against Victoria clade 1A.1 viruses (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), owing to the periods of long divergence followed by staggered selective sweeps among the lineages, the composition of World Health Organization recommended vaccines have been updated in 7 of the last 12 y to combat epidemics of both lineages.
