<p>Three separate clades of Victoria viruses harboring 3-aa deletions at positions 162–164 in the HA (clades 1A.2–1A.4) also emerged (mean TMRCA 2017.64, 2016.95, and 2016.99, respectively; see

 </xref>) appear more prevalent than 1A.3 and 1A.4 viruses, with viruses isolated from North America, but widely detected throughout Africa, East Asia, Europe, Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America (

 </ext-link>). Clade 1A.2 viruses possess cooccurring mutations on the HA (at K136E and G133R) both in proximity to the 162–164 deletion at the HA antigenic site and at NA A395T (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1

 </xref>) have been isolated from East Asia (China), Southeast Asia (including Bangkok, Singapore, and Vietnam), and North America, whereas to date, clade 1A.4 viruses (blue circles in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>) have only been detected in Laos. Clade 1A.3 viruses have mutations on the HA head (I180T and K209N,

 </xref>), whereas clade 1A.4 has a single mutation (G378E) in the NA (

 </ext-link>). These results show that Victoria viruses possess a variety of deletion variants with additional HA mutations mostly occurring on the 120- and 160-loop regions of the HA globular head, but also in the NA and internal segments, demonstrating alternative genomic targets for optimizing virus fitness.
