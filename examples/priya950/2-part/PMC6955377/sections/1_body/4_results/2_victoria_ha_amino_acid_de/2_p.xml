<p>Clade 1A.1 viruses that bear a 2-aa deletion at HA 162–163 and D129G and I180V substitutions in the head of the HA emerged between June 2016 and January 2017 (mean time of most recent common ancestor [TMRCA] 2016.68, 95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 2016.44–2017.06) (

 </xref>) that emerged during 2016 (mean TMRCA 2016.64; 95% HPD: 2016.27–2017.00), corresponding to the timing of the occurrence of HA mutations (D129G, I180V, and R498K). This suggests that compensatory mutations that maintain virus fitness may have been acquired either within or between genes during recent evolution of Victoria viruses. Noticeably, clade 1A.1 is only monophyletic in the HA and polymerase acidic (PA) genes, and the NA phylogeny shows a small number of clade 1A.1 viruses located in a different lineage that has acquired a T72K NA mutation (
