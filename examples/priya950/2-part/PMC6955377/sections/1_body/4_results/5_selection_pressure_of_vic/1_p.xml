 <sup>−3</sup>; NA 2.82 [2.54–3.11] ×10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site/year). The estimates for the Yamagata lineage are significantly higher than those estimated using a dataset spanning 2002–2012 (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), suggesting that recent Yamagata viruses were evolving at a greater rate than observed previously.
