<p>Based on the global HA phylogeny of influenza B lineages, the Victoria and Yamagata split into 2 lineages and their branches were colored separately. Interlineage reassortment of gene segments between Victoria and Yamagata lineage viruses were then examined based on the HA branch coloring. To investigate the extent of interclade reassortment within Victoria and Yamagata lineages, pairwise incongruence between the HA gene and individual gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS) were constructed using the dendextend R package. The twines were colored based on the HA phylogenies. The program GiRaF (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) was used to identify the reassortment events sampling from 1,000 unrooted trees generated from MrBayes, using a burn-in of 500 and sampling every 200 iterations for 200,000 generations. Five independent runs were performed, and reassortant events with confidence levels &gt;0.9 were considered.
