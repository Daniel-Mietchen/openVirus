<p>We downloaded the global sequences of influenza B viruses (Victoria: 5,302 and Yamagata: 7,360) from 2008 to 2019 to retrieve corresponding host age data. We compared the age distribution of hosts infected with Victoria and Yamagata viruses globally and across different regions. Within the Victoria clade 1A lineage, we compared the age distribution of hosts infected by Victoria viruses exhibiting different amino acid deletion mutations. Nonparametric comparisons of age distributions between lineages and Victoria HA deletion mutants were performed using the Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to examine if geographic regions differed in median age for each of Victoria and Yamagata lineages. The violin distribution plots were generated and statistical analyses performed using the 
 <italic>ggplot2</italic> and 
 <italic>ggpubr</italic> in R statistics packages.
