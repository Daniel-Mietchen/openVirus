<p>We downloaded &gt;12,000 global influenza B genomes (as of May 30, 2019) from National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data databases from 2008 to 2019. To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of recent influenza B outbreaks, we first reconstructed the global evolution using the HA gene (including new sequences from Singapore) in FastTree (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This tree was then used to classify viruses into Victoria and Yamagata lineages and prepare downsampled genome datasets of 2,078 viruses. Our final gene datasets consisted of an even sampling of Victoria (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,037) and Yamagata (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,041) lineages, with sample numbers varying in each year depending on data availability. Maximum likelihood phylogenies of individual gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP, and NS) were reconstructed using RAxML v8.0.14 (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) with the generalized time-reversible nucleotide substitution model and gamma rate heterogeneity.
