<p>Population dynamics were estimated for Victoria (685 sequences) and Yamagata (687 sequences) viruses using BEAST v1.10.4 (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), after checking for sufficient temporal signal using TempEst (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Molecular clock and changes in relative genetic diversity were estimated using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock with Gaussian Markov random field smoothing of the effective population size (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). For all analyses, the SRD06 codon position model (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) for codon partitioning of the HKY85+Î“ substitution model was used. For each dataset, at least 4 independent runs of 100 million generations, sampling every 10,000 generations, were conducted. The runs were checked for convergence in Tracer v1.7 (
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and combined after removing appropriate burn-in values using LogCombiner. The resulting maximum clade credibility trees were generated using TreeAnnontator. For each gene segment, ancestral trunk substitutions were reconstructed for Victoria and Yamagata lineages using the treesub program (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) as previously described (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and mapped to maximum likelihood phylogenies.
