<p>Vaccine effectiveness against Yamagata viruses for the 2017â€“2018 season was lower than that for Victoria viruses in the United States (48% versus 76%) (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), indicating NA as a target for future vaccine development. However, less attention is paid to the antigenicity of the NA, and it is not known if human anti-NA antibodies arising from novel Yamagata strains broadly cross-react with older viruses. Increasing awareness of the importance of influenza virus NA immunity has prompted recent efforts to understand the protective effect of anti-NA immunity in animal models; studies have shown that the anti-NA antibodies can significantly reduce virus titers and shedding of influenza B viruses (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and lower the duration of illness in influenza A/H1N1 virus (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Crucially, anti-NA antibodies can broadly cross-react against H1N1 and H3N2 subtype viruses, but current influenza vaccines cannot induce an efficient NA response (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, characterization of NA antigenicity has shown that antigenic drift also occurs at sites on the lateral surface of the NA that did not inhibit NA activity (
