<p content-type="flushleft">Influenza B virus genomes collected over the last 2 decades reveal a dynamic pattern of evolution of seasonal influenza viruses that were not observed previously using shorter time periods of data. We identified several significant changes in the evolutionary landscapes of the 2 cocirculating influenza B lineages, Victoria and Yamagata. For the Victoria lineage, evolution was predominantly acting on the antigenically dominant HA gene, with cooccurring mutations in the NA and polymerase complex that we hypothesize are required to maintain virus fitness. The HA of recent Victoria clade 1A viruses was subject to diversifying selection, with numerous amino acid mutations being fixed in antigenic sites, and the independent emergence of 2-aa or 3-aa HA deletion variants. Substitutions in the HA and NA are mostly located in the antigenic head regions, which is indicative of directional selection in escaping the host immune response, thus providing an evolutionary mechanism for the emergence and cocirculation of multiple different Victoria virus clades since 2016.</p>
