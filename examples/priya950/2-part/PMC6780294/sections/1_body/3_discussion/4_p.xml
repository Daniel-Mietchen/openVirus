<p>Another noteworthy finding of this study is the difference in the proportion of deaths attributable to different influenza subtypes between age groups. According to estimates of influenza-associated mortality, older individuals (65 years or older) were more vulnerable to influenza A(H3N2) virus. Considering that the deaths of individuals 65 years of age and older account for 85.3% of respiratory or circulatory deaths, the proportion of estimated influenza-associated respiratory or circulatory deaths in the older population is not negligible. Since the mortality data were extracted from death certificates, influenza or pneumonia deaths may have been over-estimated, especially in the 2009-2010 pandemic season. Furthermore, it cannot be guaranteed that other chronic causes of deaths made a constant contribution to weekly all-cause deaths. Therefore, as supported by previous studies [

 <xref rid="b36-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], estimated all-cause deaths or influenza or pneumonia deaths could have been overestimated or underestimated. Therefore, it can be assumed that respiratory or circulatory deaths provide the most accurate estimate, compared to the other two types of estimates, in the older population.
