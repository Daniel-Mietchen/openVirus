<p>In our analysis of estimated influenza-associated deaths by type of influenza, influenza A(H3N2) virus caused the most excess mortality, accounting for 65.8% of influenza-associated all-cause deaths. This is a meaningful point to focus on because this study included the 2009-2010 season, when influenza A(H1N1) virus became pandemic worldwide. Based on this fact, it can be inferred that the infectivity of influenza A(H1N1) virus was high, but the mortality rate was low, or that the later influenza viruses’ mortality rate was higher than that of influenza A(H1N1) virus. Regardless of the study period, a higher mortality rate of influenza A(H3N2) virus has also been proven in other countries, perhaps because of this subtype’s severity in vulnerable populations [
