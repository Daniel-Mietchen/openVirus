<p>The high overall rate of influenza-associated deaths indicates that the burden of influenza is never light, and as noticed in the USA [
 <xref rid="b37-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Europe [
 <xref rid="b38-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we may use surveillance data for calculating influenza-associated deaths in real time for the management of high-risk groups in each epidemic. The difference in the severity of each virus type in specific age groups also has important implications. Among the 3 types of estimated deaths in this study, the older (65 years and above) population had higher mortality in all-cause deaths or respiratory or circulatory deaths, particularly with influenza A(H3N2) virus. However, the younger (under 65 years) population had a higher mortality due to influenza A(H1N1) virus, except for all-cause deaths. Additionally, influenza B virus should be considered more cautiously in them than in the elderly. Further studies are needed to explain this variance in influenza epidemics.
