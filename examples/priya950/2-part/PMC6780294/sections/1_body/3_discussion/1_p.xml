<p>There were approximately 5313 influenza-associated deaths per year (10.59 per 100 000 people, 74.12 per 100 000 people above 65 years old). This is the first study, to our knowledge, to estimate age-specific influenza-associated deaths in Korea using a negative binomial regression model and considering lag time and model fit. By adding the estimated mortality of each influenza subtype, we were able to apply the model more accurately. We also considered other respiratory viruses as covariates in the model, but they were excluded from the final model due to statistical non-significance. Moreover, we classified the population by age group and evaluated the suitability of the model, making it possible to estimate excess mortality by age group.</p>
