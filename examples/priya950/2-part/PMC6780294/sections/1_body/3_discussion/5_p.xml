<p>There are several limitations of this study. The younger age group could not be subdivided into more age groups since we used weekly mortality data for the estimation, so that there were many 0 cells in the under-15 age group. This could lead to inaccurate estimation when using a negative binomial regression model as the estimation method. Therefore, we estimated excess mortality in children and adults under 65 years of age within a single group. Fortunately, this methodological choice could only lead to underestimation of influenza-associated mortality in young adults because influenza or pneumonia deaths and respiratory or circulatory deaths occur more frequently in adults than children. Secondly, since we only used respiratory virus surveillance data for the analysis, it was not possible to consider the effects of other viral or bacterial infections in a particular week. If another infectious disease were epidemic during these seasons, it could have caused an overestimation, but there were no other life-threatening pandemic infectious diseases in this period. Finally, mortality data can have inherent uncertainty because if cause-of-death certificates are filled out at a busy moment, doctors may ignore less important or indirect causes. For this reason, respiratory or circulatory deaths may be more accurate for estimating actual influenza-associated deaths.</p>
