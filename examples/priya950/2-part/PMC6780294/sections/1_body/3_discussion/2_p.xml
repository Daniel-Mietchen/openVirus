<p>The results of this study can be compared to those of a prior study that estimated 2900 influenza-associated deaths per year in Korea [

 <xref rid="b23-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] used multiple linear models to estimate the excess mortality rate caused by influenza from 2003 through 2013. However, since it is inappropriate to assume fixed fatality among viral subtypes and age groups, and considering that death is a rare and non-negative event, a count data model might be more persuasive than a linear model for estimating influenza-associated deaths. Furthermore, the KCDC reorganized the respiratory virus surveillance system, KINRESS, in 2006, changing the institutions to be monitored by specifying the percentage of target organizations in each region. They also changed the types of respiratory viruses to be monitored, and the laboratory method for detecting positivity. Therefore, influenza positivity rates before and after 2006 are non-comparable. Additionally, the results of this study are consistent with those reported in studies from other countries [
