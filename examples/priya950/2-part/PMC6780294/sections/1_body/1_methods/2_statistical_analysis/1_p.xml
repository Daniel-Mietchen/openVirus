<p>The model included a total of 7 seasons, from 2009 to 2016, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We used negative binomial regression models for the weekly age-specific mortality data. Various statistical methods have been developed for estimating influenza-associated deaths [

 <xref rid="b30-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but there is no single way to estimate the exact scale of deaths. Poisson regression analysis is broadly accepted as the predominant estimation method. However, negative binomial regression is also commonly used for modeling count data, especially when there is a suspicion of overdispersion. Since the Poisson distribution does not allow greater variability, the distribution of age-specific deaths and the positivity rate of each influenza virus in this study needed additional free parameters for model fitness. Therefore, to estimate influenza-associated deaths in 2009-2016, we used a negative binomial regression model [
 <xref rid="b31-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] considering influenza subtypes, age, and various causes of death. An additional process of checking the model assumptions and the goodness-of-fit was performed. Mortality data were transformed into weekly deaths and divided into 2 age groups: under 65 years old and 65 years or older. To consider linear and non-linear time trends, we included these factors as covariates and the age-specific population as the offset. The prediction model can be expressed as:
