<p>where Y represents the predicted number of deaths, α is the offset term for the age-specific population, and β
 <sub>6</sub> through β
 <sub>8</sub> represent the estimated coefficient for each viral subtype. After predicting age-specific mortality by cause of death, we calculated viral subtype–specific deaths as the count data using this model. The total number of influenza-associated deaths was expressed as the sum of the count for each viral subtype. To deal with weekly variance and autocorrelation, the Durbin-Watson test was performed and the Akaike information criterion was compared. Finally, we inserted a 1-week lag for mortality in each model. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.0 (
