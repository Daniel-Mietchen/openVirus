<p>Mortality data were obtained from 2009 through 2016 for all deaths in Korea. We extracted age-specific mortality from the Microdata Integrated System (MDIS) [
 <xref rid="b13-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], generated by Statistics Korea. The causes of death were coded by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision in this dataset and included demographic features such as age, sex, and residence. We constructed three different models by cause of death: all-cause deaths, respiratory (diseases of the respiratory system, J00-J99) or circulatory (diseases of the circulatory system, I00-I99) deaths, and influenza or pneumonia (influenza and pneumonia, J09-J18) deaths. We also selected other chronic causes of deaths such as cancer (neoplasms, C00-D48) to compare the results. Age-specific weekly deaths were divided by age-specific mid-year population estimates, which were also obtained from the MDIS. The weekly age-specific mortality rate was used as a predictive variable.
