<p>The overall estimated influenza-associated all-cause deaths were 5313 per year (2.02% of all-cause deaths, 10.59 per 100 000 population). In particular, the population 65 years of age or older made the largest contribution to this mortality (2.28% of all-cause deaths among those at least 65 years old, 74.12 per 100 000 population). The estimated influenza-associated mortality figures by age group are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t3-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f1-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Of the all-cause deaths, 6774 (0.51%) deaths in those under 65 years old and 30 414 deaths (2.27%) in those at least 65 years old were estimated to be influenza-associated deaths. While influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus contributed to deaths in the younger population (under 65 years old) at a similar rate (0.50% and 0.48% of all-cause deaths each), influenza A(H3N2) virus made the largest contribution of the 3 virus subtypes to deaths in the older population (at least 65 years old, 1.50%). In total, 2521 (3.05%) and 16 411 (3.42%) respiratory or circulatory deaths were estimated as influenza-associated deaths in the age groups of under 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. The overall influenza-associated respiratory or circulatory deaths were not significantly different by age group. Similarly to all-cause deaths, influenza A(H3N2) virus made the largest contribution to respiratory or circulatory deaths among those at least 65 years old (2.27%). Furthermore, 1048 (18.23%) and 4906 (6.87%) influenza or pneumonia deaths were estimated to have occurred in the age groups of under 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively, and 10.05% of the influenza or pneumonia deaths in individuals under 65 years old were due to influenza A(H1N1) virus. In addition to season, age group and the cause of death contributed to differences in estimated deaths by influenza subtype. We only considered 3 causes of death and 3 influenza subtypes since no other causes of deaths or respiratory viruses were fitted to our model.
