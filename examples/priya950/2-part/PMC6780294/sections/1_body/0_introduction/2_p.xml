<p>A simple way to measure the disease burden is to estimate the mortality of influenza by comparing the mortality rate to the rate of influenza virus positivity. However, because of the seasonality of influenza virus and the annual variability of subtypes that cause epidemics [
 <xref rid="b7-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it is necessary to include complicated calculations on time and the positivity rate of each virus subtype to obtain accurate estimates of influenza-associated mortality. Furthermore, when we count only people who die directly from influenza, we cannot estimate the substantial impact that influenza virus may exert by inducing severe complications that lead to death [

 <xref rid="b8-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, we need to explore various causes of death when estimating influenza-associated deaths because records for mortality may not directly include information about viral infection. Therefore, few studies have considered all these factors when measuring the disease burden of influenza. This study aimed to estimate influenza-associated deaths considering influenza type, patientsâ€™ age, and various causes of death, and to explore differences in influenza severity by age group through these results. We used a negative binomial regression model for the comprehensive estimation, following previous studies [
