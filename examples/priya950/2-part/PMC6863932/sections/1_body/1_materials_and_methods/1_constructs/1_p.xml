<p>Synthetic genes for the full-length HA (containing the sequences of HA1 and HA2 including the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tale) of influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (A/Cal; accession # EPI177294, 567 amino acids), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (A/NC; accession # EPI139303, 565 amino acids), A/Uruguay/716/2009 (A/Uru; accession # EPI152544, 567 amino acids), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Bri; accession # EPI394898, 586 amino acids), B/Jiangsu/10/2003 (B/Jia; accession # EPI242836, 584 amino acids) and B/Malaysia/2506/04 (B/Mal; accession # EPI175755, 585 amino acids) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gisaid.org/</ext-link>) were codon-optimized (GeneArt
 <sup>®</sup>, Life Technologies™ Cooperation). The synthetic genes were each cloned into a modified version of the integrative expression vector pKOIX where integration flanks were replaced by sequences of the GRL3 locus of 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> according to methods described in Weide et al. (Details on vector are available at Cilian AG) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Final expression cassette carried a 1 kb fragment of the cadmium-inducible 
 <italic>MTT1</italic> promoter-active region (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), BTU2-terminator, and the corresponding HA gene.
