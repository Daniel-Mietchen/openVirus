<p>The MDCK cell cultures were grown at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Serum samples, including positive and negative controls, previously heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min, were two-fold diluted with ultra MDCK culture medium with 2 μg/ml of trypsin from bovine pancreas (TPCK, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 96-wells plate and mixed with an equal volume of virus (100 TCID50/well). After 1 h incubation at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the mixture was added to the MDCK cell suspension (1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml). Plates were read for cytopathic effect after 3 days incubation at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
