<p>To date, most commercially available flu vaccines are produced using embryonated chicken eggs (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, egg-based influenza vaccine production is complex to scale up and work intensive, taking several months following the isolation of new strains. Growth of viruses in eggs may lead to a selection pressure, altering antigenicity (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), particularly for the heavily humanized H3N2 strains (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Mutations induced by growth in eggs might change viral antigenicity and in consequence could contribute to a lower than anticipated vaccine efficacy (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, eggs may not be appropriate for the growth of highly pathogenic avian strains, where there may be a limited supply of embryonated eggs due to effects of influenza virus on poultry (
