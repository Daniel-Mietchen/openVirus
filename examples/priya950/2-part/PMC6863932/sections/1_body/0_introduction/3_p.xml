<p>Alternative approaches that can generate safe and effective vaccines are needed in addition to egg–based vaccines (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The focus has been on cell culture-based technologies for mass production of influenza vaccines and there is a licensed cell culture-based vaccine: Flucelvax™ from Seqirus (Holly Springs, NC). Cell-based technologies offer advantages over egg produced vaccines. A modest improvement of vaccine efficacy was seen for inactivated cell culture-grown vaccines compared to egg-based vaccines in subjects 65 years of age and older (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Completely cell cultured virus in influenza vaccines, which was not propagated in eggs, can avoid the egg-adaptation changes of the influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). But cell lines can induce mutations, reducing vaccine efficacy (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, cell culture-based technologies using mammalian systems for manufacturing of influenza vaccine from whole virus still involve chemical virus inactivation treatment, which can alter the vaccine antigenicity (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). An alternative to viral growth and inactivation is to manufacture vaccines derived from recombinant protein. For example, influenza antigens can be produced in insect cells using baculoviral vectors expressing target antigens. However, the current market share of this approved recombinant influenza antigen produced in insect cells (Flublok™ from Sanofi, Swiftwater, PA) is relatively low at 1–2%.
