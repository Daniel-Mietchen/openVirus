<p>Other approaches for the production of recombinant influenza antigen are being investigated, for example the expression of haemagglutinin (HA) in bacterial cells (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) or in the ciliate 
 <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. The freshwater ciliated protozoan 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> is one of the best characterized unicellular eukaryotic organisms (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although ciliates have been extensively used as a model system in molecular and cell biology, their application as a biopharmaceutical manufacturing platform remains underexplored (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> has a number of advantages as a biotechnological expression system, cells grow rapidly to high densities in simple, inexpensive media. The fermentation process uses conventional equipment, including bioreactors and down-stream processing plant, typically used for 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or yeast systems. The whole bio-process is readily up-scalable for large volumes (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> has been used for the expression of recombinant proteins, which can be used as candidates for vaccines against protozoan pathogenic agents, for example the malaria agent 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown, that 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> is also suitable as expression host for the recombinant production of influenza virus proteins (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). One other consideration is post-translational modification, as a eukaryotic organism 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> is able to post-translational modify proteins by glycosylation or formation of disulfid bridges (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The naturally occurring generalized N-glycan structure of secreted proteins by 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is described as a biantennary non-complex oligomannose-type Man3GlcNAc2 structure with limited heterogeneity (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
