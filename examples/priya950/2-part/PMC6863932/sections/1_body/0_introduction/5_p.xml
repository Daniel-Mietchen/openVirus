<p>Here we describe the production of a recombinant influenza subunit vaccine by overexpression of the surface protein HA from influenza virus A and B strains using the ciliate 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> as expression system. Purified recombinant HA (rHA) was evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a non-human primate case study as well as in a mouse model. Since the use of adjuvants or delivery systems can be a strategy for increasing antigen immunogenicity and minimize the dose of vaccine necessary to confer immunity (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), we also combined the influenza antigens with PLA-Nod2 particles, a promising vaccine vehicle (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We show that the recombinant vaccine produced using the ciliate expression system was immunogenic in non-human primates and mice as well as protective in a mice challenge model. Furthermore, we demonstrate dose sparing when HA antigens were combined with PLA-Nod2 particles.
