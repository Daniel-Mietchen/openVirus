<p>To confirm that the ciliate production platform could generate immunogenic material for multiple strains of influenza, the B/Bri antigen was also generated. Mice were immunized in a prime-boost-boost regime with 30 Î¼g per dose of rHA B/Bri. Again, a significant primary response was observed upon immunization by both s.c. and i.m. routes (
