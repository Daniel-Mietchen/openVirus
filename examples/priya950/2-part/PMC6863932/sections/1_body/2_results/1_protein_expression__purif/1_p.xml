<p>In order to evaluate the potential of 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> as an expression host for production of different recombinant influenza HA expression vectors coding for full length HA, codon-optimized, synthetic genes were generated and 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cells were transformed with the expression vectors. The transformed cells were cultured in up to 50 liters. rHA-bearing cells were harvested 15â€“17 h after induction and purified via chromatographic steps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). After purification, each 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> derived HA antigen solution was characterized for their ability to form higher order oligomers like di-, tri-, and multimers by silver staining subsequent to SDS-PAGE. The A-strain antigen A/Cal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) showed a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of ~60 kDa and bands at ~130 kDa and &gt;250 kDa indicating the formation of di-, tri-, and multimers. This was also observed for the A/NC and A/Uru antigens (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>). For the B/Bri antigen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) beside a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of ~70 kDa, higher order structures at ~200 and &gt;250 kDa were visible indicating the formation of tri- and multimers of this antigen. This was also observed for the B/Jia and B/Mal antigens (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>). All these bands gave a positive signal in Western blot analysis using specific antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,E</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> potency of purified rHA solution was confirmed using haemagglutination assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F,G</xref>). Purified antigens from ciliates were able to agglutinate red blood cells indicating biological activity.
