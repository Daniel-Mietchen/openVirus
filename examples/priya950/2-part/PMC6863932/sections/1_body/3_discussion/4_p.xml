<p>In the current pre-clinical study, we demonstrate immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> rHA. We have not looked at comparative efficacy compared to other platforms for generating influenza vaccines, and the animal models may not necessarily enable us to explore the advantages, which are associated with manufacturing cost, speed and scale-up. But based on the data presented, this study supports the further development and testing of the 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> platform for vaccine antigens.
