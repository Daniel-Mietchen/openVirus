<p>Here we show that 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> can be used to produce immunogenic influenza antigens. One advantage of recombinant protein-based influenza vaccines is the avoidance of infectious viral propagation which normally requires increased biocontainment, allowing the use of lowest biosafety level laboratories and facilities for the cultivation of 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. Since 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> can be cultivated in standard bioreactor vessels (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> based expression system enabling large scale manufacturing in common, market-standard contract manufacturing facilities. In consequence, production of subunit vaccines can be rapidly scaled up without concerns about the supply of embryonated eggs. This manufacturing flexibility could be advantageous compared to other cell culture approaches, for example cell culture-based technologies using adherent cell lines, such as MDCK or Vero cells, are inherently difficult to scale up because of the requirements for an attachment surface (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Likewise, the slow growth of insect cells (12â€“24 h generation time) and the sensitivity of insect cells to the stress linked to the mechanical agitation in stirred tank reactors (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) might present a challenge for large scale manufacturing. A further limitation of insect cells for the production of recombinant influenza vaccines is the large volume of virus needed on scale-up and the time sensitivity of harvest to avoid potential cell lysis and degradation of expressed proteins (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). More work is still needed to demonstrate that the advantages of using 
 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> would be realized in a large-scale manufacturing setting. Proteins expressed in this system should be biologically safe as there is no evidence that 
 <italic>T. thermophila</italic> harbors any viruses pathogenic to humans (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), though detailed GMP work up, including a full characterization of any possible adventitious agents and the stability of the platform, would be required before human vaccine manufacture could be performed.
