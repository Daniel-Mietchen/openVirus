  <p>Ciliate produced rHA protects against infection with B/Brisbane influenza. Mice were immunized three times at 3 weekly intervals with 30 or 3 Î¼g ciliate derived B/Bri by the intramuscular (i.m.) route. Two weeks after the final immunization, anti-B/Bri antibody titer was measured by ELISA 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. Mice were then challenged with B/Bri by the intranasal route. Weight change 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, viral load 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, lung cell number

   <bold>(E)</bold> were assessed after infection. Points represent individual animals
