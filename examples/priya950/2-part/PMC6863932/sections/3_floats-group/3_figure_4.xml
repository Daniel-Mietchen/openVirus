  <p>Ciliate produced rHA protects against infection with H1N1 influenza. Mice were immunized three times at 3 weekly intervals with 15 or 1.5 μg ciliate derived A/Cal, or 15 μg control inactivated influenza antigen (IIV) by the intramuscular (i.m.) route. Two weeks after the final immunization, anti-H1N1 antibody titer was measured by ELISA (A). Mice were then challenged with pH1N1 by the intranasal route. Weight change 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, viral load 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, and lung cell number 
   <bold>(D)</bold> were assessed after infection. Points represent individual animals
