  <p>Ciliate produced rHA induces an antibody response in mice. BALB/c mice were immunized three times at 3 weekly intervals with either 15 μg A/Cal 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold> or 30 μg B/Bri 
   <bold>(D–F)</bold> by the intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) routes. A/Cal-specific and B/Bri-specific IgG were evaluated in sera collected before immunization (week -1) and at weeks 3, 6 and 8, by ELISA. Values are reported as geometric mean titers (GMT) ± 95% CI of 6 mice per group 
   <bold>(A,D)</bold>. Sera for haemagglutination inhibition (HAI: 
   <bold>B,E</bold>) and microneutralization (MN: 
   <bold>C,F</bold>) analysis were collected at week 8. Symbols represents individual mice and bars represents the mean of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 animals 
   <bold>(B,C,E,F)</bold>.
