<p id="p0015">Dengue virus infections can manifest as dengue fever or DHF/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and can also end in multi-organ failure [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In dengue virus infection, cytokines may be released either directly from virus-infected cells such as monocytes/macrophages or indirectly upon the interaction of virus-infected cells with other immunocompetent cells such as activated T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During the immune response, 6-D erythro neopterin is generated and released in increased amounts by human macrophages upon activation by interferon-gamma, released by T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Therefore, the determination of neopterin concentration in body fluids is useful for the monitoring of cellular (=Th1-type) immune activation in infections, especially viral and intracellular bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, malignant disorders, and early detection of allograft rejection episodes [
