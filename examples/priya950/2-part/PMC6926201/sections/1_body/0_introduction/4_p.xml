<p id="p0020">Only two studies are available in the literature stating the importance of determining neopterin concentration in dengue-infected patients. The CPY Chan et al. study showed that neopterin concentration was found to be higher in patients with dengue than in those with other viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The K. Babb et al. study revealed that neopterin level in patients at the early stage of dengue fever is a sensitive indicator for the estimation of the severity of the diseases [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our hospital is a tertiary care health center, and many children with dengue infection are admitted every year at various stages of the clinical spectrum. Hence, this study aims to determine the role of neopterin in the early assessment of dengue severity in children of age one month to 18 years admitted for fever and confirmed by dengue serology. The study will help in the early diagnosis of severe dengue cases requiring more intensive care.
