<p id="p0080">Neopterin is a nonspecific marker of activated cell-mediated immunity involving the release of interferon-gamma. It may be a useful marker for more accurate estimation of the extent of disease and hence prognosis. Knowledge of all potential causes of its elevation can help overcome problems with reduced specificity in a patient known to have a specific infectious disease. Neopterin level in the early stage of dengue infection may be a sensitive indicator for the estimation of the severity of the disease. Neopterin measurement could serve as an early predictor of the future course of dengue virus infection. Technological advances may further enhance the usefulness of neopterin measurement in acute infection [
