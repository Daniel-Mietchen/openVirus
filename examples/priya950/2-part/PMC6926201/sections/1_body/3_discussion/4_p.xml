Babb etÂ al. in their study. However, we did not observe any correlation between the lowest platelet count and serum neopterin levels. The serum neopterin levels in severe dengue were significantly higher than those in no-severe dengue, but the raised serum neopterin levels between severe and non-severe dengue were not statistically significant.</p>
