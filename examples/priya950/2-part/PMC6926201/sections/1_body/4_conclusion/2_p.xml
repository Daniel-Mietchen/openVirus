<p id="p0095">Our study showed that serum neopterin levels in severe dengue were significantly higher than those in non-severe dengue, but raised neopterin values between severe and non-severe dengue were not significant. Further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of serum neopterin levels in the early assessment of severe dengue.</p>
