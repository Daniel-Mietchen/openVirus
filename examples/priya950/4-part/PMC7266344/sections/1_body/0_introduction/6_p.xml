<p>The present study aimed to identify and quantify the relative importance of the factors associated with DENV and CHIKV autochthonous transmission events in mainland France following the introduction of a viremic traveller in areas where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is already established. We based our analysis on the enhanced surveillance of imported cases and performed an in-depth study of the different transmission events identified in France during recent years by the national arbovirosis surveillance system. This work was carried out within the context of improving the countryâ€™s preparedness and response system for arboviral risks in temperate areas.
