 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The French population can be considered fully susceptible to DENV and CHIKV infection. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment or recommended vaccine in France for DENV or CHIKV infection. Therefore, prevention and control of these infections is based on i) larval control to reduce the vector population as a preventive measure, ii) the surveillance of human imported cases, iii) the early detection of any local transmission, and iv) the implementation of proportionate vector control measures to prevent and contain autochthonous transmission [
