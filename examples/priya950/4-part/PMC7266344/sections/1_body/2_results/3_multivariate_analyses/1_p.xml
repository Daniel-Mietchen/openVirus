<p>Collinearity was mainly present due to the construction of the variables to be studied (e.g., temperatures and GDD with different time steps or land cover characteristics with different buffers). The different variables linked to surveillance and response activities (i.e., “Reporting delay”, “Sampling delay” and “intervention delay”) were strongly correlated. Considering variables linked to surveillance and response, using reporting delay instead of sampling delay or intervention delay resulted in a lower Aikake Information Criterion (AIC) and more explained deviance. In subsequent analyses we therefore chose to focus on the reporting delay (RD). Moreover, the RD reflects the time required for a case to be registered in the public health system and constitutes an operational reality.</p>
