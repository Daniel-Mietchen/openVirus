<p>Univariate binomial regression models were first used to identify candidate variables for the multivariate analysis, while avoiding collinearity. Variables with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.25 (arbitrarily chosen) in the univariate analyses were selected as candidates for the multivariate analysis. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated for pairwise variables. Based on the correlation analysis, different sets of variables were defined to ensure that collinearity was reduced. Multivariate models were then built based on univariate analyses using the various sets of variables that did not have statistically significant pairwise correlations. Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were used to assess multicollinearity between selected variables [

Prior to performing a global multivariate analysis, different multivariate models were built for each type of factor (surveillance, climatic, socioeconomic and environmental factors). These analyses (hereinafter referred to as “multivariate sectoral analyses”) were performed to assess the variance explained by each category of variable and to take into account the difference in the number of observations for each type of factor. Variables were selected for multivariate analyses using forward and backward selection. Best-fit models were selected on the basis of Akaike Information Criteria. Statistical analyses was performed using R software [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and MuMIn packages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] for model selection. A general diagram of the analysis strategy is shown in
