<p>Finally, we compared observations that led to an autochthonous transmission event (n = 13) with observations which did not (n = 844) in order to assess the influence of the above possible explanatory variables on the occurrence of dengue and chikungunya autochthonous events. Comparison was made using complementary log-log regression. The binary response variable of interest was therefore the occurrence of an autochthonous event, coded as “1” in the case of autochthonous transmission and coded as “0” in the absence of autochthonous transmission. We used a generalized linear model with a ‘complementary log-log’ link function, as the probability of the event occurring appeared small.</p>
