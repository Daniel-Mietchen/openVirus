<p>Daily meteorological measurements (precipitation, minimal and maximal temperature, diurnal temperature range) were obtained from the French meteorological agency (Météo France) for the period from 1 March to 30 November of each study year. For each observation, the closest meteorological station was selected from among the 147 stations located within or in the direct vicinity of the study area. The average distance between case location and the associated meteorological station was 6.4 km (sd = 3.6 km) for temperature data and 6.2 km (sd = 3.6) for rainfall data. Mean (T
 <sub>mean</sub>), maximal (T
 <sub>max</sub>) and minimal (T
 <sub>min</sub>) temperatures were computed for the 7 and 10 days before and after EDP, respectively. A bounded accumulated Growing Degree Days (GDD) index was also calculated with a baseline temperature of 11°C and a maximum threshold of 1350°C as proposed by Roiz

 <sub>0</sub>) and 10 days after EDP (GDD
 <sub>10</sub>). Different time windows were considered for calculation of weekly accumulated rainfall in the 1 to 4 weeks before EDP. Weekly diurnal temperature ranges (DTR) were also computed after EDP. A period of 7 to 10 days was chosen for the construction of different temporal variables, as this period corresponds to the duration proposed in the literature for the extrinsic incubation of DENV and CHIKV in
