<p>Land cover data were extracted from a map produced from optical imaging by the THEIA Land Data Centre [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This map is available at the national scale with 17 land cover classes and 10 m spatial resolution. Housing and vegetation were also characterized with the BD TOPO produced by the French National Geographic Institute [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Land cover information was extracted in buffers of different sizes, i.e. 100 m, 200 m and 300 m radius zones. This range of buffers was chosen according to existing knowledge on
