  <p>(A) Illustration of basic network characteristics for a protein-chemical interaction network (data from the BioGRID database (
   <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Oughtred et al., 2019</xref>), obtained and laid out using the NDEx platform (
   <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Pratt et al., 2015</xref>)). Green and blue nodes represent chemicals and proteins, respectively, that interact with each other. Several network characteristics are highlighted: network motifs are small recurrent connection patterns; hubs are nodes that have a large number of neighbors; densely interconnected groups of nodes are called ‘communities’ (also ‘modules’ or ‘clusters’); high centrality indicates that the respective nodes/edges are of structural importance to the network. (B) Overview of different biological networks and their basic characteristics (data from the BIOSNAP repository (
   <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Leskovec and Sosič, 2016</xref>; 
   <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Zitnik et al., 2018</xref>)). The average clustering coefficient is a measure for the overall local density of a network; the diameter of a network is given by the greatest distance between any pair of nodes.
