<p id="p0050">Over the last two decades, numerous relationships have been uncovered between the structural characteristics of molecular networks and the function of the systems that they represent. In PPI networks, for example, connection patterns such as the number of interaction partners, network distance between proteins or densely interconnected network neighborhoods are directly related to biological functions in both healthy and disease states (

Such perturbations may be internal, for example genetic mutations associated with severe hereditary diseases (

 <italic>exposome</italic>. Given the broad nature of this term, it is unclear whether a comprehensive mapping of the exposome and its impact on the interactome is at all achievable. First attempts in this direction focus on specific exposures, for example the impact of toxicants on metabolite networks (
