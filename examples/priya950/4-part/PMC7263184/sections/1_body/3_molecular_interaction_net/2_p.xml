<p id="p0045">PPIs are not the only molecular interactions within the cell that are biologically relevant and can be experimentally assessed. Other important molecular networks include metabolic networks and signaling cascades (

Moreover, links may also represent indirect relations, for example in gene regulatory networks, where one gene can act on another via transcribed RNA or a translated protein, resulting from the binding of transcription factors and regulatory elements to the genetic material, which can be assessed experimentally through chromosome conformation capture techniques (
