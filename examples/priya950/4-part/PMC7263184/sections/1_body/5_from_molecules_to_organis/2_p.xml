<p id="p0075">At the level of cellular organization, the neural networks that constitute the nervous system have probably received most attention (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Considerable efforts are made to systematically map out neural networks, in humans, as well as in model organisms. Similar to the different types of molecular networks introduced above, neural networks may also either represent direct cellular networks, where nerve cells are connected through synapses, or functional networks, in which regions of the brain are linked if they show correlated patterns of activity. The first complete direct neural network was resolved as early as 1986 for the worm

 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>), if only at a very coarse grained level. Mapping out the complete human ‘connectome’ of all our brain cells will likely remain out of reach for many years due to its staggering size (
