<p id="p0080">A similarly complex and important biological system is the immune system, whose primary objective is to maintain the normal function of an organism under constant threat by internal and external challenges, ranging from tumor cells to viral infections. Given the diversity of participating organs, cell types and molecules, it has been proposed to conceptualize the immune system as a multi-layered network (

The nodes in this network represent cells, links represent communication through signaling molecules, such as cell-surface receptors or secreted molecules. Different layers may represent different contexts, such as organs, tissues or activation status.
