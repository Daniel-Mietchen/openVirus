Classical models divide a population into three compartments, in which people are either susceptible to an infection (S), currently infected (I), or recovered (i.e., immunized) or otherwise removed (R) from the susceptible pool. The temporal dynamics of these SIR models can be described by differential equations. Early models typically assumed ‘uniform mixing,’ i.e., an equal probability for any infected individual to contaminate any susceptible individual. More recently, these models have been significantly improved by considering the relevant social and transportation networks that underly the disease spreading process (
