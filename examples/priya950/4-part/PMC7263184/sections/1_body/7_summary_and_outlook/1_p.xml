<p id="p0100">Networks provide a powerful framework for investigating biological systems ranging from the molecular to the global scale. A key factor for the success of network theory in biomedical applications is that many structural network characteristics can be related to functional properties of the respective biological system. In molecular networks, for example, densely connected node communities often correspond to proteins involved in a particular cellular process. Likewise, disease associated processes can be identified with specific connectivity patterns between groups of perturbed nodes.</p>
