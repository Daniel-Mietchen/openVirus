<p id="p0110">Another major focus of recent network-based biomedical research is the integration of the diverse data describing different levels of biological organization. While combinations of different ‘omics’ data, e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome data, are becoming more and more common in basic research, their translation into clinical applications is still scare (
