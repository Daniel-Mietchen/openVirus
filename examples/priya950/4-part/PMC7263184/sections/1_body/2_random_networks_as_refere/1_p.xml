<p id="p0030">In order to assess the magnitude and statistical significance of an observed network characteristic, suitable random controls are needed. Network theory provides a wide range of well-studied random graph models that can be used as reference (

 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Erdős and Rényi, 1960</xref>). In contrast to many real world networks, including most molecular networks, random graphs do not contain highly connected nodes, so-called hubs, underlying their importance as they could not have emerged by chance alone. More advanced reference models can be introduced by keeping additional properties of the original network constant during the randomization procedure. Rewiring algorithms, for example, keep the number of links per node fixed and have been used to uncover basic design principles of gene regulatory networks, such as the tendency of highly connected hubs to avoid each other (
