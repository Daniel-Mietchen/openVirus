<p id="p0015">In the following we aim to provide an overview of how tools and concepts from network theory may help address important fundamental and practical challenges in biology and medicine. We start by reviewing key relationships between structural network properties and functional characteristics of the represented biological system. We then introduce frequently used networks, from the molecular level of protein-protein interactions within the cell, all the way to the level of transportation networks that span the globe. We conclude by highlighting a few future challenges in this highly active and dynamic research field.</p>
