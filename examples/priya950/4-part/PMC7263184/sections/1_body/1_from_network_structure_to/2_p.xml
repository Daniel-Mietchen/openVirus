<p id="p0025">Networks can be characterized at different levels, ranging from the level of individual nodes (e.g., their number of connections, or their centrality within the network) to the level of groups of nodes (e.g., their connection density), to the global level of the entire network (e.g., the distribution of the number of connections per node across all nodes in the network). The finding that these properties can be associated with important biological characteristics makes network theory a valuable tool in biology and medicine. For example, proteins that are located at a highly central position within molecular interaction networks have been shown to perform important roles in the cell, whereas more peripheral proteins are often less essential (
