 <p>Dr. 
  <bold>Jörg Menche</bold> is a theoretical and computational physicist by training. During his PhD at the Max-Planck-Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam (Germany), he specialized in network science and afterward went to work with one of the world's leading experts in this field, Albert-László Barabási at Northeastern University in Boston (USA). Collaborating closely with Joseph Loscalzo from Harvard Medical School and Marc Vidal from Dana Farber Cancer Institute, he laid out the basic theoretical framework for how the interactome can be understood as a map to study human disease. Since 2015, he is a principal investigator at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna (Austria). Major research areas of his group are network-based approaches to rare diseases, understanding the basic principles of how perturbations of biological systems influence each other and developing novel virtual reality (VR)-based technologies for analyzing large genomic data.
