<p>Overall, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. were more abundant during the dry season, while 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. were most abundant during the rainy season (

 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 637 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 386, respectively) and 
 <italic>Cx. duttoni</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 199 and

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 180) and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (
 <italic>Culiciomyia)</italic> spp. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 144) in the rainy season, then 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> s.l. (
 <italic>n</italic> = 153) and

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. metallicus, Ae. wellmani</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. Soleatus,</italic> were only captured during the rainy season, while other species, such as

 <italic>Cx. ornatothoracis</italic>, 
 <italic>Uranotaenia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Mimmomyia</italic> spp. were solely trapped during the dry season (
