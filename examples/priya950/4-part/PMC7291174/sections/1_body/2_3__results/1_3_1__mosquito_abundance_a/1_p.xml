<p>A total of 2650 mosquitoes (1800 females and 850 males) were collected in the entomological survey (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00312-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) comprising 1642 mosquitoes collected as adults, and 1008 mosquitoes as larvae and pupae (immature stage). The immatures were mainly collected in the urban area (
 <italic>n</italic> = 998) in abandoned tyres, containers (metallic and plastic), gutters and stagnant water pools (Unpublished data). Difficulty in finding breeding sites in peri-urban and rural areas resulted in the low number of immatures collected in riverbeds (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). On the other hand, sweep nets were not effective in urban areas with only 6 adult mosquitoes captured compared to the high numbers captured using this method in peri-urban (
 <italic>n</italic> = 841) and rural (
 <italic>n</italic> = 795) areas. Of the 2650 mosquitoes, 2389 were morphologically identified to species. The remaining 281 mosquitoes were only identified to genera and subgenera because the specimens belonged to cryptic species complexes or were damaged (i.e., most of their scales were completely rubbed off during the process of collection in the traps). Out of the 2650 mosquitoes, 803 (30.30%) were collected in the rural area, 843 (31.81%) in the peri-urban area, and 1004 (37.89%) in the urban area. When comparing seasons, 1401 (52.87%) mosquitoes were recorded during the rainy season, while 1249 (47.13%) were collected during the dry season (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00312-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mosquitoes were evenly distributed across seasons in the urban area (
 <italic>n</italic> = 500, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 504 for dry and rainy seasons, respectively), while more mosquitoes were captured during the rainy season in the rural area (
 <italic>n</italic>= 376, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 427 for dry and rainy seasons, respectively) and peri-urban area (
 <italic>n</italic> = 373, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 470 for dry and rainy seasons, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00312-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, neither habitat type nor seasonality significantly influenced mosquito abundance independently of the mosquito species (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 according to the negative binomial regression).
