<p>Urbanisation is one of the main causes of deforestation, resulting in the alteration of the natural environment to make it more suitable for human populations and to accommodate both the growth of the local population and people moving from rural areas to cities [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, urbanisation through the expansion of roads and infrastructure creates suitable habitats for the proliferation of anthropophilic mosquito vectors of diseases of public health importance [

 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, urbanisation reduces the biodiversity and richness of sylvatic/forest mosquito species, subsequently increasing the abundance of species that can adapt to urban ecological niches, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> s.l., and increasing the risk of human disease transmission [

 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The introduction of species into new habitats provides opportunities for novel pathogens to infect human populations, which could lead to the emergence and spread of new diseases [

 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, the transmission of yellow fever virus (YFV) to human populations from sylvatic cycles was seen in South America [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Within the jungle (sylvatic) cycle, YFV is transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemagogus, Sabethes</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to monkeys in the rainforest canopy. After logging and land clearing, mosquitoes followed the canopy edge to the ground where they fed on, and infected, humans [

 <xref rid="B28-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To minimise global disease emergence, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence disease emergence and how to control these factors. However, the few studies that have assessed the impact of deforestation and urbanisation on mosquito vector communities in Cameroon mostly focused on malaria vector populations [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] whilst abundance trends and diversity patterns for all other mosquito groups have been largely neglected or undocumented [
