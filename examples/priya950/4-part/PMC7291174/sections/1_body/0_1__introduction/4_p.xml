<p>In tropical forest regions of Africa, there are numerous mosquito-borne zoonotic viruses, such as Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Spondweni, Uganda S, oâ€™nyong-nyong, Bwamba, Bunyamwera and Shuni viruses, which currently have not been shown to result in major disease symptoms in humans and animals [

Examples of previously benign viruses circulating for millennia in African forests that have, in recent times, caused global human disease epidemics because of host and vector switching due to minor viral genome mutations, including Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses [
