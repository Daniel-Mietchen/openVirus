<p>In the face of these threats, an assessment of mosquito speciesâ€™ composition, including mosquito abundance and species diversity, are required to develop projections and models to predict likely areas in which arbovirus outbreaks could occur [

In the western part of Cameroon, very few studies have examined the circulation of arboviruses in human populations and the presence of mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given the lack of studies looking at the mosquito composition after urbanisation in western Cameroon, we undertook an entomological survey to identify potential sylvatic, urban and bridge-vector species that could potentially play a role in current or future virus spillover from wild to more urbanised areas. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of landscape anthropisation following a transect of urbanisation (from rural to urban settings) on mosquito species abundance, composition and distribution across seasons and how this may influence the potential risk of arboviral infections in the area.
