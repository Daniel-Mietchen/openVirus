 <xref rid="B42-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the country is undergoing a rapid increase in urbanisation that is impacting the population dynamics of mosquito species and, subsequently, the risk of arbovirus transmission to humans. Dschang is one such city in Cameroon which has experienced over the past years, a modification of its natural environment. The rapid and spontaneous urbanisation in and around the city, through the construction of roads and buildings (while there is a lack of infrastructure for sanitation and drainage), as well as the colonisation of lowland areas for agricultural activities, have favoured the development and installation of mosquitoes in the city. These anthropogenic changes are considered to have major influence on the epidemiology of vector borne diseases [
