<p>Overall, the number of individual mosquitoes did not vary across habitats and seasons. This suggests little variation in environmental conditions and habitat conditions between seasons in Dschang. The presence of raffia palm bushes in both rural and peri-urban areas may help to provide a year-round humid environment. Such areas with adequate microclimatic conditions for oviposition and reproduction may help a mosquito population persist year-round. Furthermore, the persistence of breeding sites, such as gutters and stagnant water pools, during the dry season in the urban habitat may account for the lack of variation across seasons. On the other hand, the inconsistency of collection methods in the different habitats might have affected the number of collected mosquitoes, while breeding sites investigations were not successful in peri-urban and rural areas (in contrast to the urban area), sweep nets collections of adults were not effective in the urban area (in contrast to peri-urban and rural areas where they were very efficient). These results are different from a study carried out in Andalusia, where a greater mosquito abundance was found in rural areas than in urban areas [
