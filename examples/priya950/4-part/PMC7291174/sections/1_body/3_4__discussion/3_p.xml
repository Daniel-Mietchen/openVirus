<p>Importantly, variable mosquito species composition was found among the different habitats and seasons. 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. moucheti</italic> were only found in rural and peri-urban areas, whereas species, such as 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> s.l. and 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti,</italic> were only found in the urban area. On the other hand, species from the 
 <italic>Er.</italic> “chrysogaster” group, 
 <italic>Cx. (Culiciomyia)</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Lt. tigripes, Cx. duttoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were caught in all three habitat types. Other species, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. metallicus, Ae. wellmani</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. Soleatus,</italic> were only captured during the rainy season and species, such as 
 <italic>Ae. gibbinsi</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. ornatothoracis</italic>, 
 <italic>Uranotaenia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Mimmomyia</italic> spp., were solely trapped during the dry season. To our knowledge, this is the first documented account of the mosquito fauna of Dschang. Located in at least two different habitats, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus Cx. moucheti</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. (Culiciomyia)</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Er</italic>. “chrysogaster” group, 
 <italic>Lt. tigripes, Cx. duttoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> seem to easily adapt to human urban areas. These species can, therefore, be considered as potential ecological bridge vectors that may have the potential to contribute to the transmission of pathogens from rural to peri-urban areas and vice versa. In contrast, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> s.l. and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are considered solely urban species in Dschang. 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, the most abundant species in the study area, predominated in both rainy and dry seasons and in rural and peri-urban areas. The high abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> is probably related to the vegetational structure of the study area and can be attributed to the presence of raffia palms in rural and peri-urban areas. 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> was also one of the most abundant mosquitoes collected in the raffia palms in Kumbo, Cameroon [
