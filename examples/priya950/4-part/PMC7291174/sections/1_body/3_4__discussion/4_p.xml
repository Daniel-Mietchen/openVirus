<p>At least 19 species collected in this study have previously been implicated in the transmission of a wide variety of arboviruses suggesting a high potential for maintenance and transmission of many arboviruses in the study area, as well as the potential for outbreaks of arboviral diseases in this region. 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, the most abundant species, can transmit several arboviruses and has been incriminated as a vector of YFV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The broad distribution of this species across rural and peri-urban areas in Dschang suggests the possibility of this species contributing to potential arbovirus outbreaks. 
 <italic>Cx. duttoni</italic>, the second most abundant mosquito species in the study area, has been found to carry arboviruses, such as 
 <italic>Arb11266</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Other mosquito species, although collected in small numbers in our study area, have also been shown to or have been implicated as vectors of many arboviruses. These are 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. circumluteolus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. metallicus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Cx. univittatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. argenteopunctatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Arboviruses that have been found circulating in Cameroon include DENV, YFV, CHIKV, ZIKV, ONNV, NTAV, SPOV, WESV, SFV, SINV, MIDV, WNV, TAHV (Tahyna virus), BUNV, UGSV (Uganda S virus), YAOV, RVFV, BWAV and ILEV [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. More specifically, ZIKV has recently been detected in Cameroon in Yaoundé and in the Fako Division [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study found acute dengue in children living in urban and semi-urban areas of Dschang [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The potential vectors of these arboviruses in Cameroon include 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> “tarsalis” group (viruses isolated: MIDV, WESV), 
 <italic>Ae. argenteopunctatus</italic> (virus isolated: NKOV), 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> (virus isolated: WESV), 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> (virus isolated: WESV), 
 <italic>Cx. (Culiciomyia)</italic> spp. (virus isolated: NTAV), 
 <italic>Cx. moucheti</italic> (virus isolated: NTAV), 
 <italic>Lt. tigripes</italic> (virus isolated: NTAV) and 
 <italic>Er.</italic> “chrysogaster” group (viruses isolated: MIDV, SIMV) [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The results of these studies and our entomological survey would indicate that an entomological-based arbovirus surveillance system would provide valuable early warning systems to determine the risk of arboviral outbreaks in localities throughout Cameroon. Furthermore, in rural and peri-urban areas, people practice intensive agriculture (as their main source of livelihood) and move from rural and peri-urban areas to urban areas to sell products and for other commercial purposes. This increased flow of people might substantially increase the risk of arbovirus spread and introduction into urban areas.
