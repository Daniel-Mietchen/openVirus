<p>Mosquito species richness varied across habitats and seasons. The type of vegetation in the rural and peri-urban areas may account for the observed significant difference in mosquito species richness across habitats. In contra to the urban area, the rural and peri-urban areas are characterised by old forest patches with raffia palms, surrounded by polycultures of vegetables, bananas and other types of fruits. These environmental conditions provide breeding and resting sites and diverse host species for blood meals for the development and survival of many mosquito species [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The highest species richness was observed in the peri-urban area and the lowest richness in the urban area. More open areas, such as urban areas (compared to the bushy and forested rural and peri-urban areas), are usually less favourable for the survival of most mosquito species and only a few (e.g., 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) have successfully adapted to urban environments. Likewise, in southwestern Cameroon, high mosquito richness was observed in the selectively logged forest, and low richness in the young palm plantation [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In other areas, such as central Thailand, urban/suburban habitats were less diverse in terms of mosquito species than forest/fragmented forest habitats [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In southeastern Cote dâ€™Ivoire, the greatest species richness was found in the rainforest and the lowest richness in the oil palm monoculture [
 <xref rid="B73-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. On the other hand, a higher richness was recorded during the dry season and the lowest richness during the rainy season with more 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species found in the dry seasons. The persistence of mosquito species, as well as their breeding sites, during the dry season indicates that disease transmission could potentially occur at any time of the year in these areas. However, these results are opposed to studies by Steiger et al. [

 <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], who captured more mosquitoes during the wet season than during the dry season.
