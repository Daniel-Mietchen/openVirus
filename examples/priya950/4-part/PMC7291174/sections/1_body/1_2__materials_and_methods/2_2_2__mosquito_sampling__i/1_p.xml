<p>Entomological field surveys were conducted at each site (rural, peri-urban, urban) during the rainy season (March–September, 2019) and the dry season (November, 2019–February, 2020). A four-day mosquito collection survey was undertaken at each site during each season by collecting immature stages in available breeding sites (abandoned tyres, metallic and plastic containers, gutters, stagnant water pools, riverbeds or floor pools) and using sweep nets to catch mosquito adults resting on vegetation. Immature collections and sweep netting were done during a four-hour period each day by four people at each site. In all sites, the sampling surface covered relied on the presence of breeding and resting sites of mosquitoes; in rural and peri-urban sites, collections were focused on the raffia palm bushes, while in the urban area, mosquito collections were mainly done in the town centre or in quarters. The types of breeding sites and their characteristics were recorded (when possible) and are being considered in another paper. Immature stages were reared to adults in the Vector Borne Diseases Laboratory of the Research Unit of Biology and Applied Ecology (VBID-RUBAE) at the University of Dschang before identification. Morphological identification of mosquito adults was done using stereomicroscopes and morphological identification keys [
