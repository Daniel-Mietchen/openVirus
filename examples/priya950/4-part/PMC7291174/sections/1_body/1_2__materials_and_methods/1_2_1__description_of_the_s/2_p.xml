<p>All study sites are located in the highland area of western Cameroon that exhibits a sub-tropical climate characterised by two seasons; a dry season of four months (from mid-November to mid-March) and a rainy season of eight months (mid-March to mid-November). The annual average rainfall and temperature of this region are 321 mm and 21.6 °C, respectively [

Dschang contains shrub-like vegetation, an important hydrographic network and many artificial breeding sites that might provide ideal environmental conditions for urban mosquito species. A peri-urban area was defined as a location with 250–1000 persons per km

The peri-urban (Toutsang) and rural (Fonakeukeu) sites in our study are located approximately 2 km and 5 km, respectively, from the urban habitat (Dschang). Raffia palm bushes are common in Toutsang and Fonakeukeu and are found along the valleys and streams, which might offer natural year-round breeding sites for sylvatic mosquito species (
