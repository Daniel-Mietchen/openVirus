<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the environment for statistical computing and graphics R [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Mosquito abundance was defined as the total number of mosquitoes captured, independently of the species. Species richness (S) or number of species or taxa in the community was determined per habitat type and per season. Two estimators of the ‘true’ number of species in each site, Chao1 and ACE (Abundance-base Coverage Estimator), were calculated using the command estimate R in the ‘vegan’ package [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Individual-based rarefaction curves for all sites across seasons were constructed from EstimateS software. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was performed with the FactoMine R package [
 <xref rid="B53-insects-11-00312" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] to display the association between mosquito species and habitat types, and mosquito species and seasons. Mosquito abundance across habitats and seasons was treated as count data and analysed using negative binomial regression. A full-factorial negative binomial generalised linear model that included the mosquito species, the habitat and season was fitted to the data. Mosquito species that were represented with fewer than two counts across habitats and season were discarded for analysis. Statistical significance of the predictors’ effects was assessed by comparing nested models for changes in deviances (goodness of fit measure for a model) based on a chi-squared distribution with the R package car [
