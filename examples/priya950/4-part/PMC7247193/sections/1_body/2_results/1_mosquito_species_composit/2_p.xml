 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the dominant species, accounting for 51.6% of this fauna (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It was followed in descending order, among the potential vectors of ZIKV, by 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> (19.4%), 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> (8.4%), 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> (8.3%), 
 <italic>Ae. hirsutus</italic> (3.8%),

 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> (0.9%), 
 <italic>Ae. fowleri</italic> (0.6%), 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> (0.3%) and 
 <italic>Ae. dalzieli</italic> (0.1%). The dominant species varied according to the breeding site and land cover (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the dominant species in tree holes from forests (52.9%) and villages (74.5%), rock holes from forests (43.3%) and barrens (65.7%), tires from forests (97.1%) and discarded containers from villages (54.5%). This species was the only one present in tires from villages. The relative abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in different tree holes from all land cover were significantly different (
