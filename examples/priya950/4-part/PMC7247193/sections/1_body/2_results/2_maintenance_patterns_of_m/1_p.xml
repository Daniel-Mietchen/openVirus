<p id="Par25">A total of 1339 samples, including 687 tree holes, 462 rock holes, 71 discarded containers, 29 used tires and 90 fruit husks of 
 <italic>Saba senegalensis</italic> were collected and flooded for eggs hatching. No positive breeding site was noted for fruit husks. The maintenance rates of vectors in the different land cover classes and breeding sites are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the species that persisted in the largest number of breeding sites in the different land covers investigated. Adults of this species emerged in tires from forests (66.7%, 2 out of 3 flooded sites), and villages (7.7%, 2/26), rock holes from forests (7.4%, 20/270), and barrens (1%, 2/192), tree holes from forests (6%, 15/251), villages (4.7%, 7/149), and savannahs (1.8%, 4/227), and discarded containers from villages (2.8%, 2/71). These rates showed statistically significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, maintenance rates of this species in rock and tree holes from forests, discarded containers, tires and tree holes from villages were comparable (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). The other potential vectors were less plastic. Even if 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> was only found in tree holes, this vector was found in this breading site from forests (0.4%, 1/227), savannahs (0.4%, 1/227), agricultures (0.4%, 1/227) and villages (0.4%, 1/227). 
 <italic>Ae. fowleri</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> were found in tree and rock holes of different land covers. Indeed, 
 <italic>Ae. fowleri</italic> viable eggs were maintained in tree holes from savannahs (0.4%, 1/227) and forests (0.7%, 2/270) while 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> eggs were maintained in tree holes from forests (2%, 5/251) and villages (0.7%, 1/149) and in rock holes from forests (0.4%, 1/270) and barrens (0.5%, 1/192). 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> was maintained only in tree holes (2%, 5/251) and tires (33.3%, 1/3) from forests. For each of these species, the maintenance rates in the different breeding sites were comparable (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.07). The only species that was maintained in only one type of breeding site and land cover were 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> in tree holes from forests (0.8%, 2/251) and 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> in rock holes from forests (11.1%, 30/270).
