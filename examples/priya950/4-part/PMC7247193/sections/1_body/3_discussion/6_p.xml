<p id="Par33">ZIKV detection by RT-PCR in 4 mosquito pools from 3 different species indicating for the first time that the virus can be maintained locally during dry season in these potential vectors through vertical transmission. This possibility had already been suggested by detection of the virus from a male 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> in the area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent study detected ZIKV in 5 adults 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> emerged from eggs collected in 2015 in Bahia, Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, vertical transmission of ZIKV has also been proven for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in laboratory studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The maintenance of ZIKV in 3 species in southeastern Senegal explains its frequent amplification from the beginning of the rainy season. Although these vertical transmission rates of arboviruses are generally low, they are of great epidemiological importance in nature. Indeed, they allow prolonged conservation of viruses during unfavorable periods to transmission (dry season) where vectors live in state of eggs and sensitive hosts are rare. The implication of 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> in ZIKV maintenance strengthens its status of potential epidemic vector. Indeed, 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> has already been found associated with ZIKV in nature and competent for the virus in laboratory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Our study revealed for the first time the association of 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> with ZIKV in the area. Particular attention should be paid to this vector belonging to the same group as 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> which is one of the main vectors of yellow fever in East Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Nevertheless, further studies are needed on the vector competence of this species for ZIKV. 
 <italic>Aedes unilineatus</italic> has already been found associated to ZIKV in nature and able to disseminate but not to transmit the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Its implication in maintaining ZIKV suggests that it may also play a more important epidemiological role in ZIKV epidemiology in Africa.
