<p id="Par28">Our study showed that 13 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species eggs were maintained in the different land covers and breeding sites sampled in southeastern Senegal. This diversity is greater than that observed in a previous study conducted in the same area with only 9 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species emerged from eggs samples collected in tree holes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The higher number of breeding sites and land cover classes investigated in our study would explain this difference. Indeed, Diallo and others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] only surveyed tree holes from a single forest gallery while our study covered 4 types of breeding sites in 5 different land cover classes. However, 12 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species previously found as larvae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in this area were not found in this study. This could be explained by the inaccessibility of tree holes located at height higher than 2â€‰m, which may be preferential habitat for these arboreal species. Indeed, variations of breeding behavior of some mosquito species depending on tree height were observed by some authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The entrances of these tree holes may also be hidden by their small sizes or their location behind tree barks. Despite the fact that we were interested to the eggs (that are not mobile), sampling in different months and years could be considered as a limitation in our study.
