<p id="Par32">Viable eggs of 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> were maintained in rock holes of forests in concordance with its breeding preference in Nigeria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, larval survey data in the area and elsewhere have shown that the species can colonize a wide range of breeding sites and land cover classes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The maintenance of 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> exclusively in rock holes from forests could be explained by total egg mortality in other land covers that are exposed to very high temperatures associated with low relative humidity. Rock holes from forests in which 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> was maintained were relatively shady and filled with dead leaves creating a microclimate that is less warm, wetter and thus more favorable to eggs survival of this species.
