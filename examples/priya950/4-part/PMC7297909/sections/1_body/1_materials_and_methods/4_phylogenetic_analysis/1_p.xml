<p>For molecular epidemiology study of E-30, the entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of E-30 from GenBank database were downloaded (âˆ¼1,400 sequences available until April 2019). First, based on the entire VP1 coding region of E-30, we constructed the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and randomly selected the representative strains of E-30 from each branch of phylogenetic tree. In addition, the representative sequences should cover more regions to obtain higher geographical representation and cover each cluster of phylogenetic trees for obtaining higher phylogenetic representation. Second, the datasets were filtered by discarding the low-quality sequences and incomplete genome sequences. At last, we randomly selected 36 representative entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences for genotyping, including an E-21 sequence as an outgroup. To assess the mean genetic distance among different genotypes, we calculated the mean genetic distance between genotypes and within each genotype using the Kimura two-parameter model.
