<p>Using Bayesian inference method implemented in BEAST software (version 1.8.4), the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and the coalescent-based Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) skyride plots were inferred, with the genome substitution model of GTR + I + Î“ supported by the ModelGenerator (version 0.85) (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Rieux and Khatchikian, 2017</xref>). Sufficient temporal signals of datasets are confirmed when 95% credibility intervals of rate estimation of real datasets do not fall into the 95% credibility intervals of rate estimation from date randomized replicates (

A total of 15 dataset analyses was run combined with one genome substitution model, three different clock models, and five different Coalescent tree priors. The path sampling (PS) and stepping stone sampling (SS) analysis, which showed the marginal likelihood estimation results, were implemented in BEAST to choose the best parameters of Bayesian phylogenetic models (

The output trees were summarized using the maximum clade credibility (MCC) topology from TreeAnnotator software (version 1.8.4), with a burn-in of the first 10% of sampled trees. To assess demographic dynamics of E-30 in mainland of China, the GMRF method with time-aware smoothing parameter was used to investigate the past population dynamics. The GMRF skyride plots were summarized and visualized using Tracer software (version 1.7.1) (
