<p>Viral RNA was extracted from the cell cultures using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Reverse transcription PCR was performed to amplify the entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region using the PrimeScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Ver.2 (TakaraBio, Dalian, China) using primers 490–493 as described before (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Oberste et al., 2006</xref>). The entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region of the amplicons was sequenced using ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States). Using the BLAST server and the EV Genotyping Tool, the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences were analyzed to determine the serotypes (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kroneman et al., 2011</xref>). The genome sequence of the entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number
