<p>For the purpose of public health under the investigation of the National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, we collected the feces (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27, 20.5%), serum (
 <italic>n</italic> = 66, 50%), throat swab (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25, 18.9%), and cerebrospinal fluid (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14, 10.6%). Real-time RT-PCR method was used to directly detect the enterovirus genome in clinical samples, with public probe and primers used (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang S. et al., 2014</xref>). We defined a laboratory-confirmed patient with laboratory evidence of enteroviruses infection. The positive samples were cultured and processed according to the standard procedures described before and were then inoculated into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cells, provided by the WHO Global Poliovirus Specialized Laboratory for viral isolation. Infected cell cultures were harvested once complete EV-like cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. All experimental protocols were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines by WHO, as were reported before (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, 46 E-30 strains were harvested, with complete EV-like CPE. Subsequently, we randomly selected 32 isolates sampled from different patients for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis (
