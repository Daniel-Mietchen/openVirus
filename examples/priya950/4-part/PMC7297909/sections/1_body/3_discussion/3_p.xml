<p>Using the Bayesian phylogenetic inference method, the evolutionary dynamics of E-30 were analyzed. Sporadic importing and exporting of cases were observed in several provinces of China, indicating that E-30 transmitted through different regions and that the gene flow of E-30 among different provinces was apparent. The substitution rate of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region of E-30 is higher than that of CV-B3, indicating the relatively faster evolution extent of E-30 as compared to CV-B3 (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anh et al., 2018</xref>). The timespan for the emergence of lineages 1 and 2 was 15 years, indicating chronic transmission and evolution. Two larger expansions of relative genetic diversity in China were observed, whereas three small-scale fluctuations were confirmed. From 1996 onward, the oscillating patterns of E-30 presented a complicated phenomenon. With the increase in genetic diversity, the outbreak possibility of E-30 increased, as the genetic diversity provided the breeding grounds for subsequent outbreaks. For example, the genetic diversity of E-30 isolated in Taiwan of China increased remarkably in 2000, followed by a large outbreak of E-30 in Taiwan of China in 2001. Based on the evidence from our data, the E-30 strains isolated from mainland of China possibly originated from Taiwan of China through population movement in last century. The coastal provinces, such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong, were primary regions infected, followed by spreading to the nationwide regions.
