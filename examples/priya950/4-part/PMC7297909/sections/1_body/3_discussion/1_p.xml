<p>Although E-30 outbreaks were recorded in China, the deep evolutionary characteristics of E-30 remained unclear (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). To assess the phylogenetic dynamic of E-30 in China and provide insight of E-30 evolution, we performed deep analysis for revealing the epidemiological features and transmission models. Our analysis revealed that this outbreak affected nine towns of the prefecture of Gansu Province and caused a severe infectious disease transmission. The Nancha town of Gansu Province has the most infected patients. The outbreak of E-30 started at a school in Nancha town in June and gradually spread to other towns in July, with a strong transmission ability. The cases reported presented common clinical symptoms, including high fever (≥38°C), nausea, vomiting, and neurological appearance (listlessness and unconsciousness), indicating a major clinical characteristics of E-30 surveillance. Males comprise higher ratio, with 65.3 and 68% cases in probable cases panel and laboratory-confirmed cases panel, respectively. Children aged between 0 and 15 accounted for 90.5 and 86% in probable cases panel and laboratory-confirmed cases panel, respectively. The results show that children are more easily attacked by E-30 infection, which is consistent with other enterovirus infections (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the age group between 6 and 15 constituted the highest ratio. In the process of laboratory test, the throat swabs, cerebrospinal fluids, and feces presented high detection ratios, with the proportion of 96, 78.6, and 81.5%, respectively. However, the serum samples are not good samples for viral isolation compared with other clinical samples; therefore, when collecting clinical samples during E-30 outbreak, investigators do not collect serum for virus isolation.
