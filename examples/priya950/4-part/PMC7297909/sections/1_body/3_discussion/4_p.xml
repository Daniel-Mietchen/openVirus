<p>It is important to mention here that the results of this study, which is based on the molecular epidemiological data currently available, including the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> genome sequences of China, could change slightly in the future when more information will become available. The perfect HFMD pathogen surveillance system was significant for preventing infections, as was supported by the relative genetic diversity reduction after the surveillance net was built. The E-30 surveillance system has not been built yet in several countries of the world, which hinders the formulation of countermeasures for E-30 associated with encephalitis outbreaks. The basic research efforts and current surveillance should be strengthened to help understand and develop effective medical countermeasures (
