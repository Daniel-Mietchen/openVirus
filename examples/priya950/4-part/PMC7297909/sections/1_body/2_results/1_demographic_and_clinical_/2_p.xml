<p>Among the laboratory-confirmed cases (
 <italic>n</italic> 50), the male outnumbered female patients, with a proportion of 210% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The ratios of demographic characteristics between probable cases and lab-confirmed cases were similar (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The collective outbreak, which presented similar symptoms for all patients and showed rapid diffusion in a short timescale, exhibited the increasing transmission ability of E-30 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The major period of E-30 transmission, which caused the most infection and outbreak, is July. A total of 91 probable cases were reported in July and August, constituting 95.8% (91/95) of total probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95). It is consistent with the detected proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases and E-30 isolation. From the opening phase of E-30 transmission, E-30 spread to nine towns using only 1-month timescale, indicating the rapid transmission ability.
