<p>We used 36 entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region sequences, including one E-21 genome sequence as an outgroup for genotyping (see section “Materials and Methods”). The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, based on the 36 entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> genome sequences with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, was constructed. According to the criteria of difference of at least 15% genetic distance over the entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequence, the genotype of E-30 are segregated into three distinct genotypes designated as genotype A, B, and C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The outgroup of E-21 strain and E-30 prototype strain isolated from America in 1958 formed a single genotype, respectively, and differed from other genotypes by 19.2–21.5%. The genotype B, which consisted of several strains isolated from many regions between 1979 and 2010, such as France, Netherlands, United States, Taiwan of China, and other regions, showed 16–21.5% genetic distance compared with other genotypes. The genotype C, which revealed the genetic differences between 16 and 19.2% among different genotypes, primarily was composed of Chinese isolates ranging from 2003 to 2016, besides two strains of E-30 from Russia. The mean genetic divergence within the genotype B and C showed 7 and 10.1%, respectively.
