<p>The midpoint-rooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showed that two lineages (lineage 1–2) circulated in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The mean genetic distance between the two lineages, which was calculated using the Kimura two-parameter model, is 18.1% and is larger than the mean genetic distance within these two lineages (7.3 and 9.6%), indicating the reliability of lineages division. The lineage 1, which circulated in the mainland of China and Taiwan of China earlier, consisted of fewer E-30 isolates recently and was infrequently detected in China. The strains of lineage 1 seemed to be disappearing in recent years, indicating that the E-30 evolved in nearly 20 years. However, the lineage 2, which circulated in China from 2003 till present, comprised mostly E-30 strains isolated from the mainland of China, including the encephalitis outbreak isolates of this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, colored in red). The 
 <italic>VP1</italic> genome sequences of these strains isolated from this study showed high similarity, with 99.3–100% identity among these 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences. The close phylogenetic relationship, as shown in the maximum likelihood tree, also confirmed the occurrence of collective outbreak.
