<p>The evolutionary dynamics of E-30 in China was estimated using a Bayesian method with relaxed molecular clock, including their evolutionary rate, tMRCA, and phylodynamic. The substitution rate for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region of E-30 is 6.54 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> substitutions per site per year [95% highest posterior density (HPD), 5.76 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>–7.33 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>)], which is lower than the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> evolutionary rate of EV-A71 and CV-A6 reported by others (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">McWilliam Leitch et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anh et al., 2018</xref>). However, the median value of substitutions rate of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences is slightly larger than that of CV-B3, indicating that the E-30 relatively evolved compared with CV-B3, whereas 95% HPD values of CV-B3 cover the threshold value of E-30 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>). According to the estimated molecular clock, the common ancestor of lineage 1 was dated to about July of 1986 (95% HPD, November 1985–February 1987), whereas the strains of E-30 were isolated first in Taiwan of China in 1988. The isolates of lineage 2, which was estimated for tMRCA of April 2001 (95% HPD, June 2000–November 2001), emerged in Jiangsu and Shandong Province first in 2003. The results showed that E-30 had transmitted in China for approximately 2 years before it was detected in China.
