<p>The MCC phylogenetic tree of 446 entire 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region sequences of E-30, sampled from 1988 to 2016 in China, formed a ladder-like phylogenetic tree topology colored by locations of isolation. The MCC phylogenetic tree classified all E-30 strains into two lineages (lineage 1â€“2), consistent with the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree described above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis show that lineage 2 still dominated in China, whereas lineage 1 seemed to be disappearing. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, each clade did not locate in only one province, illustrating that E-30 transmitted and spread in several regions. Sporadic importing and exporting of cases among provinces of China were monitored, showing a certain level of genetic flow of E-30 among different regions. The clades of MCC phylogenetic tree, covering several provinces, showed a more complex distribution phenomenon compared with CV-B3 geographical distribution reported before (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the strains isolated from Yunnan province almost located at each clade of MCC phylogenetic tree, indicating that the E-30 spread widely in China (
