<p>In these clinical samples, 54.5% (72/132) were positive for EV genome detection (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The positive number of EV genome detection for feces, serum, throat swab, and cerebrospinal fluid are 22 (81.5%), 15 (22.7%), 24 (96%), and 11 (78.6%), respectively. We tried to inoculate RD and HEp-2 cell lines with all positive samples of enterovirus nucleic acid and showed different proportions of isolation of E-30 with total viral isolation ratio of 63.9% (46/72); 12 feces samples (44.4%), 0 serum samples (0%), 24 throat swabs (96%), and 10 cerebrospinal fluid samples (71.4%) were successfully used to isolate E-30 strains. About 10 randomly selected serum samples were subjected to ELISA IgM test, out of which 50% (5/10) serum samples tested positive for CV IgM.
