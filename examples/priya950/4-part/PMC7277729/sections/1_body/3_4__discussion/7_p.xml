<p>Apart from chikungunya, the most severe and deadly vector-borne disease that has spread widely and caused cluster infections in Taiwan is dengue fever, which has particularly affected Southern Taiwan. Both dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by the same types of vector mosquitoes. Dengue fever has been detected widely throughout Southern Taiwan and sporadically in the north [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-03615" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, they are difficult to distinguish. The clinical conditions of patients contracting these two diseases typically become less severe over 1–2 weeks. For patients who have traveled to areas with chikungunya spread and have suspected dengue fever but have tested negative to the dengue NS1 test, the clinical doctor should report them as having a suspected case of chikungunya to more effectively identify people with chikungunya before symptom onset. Moreover, Southern Taiwan has experienced a domestic spread of dengue fever over the last 5 years. According to dengue virus type, large spreads occur approximately once every 4 years, and mixed viruses, which result in dengue hemorrhagic fever, can easily occur [

Because domestic sporadic and cluster cases for chikungunya have been observed in Northern Taiwan and chikungunya is spread by the same vector mosquitoes as those that spread dengue fever, epidemic-control specialists of health departments and public-health experts have expressed concerns. Convenient and frequent north–south travel in Taiwan might influence chikungunya and dengue infections and pose challenges for epidemic control. In consideration of this serious public-health challenge, the health department in Taiwan should formulate new control measures in response to concurrent domestic infections of dengue fever and chikungunya as early as possible to prevent and control the diseases.
