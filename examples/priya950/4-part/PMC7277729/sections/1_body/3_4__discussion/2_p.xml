<p>Since July 2019, domestic cases of chikungunya have been observed in Taiwan, including one single case in July and 20 cluster cases in August and September. Between January 2019 and October 2019, imported cases reached a cumulative total of 86. Most of the imported cases originated in Myanmar. The disease situation in Thailand has worsened and entered a rapid-spread phase, and India has witnessed a cumulative total of 40,000 suspected cases. Therefore, the Taiwan CDC issued a level-2 (alert) travel notice for Myanmar and level-1 (watch) travel notices for Thailand, India, and the Maldives on 22 October, 2019 [

Hot zones for chikungunya are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere, in which relatively high temperatures and numerous travelers are the main causes of disease spread. In other words, airlines contribute substantially to virus transmission, and busy airports are breeding grounds for the virus. Therefore, the government should provide disease information and establish control measures for inbound travelers from disease hot zones to improve the effectiveness of epidemic control. This study compared the domestic and imported cases of chikungunya from July 2019 to October 2019 and revealed a nonsignificant difference in patient sex. Specifically, sex was not a risk factor for chikungunya; however, the attack rate was slightly higher in women (71.4% for domestic cases and 64.6% for imported cases) than in men. Patient age exhibited a significant difference. Patients with domestic cases were mainly 60–69 years old (attack rate = 42.9%), whereas those with imported cases were predominantly 20–29 years old (attack rate = 30.4%). The older population accounted for a larger proportion of domestic confirmed cases, probably because older adults visited mountain areas that have vector mosquitoes (infected areas) more frequently than young people did, and they tended to underestimate the risk of the epidemic. A significant difference also emerged in the month of confirmation; specifically, the number of domestic confirmed cases increased in August and September proportionally to the increase in imported cases confirmed in July and August. This proportional increase may have occurred because patients with imported cases were bitten by noninfected vector mosquitoes that spread the disease, thereby indirectly increasing the number of domestic cases. A significant difference was also observed in the patients’ places of residence. Surprisingly, although Taipei City and New Taipei City exhibited similar numbers of imported cases, the proportion of domestic cases in New Taipei City to the total number of domestic cases of the two cities combined (95%, 20/21) was 19 times that of domestic cases in Taipei City (5%, 1/21). Such a high ratio may have been caused by patients who were infected in clusters in New Taipei City regularly visiting noncentral metropolitan areas near mountains; thus, they had a higher risk of being bitten by vector mosquitoes. In contrast, Taipei City is a metropolitan center in which residents were probably more aware of the disease and tended to maintain neighborhood cleanliness, contributing to the lower number of confirmed cases. Overall, differences between imported and domestic cases in terms of patient age, month of confirmation and place of residence may be risk factors for chikungunya in the Taiwanese population.
