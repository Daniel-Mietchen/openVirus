<p>In addition to the aforementioned preventive measures to control infectious disease, vaccine development is an epidemic prevention strategy to induce the human body’s immunity to external pathogens and achieve community immunity. Although the chikungunya virus is not associated with a high mortality rate, its severe and chronic symptoms have motivated experts to rapidly develop a vaccine. Vaccine development for the chikungunya virus began in 1960, when large-scale spread occurred in Thailand. Regarding progress until 2018, Reisinger and colleagues assessed the immunogenicity, tolerability, and safety of a live attenuated measles-vectored vaccine that expresses the chikungunya virus structural protein in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled phase-2 trial. The results revealed that the vaccine has a strong safety and immunogenicity profile, and plans for a phase 3 study are in preparation [

However, an expert of the US CDC argued that “the report of a successful chikungunya virus vaccine phase 2 clinical trial that might lead to a protective, licensed product in the future is a clear win for all those still at risk of infection by this highly debilitating arbovirus” [
