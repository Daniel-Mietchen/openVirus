<p>Because of global climate change and the increased travel between continents, tropical diseases including chikungunya are more likely to spread in Taiwan. Humans face new challenges in the control of these diseases. This study analyzed publicly available annual summary data of reported imported and domestic chikungunya cases from 2007 to 2019 published by the Taiwan CDC. All 112 chikungunya cases reported during and before 2018 were imported. The first domestic case was reported in July 2019 in a woman between 20 and 30 years old living in Tu-Cheng District, New Taipei City [

The patient’s activity area encompassed her home and an area with a high population of foreign workers, and she had no history of travel abroad. The patient reported having been bitten by mosquitoes during her activities in Tu-Cheng District. This suggests that undetected imported chikungunya cases were in the area. A few days after biting a person, a mosquito can carry the virus and cause more domestic infections. On 21 July 2019, the patient presented symptoms including fever, joint pain, headache, and rash. When the patient reported to the hospital, the doctor suspected dengue fever or measles; although testing excluded a suspected infection, chikungunya was confirmed in a routine test. Currently, the patient’s symptoms have improved, and she was isolated at home until the epidemic warning ended. Those who had contact with the patient have not exhibited any symptoms of chikungunya.
