<p>Research outside Taiwan has demonstrated that hot environments are associated with rapid disease transmission by vector mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-03615" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in late 2019 that climate change has progressed beyond the human capacity to adapt. Global temperatures since 2019 have exceeded those before the industrial revolution by 1.1 °C, and this decade will be the hottest in history. According to Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-03615" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Taiwan’s average temperature in 2019 was 24.56 °C, which was higher than that of 2018 by 0.34 °C and the highest since 1947. Therefore, the first cluster of confirmed cases of chikungunya in the fall of 2019 was probably caused by the increased temperatures during this year which increased the number of vector mosquitoes and subsequently the number and frequency of bites. The increase in temperature also accelerated viral replication in vector mosquitoes and expanded the spread of disease. In other words, Taiwan faces climate change and a climate emergency, both of which require an immediate response. Because of global warming, fall and winter have become warm; this has contributed to the spread of vector-borne disease, posing a great threat to public health. The government should plan public-health policies in advance and thoroughly implement preventive measures to safeguard the health of citizens.
