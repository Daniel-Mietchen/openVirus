<p>Viruses have been linked to a number of honey bee diseases [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and can act synergistically with other biotic and abiotic stressors, which can lead to the collapse of host colonies [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that viruses infecting honey bees can affect a wide range of other insect species [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and therefore threaten our ecosystems more profoundly than previously thought. In the last decades, numerous studies have been conducted to assess the prevalence of viruses in honey bee colonies throughout the world, mostly using molecular diagnostic tools. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of the diversity and distribution of viruses known to infect and replicate in 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. In this review, we first described the diversity of viruses infecting the western honey bee and their associated symptoms. In the second part we conducted an extensive literature survey of the geographical distribution of the major viruses infecting 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and reviewed their temporal population dynamics. In the third part, we discussed the multiple factors that influence the spatiotemporal distribution of viruses. Finally, we scanned the potential knowledge gaps of the field and identified new perspectives to tackle the future challenges associated with the viruses of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>.
