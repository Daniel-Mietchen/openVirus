<p>There is a general consensus that the industrial revolution and increase in global trade have greatly altered the geographical distribution of species [

 <xref rid="B3-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have become more frequent, and these are currently considered to be one of the most critical threats to wildlife, public health and food security [

 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, the threats caused by EIDs are compounded by an increase in the re-emergence of previously known diseases, caused by a variety of factors such as the evolution of antibiotic resistant pathogens [
