 <p>
  <bold>Host:</bold> In this review, we define the 
  <italic>host</italic> of a virus as the organism in which the pathogen actively replicates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Virus detection:</bold>
  <italic>Virus detection</italic> is the establishment of the presence of a particular virus in an organism, using a variety of technologies. The mere detection of a virus in the organism does not necessarily indicate that the pathogen is using the host to replicate.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Prevalence:</bold> The 
  <italic>prevalence</italic> of a virus is the proportion of a specified target group (e.g., populations) that is infected by that virus. In honey bees, the prevalence of viruses can be described at a wide range of scales, from organs [
  <xref rid="B38-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to species [
  <xref rid="B39-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and landscape levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Replication:</bold> Virus 
  <italic>replication</italic> refers to the multiplication of the virus within the host’s cells. Viruses rely on the host’s cellular machinery to replicate. Eventually, the replication of viruses may impair host fitness or result in the host’s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Symptoms:</bold>
  <italic>Symptoms</italic> are the physical or behavioral changes caused by the host’s adverse reaction to the presence and replication of a virus. The most striking virus symptom in honey bees are the wing malformations caused by DWV.
