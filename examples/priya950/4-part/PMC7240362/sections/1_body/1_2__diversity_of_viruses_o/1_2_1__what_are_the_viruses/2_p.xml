<p>Like in most other organisms, viruses with RNA genomes predominate in honey bees. These viruses typically consist of small icosahedral particles (17, 30 or 35 nm) that contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (ranging from 1.1â€“10 kbp) [

 <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After attaching to and penetrating into their host cells, these viruses generally replicate by injecting RNA directly into the cytoplasm. The host machinery (e.g., ribosomes) will then transcribe and generate new viral proteins, that will be assembled as a viral particle, released from the infected cell and will start infecting new cells. More recently, RNA viruses with a negative-sense, single-stranded genome, which are generally more difficult to propagate

 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, a few viruses with a DNA genome have been identified in honey bees. These DNA viruses differ from RNA viruses in the way they replicate. Once within their host cells, DNA viruses are transported to the host nucleus to be transcribed and translated. Although this group of viruses has been known to infect 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> for decades [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], studies involving DNA viruses remain much rarer than those on RNA viruses.
