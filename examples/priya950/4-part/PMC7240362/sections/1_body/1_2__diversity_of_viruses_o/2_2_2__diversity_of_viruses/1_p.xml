<p>Honey bee virology was relatively simple prior to the advent of cheap, fast, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. The only viruses that one knew or cared about were those that revealed themselves through symptoms: either physical (DWV, CWV, AmFV, AIV—see

 <xref rid="B42-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] linking a virus to the symptoms, which simultaneously confirmed the honey bee’s host status for the virus. The existence of other viruses was suspected and even sometimes revealed as unintended by-products of propagation [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the technological limitations of the day meant that other, asymptomatic viruses remained largely unknown.
