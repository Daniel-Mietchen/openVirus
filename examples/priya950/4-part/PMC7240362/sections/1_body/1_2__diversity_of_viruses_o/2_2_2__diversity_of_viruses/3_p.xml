<p>The extent of this virological biodiversity by itself poses questions about its origins and functional significance, either as former/future pathogens or molecular symbionts [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Impressive as it is, this accumulation of honey-bee-derived virus genome sequences needs to be completed by molecular, biological and epidemiological character studies in order to understand their possible functional and ecological roles [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and thus their current relevance and possible future significance. For the importance of adding biological flesh and personality to these sequences, one has to look no further than DWV, which was exactly one of these thousands of unassuming, asymptomatic viruses until it was weaponized by 
 <italic>V. destructor</italic> into becoming the scourge that it is today [
