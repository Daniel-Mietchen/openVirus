<p>Our survey shows that DWV is the most investigated virus of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (based upon the number of records in Web of Science), and is distributed almost globally. Only a few studies did not detect DWV, such as in the Ukraine [
 <xref rid="B118-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], Sudan [
 <xref rid="B119-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] and Kenya [
 <xref rid="B61-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. If these countries are truly free from this virus, keeping the DWV-free status will be nearly impossible as neighboring countries have reported its presence. Only truly remote and isolated territories, such as several island archipelagos [
 <xref rid="B120-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] can be confidently considered devoid of DWV, as well as Australia, the largest DWV-free territory in the world (but see conflicting reports [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B109-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B121-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]). In pretty much all these cases, the absence of DWV is directly related to the strictly regulated and enforced absence of 
 <italic>V. destructor</italic>. Another highly prevalent virus is SBV, which was not found in two investigated countries, Turkey [
 <xref rid="B122-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] and Uganda [
 <xref rid="B123-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Although BQCV is generally less studied than SBV, it was also distributed globally, and only a study in Syria [
 <xref rid="B124-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] did not detect this virus. Viruses of the acute bee paralysis complex (i.e. ABPV, IAPV and KBV) also have a worldwide distribution [
 <xref rid="B125-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>], and only two studies, from Mongolia [
 <xref rid="B126-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] and Uganda [
 <xref rid="B123-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], screened for and did not detect these viruses.
