<p>Given the commercialization, transportation and resulting quasiglobal distribution of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>), many viruses of the honey bee can be found on multiple continents. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00239-f001">Figure 1</xref>, we show the native distribution of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cerana</italic>. Both honey bee species are currently the most used species in commercial apiculture [

 <xref rid="B113-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In this review we focus on 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, although 
 <italic>A. cerana</italic> and other 
 <italic>Apis</italic> species are also potential hosts to the viruses reported here (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B114-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]). Summarizing the global distribution of a virus involves several limitations and difficulties, mostly due to the national and regional differences in how these are detected and reported. First, not all countries have the same means or techniques to screen for viruses or do not report their findings in readily accessible documents or formats, creating a knowledge gap for the presence or absence of the pathogens in different regions. For instance, there is a clear deficiency of studies that screen for viruses in African and Asian countries, even though beekeeping is present there. Secondly, reporting the absence of a certain virus in a location does not automatically render the whole country virus-free. Similarly, if a virus is detected, it does not mean that all the colonies in that country are infected. Finally, the honey bee host is not bound to national borders, nor to the precise localities where the viruses were reported, as hives may be relocated. For the purpose of this review, a general overview of the four most prevalent viruses or virus complexes is presented (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00239-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the most prevalent viruses are also those with a clear symptomatology, as these are more often reported and screened for. Although recently discovered viruses may well be less prevalent, these pathogens are also much less studied or screened for, creating a distorted view of their true distribution. One recent screening of apiaries in the USA showed however that two recently discovered viruses are widespread in the country [
