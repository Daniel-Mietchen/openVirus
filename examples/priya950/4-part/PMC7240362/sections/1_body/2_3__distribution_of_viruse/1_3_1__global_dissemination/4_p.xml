<p>The dissemination of viruses is not limited to the trade of live bees. In the case of artificial insemination of queens, the international trade of semen from drones with desirable apicultural traits is becoming a common practice. As honey bee viruses have been reported in semen [

 <xref rid="B94-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] and via transmission to the offspring [
 <xref rid="B108-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], this practice may impose a high risk for the transmission of viruses as it is virtually impossible to produce “virus-free” honey bee stocks. However, no data are currently available on the size and extent of this trade. Honey bee products have also been demonstrated to carry viruses and produce infection in exposed bees [
 <xref rid="B109-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]; despite the exposure for several weeks of combs to the sun, DWV remains infectious in pollen and honey. More studies are needed on bee products and their storage to assess the contribution of hive products to the dissemination of viruses by the international trade.
