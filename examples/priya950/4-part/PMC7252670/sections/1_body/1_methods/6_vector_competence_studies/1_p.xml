<p>At 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi), a maximum of 30 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> females were randomly collected and chilled. The wings and legs of each were removed and the proboscis was inserted into a 20 μL filter tip filled with 5 μL of FBS. After 30 min, medium containing the saliva was added to 45 μL of Leibovitz medium and stored at -80°C. Whole mosquito carcasses were also stored at -80°C before processing. After removing the head, the body and the head of each mosquito was mechanically ground separately for 30 seconds at 6,000 rpm with metal beads in 350 μL of Leibovitz medium supplemented with 2% FBS, 10% tryptose phosphate broth and antibiotics/antifungals (100 units/mL of penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin and 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific). The resulting homogenates were then centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The detection of viral particles in each homogenates or saliva sample was performed by virus titration as described above. The infection rate corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected body among all tested mosquitoes. The dissemination rate is the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious head among infected mosquitoes. The transmission rate is the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious viral particles in saliva among mosquitoes with infectious head, whereas transmission efficiency is the proportion of mosquitoes with virus in saliva among all tested mosquitoes.
