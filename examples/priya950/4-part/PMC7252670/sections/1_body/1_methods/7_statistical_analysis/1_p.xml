<p>Two replicate experiments were performed with the same population of mosquitoes and the same DENV strains. All percentages used for the comparison of the two experiments and the determination of the different rates and efficiency were statistically compared by Fisher’s exact test. Quantitative data corresponding to virus titers obtained from positive mosquitoes were statistically compared by two-sample Wilcoxon test. To narrow down the risk estimations of the simple dichotomous-outcome analysis, multivariate analysis for the different rates and efficiency were performed using logistic regression modeling (log-linear model): the dependent variable was the outcome expressed in two categories for each mosquito (presence or absence of virus), the independent variables were “days post-infection” (with 7 dpi as reference) and the DENV strains. All tests were performed using R software, considering
