<p>To conclude, our study provides the first experimental evidence of the ability of NC vector population 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to transmit all four DENV serotypes. Further studies on virus-vector interactions should be undertaken in the light of our results to better understand the DENV epidemiological profile in NC and the evolutionary dynamics of DENV at a larger scale. Indeed, DENV evolutionary dynamics are often characterized by DENV serotypic and/or genotypic replacements that can be epidemiologically significant. With only one proven vector for dengue in NC and the occurrence of DENV-1 genotype displacement in 2012, NC would be an ideal observatory to investigate the possible role of the vector in the selection of DENV variants and to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms driving DENV genotype replacement. Deepening our knowledge in this field is all the more important as DENV genotypes may differ in their antigenic properties and thus potentially have an impact on vaccine design.
