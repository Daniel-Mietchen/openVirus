Researchers and research teams need domain knowledge, along with skills in computing and, increasingly, data science expertise. We have been working to draw students into STEM, Computational Science and Data Science through our Team Zombie outreach program. The program leads the students through a scenario of a disease outbreak in their local area, which turns out to a potential zombie apocalypse. They become part of Team Zombie, a multi-disciplinary response team that investigates the outbreak; models the spread and potential interventions; works towards cures or vaccines; and provides options for detection and monitoring. Throughout the activities we make reference to real-world situations where the techniques are applied. Our program has engaged students from primary school through to university level, raising awareness of the range of approaches to problem solving through models and simulations. We hope this will inspire students to choose courses and careers in computational and data science.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Computational Science</kwd><kwd>STEM</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Around the world, educators are working to boost student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). According to Scitech, &#x02018;As we shift to an information-based, highly connected and technologically advanced society, STEM can empower individuals and communities with the problem-solving capabilities to meet unprecedented economic, social and environmental challenges&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to developing interest in the STEM subjects themselves, we can inspire students by exploring scenarios that require a combination of STEM knowledge and techniques.</p><p id="Par3">Computational and data science provide many vibrant examples of STEM. Combining one or more science disciplines with computer simulations and data analytics can give interactive and realistic experiences. A key requirement for outreach activities is to be able to easily explain the context and be inclusive of a wide range of ages and backgrounds. To give better reuse and flexibility, we also look to allow for hiding or revealing details, and moving through a range of models/solutions. An important point to get across is that we are working with models, which will always be wrong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Inspired by The Shodor Foundation&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] resources for mathematics and science education through the application of modeling and simulation technologies, we have previously developed outreach activities exploring supercomputing and simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this paper we discuss the development and results of a story/scenario-based approach where various techniques are applied through the investigation of a zombie apocalypse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Approach</title><p id="Par4">The initial simulation that inspired this work was an assignment set in Fundamentals of Programming, a Python programming course developed for Science and Engineering students at Curtin University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The assignment gave students a simple model of disease spreading through a population, which they then had to extend to incorporate barriers, immunity/recovery and airports. Discussions around the assignment often referred to it as modelling the zombie apocalypse. The additional engagement this elicited was a sign of the potential of the scenario for outreach purposes.</p><p id="Par5">To give authenticity to the resources, we considered real epidemic monitoring and policy. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides an example of the steps taken when investigating a disease outbreak. Our scenario begins by going through the steps required to identify and characterise a disease outbreak.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Epidemiologic steps of an outbreak investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Step</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Prepare for field work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Establish the existence of an outbreak</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">Verify the diagnosis</td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Construct a working case definition</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">Find cases systematically and record information</td></tr><tr><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">Perform descriptive epidemiology</td></tr><tr><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">Develop hypotheses</td></tr><tr><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically</td></tr><tr><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">As necessary, reconsider, refine, and re-evaluate hypotheses</td></tr><tr><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">Compare and reconcile with laboratory and/or environmental studies</td></tr><tr><td align="left">11</td><td align="left">Implement control and prevention measures</td></tr><tr><td align="left">12</td><td align="left">Initiate or maintain surveillance</td></tr><tr><td align="left">13</td><td align="left">Communicate findings</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par6">Steps 1&#x02013;4 would be done as preparatory work, looking at health, media and other reports. This is the settling in part of the outreach activity. Once the zombie diagnosis is established, we need more specific information about the type of zombie outbreak we&#x02019;re looking at (step 5&#x02013;6):</p><p id="Par7">Depending on the time available, we might have an activity around researching the various types of zombies in movies and literature. From our research, these are some of the known Zombie types (transmission and behaviour): <list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par8">Viral: An airborne virus infects the entire population. When people die, they re-animate four hours later as zombies. These zombies are gradually decomposing. They can be killed by destroying their brain. (Ref: Walking Dead)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Contact+Hoarding: Hoard zombies are attracted to sound, and speed up when moving towards noise. Contact from zombie to innocent bystander will turn said bystander into a zombie. Conversion takes twelve seconds. (Ref: World War Z)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Plant-based: A plant releases spores that turn people into zombies and hosts of the infection. The zombies transfer the spores to others. Animals can also be infected. (Ref: Last of Us)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Smart Zombies: Most zombies are mindless, but some can open doors and may be able to catch planes etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par12">With the infection information, and an understanding of the type of zombie we are dealing with, it&#x02019;s time to develop and validate models of the outbreak (steps 7&#x02013;10). These can extend on the models used in the assignment, described earlier. Steps 11&#x02013;12 look at the response and monitoring of the situation, while the final step looks at communicating the plans and progress of the response. The steps may be carried out in parallel, and may have feedback loops to update and reassess based on additional information throughout the investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The context for the outreach tasks is given to the students by memos, briefings and/or developed websites. After consideration of the various computational tools that could be developed for battling the Zombie Apocalypse, we focused on three key demonstrations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par14">Zombie Outbreak &#x02013; modelling the spread of the disease</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Zombie Detector &#x02013; application of computer vision and machine learning to automatically identify zombies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Zombie Vaccine &#x02013; once a potential vaccine has been identified and developed, modelling its dosage and distribution</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par17">We will now describe the approach and implementation for each of the demonstrations.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Modelling the Zombie Outbreak</title><p id="Par18">As the purpose of the model is to communicate the concepts around the spread of disease, we focused on the visual and interactive elements of the implementation. The Python simulation begins with a healthy population in a 2D grid. We use the PyGame package to provide an interactive interface where the user can click on individuals to infect them. The disease spreads via a set probability of infecting a cell&#x02019;s neighbours in a Moore neighbourhood (eight directions). The main loop of the program is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Python code for modelling the spread of disease</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="500810_1_En_46_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par19">Healthy and infected cells/individuals are indicated by colour (green/red in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A third option is a proportion of the population having immunity (yellow) which contains the spread of disease. Users can also enter a value to speed up the simulation. Possibly the most compelling part of the application is the underlying map of Perth, which localises the scenario and caused much excitement. Also included are natural and man-made barriers such as the river/ocean and bridges. Users can click on the bridges to break them down, allowing for isolation of the infected population.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Zombie Outbreak proved to be engaging and insightful, across all age groups </p><p>(developed by Cleye Jensen) (Color figure online)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="500810_1_En_46_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Detecting Zombies</title><p id="Par20">An important step in controlling a disease outbreak is the detection of infected people, preferably using a remote, automated system. When discussing zombies, a range of potential traits were considered:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par21">Speed of movement - slowness, gait</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Intelligence, or lack of it</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Odour - decomposing flesh</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Temperature - using thermal images</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Appearance - e.g. missing limbs, expression</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par26">Although temperature may have been the preferred approach, we chose to work with appearance as it would be engaging in an interactive display. To show the potential of computer vision, the premise was that zombies could be identified by their facial expression. We found no record of zombies smiling, so this could be a clear visual difference between healthy people and zombies.</p><p id="Par27">A Python program was developed to work with real-time camera footage to detect faces and flash up a warning if a face is determined to be a zombie (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Packages used included: sklearn, open cv (cv2), dlib, numpy and csv. The implementation finds a face using HAAR Cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and puts a bounding box on the face. Then the system identifies 68 facial landmarks, and the positioning of the landmarks is used to determine if the face is human or zombie, based on a training data set.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Visual detection of zombies </p><p>(developed by Harry Walters)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="500810_1_En_46_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Developing a Zombie Vaccine</title><p id="Par28">The third demonstration assumes that a vaccine or medication can be developed to protect healthy humans. Once we have a vaccine, we need to calculate how much of it is required, and how often, for there to be effective protection. With this individual information, we can then consider how many people can be saved, how much medication to produce, and whether there are difficult decision to be made due to limitations in supply.</p><p id="Par29">The demonstration used for communicating these concepts is based on the one-compartment model with repeat dosages described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This model has been used each semester in Fundamentals of Programming to explore simulations and parameter sweeps. In this case, we limit the interaction to adjusting key parameters to vary the half-life, absorption, dose and interval between doses. The diagram in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show the display of the demonstration code, which we are running in a Jupyter notebook (via Google Colab). In this case, the students see and interact with the code directly.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Drug dosage simulation - this one needs a bit more serum to provide effective treatment (developed by Brodie Sandford, based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>])</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="500810_1_En_46_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

We were informed that the Particle article had strong readership figures and received many queries for more information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">We have described an outreach project intended to increase awareness of computational science and the multi-disciplinary teams that are required to address the challenges facing our planet. The project has been able to capture the imagination of students, teachers and parents through interaction with our models and simulations. Lengthy interactions, requests for additional resources and school visits indicate that we have succeeded in engaging our audience. The media interest supports our belief that we have a useful premise and plausible resources. Future work will be to develop an improved online presence and additional resources, including browser and/or app-based simulations, lesson plans and more detailed materials to expand on specific aspects of the scenario.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>A squad of student volunteers joined Team Zombie to put together outreach materials and interactive displays.
