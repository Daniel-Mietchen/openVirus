<p id="Par29">The demonstration used for communicating these concepts is based on the one-compartment model with repeat dosages described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This model has been used each semester in Fundamentals of Programming to explore simulations and parameter sweeps. In this case, we limit the interaction to adjusting key parameters to vary the half-life, absorption, dose and interval between doses. The diagram in Fig.Â
