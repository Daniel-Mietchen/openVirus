<p id="Par18">As the purpose of the model is to communicate the concepts around the spread of disease, we focused on the visual and interactive elements of the implementation. The Python simulation begins with a healthy population in a 2D grid. We use the PyGame package to provide an interactive interface where the user can click on individuals to infect them. The disease spreads via a set probability of infecting a cell’s neighbours in a Moore neighbourhood (eight directions). The main loop of the program is shown in Fig.
