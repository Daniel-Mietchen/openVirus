<p id="Par27">A Python program was developed to work with real-time camera footage to detect faces and flash up a warning if a face is determined to be a zombie (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Packages used included: sklearn, open cv (cv2), dlib, numpy and csv. The implementation finds a face using HAAR Cascades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and puts a bounding box on the face. Then the system identifies 68 facial landmarks, and the positioning of the landmarks is used to determine if the face is human or zombie, based on a training data set.
