<p id="Par3">Computational and data science provide many vibrant examples of STEM. Combining one or more science disciplines with computer simulations and data analytics can give interactive and realistic experiences. A key requirement for outreach activities is to be able to easily explain the context and be inclusive of a wide range of ages and backgrounds. To give better reuse and flexibility, we also look to allow for hiding or revealing details, and moving through a range of models/solutions. An important point to get across is that we are working with models, which will always be wrong [
