<p id="Par35">This initiative has been run by Curtin Outreach for over 15 years. The four-day event has a program of science activities for Year 9 and 10 students. The premise is the give students with an interest in science a chance to participate in a range of science activities, with guidance from scientists and engineers who can share their love for their work. We were asked by the organisers to showcase Technology/Data as a link to the State Government’s priority areas. We were assigned a two hour timeslot with up to fifty students attending.</p>
