<p>Based primarily on the amplification and sequencing of ancient DNA (aDNA), the development of techniques for the detection, identification, and characterization of ancient pathogens has allowed us to better understand the natural history of some infectious diseases and their evolution as well as provide increasing knowledge on ancient microbiota and resolve historical controversies (Drancourt et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). In 1998, for the first time, 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> was detected by molecular biology in human dental pulps collected from skeletons buried in French graves dating back to the 18th century. This research opened a new way to establish the etiology of ancient infectious diseases from human or animal remains (Drancourt, Aboudharam, Signoli, Dutour, &amp; Raoult, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Furthermore, two experimental studies confirmed the interest of using dental pulp as a potential reservoir of blood‐borne bacteria. These works were conducted on guinea pigs by causing a bacteremia with 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>. The first work showed that 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> DNA was detected after a long time in the dental pulp, whereas it was no longer present in blood and spleen. This late detection was called the "memory effect" of the dental pulp (Aboudharam, Lascola, Raoult, &amp; Drancourt, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). The second work indicated the persistence of live bacteria in the dental pulp after intraperitoneal infection (Aboudharam, Drancourt, &amp; Raoult, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). The dental pulp is a conjunctive soft tissue, derived from ectomesenchyme, containing an abundant vascular system and nerves, in which anastomoses between venules and arterioles allow regular blood flow pressure. Therefore, microorganisms could penetrate and circulate in blood vessels and colonize the dental pulp (Dang, Aboudharam, Drancourt, &amp; Raoult, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In contrast to other tissues collected from ancient corpses and skeletons, such as hair, bones, mummified tissues that were exposed to the environment and more easily degraded; the dental pulp is located into a close cavity, isolated and well‐protected from the outside by enamel and dentin. Enamel and dentin are very hard mineralized tissues. They resist to external degradation factors and are the parts that last the longest after degradation of the body (Higgins &amp; Austin, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Krishan, Kanchan, &amp; Garg, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The dental pulp has become ultimately a reference tool for research in paleomicrobiology and the establishment of new knowledge for the history of some infectious diseases. Many international research teams now use ancient dental pulp with different methods based essentially on DNA (amplification/sequencing) and protein analysis to detect ancient septicemic agents.
