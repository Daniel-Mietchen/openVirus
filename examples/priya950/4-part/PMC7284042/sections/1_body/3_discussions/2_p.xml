<p>To more understand the important role of the dental pulp in paleomicrobiology, we summarized its structural anatomy. The dental pulp is a specialized loose connective tissue present in the center of the tooth, derived from the neural crest, and situated within mineralized dentin that is covered by enamel on the crown and cement on the root. Histologically, typical pulp architecture, from the periphery to the center, consists of an odontoblastic zone, cell‐free zone or Weil zone, cell‐rich zone and the core of the pulp. The pulp contains numerous cell types such as odontoblasts, fibroblasts, immune cells, nerve cells, endothelial cells, and stem cells (Attoumani, Drancourt, &amp; Ghigo,

 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Blood vessels and nerve fibers enter the pulp via the root apex, creating a rich network with a high density. The blood circulation of the dental pulp is a terminal circulation with arteriovenous shunts that compensate for blood pressure (Figure 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The smallest vessels form the terminal capillaries and are located within the odontoblastic layer. They influence the formation of dentin (Yoshida, Ohshima, &amp; Kobayashi, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). The average capillary density in pulp is higher than in most other tissues with 1.402/mm
 <sup>2</sup> (Vongsavan &amp; Matthews, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>) and the blood flow here is about 45 ml mm
 <sup>−1</sup> 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> of tissue, nearly equal to that of the brain, lower than that of the heart and kidneys (Kim, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>). The nerve fibers branch on the vessel walls and perivascular space. The neurovascular system maintains the normal function and self‐repair of teeth and has an important role in the regenerating process of the pulp tissue. Bacterial infection is considered the most common challenge to the pulp tissue (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). There are many ways for microbes to reach the pulp, listed as follows: exposed dentinal tubules, direct pulp exposure, periodontal pocket, faulty restoration, spread of an infected adjacent tooth, and blood‐borne microbes (Narayanan &amp; Vaishnavi, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Bacteria and their components are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in which Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) play a central role for activating the innate immunity; these receptors are expressed on odontoblasts, fibroblasts, and stem cells. Binding these TLRs to bacterial antigens initiates an inflammatory reaction that activates cells and releases mediators (Fawzy El‐Sayed, Klingebiel, &amp; Dörfer, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Nakanishi et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Yumoto et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Adaptive immunity complements innate immunity. It creates immunological memory after initial response to specific antigens, includes lymphocytes, mast cells, cytokines, and chemokines. Both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms represent an important defense system that eliminates the effects of threatening factors (Attoumani et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Hahn &amp; Liewehr, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). After death, the pulp is degraded over time, the components and the products of this process are kept in the pulp cavity or on the surface of the dentin. Recuperating the pulp‐dentin complex or total tooth grind for investigating pathogens of ancient septicemia is essential for pulp analysis.
