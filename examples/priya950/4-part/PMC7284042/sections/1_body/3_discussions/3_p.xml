<p>We suggested a general and detailed protocol with successive steps in using teeth for paleomicrobiology, from the collection at the beginning to organic molecule extraction at the final. Each step was established to ensure the authentic outcomes based on the analysis of DNA and protein. A total of seven methods was applied for pathogens’ identification, among them three for DNA (molecular biology, metagenomics,next‐generation sequencing) and four for protein (ICA, iPCR, ELISA and proteomics). Among the bacteria found in ancient dental pulp, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> has the largest number of publications, all bacterial identification methods were investigated for this pathogen, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> were identified by three methods and others only by one (Figure 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The availability of skeletal samples of plague has facilitated investigation, as evidenced by many methods created to increase diagnostic sensitivity, using proteins and DNA for material research. A general view of three methods was realized on ancient dental pulp, the percentage of detectable capacity is arranged here in increasing order: ELISA 8.8%, PCR 29.4%, iPCR 41.2%, and obviously, combining multiple methods increases the probability of bacterial detection in ancient pulp by 53% (Malou et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Tables 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The analysis of samples by autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs) shows that aDNA is better conserved in ancient dental pulp than in ancient bones (Ricaut, Keyser‐Tracqui, Crubézy, &amp; Ludes, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Although the quantity of DNA extracted was much lower in dental pulps than in ancient bones, the positivity rate confirmed using 
 <italic>Y. pestis pla</italic> gene in qPCR from dental pulps was higher than for bone remains, with 5.7% in bones and 37% in teeth (Schuenemann et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). RDT was used to identify 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> by targeting its specific protein, this technique gave a positivity rate of 35.7% (10/28 samples) while PCR was negative in 13 ancient bones samples (Haensch et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). RDT was applied to both ancient dental pulp and bones, which yielded different results. More specifically, bone and pulp samples were harvested from the same individuals, RDT detected 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> with the rate of 50% in bones and 100% in pulp from four skeletons (Bianucci et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), another study showed the opposite result with 66.7% of positivity in bones and 19% of positivity in pulp from the same 21 skeletons (Bianucci et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>).
