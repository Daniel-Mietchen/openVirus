<p>In total, 10 bacteria and one virus were identified by seven techniques in the human dental pulp during the last 20 years (Figure

 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (anthrax; Nguyen‐Hieu et al.,

 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Tran, Signoli, et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), cowpox virus (cowpox), and 
 <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic> (cat‐scratch disease; Papagrigorakis et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Therefore, it is useful to multiply multidisciplinary collaborations, not only to discover the microorganisms mentioned above but other microorganisms including viruses. In a previous study made from intact modern teeth, 100% healthy pulp (10/10), showed the presence of bacterial DNA. The predominant genera were Actinetobacter, Ralstonia, and Staphylococcus (Widmer et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Until now, two virus that cause worldwide epidemics were found from modern pulpar tissues by molecular biology: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Glick, Trope, Bagasra, &amp; Pliskin, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>; Glick, Trope, &amp; Pliskin, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), with a higher rate of identification of HCV in the dental pulp by molecular biology than in whole blood by immunoenzymatic reaction (Siravenha et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
