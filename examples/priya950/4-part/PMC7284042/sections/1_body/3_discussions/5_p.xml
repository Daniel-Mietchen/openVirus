<p>A lot of techniques have been applied to ancient materials but not ancient pulp. Immunohistochemistry uses monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to determine antigens in tissue sections, a kind of antigen‐antibody reaction. By using this technique, 
 <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, the causative agent of syphilis, was found on the skin of a female Italian mummy (1503–1568) in Naples, showing signs of tertiary syphilis (Fornaciari, Castagna, Tognetti, Tornaboni, &amp; Bruno, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>); 
 <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic>, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), was also identified in some ancient tissues from a patient who died in 1901 (Dumler, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). The immunologic techniques mentioned above belong to the field of paleoserology, including ICA, iPCR, and ELISA, which basically uses antibodies to detect 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> antigens in the ancient pulp. Another technique consisting in the purification of immunoglobulin should be performed differently: immunoglobulins could be isolated from ancient pulp, after purification, then confronted to antigens of suspected pathogens. This method was practiced to confirm the presence of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> in a 200‐year‐old bone fragment (Kolman, Centurion‐Lara, Lukehart, Owsley, &amp; Tuross,
