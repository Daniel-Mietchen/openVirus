<p>In addition to confirming the aetiologies of blood‐borne infections, dental pulp also contributed to determine species, this is an important task that could involve genetic analysis or metagenomics. Recently, MALDI‐TOF MS allowed to distinguish species through creating protein files from various cell lines (Zhang, Scalf, Berggren, Westphall, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). In 2011, this technique analyzed peptides from ancient dental pulp of different mammalian species, including humans, the specific spectrum of each species helped classify them into more accurate categories (Tran, Aboudharam, et al.,
