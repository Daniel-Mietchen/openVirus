<p>Dental X‐ray is used to visualize the internal structure of the teeth, such as the pulp chamber, the presence of calcification, sometimes detect discrete fissures on teeth and jaws. Advanced imaging technologies including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, spiral CT, cone‐beam CT, micro‐CT and Synchrotron Radiation‐based micro‐Computed Tomography (SRµCT) have been widely employed to yield the detailed image of the complex dental structure. Furthermore, these techniques allowed for an easier and more accurate analysis (Kato, Ziegler, Utsumi, Ohno, &amp; Takeichi,

The accumulation of X‐ray irradiation influences the degradation of aDNA, indeed, the quality of aDNA from bone samples is unaffected with doses below 200 Gy, negligible between 200 Gy and 2.000 Gy, but the quality of the DNA is deteriorating with doses above 2.000 Gy (Immel et al.,
