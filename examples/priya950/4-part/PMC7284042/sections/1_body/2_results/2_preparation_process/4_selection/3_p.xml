<p>The age of teeth before extraction from the jawbone or death has a significant impact on nuclear DNA yield, as the older teeth resist better to decomposition. This observation can be explained by the dental structure. Indeed, mature teeth have closed apices, more compact enamel, and dentin, thicker and less porous cementum, therefore DNA in these teeth is preserved and less degraded than in young teeth (Higgins et al.,
