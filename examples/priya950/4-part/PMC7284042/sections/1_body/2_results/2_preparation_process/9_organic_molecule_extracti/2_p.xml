<p>For the identification of pathogens, the DNA‐based detection approach is the most commonly used, while the emerging protein fragment‐based approach is increasingly used today and is very effective (Figure 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is efficient not only on ancient teeth but also on other ancient samples. Indeed, the phenol‐chloroform protocol has been widely used and has demonstrated optimal results in the recovery of nucleic acid with the highest quantity and quality (Barnett &amp; Larson, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). For protein extraction, the modified protocol was applied for matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization‐time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS), Enzyme‐Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA), immuno‐Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR (iPCR), and Liquid Chromatography‐Mass Spectrometry (LC‐MS; Malou et al.,
