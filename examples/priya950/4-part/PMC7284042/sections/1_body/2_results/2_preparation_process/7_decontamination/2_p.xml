<p>The contamination with exogenous sources from the archaeological context or laboratory manipulation is a major issue when working with ancient skeletons

 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), for ancient teeth, contaminants can be found at the level of the apex. After washing extensively with sterile water and removing any retained soft tissue or bone adherence, teeth could be decontaminated with different techniques such as the removal of the outer layer by a high‐speed surgical handpiece (Rubio, Martinez, Martinez, &amp; Martin de las Heras, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC: 200–280 nm), irradiation (Yin et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), soaking in hydrogen peroxide or washing in ethanol (Ginther, Issel‐Tarver, &amp; King, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). The most frequently used technique was washing in sodium hypochlorite (bleach; Kemp &amp; Smith,

 <italic>.</italic> These techniques were designed to eliminate exogenous DNA but their impact on endogenous DNA has not been established. The use of bleach was mentioned but limited. To extract teeth from the jaws under clean conditions, they should be brushed under tap water to remove dirt or debris and finally washed with DNA‐free water (Higgins &amp; Austin,
