<p>There are several methods to collect ancient dental pulp. For instance, retrograde or ‘reverse root canal’ uses the root apex as penetration site (Cobb,

A third method has been applied in many research works: using an electric motor with rotating diamond disc to open the teeth longitudinally, afterward, the pulp and dentine powder is scraped into a sterile tube using a sterile instrument. The two parts of the tooth could be glued together after extirpation of the pulp in order to preserve dental morphology (Drancourt et al.,
