<p>The contamination of ancient samples resulting from contact with the environment is more difficult to detect than that resulting from laboratory works (Serre, Hofreiter, &amp; Pääbo, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), in fact, the dental pulp was rarely contaminated by the environment due to its structure and protocol in teeth selection. With molecular analysis, it is necessary to use controls at the time of extraction and amplification of the DNA. These are either internal controls added at the time of extraction, to validate the extraction of the DNA at the time of amplification, or controls added at the time of amplification, to validate the amplification but not the extraction of the DNA (Handt, Höss, Krings, &amp; Pääbo, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). The best way to eliminate doubts about laboratory contamination is the replication of results by another laboratory. It is actually the highest standard in active laboratories, especially in aDNA studies, to show true evidence (Willerslev &amp; Cooper, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). For pathogen detection in ancient dental pulp, “suicide PCR” was considered as a principle to avoid any risk of contamination, it included: (a) primers which were used only once, (b) no positive control, (c) negative controls were added, (d) positive results were followed by sequencing. Although “suicide PCR” could show a low sensitivity, it had a high specificity and amplification process, ensuring almost positive predictive values (Raoult et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). It is important to follow correctly paleomicrobiology protocols for dental pulp to minimize risks of human DNA contamination during laboratory manipulation (Drancourt et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
