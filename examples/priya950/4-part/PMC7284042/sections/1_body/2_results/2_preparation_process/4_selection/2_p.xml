<p>Human teeth are divided into four groups with different sizes and shapes, yet the histological structure of all teeth is almost identical (Malaver &amp; Yunis, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The volume of the pulp is correlated with the amount of DNA recovered, the larger the pulp volume, the more the pulp cavity contains cells (De Leo et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Teeth selection for pulp investigation should preferably focus on larger pulp cavities. Indeed, our unpublished data on the volume of old teeth indicates a significant difference between the total volume of the teeth and the volume of the pulp of the four types of teeth. The latter is, from the largest to the smallest, molars, canines, premolars, and incisors (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A guideline for suitable ancient teeth selection was proposed in order to obtain as much dental pulp as possible, it describes several possibilities (Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>): (a) intact teeth with a closed apex, (b) teeth with single root are easier to manipulate and may have a larger cavity and yield a larger volume of pulp, (c) unerupted teeth should be investigated instantly after being removed from the jawbone, (d) multiple teeth were chosen per individual to maximize chances of detection. For example, the number of ancient teeth per individual analyzed by PCR and containing the plague agent 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> was 3/3 teeth, 1/4 teeth, and 1/2 teeth (Drancourt et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Also, after two teeth were extracted from the same individual, PCR analysis revealed that the first contained both 
 <italic>B. quintana</italic> and 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, the second contained only 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (Tran, Forestier, Drancourt, Raoult, &amp; Aboudharam,
