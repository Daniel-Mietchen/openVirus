<p>This stage aims at recording the visual information of teeth such as their form, color, fissures, and position on the jaws (Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Teeth and jaws should be photographed with different orientations to obtain a complete overview. Currently, we photograph the four sides of the teeth when they are dissociated from the jaw. However, the use of a scale would allow comparing the size on the photos or allow re‚Äêspecifying the measure when necessary.
