<p>Recently, Liquid Chromatography‐Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) was applied to determine four specific peptides of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> proteins from dental pulps in 3/16 individuals collected in archaeological plague‐positive places while in the negative control, no 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> specific peptide was found. This result from LC/MS opens a new method in paleoproteomics that studies proteins to diagnose ancient blood‐borne pathogens in the dental pulp. Furthermore, 30 proteins of human origin were found in this research (Barbieri et al.,

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the dental pulp of the painter Michelangelo Merisi (Drancourt et al.,
