<p>Immunological methods with ELISA and immunohistochemistry were applied to identify F1 antigen of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> in ancient bone specimens (Cerutti, Marin, &amp; Rabino Massa, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Immuno‐PCR that was described in 1992 combined an immunological technique (ELISA) and a molecular technique (real‐time PCR), in which the marker was a specific DNA, it allowed increasing the sensitivity of detection of any specific antigen in samples (Sano, Smith, &amp; Cantor, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). For the first time, both iPCR and ELISA were adapted for the detection of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> antigens in dental pulp, furthermore, combining three techniques (iPCR, ELISA, and PCR) gave the highest positive percentage in the diagnosis of 34 ancient teeth from five archeological sites (Malou et al.,
