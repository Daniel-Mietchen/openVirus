<p>Previously, bacterial identification based on host protein signatures was challenging for ancient specimens. For example
 <italic>,</italic> the presence of the agent of tuberculosis, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, in archaeological human remains was suggested by osteological examination and easily confirmed by biomolecular techniques. MALDI‐TOF MS, a new approach by proteomics, identified 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from human ancient bone samples through spectra of proteins (Boros‐Major et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Hajdu et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and mycolic acids (Mark, Patonai, Vaczy, Lorand, &amp; Marcsik, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Then, an article revealed that the presence of mycolic acids of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the previous research was not enough evidence to have confirmation (Minnikin, Lee, Pitts, Baird, &amp; Besra, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, a study in 2016 showed the difficulties of protein identification from 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> because of the lack of specific proteins, the peptide mass fingerprint used in these researches was not so different from human collagen (Hendy et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
