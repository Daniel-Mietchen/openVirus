<p>In 2003, a research group developed and successfully tested a new immunochromatographic assay (ICA), aimed at rapidly and exactly identifying 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> in samples from people suspected of having plague. The technique used monoclonal antibodies to detect the F1 antigen of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, as well as rapid diagnostic test (RDT) which was able to give the result after 10–15 min, positivity was defined when the threshold of the antigen concentration was higher than 0.5ng/ml and indicated by two pink lines (Chanteau et al.,

 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> was the cause of the death of plague victims from different sites in Europe (Bianucci et al.,
