    "INTRODUCTION:Dental pulp with special structure has become a good reference sample in paleomicrobiology-related blood-borne diseases, many pathogens were detected by different methods based on the diagnosis of nucleic acids and proteins. OBJECTIVES:This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during the past 20 years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. METHODS:The papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and Google scholar with combining keywords: \"ancient,\" \"dental pulp,\" \"teeth,\" \"anatomy,\" \"structure,\" \"collection,\" \"preservation,\" \"selection,\" \"photography,\" \"radiography,\" \"contamination,\" \"decontamination,\" \"DNA,\" \"protein,\" \"extraction,\" \"bone,\" \"paleomicrobiology,\" \"bacteria,\" \"virus,\" \"pathogen,\" \"molecular biology,\" \"proteomics,\" \"PCR,\" \"MALDI-TOF,\" \"LC/MS,\" \"ELISA,\" \"immunology,\" \"immunochromatography,\" \"genome,\" \"microbiome,\" \"metagenomics.\" RESULTS:The analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp help to distinguish species. CONCLUSIONS:Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics."
