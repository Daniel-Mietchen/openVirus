<p id="Par19">Syphilis is a sexually and vertically transmitted disease (STD), which is caused by the 
 <italic>spirochaete Treponema pallidum</italic> subspecies pallidum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 17.7 million individuals aged 15–49 years had syphilis globally in 2012, with 5.6 million new cases every year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the low and middle-income countries, the risk for heterosexual spread of syphilis has declined in the general population but remains a challenge in some high-risk subpopulations, such as female sex workers (FSWs) and their male clients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The infection of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> can cause cutaneous lesions, late complications such as neurologic and cardiovascular disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and congenital syphilis with other immediate complications, such as premature labor and low birthweight [
