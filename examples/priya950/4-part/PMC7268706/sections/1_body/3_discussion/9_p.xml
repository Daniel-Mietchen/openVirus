<p id="Par40">There are several limitations in this study. There might exist false-negative testing results because of the sensitivity of the colloidal gold kits. Our estimate for the prevalence of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection could be conservative, because many young individuals, who had a higher risk of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection, were more likely to search jobs outside and were not able to participate in the study. In addition, the history of drug abuse and other high-risk behaviors relied on self-reporting without further verification, which might result in a misclassification bias for the estimation of associations between study factors and 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection. The number of syphilis-infected people was small and there might be a lack of statistical power to detect certain associations. The cross-sectional design did not allow us to assume any causal relationships between associated factors and 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection.
