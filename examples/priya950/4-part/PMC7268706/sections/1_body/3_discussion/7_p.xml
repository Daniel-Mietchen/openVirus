The Chinese government has also committed to eliminate the mother-to-child transmissions of HIV, syphilis and HBV with an ambitious plan for prenatal screening being executed nationwide. Given the high rate of co-infection with HCV found in this study area, pregnant women should also be screened for HCV.
