  <p>Immunohistochemical detection and distribution of PEDV antigen-positive cells in the proximal jejunum, mid-jejunum, or distal jejunum of a gnotobiotic 9-day-old pig inoculated with the original US non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC21A. The pig exhibited vomiting (but no diarrhea) at post-inoculation hour (PIH) 16 and was euthanized. (A) Proximal jejunum distant by 15 cm from the pylorus, showing low numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells (red color) in the villus-crypt interface (arrows). (B) Proximal jejunum distant by 30 cm from the pylorus, showing high numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells (red color) in most of the villous epithelium. (C) Mid-jejunum [mid-location of the small intestine (duodenum to ileum)], showing extremely high numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells (dark red color) in most of the epithelium of mildly atrophied villi. (D) Distal jejunum, showing moderate numbers of PEDV antigen-positive cells (red color) in the villus-crypt interface. Original magnification, all ×40. Fast Red, Gill’s hematoxylin counterstain.</p>
