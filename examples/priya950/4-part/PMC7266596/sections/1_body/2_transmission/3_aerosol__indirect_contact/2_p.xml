 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder et al., 2016</xref>). The nasal cavity of naïve pigs housed at a distance from clinical pigs was frequently positive for PEDV RNA (
 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder et al., 2016</xref>). Aerosolized PEDV does not infect only the intestine of pigs (
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Alonso et al., 2015</xref>), but it also infects the epithelium lining the nasal cavity (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2018)</xref> reported that dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa or lymphoid tissue carry and transfer PEDV to CD3

 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder et al., 2016</xref>). In the study, none of aerosol contact, 28-day-old pigs (0/5 pigs) was infected, although their nasal cavities (5/5 pigs) were positive for PEDV RNA.
