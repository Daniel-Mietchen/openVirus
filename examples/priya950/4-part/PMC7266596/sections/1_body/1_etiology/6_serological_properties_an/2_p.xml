<p id="par0060">Antigenic cross-reactivity or cross-neutralization between PEDV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting and immune-precipitation (
 <xref rid="bib0785" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 1988</xref>), or VN tests (
 <xref rid="bib0780" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Despite no serological cross-neutralization detected between PEDV and TGEV (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann and Wyler, 1989</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0560" ref-type="bibr">Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978</xref>), investigators found some antigenic cross-activity between PEDV and TGEV (Miller, but not Purdue strain) based on at least two conserved epitopes on the N-terminal region of their N proteins, as well as

 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Truncation of the N-terminal region of the N protein or avoidance of M- or purified whole virus-based serologic tests may eliminate PEDV and TGEV shared epitope(s) or reduce the possible cross-reactivity for serologic assays (

 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Polyclonal hyperimmune antisera against PDCoV did not cross-react with PEDV (
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015c</xref>). Among N, M and E proteins and whole PEDV particles, only the M protein of PEDV showed cross-reactivity in 1/12 convalescent sera from PDCoV-infected pigs (
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017</xref>). However, one study reported antigenic cross-reactivity between US PDCoV and PEDV strains, possibly due to at least one shared epitope in the N-terminal region of their N proteins (
 <xref rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). For SADS-CoV, monoclonal antibody against the N protein did not cross-react with PEDV, TGEV or PDCoV (
