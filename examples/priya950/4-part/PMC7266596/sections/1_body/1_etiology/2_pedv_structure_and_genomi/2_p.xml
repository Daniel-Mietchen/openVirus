Details of the viral structure and genome, epidemiology, evolution, and replication of PEDV are described by Thiel and colleagues in another review in this current special issue. PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size (excluding the poly A-tail) that encodes four structural proteins, namely, S, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) and an accessory protein ORF3 (

 <xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). The S protein is divided into S1 [amino acids (aa) 1–726 based on PEDV CV777] and S2 (aa 727–1386) subunits. The N-terminal S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain and the C-terminal S2 subunit is responsible for membrane fusion (
