<p id="par0050">Researchers evaluated cross-reactivity or cross-neutralization between G2b non-S INDEL and G1b S INDEL PEDV using convalescent sera from pigs infected with each strain in immunofluorescent assays (IFA) or cell culture IF (CCIF) assays and virus neutralization (VN) tests

 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015b</xref>). The IFA or CCIF PEDV antibody titers of the two convalescent sera against both PEDV strains were similar by the assays using S INDEL PEDV antigen, but the titers differed slightly (higher antibody titers against non-S INDEL than for S INDEL strain) when using non-S INDEL PEDV antigen (

 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015b</xref>). However, there were 4- to 16-fold differences in the CCIF and VN antibody titers of pig antisera between either of the two strains and G1a CV777 (
