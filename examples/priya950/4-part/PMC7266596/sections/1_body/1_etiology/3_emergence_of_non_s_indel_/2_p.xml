<p id="par0045">The US G2b non-S INDEL and G1b S INDEL strains were first detected in Aprilâ€“May 2013 and January 2014, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0715" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). The US G2b strains were genetically closest to PEDV strains that emerged in China in 2010 (

 <xref rid="bib0715" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). The G2b non-S INDEL PEDV strains that emerged in China in 2010 caused large PED outbreaks (

 <xref rid="bib0705" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In China, the S INDEL PEDV strains were detected in 2011 (
 <xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>), probably resulting from recombination events between the G1a CV777-lineage classical and the G2 strains of PEDV (
