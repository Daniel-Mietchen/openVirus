There was 0% mortality rate of piglets (with 57 % reduced incidence of diarrhea), compared with mean 33 % mortality and 100 % morbidity rates of piglets born to non-immunized sows. However, another study revealed that more than 80 % of the piglets inoculated orally with a G1b S INDEL PEDV (Iowa106 strain) at 3âˆ’4 days of age had diarrhea after challenging with a G2b non-S INDEL PEDV at 24 days of age, whereas none of the piglets inoculated previously and then challenged with the same non-S INDEL PEDV showed diarrhea (
