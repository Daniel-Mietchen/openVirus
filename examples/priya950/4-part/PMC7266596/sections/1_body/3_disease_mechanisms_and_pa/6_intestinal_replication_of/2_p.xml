<p id="par0100">During the incubation period (&lt;PIH 16) in nursing pigs, a few to 50 % of the villous epithelial cells positive for PEDV antigen were seen in the villous-crypt interface and upper villous epithelium of the small intestine (

During the middle [post-inoculation day (PID) 1–3] to late (PID 4−5) stages of PEDV infection of nursing pigs (5–9-day-old), regardless of the locations (except for the duodenum with milder villous atrophy), all small intestinal segments exhibited similar, extensive villous atrophy (mean 1−2 intestinal villous height to crypt depth ratios, compared with 5–9 of uninfected pigs) (

 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015a</xref>). During this period, large numbers of PEDV-infected epithelial cells could still be observed (
