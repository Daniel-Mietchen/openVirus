<p id="par0155">Clinically infected pigs responded to a primary PEDV infection and seroconverted at PID 7–14 (mean PID 14) (PID 14–21 for serum PEDV-specific IgA antibodies), with peak serum PEDV-specific IgG or IgA antibody titers at PID 21 (

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>). Serum VN antibodies were detected 7 days earlier than serum PEDV-specific IgG antibodies (

 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2015a</xref>). There were low titers of PEDV-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) in the feces of PEDV-infected pigs (10-day or 8-week-old) by PID 14 (
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al., 2016</xref>). Serum PEDV-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in naturally infected sows remained high for 6 months, whereas fecal PEDV-specific sIgA antibodies disappeared 1−2 months after infection (
 <xref rid="bib0545" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2015</xref>). PEDV-specific IgA or VN antibody titers of sows infected at 3 months pre-farrowing peaked in the colostrum at post-farrowing day (PFD) 1, decreased rapidly in milk by PFD 3, and then declined only gradually during PFD 4–19 (
 <xref rid="bib0635" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2016</xref>). Memory B cell responses were first identified by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> secondary stimulation in mononuclear cells from PEDV CV777-infected nursing pigs at PID 21 (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">de Arriba et al., 2002a</xref>). The number of PEDV-specific IgA antibody-positive pigs also rose from 30 % at the day of re-infection to 70 % 3 days later (
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the number of PEDV-specific IgA antibody secreting cells of sows infected at 3−4 months pre-farrowing and then after re-exposure to PEDV at PFD 3–5, increased in the milk at PFD 8–14, compared with PFD 0 (colostrum) or PFD 3–5, and then peaked at PFD 15–22 (
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">Langel et al., 2019b</xref>). Previously infected sows showed increased VN and PEDV-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in the colostrum and milk after vaccination with an inactivated PEDV at 5 and 2 weeks pre-farrowing, whereas naïve sows showed no or little VN or PEDV-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in the colostrum and milk after the same vaccination (
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2018</xref>). Memory B cells, following PEDV infection or oral vaccination, may play a critical role in induction of rapid systemic and mucosal humoral immune responses to PEDV upon re-infection or booster vaccination.
