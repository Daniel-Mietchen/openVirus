<p id="par0105">Diarrhea induced by PEDV is a consequence of malabsorption and maldigestion due to massive loss and functional disorders of infected enterocytes, followed by decreased brush border membrane-bound digestive enzymes (

 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Saif, 2015</xref>). Serotonin is involved in induction of vomiting, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in part led to decreased appetite (

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Saif, 2017</xref>). The damaged gut integrity may lead to uptake of luminal food and bacteria causing allergic reactions and co-infections. The impaired gut integrity or digestive function usually recovered by the second week after infection in survived pigs (
