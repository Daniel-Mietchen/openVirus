<p id="par0135">During the clinical period, alteration in the abundance or proportion of gut microbiota (dysbiosis) occurred in nursing pigs and their dams (

 <xref rid="bib0640" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2017</xref>). The dysbiosis was characterized by reduced numbers of beneficial bacteria (Verrucomicrobia) and increased numbers of harmful bacteria (Fusobacterium and Proteobacteria) (

 <xref rid="bib0675" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2019</xref>), followed by decreased cellular transport and catabolism (
