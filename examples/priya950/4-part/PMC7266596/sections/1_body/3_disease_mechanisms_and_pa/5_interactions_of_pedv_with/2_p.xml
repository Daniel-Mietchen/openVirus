<p id="par0095">PEDV antigens were also frequently detected in the intestinal crypt cells or antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages, in the lamina propria or Peyer's patches (

 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), but dendritic cells may not be a site of PEDV replication (
 <xref rid="bib0720" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, PEDV appeared to employ dendritic cells to cross the epithelial barrier of the nasal cavity (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Lung tissues of oronasally infected pigs were negative for PEDV antigen (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2014</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib0665" ref-type="bibr">Sueyoshi et al., 1995</xref>). However, the upper respiratory tract may be the site of PEDV infection, because the epithelium lining the nasal cavity was positive for PEDV antigens (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Although acute viremia was frequently noted in infected pigs during the acute or incubation stage of infection (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr">Madson et al., 2016</xref>), PEDV antigens were not detected in other major organs, such as liver and kidneys (
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Debouck et al., 1981</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib0665" ref-type="bibr">Sueyoshi et al., 1995</xref>). The reproductive organs of experimentally infected boars, such as Cowpersâ€™s glands, were also negative for PEDV RNA, but their semen was transiently positive for PEDV RNA (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Gallien et al., 2018b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Nevertheless, whether the PEDV RNA-positive semen contained infectious viral particles is unclear.
