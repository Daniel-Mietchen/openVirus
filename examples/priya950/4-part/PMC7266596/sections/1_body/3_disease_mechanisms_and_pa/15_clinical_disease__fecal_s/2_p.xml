<p id="par0145">The virulence of PEDV was attenuated by: 1) high cell-culture passage (93rd–160th) in the cell line of non-swine origin, Vero cells (with trypsin in the cell culture medium) (

 <xref rid="bib0680" ref-type="bibr">Teeravechyan et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, PEDV variants of mild virulence, such as the S1 N-terminal domain (NTD)-Del variant, also occurred naturally (

 <xref rid="bib0670" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0760" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>). PEDV strains fully adapted to Vero cells and serially passaged at least 70 times (with trypsin or GCDCA in the cell culture medium) tended to replicate less efficiently in the intestine of pigs (

 <sub>50</sub> of G1a PEDV 83P-5 (100th passage in Vero cells) exhibited only intermittent fecal viral RNA shedding in 3 of 4 pigs (

Compared with G2b PEDV YN (144th) and PC22A (140–160th passage in Vero cells) grown with trypsin, G2b PEDV 8aa (70th–105th passage in Vero cells) grown with GCDCA and attenuated at lower cell passage numbers, caused no or little fecal viral RNA shedding in 1-day-old pigs (6 log

 <sub>10</sub> PFU of PC22A (140th–160th) showed low to moderate fecal viral RNA shedding titers, with mild villous atrophy (
 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017a</xref>) (

 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of G2b PEDV CT (120th passage in Vero cells) showed mild diarrhea and moderate fecal viral RNA shedding titers, with mild villous atrophy (
 <xref rid="bib0740" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, pregnant sows orally inoculated with G1a PEDV DR13 (100th passage in Vero cells) showed no clinical signs but high VN antibody levels in the colostrum (
 <xref rid="bib0630" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2007</xref>). Attenuated PEDV strains (highly passaged in Vero cells) were less infectious, replicative, and immunogenic in the intestine of pigs (with mild or no clinical disease or lesions) compared with the corresponding virulent PEDV strains.
