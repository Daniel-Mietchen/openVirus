<p id="par0080">Porcine small intestinal villous enterocytes express aminopeptidase N (APN), a 150-kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein, which was tentatively identified as the cellular receptor for PEDV (

 <xref rid="bib0525" ref-type="bibr">Nam and Lee, 2010</xref>). However, porcine APN may not be the major cell surface receptor for PEDV (

 <xref rid="bib0770" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Cell membrane cholesterol or two cell surface molecules, such as sialic acids and occludin expressed on the apical surface of secretary (goblet) or absorptive enterocytes, respectively, were involved partially in binding and entry of PEDV into enterocytes (
