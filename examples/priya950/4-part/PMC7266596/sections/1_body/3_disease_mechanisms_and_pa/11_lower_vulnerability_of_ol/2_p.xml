<p id="par0125">Compared with nursing pigs, several factors that influence a shorter recovery of weaned pigs from PED include: 1) the faster regeneration of enterocytes in weaned pigs compared with nursing pigs (

 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015a</xref>). There was a lack of LGR5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5, marker for crypt stem cells)-positive crypt base columnar cells (LGR5+ cells) and low proliferation of crypt cells in the small intestine of naïve nursing piglets (9-day-old), causing the slower turnover of enterocytes (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015a</xref>). Unlike nursing pigs, naïve weaned pigs (3-week-old) exhibited high proliferation of intestinal crypt cells and large numbers of LGR5+ cells in the crypts, leading to the higher turnover rate of enterocytes (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2015a</xref>). After PEDV infection, large numbers of LGR5+ cells and high proliferation of crypt cells were maintained, possibly relating to the rapid recovery from PED in weaned pigs.
