<p id="par0185">For maintaining or boosting herd immunity initiated through feedback or oral live vaccines in farrowing herds, IM administration with either live PEDV (
 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2018</xref>) or inactivated, adjuvanted whole-virus PEDV vaccine (
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2018</xref>) once or twice at 4âˆ’5 or 2 weeks pre-farrowing was effective in boosting lactogenic immunity in sows positive for PEDV-specific IgA memory B cells in GALT. Many vaccine candidates or products have been tested and developed in the US and worldwide. The details were reviewed previously (

 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017</xref>). IM live vaccine booster plus feedback was more effective in reducing the number of deaths of suckling piglets, compared with either IM live vaccine alone or feedback alone (
 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Prime and boost IM vaccination with inactivated PEDV provided incomplete protection of piglets against PEDV infection (
