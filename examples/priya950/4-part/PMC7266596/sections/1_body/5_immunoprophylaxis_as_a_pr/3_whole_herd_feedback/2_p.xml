The most common practice used to initiate herd immunity in US pig farms during the 2013–2017 epidemic when no PEDV vaccines were available, was use of whole-herd feedback using a load-close-expose protocol (59/77 herds surveyed; 76.6 %), in which a controlled exposure for gilt acclimation (23/77 herds surveyed; 29.9 %) was included (
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018</xref>), whereas 19/77 herds surveyed (24.7 %) used vaccination. There is no standard feedback protocol for any type of pig production systems to have the most consistent and highest efficacy (

Immunization of pregnant sows, or gilts expected to be bred (gilt acclimation), is undertaken by exposure to virulent autogenous virus, such as minced intestines from infected neonatal piglets negative for other infectious agents (

 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Goede et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, strong protective immunity (100 % survival rate of the piglets challenged with PC22A) was induced in gilts inoculated orally once with virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC22A (10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/gilt) during mid-gestation (day 57–59) (
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">Langel et al., 2019a</xref>). Gilts exposed to the virus earlier (day 19–22) or later (day 96–97) in the gestation period showed less protective immunity, as evident by 87.2 % or 55.9 % survival rates of their piglets, respectively. Sows given feedback or orally inoculated with virulent PEDV during mid-gestation also discontinued fecal PEDV shedding prior to farrowing (

 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">Leidenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Whether prolonged PEDV shedding post-exposure and during farrowing and lactation may cause infection of piglets, remains unclear. However, the most efficient and safest timing for feedback should be mid-gestation.
