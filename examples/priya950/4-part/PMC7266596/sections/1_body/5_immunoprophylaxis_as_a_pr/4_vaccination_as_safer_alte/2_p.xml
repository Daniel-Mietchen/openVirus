<p id="par0180">Because of the frequent inefficiency or lack of safety, feedback should be replaced by oral immunization with high, consistent doses of live attenuated PEDV that is minimally replicative, but immunogenic in the intestine of pigs (

Pregnant sows orally inoculated with live attenuated PEDV (DR13 strain) vaccine twice at 2 and 4 weeks pre-farrowing exhibited higher PEDV-specific IgA and VN antibody levels in the colostrum compared with the counterpart sows administered the same vaccine IM (
