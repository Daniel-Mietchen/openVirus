<p>From October 2013 to April 2014, a severe ZIKV outbreak hit French Polynesia, and the attack rate (IAR) was first estimated as 66% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but updated soon after to 49% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An outbreak of 42 GBS cases was simultaneously reported, but with a three-week delay in the peak timing, and was linked to the ZIKV outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Based on the IAR of [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the risk of ZIKV induced GBS can thus be roughly calculated as 0.32 GBS cases per 1,000 ZIKV infections, or just 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.00032. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] estimated the proportion to be 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.00024. Aubry 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also found that, the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections (asymptomatic ratio) was about 1:1 in the general population and 1:2 among school children [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These findings are notably different from estimates for a previous ZIKV outbreak in Yap island in 2007, where the asymptomatic ratio was 4.4:1 and the estimated overall ZIKV IAR was about 75% [
