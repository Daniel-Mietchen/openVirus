<p>Mathematical modelling provides a possible way to infer the epidemic waves of ZIKV (or together with a minor proportion of CHIKV). First, we assume a constant risk ratio between symptomatic ZIKV cases and reported GBS cases (ZIKV-GBS ratio), denoted by 
 <italic>ρ</italic>. Second, we simulate our ZIKV model, and fit the model to observed GBS cases with a time-dependent ZIKV transmission rate. Finally, by using iterated filtering techniques, we find the maximum likelihood estimates of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> and the overall IAR.
