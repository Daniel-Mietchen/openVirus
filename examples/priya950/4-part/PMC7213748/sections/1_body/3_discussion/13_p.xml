 </sub>(0), was likely below 0.75. There are several plausible explanations. First, it has recently come to light that a large proportion of the population was already exposed to dengue before the 2015 Zika outbreak and this may have provided a significant proportion of the population with cross-immunity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. As found in Rodriguez-Barraquer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] the “pre-existing high antibody titers to dengue virus were associated with reduced risk of ZIKV infection and symptoms.” A similar outcome was noted in Gordon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Second, Faria 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] indicated that the Zika virus (Asian ZIKV genotype) may already have been in Brazil as early as 2013, and thus, there may have been some exposure and build up of immunity by 2016. However, given the almost nonexistent reports of ZIKV, it is unlikely that this generated any major population immunity. Third, there exists significant spatial heterogeneity in the Brazilian population distribution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Messina 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] reported that most of the ZIKV incidences of NE Brazil were distributed in the coastal areas, and thus population in the inland areas were likely spared from the epidemic. This may also contribute to our estimated initial susceptibility.
