 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> are the scale parameters controlling the effects of local temperature and rainfall respectively. The two terms 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>4</sub>, are time-driven baseline effects characterizing trends in 
 <italic>m</italic> that switch on depending on the time period 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. The parameter 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> could be viewed as the timing of baseline change in the mosquito population, due to the possible interference between ZIKV and CHIKV for instance, and/or local mosquito control measures. The function 
 <bold>1</bold>(⋅) is an indicator function, which equals 1, if the condition in the brackets is true; but is 0 otherwise.
