<p>The Northeastern Brazil datasets which are analysed in this paper are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The time series indicate two epidemic outbreaks of reported ZIKV cases, where the second outbreak in 2016 is far stronger than the first in 2015. Despite this, the two waves of GBS appear similar over the two years, although a close examination reveals there were fewer cases in 2016. If one ignores the possible regional difference and adopts the GBS-ZIKV risk rate of 0.032% i.e., 0.32 GBS cases per 1,000 ZIKV infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) calculated in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the total cases of ZIKV can be approximated according to the excess GBS cases time series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref>). But this is a naive calculation and we will seek ways to improve this.
