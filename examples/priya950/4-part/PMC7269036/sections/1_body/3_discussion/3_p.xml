<p>Our results show that IFITM3 deletion diminishes the antibody response and 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C/C carriers show lower antibody levels after TIV immunization. The frequency of the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C is much higher in the Han Chinese population than in Caucasians [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A comprehensive knowledge of influenza-IFITM3 interactions is necessary to develop a novel and alternative anti-influenza virus strategy in carriers of the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C/C. 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C could be used to identify patients at high risk of severe illness, which would be of immense benefit for prioritizing treatment.
