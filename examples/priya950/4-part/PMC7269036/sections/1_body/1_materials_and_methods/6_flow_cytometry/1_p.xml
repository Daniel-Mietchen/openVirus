<p>Single cell suspensions of murine splenocytes were prepared according to a protocol described previously using cell strainers (Biologix, USA) [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Splenocytes were harvested and stained using various combinations of the special Abs: anti-CD3-PE-Cy7(clone 17A2; Biolegend, CA), anti-CD45R/B220-APC-Cy7 (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD138-PE (clone 281-2), anti-CD38-FITC (clone 90), anti-GL7-Pacific Blue™ (clone GL7), anti-Fas/CD95-APC (clone SA367H8), anti-IgG-PE/Dazzle™ 594 (clone Poly4053). 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) (Biolegend) was also included to exclude dead cells.. Data was analyzed on a FACS Aria
