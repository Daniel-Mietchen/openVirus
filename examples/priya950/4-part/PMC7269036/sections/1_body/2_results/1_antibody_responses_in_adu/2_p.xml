<p>HI antibody was measured for each of the three influenza strains. Seroconversion (SC) was defined as the percentage of subjects with either a pre-vaccination HI titre ≦1:10 and a post-vaccination HI titre ≧1:40 or a pre-vaccination HI titre ≧1:10 and a minimum four-fold rise in post-vaccination HI titre [

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the SCR for H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses in donors with 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C genotype was lower compared with donors carrying the T/T genotypes (

 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c). However, the GMT of HI titre against H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses in donors with IFITM3 rs12252-C/C genotype were lower than donors with TT genotype after TIV immunization (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). To explore this interesting phenomenon, we established an IFITM3 deletion mouse model for further investigation.
