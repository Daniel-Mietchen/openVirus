<p>The transcription factors involved during proliferation and differentiation of GC B cells into plasma cells is well characterized (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>a) [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. T cells are committed to become T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells, which upregulate B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6). BCL6 is a master regulator which progresses primed B cells to upregulate BCL6 at both the RNA and protein levels and further differentiate into GC B cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Proliferating GC B cells characteristically have large amounts of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), encoded by the 
 <italic>Aicda</italic> gene and is the enzyme responsible for SHM and class switch recombination which generate a wide repertoire of affinities for specific antibody [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. GC B cells differentiate into plasma cells which need large quantities of B lymphocyteâ€“induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), encoded by the 
 <italic>Prdm1</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Blimp-1, together with IRF4, acts upstream of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), a transcription factor that is essential for upregulation of the secretory apparatus required for antibody production in plasma cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Bach2 is as a factor in the promotion of the entry of light-zone GC cells into the memory B cell compartment [
