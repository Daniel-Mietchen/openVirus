<p>To investigate the impact of IFITM3 on the antibody response, we established a model of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice and continuously measured the antibody level for a month after inoculating WT and 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice via the intraperitoneal route with TIV. We collected serum from orbital blood before immunization and at days 0 (14 days after primary immunization), 7, 14, 21 and 28 after booster immunization and detected the HI titre and IgG against H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a). The peaks of HI titre against H1N1 and H3N2 viruses occurred at day 14 in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice, which were later compared with those in WT mice. The HI titre against H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice were lower than those in WT mice after booster vaccination (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). Especially at day 7 after booster immunization, the GMT of HI titre against H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria viruses were 3.49, 5.01 and 2.20-fold higher, respectively, in WT mice than those in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice (Table S3).
