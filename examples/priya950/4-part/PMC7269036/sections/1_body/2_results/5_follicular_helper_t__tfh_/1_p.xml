<p>Inside GCs, T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells provide critical cellular interactions and cross-signalling to antigen-experienced B cells to undergo proliferation, isotype switching, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in order to generate long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. IFITM3 deletion reduced the antibody level and numbers of splenic GC B cells. So how then do the numbers of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells which are required for GC formation vary between WT and 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice? We analyzed the numbers of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells from spleens of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice and found them to decline at days 0, 3 and 7 after booster immunization (Fig. S2; 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a, b). The variations of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells were similar to the trends observed for GC B cells in WT and 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. The overall numbers of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells peaked at day 7 in WT mice, but no peak was observed in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. Furthermore, the number of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells was two-fold higher in WT mice than in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice on day 7 after booster. Collectively, our results further show that a reduction of T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells occurs in spleens of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice.
