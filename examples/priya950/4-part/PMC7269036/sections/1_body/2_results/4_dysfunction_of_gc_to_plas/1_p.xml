<p>In GC, primed B cells differentiate into plasmablasts, plasma cells and memory B cells for secretion of antibody. Antigen-specific plasma cells and memory B cells appear within 1 week and peak in the peripheral blood around day 7 post-influenza immunization, which indicates that the GC reaction is remarkably efficient [
