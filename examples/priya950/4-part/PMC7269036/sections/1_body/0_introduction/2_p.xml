<p>An important single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252-C of 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> is a splice variant wherein the majority allele, T, is substituted with a C and then encodes an 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> isoform (â–³21 IFITM3) lacking 21 amino acids at the amino terminus [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In humans, the SNP rs12252-C allele of 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> was linked to severe illness in adults during H1N1/09 virus infections, as well as following infection with the novel H7N9 virus [

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, but it is known that the rs12252-C allele reduces the restriction on virus replication [

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Research has shown that deleting the first amino-terminal 21-amino-acid or mutating 20-YEML-23 result in relocation of IFITM3 from the endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane, thus losing influenza-inhibitory action [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study found that rs12252-C/C donors had a significantly higher level of antibodies to H1N1/09 virus in comparison with rs12252-T/T donors before vaccination with the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) and at 1 year post TIV [
