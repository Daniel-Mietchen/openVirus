  <p>IFITM3 deletion reduced the number of activated GC B cells in spleens after TIV immunization. (a) Lymphocytes were isolated from splenocytes from each group of mice. The populations of CD3

   <sup>+</sup>FAS
   <sup>+</sup>GL7
   <sup>hi</sup> cells were defined as GC B cells and analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. (b) The percentage of GC B cells among B220
   <sup>+</sup> B cells were compared between WT and
