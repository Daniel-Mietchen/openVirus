  <p>The dysfunction of plasma and memory cells differentiation in 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice. (a) The population of plasmablasts were defined as CD3
   <sup>-</sup>B220
   <sup>+</sup>CD138
   <sup>+</sup> and gated with green rectangle by flow cytometric analysis. The population of plasma cells were confirmed as CD3
   <sup>-</sup>B220
   <sup>low</sup>CD138
   <sup>+</sup> and gated with red rectangle. (b, c) The percentage of plasmablasts and plasma cells among lymphocytes were respectively analyzed between WT and 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice at days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after TIV boost immunization (
   <italic>n </italic>= 5 per group). (d) The phenotype of memory cells were defined as CD3
   <sup>-</sup>B220
   <sup>+</sup>CD138
   <sup>-</sup>GL7
   <sup>−</sup>IgD
   <sup>−</sup> by flow cytometry. (e) The proportion of memory cells among lymphocytes was analyzed between WT and 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice at days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after boost immunization (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). (f) TIV-specific IgG
   <sup>+</sup> ASCs were assayed by an ELISPOT with the lymphocytes in the spleens of WT and 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice at days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after booster immunization. (g) The histogram shows the representative spots at days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after booster (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). The bars represent the mean values and the standard errors of the means. Significant differences are marked by * 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.01, *** 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001.
