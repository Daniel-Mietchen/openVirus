A single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C of <italic>IFITM3</italic> results in a truncated IFITM3 protein lacking its first 21 amino acids, which is much higher in the Han Chinese population and associated with severe illness in adults infected with pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus. To investigate if IFITM3 or <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C could affect the antibody response after influenza vaccination, we detected the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) of 171 healthy young adult volunteers (<italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C, C/T, T/T carriers) and in an IFITM3-deletion mouse model (<italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) after trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) immunization.

Correspondingly, the numbers of splenic germinal centre (GC) B cells, plasma cells, TIV-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> antibody secreting cells and T follicular helper cells in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were lower compared with wild type mice. However, the number of memory B cells was higher in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at day 7 after booster. The HI level of <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice remained lower than WT mice after third vaccination. Moreover, the transcriptional network regulating GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation was abnormal in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Our results indicate that IFITM3 deletion attenuated the antibody response.

Influenza A virus (IAV) has evolved various strategies to evade host defenses and acquire antiviral drug resistance [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The host produces a variety of factors that are able to fight Influenza virus infection through various mechanisms. Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 3 is upregulated upon stimulation of cells by type I and II IFNs [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IFITM3 is a 15-kDa membrane-associated protein that localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and inhibits viral entry into the host cell cytoplasm by impeding the formation of the virus fusion pore [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IFITM3 was identified as a host antiviral factor following RNA interference genomic screening for host factors involved in influenza virus infection during the pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus outbreak [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IFITM3 was found to be one of the most potent antiviral factors in restricting influenza virus infection, as IFITM3 knockout mice displayed enhanced morbidity and mortality associated with pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus infection [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several distinct studies have revealed that IFITM3 plays a role in immune function [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IFITM3 was constitutively expressed in mouse lung-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after challenge with influenza virus, enabling the mice to withstand viral infection during a secondary challenge and effecting quick protection at the site of viral entry [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, respiratory dendritic cells up-regulate the expression of IFITM3 in response to influenza virus infection [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>An important single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252-C of <italic>IFITM3</italic> is a splice variant wherein the majority allele, T, is substituted with a C and then encodes an <italic>IFITM3</italic> isoform (&#x025b3;21 IFITM3) lacking 21 amino acids at the amino terminus [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In humans, the SNP rs12252-C allele of <italic>IFITM3</italic> was linked to severe illness in adults during H1N1/09 virus infections, as well as following infection with the novel H7N9 virus [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, but it is known that the rs12252-C allele reduces the restriction on virus replication [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Research has shown that deleting the first amino-terminal 21-amino-acid or mutating 20-YEML-23 result in relocation of IFITM3 from the endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane, thus losing influenza-inhibitory action [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study found that rs12252-C/C donors had a significantly higher level of antibodies to H1N1/09 virus in comparison with rs12252-T/T donors before vaccination with the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) and at 1 year post TIV [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza virus infection. Growing evidence suggests that host factors including host genetics, the hormonal milieu, and gut microbiota play important roles as modifiers of influenza virus vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We are curious to know whether there is an association between IFITM3 and antibody response after TIV immunization. In this study, we recruited 171 healthy young adult volunteers who received TIV and observed the seroconversion rates (SCRs) for H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses. SCRs were found to be lower in donors with <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C genotype compared with rs12252-C/T or T/T genotype. We also found a lower level antibody after TIV booster in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Further analysis of germinal centre (GC) B cell and plasma cell indicated a similar reduction in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These findings suggest IFITM may affect the antibody response after influenza vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Study cohort and ethics</title><p>A total of 212 healthy young adult volunteers (age from 18 to 59 years) from the Xinjiang autonomous region and Yunnan province were enrolled in the study from 2009 to 2015.

The SNP rs12252-C allele of <italic>IFITM3</italic> had been linked with severe illness in adults during pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus infections, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We were curious about whether IFITM3 plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system and so we investigated the antibody responses of three IFITM3 rs12252 genotype carriers after TIV immunization. Our results showed that <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C carriers exhibited a lower level of antibody response to H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses compared with rs12252-T/T carriers after TIV immunization, suggesting that the <italic>IFITM3</italic> genotype may be associated with antibody response. The same phenomenon was also observed in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice after TIV immunization. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for IFITM3 in the antibody response. The research from <italic>Ling Qin et al</italic> who investigated the influenza vaccination response is associated with IFITM3 gene in human population. The results showed that the median fold of increasing HI antibody to pdm09H1N1 in volunteers with the rs12252-C/C genotype was much lower than the change in rs12252-T/T genotypes on both days 14 and 28 after vaccination [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These results supported our conclusions as well.</p><p>GCs are the principal sites of affinity maturation of antigen-specific immunoglobulin, transient structures induced by T cell-dependent (TD) antigens [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. T<sub>FH</sub> cells orchestrate the GC response in part by providing help factors for which GC B cells compete to survive and undergo clonal expansion [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Proliferating GC B cells differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibody, and simultaneously differentiate to memory cells which produce powerful antibody responses. The numbers of GC B and plasma cells and TIV-specific IgG<sup>+</sup> ASCs were decreased in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which may explain the lower level of antibody response. We also found a decreased number of GC T<sub>FH</sub> cells in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, the expression levels of some factors of the transcriptional network regulating the cellular dynamics of splenic GC B cells, high-affinity antibody development and plasma cell differentiation, such as BCL6 or Blimp1, which are considered to be master regulators for GC or plasma cell development, were abnormal in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. BCL6 inhibits the transcription of Prdm1, the gene that encodes Blimp-1, and Blimp-1 represses transcription of the genes that encode BCL6 [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. So, BCL6 is a known inhibitor of plasma cell differentiation and thus promotes memory B cell differentiation [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, the increased <italic>Bcl6</italic> mRNA and decreased expression of Blimp-1 and <italic>Prdm1</italic> mRNA may be a reasonable explanation for the dynamic cells observed within GCs in <italic>Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. As expected, IFITM3 deletion resulted in diminished numbers of plasma cells and increased the memory cells. A previous study reported that IFITM3 loci contain several potential BCL6 binding sites and BCL6 could bind to these sites, including the promoter and 3&#x02019; conserved untranslated region to inhibit the expression of MX2 and IFITM3 in T<sub>FH</sub> cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our findings indicate that BCL6 may have a close connection to IFITM3, giving us a hypothesis that IFITM3 deletion results in the high expression of BCL6 in T<sub>FH</sub> cells or other immune cells and then impacts on the antibody response. However, the mechanisms involved require further investigation.</p><p>Our results show that IFITM3 deletion diminishes the antibody response and <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C/C carriers show lower antibody levels after TIV immunization. The frequency of the <italic>IFITM3</italic> SNP rs12252-C is much higher in the Han Chinese population than in Caucasians [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
