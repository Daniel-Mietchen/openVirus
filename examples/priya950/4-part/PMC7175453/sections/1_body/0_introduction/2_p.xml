<p id="Par3">There have been four major influenza pandemics since 1918 with some glimpses of pandemic-like events in history [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918 (pdm1918) is estimated to have caused up to 50 million human deaths across the globe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], symbolizing how devastating one pandemic outbreak can be. It is believed that influenza pandemics can be occurred by antigenic shift, which generally results from the introduction of certain gene segment(s) from nonhuman sources to human infecting IAVs through a genetic reassortment process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The efficient human-to-human transmission and lack of immunity against the novel virus in humans can be driving forces to facilitate the dissemination of the virus and then to result in a pandemic. After a pandemic wave, the virus may lose momentum under increasing immune pressures among humans and persist as a seasonal virus. This seasonal virus will retain genetic mutations by circulating season by season, and its viral antigenicity may change, which is so-called antigenic drift, and it is the main reason that the vaccine viruses need updates every year. Currently, the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of IAVs, which are the descendants of 2009 and 1968 influenza pandemics, respectively, and the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of IBVs are circulating as seasonal viruses in humans.
