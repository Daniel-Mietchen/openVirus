<p id="Par10">MERS-CoV appeared to originate from a bat coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] and has become enzootic since a certain time point among dromedary camels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], which is readily transmissible to and between humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Unlike other human virus, such as measles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], MERS-CoV might evolve constantly in the dromedary camels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], which show a high rate of seroconversion and carry the virus mostly asymptomatically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Continuous back and forth transmission between humans and the dromedary camels constitutes very similar situations with IAVs. Frequent recombination during MERS-CoV replication in the reservoir host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] might be used as a tool of adaptation by antigenically novel MERS-CoV strains or closely related bat coronaviruses, similarly as genetic reassortments of IAVs in swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. If there might be a MERS-CoV pandemic, subsequent MERS-CoV epidemics by antigenically ‘drifted’ strains might follow the pattern of seasonal influenza viruses until antigenically shifted (recombined) MERS-CoV strains hit humans again.
