<p id="Par8">From the examples of the past influenza pandemics discussed so far, the recipe of a pandemic may be drawn up. The ingredients of influenza pandemics appear to be (1) non-human animal reservoir(s) that provides novel antigenic sources continuously, (2) adaptation host(s) where accumulated mutations result in host specificity changes or genetic reassortment occurs, (3) proper transmissibility between adaptation host(s) and humans back and forth, (4) efficient human-to-human transmission, and (5) pathogenicity in humans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The second and third ingredients may work together to generate a virus with the human adapted genes with a new antigenic flavor. We have seen that the influenza pandemics came about with these ingredients and the human activity of socializing and traveling. Determining whether a virus has these ingredients might be an important step in assessing its pandemic potential.
