<p id="Par15">Starting from the distinct receptor specificities of the HA proteins between avian and human IAVs, host restriction determinants of IAVs have been documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Receptor specificity and amino acid signatures at PB2 residue 627 are well established host determinants critical for the interhost transmission of IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. However, IAVs with avian or human receptor specificity can infect swine, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the PB2 protein of the triple reassortant swine IAV lineage, which comprises a majority of North American swine IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>], retains the avian type E627 (glutamate in the PB2 residue 627) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. This was also a part of the molecular signatures of pdm2009 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some human infecting avian IAV isolates have shown acquisition of the human type K627 (lysine in the PB2 residue 627) but not acquisition of the human type receptor specificity determinants, and some acquisition of both [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. IAVs were shown to bind cells lacking sialic acid, and replicated efficiently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Acquisition of PB2 K627 might be more advantageous than acquisition of human type receptor specificity for avian IAVs to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of humans, which is not an optimal temperature for PB2 E627 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. It has been also shown that the PB2 E627K mutation can emerge in a human case infected with an avian IAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Of note is that, although there have been avian-to-human transmission cases of avian H5N1 and H7N9 IAVs, there have been no sustained human-to-human transmission of avian IAVs. Indeed, it has been reported that an H5N1 HPAIV harboring the human-type PB2 E672K mutation (change from glutamate to lysine in the position 627) and human-type HA Q226L and G228S mutations (change from glutamine to leucine and from glycine to serine in positions 226 and 228, respectively, by H3 numbering) by itself could not transmit via airborne droplets between ferrets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. This may suggest that airborne transmissibility of avian IAVs in humans might not be determined only by the presence or absence of molecular determinants. Several studies using reassortant viruses have shown that the competence of reassortant viruses may not be predicted simply by the presence of the specific molecular determinants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. An experiment testing a swine ‘mixing vessel’ hypothesis by co-housing pigs infected with an avian H1N1 strain or with a swine H3N2 strain and naive pigs revealed 40 and 60% transmission efficiency, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In that experiment, the reassortant viruses appeared to be well replicated (59/63) in the middle or lower respiratory tract, regardless of the presence of swine PB2 or avian PB2, although all but one reassortants (62/63) contained the swine HA. Four out of the 63 reassortants did replicate in the upper respiratory tract and three out of four of those were the swine PB2-containing reassortants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. What we can learn from this experiment is that the reassortant with an avian HA is not frequently selected in pigs and that the reassortant with swine PB2 is selected for the replication in the upper respiratory tract of pigs. The proportion of IAV infection in farmed pigs is relatively low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and the likelihood of co-existing of pigs infected with avian IAVs and/or with swine IAVs in the same pen may be even lower. However, avian and swine IAV reassortants have been established and isolated in pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>], which is the evidence of ongoing ‘genetic mixing’ of IAVs.
