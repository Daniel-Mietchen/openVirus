<p id="Par19">Through a serial adaptation process, more pathogenic viral isolates can be recovered. For an IAV with the receptor specificity to α-2,6 SA to replicate in mice, where there is hardly any or small amount of α-2,6 SA in the respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>], the virus must have used surrogate receptors such as C-type lectins or else [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. IAVs have been shown to bind to and replicate in SA-free or sialidase treated cells, although to a lower degree than in the untreated cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. Abolishing NA activity has been shown to be another mechanism of adapting to the host expressing a low level of the specific receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. Indeed, the HA protein of a mouse-adapted pdm2009 has been shown to have acquired higher affinity to α-2,3 SA and lower affinity to α-2,6 SA compared to the wild type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. The difference between a human IAV adapted in mouse and an avian IAV infecting humans may be determined by the usage and availability of appropriate SA or equivalent molecules. To be pathogenic to mice, human IAVs with α-2,6 SA specificity must adapt to use non-SA receptors or α-2,3 SA abundant in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>], but avian IAVs with α-2,3 SA specificity may have a possibility to replicate in the lower respiratory tract of humans without a prior adaptation.
