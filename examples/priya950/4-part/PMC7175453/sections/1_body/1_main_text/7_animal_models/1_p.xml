<p id="Par12">Small laboratory animals are surrogate models used in the experiments of human infecting viruses. Viral behaviors in a natural host are often different from those in humans. Viruses causing serious diseases in humans are often asymptomatic in their natural hosts. This is why natural hosts have a limitation as animal models. In case of IAVs, avian and swine species should be considered the natural reservoir animals, and in case of MERS-CoVs, bats and dromedary camels [

Researches using animal models for such viruses are carried out in two main directions: (1) investigation of viral characteristics in hosts, such as replication capacity, cellular tropisms, pathogenicity, and transmission, and (2) development of antivirals and vaccines. No animal models can be a perfect replicate of humans. Certain animal models can have advantages in representing viral infection and, at the same time, disadvantages in other aspects. Therefore, experimental questions may determine the best animal model, and experiments should be conducted such a way that the results obtained using animal models can be translated to humans.
