  <p>Potentiating immune response by activating TLR signaling pathways.</p>
  <p>With the exception of TLR3, all TLRs activate MyD88 dependent pathway which leads to NF-ÎºB mediated proinflammatory cytokine upregulation. TLR3 and TLR4 can activate TRIF-dependent pathway which leads to IRF3 mediated interferon stimulated gene upregulation. TLR2 and TLR4 reside on the cell membrane whereas TLR3/7/9 are localized in the endosomal compartment.
