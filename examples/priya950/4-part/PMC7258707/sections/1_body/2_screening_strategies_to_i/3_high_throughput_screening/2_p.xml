<p id="p0305">New therapeutics effective against both natural and engineered resistant forms of bacterium are vital to the biodefense armory. Screening for novel antimicrobials is traditionally done by scoring for growth inhibition in vitro, using the standard Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. This generally involves performing a doseâ€“response assay in a multiwell plate format and monitoring growth in the absence or presence of the test compounds. The compound concentration that shows no visible growth is considered the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Over the years, this approach has led to the discovery of only a limited number of novel antimicrobial compounds and resistance has already been generated against most of the antibiotics used in the clinic. One disadvantage to this approach is the inability to identify potent immunomodulatory compounds against intracellular pathogens that require the host for replication.</p>
