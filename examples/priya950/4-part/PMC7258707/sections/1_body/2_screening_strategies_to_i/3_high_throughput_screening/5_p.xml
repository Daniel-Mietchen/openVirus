<p id="p0320">There is a possibility that therapeutics targeting the virulence factors or other drug resistance mechanisms may not be effective by themselves and will need to be evaluated in combination with antibiotics to treat multiple drug resistance (MDR) infections. Thus screening experiments designed to find combination therapies are warranted. To determine the synergy of two drugs (antibiotic and nonantibiotic), conventional checkerboard assays are set up wherein the two drugs are tested in combination at varying concentrations and the MIC of each drug either alone or in combination is then used to calculate the fractional inhibitory concentration
