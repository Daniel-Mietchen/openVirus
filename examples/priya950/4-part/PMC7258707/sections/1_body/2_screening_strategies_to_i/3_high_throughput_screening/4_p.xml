<p id="p0315">To overcome the problem of multidrug resistant bacteria, there is a growing focus on identifying small molecules that target drug resistant mechanisms or virulence factors, or agents that prevent/disrupt biofilm formation. Virulence factors, such as secretion systems in gram negative bacterial pathogens, are promising therapeutic targets. Specifically, the Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) present in 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is responsible for injecting effectors that target the cytoskeleton and proinflammatory signaling pathways. A number of techniques have been used to screen and identify potential T3SS inhibitors that can be adapted for biothreat pathogens. These include an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based detection of proteins secreted from enteropathogenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC), inhibition of sheep erythrocyte lysis by EPEC, inhibition of induction of a 
 <italic>yopE</italic> luciferase fusion in 
 <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and a 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> cell-based bioluminescent reporter screen

 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Using a high-throughput luminescence screening assay, three compounds were identified that inhibit 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> T3SS-mediated cytotoxicity that relieves the growth inhibition associated with in vitro activation of T3SS 
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Another promising approach to disarm the bacteria is to prevent/disrupt biofilms, a barrier produced by bacteria to protect itself from the aggressive host environment. Small molecule therapeutics that specifically disrupt or prevent the biofilm formation could be used in combination with antibiotics. The common method to quantitate biofilms is a colorimetric-based assay that utilizes a crystal violet dye to stain the biofilms and subsequent extraction of the dye using organic solvents or detergents 
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> followed by absorbance measurement. To improve sensitivity, robustness, and throughput, a fluorescent-dye-based assay was developed, wherein the biofilms are stained with FM1-43 fluorescent dye and fluorescence signal is measured following organic extraction of the dye 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Screening of a small molecule library in this assay identified rifabutin and ethavarine, as potential inhibitors of 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (Bp82) and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> biofilm production, respectively, without directly affecting the bacterial growth.
