<p id="p0350">Functional genomic screening using gene-trapping, CRISPR’s gene editing, or RNA interference (RNAi) technologies has been applied to identify host factors that are required for replication or involved in pathogenesis of several biothreat viral and bacterial agents and are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 7.2</xref> . The activities of several identified host factors can be perturbed by small molecules and thus serve as potential therapeutic platforms. For example, it was demonstrated that the novel host factor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α is required for 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> infection in mammalian cells 
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Reducing the levels of either the retromer cargo-adapter complex or retromer-associated sorting nexins abrogated 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> replication 
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Multiple host kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase B, and protein kinase C all play a role during 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infections 
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Zhou et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> identified TNFRSF9 and SERPINI1 that may promote activated macrophages in controlling 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> replication. Akimana et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed that 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> utilizes host ubiquitin turnover in distinct mechanisms during the phagosomal and cytosolic phases and that phosphoinositide metabolism is essential for cytosolic proliferation of 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. Connor et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> revealed that 71 host proteins are required for intracellular survival of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. Of particular, interest was the enrichment for genes involved in endosome recycling.
