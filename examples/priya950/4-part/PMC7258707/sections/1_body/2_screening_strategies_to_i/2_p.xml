<p id="p0300">The lack of approved therapeutics available to combat biothreats may be in part attributed to the unique challenges for the discovery and development process of evaluating drugs that target select agents. Foremost is the implementation of high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts for the discovery of new compounds against authentic or wild-type biothreat bacterial and viral pathogens 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Specifically, the requirement of work to be performed in high-level biocontainment laboratories (BSL3 or BSL4) is a major limiting factor since laboratories with these capabilities are not widely available. In addition, highly trained personnel that can handle infectious agents use robotic instruments and adhere to operational, engineering, and government regulations are a critical requirement for working with biothreat agents 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the United States, strict guidelines have been instated for generating government-approved methods and processes for inactivation of pathogens before plates/samples can be brought out of biocontainment suites for further experimentation, and to track the inactivated material 
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Other challenges that need to be considered include the prevention of pathogen aerosolization while handling screening plates in biocontainment laboratories and ensuring that inactivation chemicals and methods are compatible with downstream procedures.
