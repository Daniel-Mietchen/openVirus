<p id="p0325">Unlike most bacteria, viruses require the mammalian host for replication. The virus life cycle can be divided into distinct stages that include the entry, uncoating, replication, genome packaging, assembly, maturation, and budding. Various cell-based and in vitro biochemical assays have been developed to study virus life cycles as well as to screen and identify antivirals 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The conventional plaque-forming assay used to evaluate antivirals is time-consuming, not amenable for HTS, and not very robust. Alternatively, in the absence of more sophisticated instruments or technologies, a virus-induced cytopathic effect can be used as an endpoint to test antivirals. With advances in imaging instruments and informatics, a cell-based HCI platform (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.2</xref>) that uses viral antigen-specific antibodies to detect and quantitate the viral infection is now a general approach to identify compounds that inhibit viral infection

 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, this approach will not provide information on which steps in the viral life cycle the inhibitors are disrupting. To help one to deconvolute the mechanism of action of identified hits (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.3</xref> ), cells pretreated with an inhibitor prior to virus exposure can potentially identify compounds that inhibit viral entry, while treatment of cells after exposure (i.e., after the entry step) would identify compounds that inhibit intracellular replication and/or viral spread.
