<p id="p0345">The host lysosomal protease cathepsin L (Cat L) is necessary for the processing and cleavage of the GP of enveloped viruses, so that the virus can fuse with the host cell membrane and gain entry into the host. Thus Cat L has been regarded as an ideal target for drug discovery. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cat L enzymatic assay was developed, wherein peptides derived from GPs of viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, Hendra, and severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and containing Cat L cleavage site were chemically conjugated with a quencher 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the N-terminus and 5-carboxyfluorescein fluorophore at the C-terminus

The intact peptides exhibited minimal to no fluorescence, but following cleavage of the peptide by Cat L, there was an increase in fluorescence intensity. Screening of a chemical library in this assay identified small molecules that selectively inhibited Cat L-mediated cleavage of multiple viral peptides over host proneuropeptide Y
