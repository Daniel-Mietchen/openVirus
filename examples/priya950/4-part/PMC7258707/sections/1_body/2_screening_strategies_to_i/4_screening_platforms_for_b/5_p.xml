<p id="p0340">To identify inhibitors of viral genome replication, in vitro biochemical assays targeting viral enzymes such as polymerases, methyltransferases, helicases, as well as viral and host proteases such as cathepsins or kinases have been developed. A number of antivirals that have been approved by the FDA target either the DNA or RNA polymerases. Incorporation of radioactive nucleotide either to a DNA oligonucleotide by DNA polymerase 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> or to a homopolymeric RNA as a template by RNA polymerase are common methods to determine polymerase activity
