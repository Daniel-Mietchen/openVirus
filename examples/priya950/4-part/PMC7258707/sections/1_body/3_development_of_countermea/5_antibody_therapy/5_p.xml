<p id="p0415">A solution to the challenges with viral mutagenicity may be found in the identification of potent new mAbs that target highly conserved viral structures, which are critical for virus entry into cells. Alternatively, utilization of combination therapy, whereby, a cocktail of several mAbs may be used or mAbs may be combined with other drugs, such as antiviral compounds, may overcome mutagenicity issues. These areas of research will continue to be a major focus of biothreat agent therapeutic research
