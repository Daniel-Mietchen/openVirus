<p id="p0410">It is clear that mAbs offer a highly specific, potent, and generally safe platform for antimicrobials and may be a useful alternative to immune plasma. It is imperative to find appropriate niches in infectious diseases, specifically those caused by biothreat agents, where new antibody-based treatments could prove to be efficacious

 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 7.5</xref> summarizes key research in antibody therapy across different bacterial and viral families of some current biothreat agents. The utilization of mAB therapy for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of biothreat agents varies depending on the agent. In all cases however, the challenge for the development of effective therapeutic antibodies against viruses is the viruses’ heterogeneity and mutability. A related problem is the low binding affinity of cross-reactive antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a variety of primary isolates. Finally, the cost of large-scale production of mABs is a limiting factor for continued use.
