<p id="p0405">In general, limited clinical applications for antibody therapy existed until the development of technology that allowed the production of mAbs through the use of hybridomas 
 <xref rid="bib1095" ref-type="bibr">[218]</xref>. Hybridomas allow for the production of homogenous antibodies with the same specificity of a single immunoglobulin class and isotype. Further advancements made it possible to humanize or generate fully human mAbs. Research advancements in the past 10–15 years have resulted in numerous mAB-based therapies that have been approved for inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Infectious diseases have not been included in approved treatments. Although many mAb products targeting infectious diseases are in different stages of development, to date, one mAB-based product, Synagis (palivizumab), is currently approved for use in infectious diseases (RSV) 
 <xref rid="bib1100" ref-type="bibr">[219]</xref>, while two mAbs Abthrax (raxibacumab) and Anthim (obiltoxaximab) have been approved under the FDA’s Animal Efficacy Rule for treatment of inhalation anthrax 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For treatment of Ebola infection, the single mAb mAB114 and Zmapp, a cocktail of three “humanized” mABs, have advanced in product development and are being tested for efficacy in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (NCT03719586,
