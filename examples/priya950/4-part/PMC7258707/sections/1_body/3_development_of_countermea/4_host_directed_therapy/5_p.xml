<p id="p0390">HTS of FDA-approved drugs is another approach to identifying compounds that were previously approved for other disease indications but may have the potential to be repurposed as antiinfectives. Trifluoperazine (an antipsychotic), amoxapine (an antidepressant), and doxapram (a breathing stimulant) mitigated fatal 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection in a pneumonic plague murine model 
 <xref rid="bib1040" ref-type="bibr">[207]</xref>. At 48Â h postinfection, these drugs provided animals with up to 100% protection against challenge with bubonic or pneumonic plague agents when administered in combination with levofloxacin 
 <xref rid="bib1045" ref-type="bibr">[208]</xref>. Multiple FDA-approved drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors and calcium fluxes inhibited

 <italic>B. abortus</italic>, whereas drugs targeting cholesterol traffic attenuated

 <xref rid="bib1050" ref-type="bibr">[209]</xref>. Similarly, increasing evidence suggested statin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor, possesses antibacterial activity by the inhibition of sterols, prenylation, and isoprenoids (
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic>), the inhibition of antiinflammatory cytokines (
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>), and the modulation of phagosome maturation (
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bib1055" ref-type="bibr">[210]</xref>. It was demonstrated that a low dose of Gleevec, an anticancer drug inhibiting Abl1, c-Kit, and related protein tyrosine kinases, can increase the number of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, blood, and spleen and enhance antimicrobial responses in a mouse model of 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> infection
