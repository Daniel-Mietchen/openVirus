<p id="p0395">In the case of viruses, small molecule targeting of innate immune receptors has also shown efficacy in several relevant viral models of infection. For example, treatment with poly(IC:LC) has also been protective against EBOV infection in NHPs 
 <xref rid="bib1065" ref-type="bibr">[212]</xref>. Prophylactic pulmonary administration of TLR7 ligand (TMX201) significantly protected mice from lethal infection with VEEV 
 <xref rid="bib1070" ref-type="bibr">[213]</xref>. TLR3 and TLR9 agonists have also been shown to improve the efficacy of postexposure therapeutics against smallpox 
 <xref rid="bib1075" ref-type="bibr">[214]</xref>. Sometimes modulation of host pathophysiological responses can be evaluated as a target. Hemorrhagic fever virus pathophysiology includes the stimulation of procoagulant pathways and increased permeability of the vascular endothelium; therefore these processes are being evaluated as possible targets for therapeutic intervention. This could be accomplished by utilization of an anticoagulant, such as recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2) that blocks initiation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway by inhibiting the tissue factorâ€“factor VIIa complex

 <xref rid="bib1085" ref-type="bibr">[216]</xref>. rNAPc2 has been shown to be highly protective in macaques infected with a lethal dose of Ebola Zaire virus, when treatment was initiated 1 day post viral challenge
