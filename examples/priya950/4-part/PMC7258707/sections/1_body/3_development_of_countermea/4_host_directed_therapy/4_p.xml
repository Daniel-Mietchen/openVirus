<p id="p0385">In addition to targeting innate immune cell receptors, there is a growing interest in modulating autophagy as an immunotherapeutic intervention. Autophagy is a dynamic process that targets cellular cytoplasmic contents for lysosomal degradation. More specifically, xenophagy is a type of selective autophagy that specifically targets intracellular pathogens to lysosomes, retracing their replication and survival
