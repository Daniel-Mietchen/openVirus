<p id="p0375">HDT is an emerging approach in the field of antiinfectives discovery. The strategies behind HDT can include modulation of host immune responses, or interference/manipulation/targeting of host-cell factors that are required for pathogen replication 
 <xref rid="bib1015" ref-type="bibr">[202]</xref>. For example, in a potential bioterror scenario, where the identity of the etiological agent causing the disease is unknown, stimulation of innate immunity may be particularly useful as induced immune responses are often capable of providing protection against a broad range of pathogens. Although no FDA-approved HDT therapies are yet available for treating infectious diseases, we have summarized in this section the antimicrobial potential of several small molecule immunomodulators and host cell factors that have been investigated to date.
