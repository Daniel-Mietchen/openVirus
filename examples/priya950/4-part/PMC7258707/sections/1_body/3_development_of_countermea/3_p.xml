<p id="p0370">Many of the therapeutics that are in different stages of either preclinical or clinical development for select biothreat pathogens include small molecule antivirals (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 7.3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 7.4</xref> ), antibody (or antibody cocktails) against viruses or bacteria/virulence factors (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 7.5</xref> ), and combination drug therapy (
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7.6</xref> ). The increased use of antivirals and antibiotics has set the stage for rapid adaptation mechanisms that microbes can use to counteract them. The development of antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest public health threats and hence alternative approaches to treat infectious diseases are urgently needed. 
 <xref rid="t0040" ref-type="table">Table 7.7</xref> lists the resistance mechanisms identified in each biothreat bacterial pathogen and provides references for targets of resistance. Since stand-alone antibiotics may not be sufficient to overcome resistance and/or completely clear some biothreat bacterial infections, we have also included encouraging data on host directed therapeutics, and combination therapy.
