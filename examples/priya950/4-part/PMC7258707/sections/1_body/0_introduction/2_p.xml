<p id="p0255">The concept of bioterrorism and the intentional release of biothreat agents for purposes of harm to human and agricultural interests stimulates discussion of some unanswerable questions. Questions ranging from protection of a nationâ€™s security to military defense tactics, all point to the gravity of the problem for which scientists are working together in many areas of study such as the development of novel medical countermeasures to combat lethal infections, the prevention of the spread of disease in the general populace, and design of field-worthy diagnostic tools. A biothreat organism is generally thought to be one causing severe or lethal disease or has potential to induce panic over the prospect of infection therewith; one with high pathogenicity and/or contagious infectivity; one with strong environmental stability or probable transmission as an aerosol; one with ease of large-scale production for far-reaching dissemination; and one that can be controlled for directing the release to only the intended target rather than accidental harm to the perpetrator 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Improved preparedness for intentional release of bacteria, viruses, and toxins will not only protect military positions and strategies but will also increase ability to combat disease in naturally occurring epidemics of diseases caused by some of these organisms.
