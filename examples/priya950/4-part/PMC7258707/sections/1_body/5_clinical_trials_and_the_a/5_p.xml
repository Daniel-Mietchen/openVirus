<p id="p0450">Animal Rule pivotal efficacy studies are essentially performed in place of traditional phase 3 clinical studies, so they must be done in the containment laboratory under a quality system 
 <xref rid="bib1135" ref-type="bibr">[226]</xref>. Use of FDA Good Laboratory Practice or other comparable quality system with high levels of documentation and data integrity is paramount, so data packages can withstand regulatory review and audit 
 <xref rid="bib1145" ref-type="bibr">[228]</xref>. The studies must be designed so that the program will collect the same results and conclusions one would expect from a well-designed traditional phase 3 trial, but in addition a pivotal animal efficacy study must describe a mechanism of action for the treatment modality to prevent or block disease or tissue infection and damage 
 <xref rid="bib1140" ref-type="bibr">[227]</xref>. The pathologic mechanism needs to be consistent and well understood across both the human and animal models, such as the mechanism of pathogen entry into the target host cell, toxicological mechanism of lethal factors, or germination of spores and dissemination of bacterial infection in target cells and tissues, all of which may be mechanisms the drug under study is known to block; this must be proven in the animal model.
