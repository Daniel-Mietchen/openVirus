<p id="p0455">Products developed under the Animal Rule are subject to postmarketing or field studies when the product is actually used in the scenarios for which it was developed, and this is required to verify a productâ€™s clinical benefit 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Part of the approval process is a requirement to have postmarketing study plans in place, for quick execution should an event occur in which the drug would be field tested. Approval may also come with restrictions for off-label use, distribution, or access. Actual use will also come with requirements to inform patients of the conditions under which the drug was approved by virtue of only animal efficacy data, making them informed consumers as to the risks of possible nonefficacy or unknown effects in cases of human disease.
