<p id="p0435">Because biothreat pathogens cause infrequent human cases and outbreaks in generally remote areas of the world, planning a traditional human clinical trial with large numbers of participants is not feasible. Even when the West African Ebola outbreak of more than 28,600 cases was unfolding in 2014â€“2016, and now that there is a large outbreak unfolding in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the amount of clinical efficacy data that have been collected for EBOV therapeutics is quite limited. The limitations are due to difficulty of performing clinical research in a remote outbreak setting where cultural, geographical, and political barriers may hinder or halt trial planning 
 <xref rid="bib1130" ref-type="bibr">[225]</xref>. The bulk of the efficacy data for Ebola published in the literature has been garnered through animal studies. To enable product development for viral, bacterial pathogens as well as for chemical, toxin, and radiological threat agents for which outbreaks or cases are sparse, the FDA issued an Animal Rule, codified 21 CFR 314.600 in 2002, that proposes to permit consideration of product development and efficacy data obtained from animal studies for drug licensing, in lieu of human clinical trials when such trials would be unfeasible or unethical
