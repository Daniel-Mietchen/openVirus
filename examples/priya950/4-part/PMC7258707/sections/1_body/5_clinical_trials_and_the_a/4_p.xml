<p id="p0445">Under the Animal Rule, efficacy studies are expected to demonstrate that drug effectiveness in animals reliably indicates efficacy in humans. Thus while traditional human clinical efficacy studies require demonstration that the therapy is effective, the Animal Rule imposes an additional burden on investigators to establish a drug candidateâ€™s mode of action in at least one animal model that reproduces accurate human disease pathology. Further, the Animal Rule outlines considerations for the development of the model(s), to include the use of an isolate of the etiologic agent that was known to cause human disease (e.g., agent was isolated from a fatal human case if it is a lethal disease, such as Ebola) 
 <xref rid="bib1140" ref-type="bibr">[227]</xref>. There is also a requirement that the infection model using the chosen pathogen strain must present the same or similar pathophysiology as the human disease. Definitive animal model efficacy evaluations should be performed only after careful model development studies have been performed and accepted by the regulators. These studies are known as natural history studies and are carefully designed to investigate and describe the course of the disease in the animal species, through clinical, serological, and histopathological evaluations, to compare the features of the disease in the model to the features of disease in human cases. It is important to consider the route of pathogen exposure (nasal, oral, and aerosol routes) to the animal because this will model the natural or unnatural modes of exposure predicted for humans, where a biorelease would constitute an unnatural exposure. A dose of challenge agent that is thought to be predictive of the human exposure level in a biorelease scenario should be used to develop the model, and that dose should be well characterized and reproducible by a quantitative measure. The route of drug delivery, dose administration timing, and treatment regimen in response to a biorelease scenario must also be considered when designing the animal model studies for a drug under development for such an indication. It is possible that a biorelease scenario would not be immediately known, and a period of time might pass before people begin to develop symptoms. Studies evaluating the cutoff time for drug to still be effective, and what are the triggers for treatment should be investigated in the animal model.
