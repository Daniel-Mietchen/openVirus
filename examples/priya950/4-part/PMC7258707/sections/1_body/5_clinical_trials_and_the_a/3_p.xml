<p id="p0440">Since introducing the Animal Rule in 2002, the FDA has approved more than a dozen products, including several therapeutics for anthrax, plague, botulinum toxin, and smallpox 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The Animal Rule does not provide an expedited pathway to FDA approval for drugs and can certainly be more challenging than traditional drug development pathways. The developer must compile a significant body of data to prove efficacy of the drug against the target therapeutic indication. First in 2009, and updated now into a formal document published in 2015 
 <xref rid="bib1135" ref-type="bibr">[226]</xref>, the FDA has released guidance for Industry describing critical data elements required for animal efficacy studies for drug approval under the Animal Rule: (1) the pathophysiology of disease and the mechanism of action by which the drug prevents or ameliorates disease must be reasonably well understood; (2) it is desired that the efficacy must be demonstrated in two animal species, although multiple studies in one species can be acceptable if the animal model is sufficiently well characterized and accurately predicts the human response; (3) the animal study end point must be clearly related to the desired human efficacy end point, such as enhancement of survival; and (4) PK and pharmacodynamics data must be generated in the animal studies to allow selection of an effective dose in humans.
