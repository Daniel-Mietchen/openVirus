<p id="p0285">There are a great number of viruses on the list of select agents and toxins, and some of these can only be handled in the laboratory at the highest biocontainment level (biosafety level 4). The causative agents of some of the most lethal hemorrhagic fever infections are filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and arenaviruses. Filoviruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus infect humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) and have caused large outbreaks in recent years. These viruses are likely transmitted in nature by fruit bats and are spread from person to person via contact with body fluids or fomites 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Marburg virus was reportedly weaponized through activities carried out by the former Soviet Union 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Because of the large scale of recent EBOV outbreaks, this virus may have become available to nefarious people through access to corpses and contaminated clinical waste. Two more viruses transmitted in nature at least in part by fruit bats are the Nipah and Hendra paramyxoviruses that belong to the Henipaviridae family and cause severe neurological and/or respiratory diseases in humans 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These viruses can infect many domestic and agricultural animal species and are frequently transmitted between humans via droplets or fomites, leading to concerns of new human outbreaks in areas of Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, and Australia where case-fatality rates range from 40% to 100% 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Arenaviruses, specifically 
 <italic>Lassa virus</italic> (LASV) and Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo, and other South American viruses are transmitted not by bats but by peridomestic rodent species 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. None of the filoviruses or henipaviruses has any FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines available for prevention or treatment of human disease, and while ribavirin is sometimes used to treat Lassa fever, it is not a terribly effective drug against this viral infection
