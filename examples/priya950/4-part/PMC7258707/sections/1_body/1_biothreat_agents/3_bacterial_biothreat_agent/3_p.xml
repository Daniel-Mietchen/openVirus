 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> and 
 <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> are Gram-positive bacterial agents of grave biothreat concern. 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> is a spore-forming bacterium that causes cutaneous, respiratory, or intestinal forms of anthrax disease, which is an acute, rapidly progressing infection in any form. The 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores are highly stable both in the environment and in the exposed individuals and can be easily disseminated via the aerosol route, thus making it a dangerous bacterium 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The anthrax attacks in 2001 caused widespread panic, damage, disease, and death, which increased national awareness to the threat of bioterrorism. The bacterium produces a lethal toxin that disrupts the host innate responses during the early stages of infection and ultimately leads to septicemia and death of the host (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.1</xref>A). Antibiotic treatment requires a lengthy dosing regimen and is effective only if it is initiated during the early stage of the infection. Two monoclonal antibody (mAB)–based anthrax antitoxin therapeutics [Abthrax (raxibacumab) and Anthim (obiltoxaximab)] have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and included in the Strategic National Stockpile for treating inhalational anthrax 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. BioThrax, the only licensed anthrax vaccine, is indicated for preexposure prophylaxis of disease in persons at high risk of exposure and postexposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed 
 <italic>B. anthracis</italic> exposure 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), produced by 
 <italic>C. botulinum</italic>, is extremely potent, lethal, and easy to produce, transport, and misuse. The toxin itself is the select agent, but the 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> organism, as an isolate capable of producing the toxin, is also classified as a Tier 1 select agent. There are seven serotypically distinct BoNTs (serotypes A–G) and they act by blocking neurotransmitter release and thereby preventing transmission of nerve impulses, which can lead to botulism, hallmarks of which are paralysis and respiratory arrest

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.1</xref>B). Current treatment is limited to Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous, human-derived antibotulism toxin antibodies for the treatment of infant botulism types A and B, and Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A–G), a mixture of immune globulin fragments developed from equine plasma for the symptomatic treatment of adult and pediatric botulism. The US Army has developed a similar antitoxin based on equine neutralizing antibodies that is effective against a number of serotypes, but there is a limited supply and risk of horse serum sensitivity. An investigational vaccine also exists, but it offers limited protection and painful side effects
