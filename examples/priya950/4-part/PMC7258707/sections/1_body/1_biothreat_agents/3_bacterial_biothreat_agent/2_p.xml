<p id="p0265">Bacteria cause disease in humans by invading tissue, altering the host immune response, and/or producing toxins or virulence factors. Many of the bacteria described here are difficult to treat clinically. The potential bacterial threat agents that pose the greatest risk to national security are ones that can be easily disseminated and result in high morbidity and mortality rates. The former Soviet Union is known to have weaponized at least 30 viral and bacterial agents, including several vaccine or drug-resistant strains
