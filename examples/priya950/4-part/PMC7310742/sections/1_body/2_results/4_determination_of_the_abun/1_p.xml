<p>To determine if prophylactic immunotherapy can decrease the bacterial burden among IAV-GAS superinfected mice, we quantified GAS in the lungs, blood, and spleen of superinfected mice. To do so, mice were infected i.n. with a sublethal dose of IAV (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>). Seven days later they were given antisera to either SLO or the M protein, or non-immune serum. Six hours later, mice were inoculated i.n. with a sublethal dose of GAS (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>). After 24 h, the mice were euthanized and the number of viable bacteria in the lungs, blood, and spleen was determined by dilution plating. The differences among individual groups treated with antisera compared to controls (e.g. antisera to M protein versus control sera) were not statistically significant (
