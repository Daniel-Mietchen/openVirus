<p>We next determined if the IgG fraction of the antisera to the M protein could inhibit the growth of GAS in the presence of phagocytes and complement. For this, GAS was incubated for 30 minutes with the IgG fraction of antisera raised against the M protein; controls included non-immune rabbit IgG. The bacteria were then suspended with murine blood for 30 minutes at 37Â°C and viable bacteria were enumerated by dilution plating. As an additional control, cytochalasin D was used to inhibit actin polymerization and phagocytosis. Compared to non-immune IgG, the addition of antibodies to the M protein decreased the number of viable GAS by 90%; however, the difference was not statistically significant (
