<p>To determine if prophylactic use of antisera to SLO or the M protein could decrease either the morbidity or mortality associated with IAV-GAS superinfection, groups of mice were first inoculated with a sublethal dose of IAV (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) on day 0. On day 7 mice were given antisera to either SLO or the M protein, or non-immune rabbit sera. Six hours later, mice were inoculated with a sublethal dose of GAS (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>). Additional untreated groups of mice included those infected with a sublethal dose (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of either IAV or GAS alone to control for the synergistic effects of viral-bacterial superinfection. Prophylaxis with antisera specific to SLO and to the M protein significantly decreased morbidity compared to mice receiving non-immune sera (
