 <italic>pyogenes</italic> strain MGAS315 (serotype M3) was obtained from ATCC and grown statically with Todd-Hewitt broth, or agar plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY) at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. To prepare stocks to inoculate mice, GAS was grown overnight with THY agar, colonies were inoculated into pre-warmed THY medium, grown to the mid-exponential phase of growth (
