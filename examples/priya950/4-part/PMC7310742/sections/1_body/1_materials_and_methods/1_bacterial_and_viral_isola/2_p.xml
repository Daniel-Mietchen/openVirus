 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Viral RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and whole genome sequence analyses were used to confirm the genetic makeup of the viral preparation. Further characterization of the virus included calculating the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells.
