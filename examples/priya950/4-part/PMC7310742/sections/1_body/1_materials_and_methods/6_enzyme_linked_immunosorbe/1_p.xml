<p>ELISA was done as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 5 μg/mL of recombinant M protein or the SLO toxoid diluted with 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 9.8). Plates were blocked with 1% BSA, washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and serial dilutions of sera were added to the wells and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Plates were washed again with PBS-T, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well. After washing, HRP was detected using One-Step-TMB Turbo substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The OD was measured at 450 nm using a Biotek EL808 plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). End-point titers were defined as the reciprocal serum dilution corresponding with the last well demonstrating an OD
 <sub>450</sub> of 0.1 in the titration curve. In some experiments, intact MGAS315 was immobilized to the ELISA plate as the antigen.
