<p>All experiments were conducted in conformity with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and according to the guidelines of the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of South Dakota (protocol number 10-06-18-21E). Drs. Victor Huber and Ruth Bakker (D.V.M.) provided all animal care and handling training. Female (6 to 8-week-old) BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in groups of four with 24-hour access to food and water. The IAV-GAS superinfection model was previously described and we showed that IAV (PR8) persists in the lungs of mice up to day 9 after infection; which overlaps with GAS infection on day 7[

Intranasal administration was performed by pipetting small droplets every 2 to 3 seconds (approximately 5–10 μl) onto the outer edge of each nostril (alternating) where it was inhaled until 100 μl was delivered. For IAV and GAS the LD
 <sub>50</sub> was determined by the method of Reed and Muench [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We used 0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub> as a sub-lethal dose, which was 10
 <sup>0.75</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of IAV and 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFUs of GAS [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For superinfections, mice were inoculated with IAV on day 0 and GAS on day 7. Animal health and behavior was monitored at least three times a day over the 21 day course of the experiment. Body weight was recorded daily. Endpoint criteria included extreme clinical signs of infection (huddling, hunched posture, ruffled fur, tachypnea), severe hypothermia as indicated by a temperature of 34°C (~4.5°C below normal), and weight loss equal to or greater than 20% of starting weight. Mice with one or more of these symptoms were immediately euthanized and the infection was considered lethal. The total number of mice used in the study was 138. Of these, 61 were euthanized and 77 succumbed to infection.
