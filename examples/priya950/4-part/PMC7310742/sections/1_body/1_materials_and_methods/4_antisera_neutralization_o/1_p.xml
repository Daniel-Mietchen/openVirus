<p>The capacity of SLO antisera to neutralize SLO cytolytic activity was determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, 100 μg of purified SLO toxin was serially diluted 2-fold with PBS (50 μl total volume) in a 96-well flat bottom plate. Then, 50 μl of SLO antiserum, non-immune serum, or PBS, was added and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes. Next, 50 μl of 5% rabbit erythrocytes (Innovative Research; Novi, MI) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 30 minutes at 37°C. Intact erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Hemoglobin present in the supernatants was measured by determining the
