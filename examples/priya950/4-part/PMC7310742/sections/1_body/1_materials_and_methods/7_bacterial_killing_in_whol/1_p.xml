<p>Antibody-mediated killing of GAS was measured with whole mouse blood (Biochemed Services; Winchester VA). Stocks of GAS were diluted in PBS to 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFUs and mixed with 100 μg of IgG (diluted in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow antibodies to bind GAS. Then, 200 μL of whole mouse blood was added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Viable GAS were enumerated by dilution plating on THY agar. Cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization, and is a general inhibitor of phagocytosis. In some experiments cytochalasin D (final concentration, 10 μM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to whole blood 30 minutes prior to the addition of GAS to inhibit phagocytosis.
