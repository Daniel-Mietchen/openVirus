<p>Passive antibody therapy has been successfully used to treat toxin-mediated bacterial diseases including diphtheria, tetanus, botulism, and 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These diseases result largely from the activity of one, or two, specific proteins. In contrast, the pathogenesis of GAS (and many other bacteria), involves multiple, sometimes functionally redundant, virulence factors. Thus, the successful development of antibody-based adjunct therapeutics to pathogens employing multiple virulence factors may require formulations that include antibodies to multiple virulence factors and not monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies targeting a single protein. Subsequent studies will explore the efficacy of using a combination of IgG antibodies to both the M protein and SLO in mitigating the morbidity and mortality of IAV-GAS superinfections.
