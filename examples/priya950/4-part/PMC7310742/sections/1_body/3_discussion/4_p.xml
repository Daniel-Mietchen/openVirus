<p>The mortality of iGAS diseases is remarkably high despite the susceptibility of the pathogen to antibiotics and there is considerable need for adjunct therapeutics. Patients with iGAS diseases typically have either low titers, or lack antibodies to the causative GAS serotype suggesting that sufficient levels of circulating antibodies may protect against iGAS diseases [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains both opsonic and neutralizing antibodies to several GAS virulence factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. There has been some clinical success using IVIG to treat iGAS diseases, especially streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; however, definitive results from robust clinical trials are lacking [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This is due, in part, to challenges in enrolling a sufficient number of patients and probably the low concentration, and variability, of GAS-specific antibodies in IVIG [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A study supporting this interpretation found that when IgG antibodies specific to GAS were purified from human IVIG they were more efficacious when used as a passive vaccine in a murine model of iGAS infection compared to IVIG [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These results support the idea that GAS-specific antibodies may be an effective therapeutic approach to manage iGAS diseases, although it is acknowledged that IVIG treatment also dampens the inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which likely affects clinical outcomes.
