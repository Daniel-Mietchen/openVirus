<p>IAV increases host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections by a variety of mechanisms. Most research related to GAS has focused on the characterization of viral-induced changes affecting GAS adherence and internalization [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, murine models of IAV-GAS superinfection show that IAV infection significantly enhances the virulence of GAS [
