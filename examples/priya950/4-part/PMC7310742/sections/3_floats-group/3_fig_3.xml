  <title>Quantification of GAS in the lungs, blood, and spleens of mice treated prophylactically with antisera.</title>
  <p>Mice were infected i.n. with 0.1 LD
   <sub>50</sub> IAV on day 0. On day 7, mice were treated with antisera specific to either the M protein or SLO, or non-immune sera (ctrl) and superinfected 6 h later with GAS (0.1 LD
   <sub>50</sub>). Mice were euthanized 24 h later and the number of GAS present in blood, lungs, and spleens was determined by dilution plating. Differences between the individual groups were not statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05); however, the difference in the number of bacteria in the lungs and blood of mice treated with either antisera to SLO or the M protein was lower compared to those treated with non-immune sera (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; *). Statistical significance was determined with the Student's t-test.
