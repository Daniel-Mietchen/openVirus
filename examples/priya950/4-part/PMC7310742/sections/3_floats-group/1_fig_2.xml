  <title>Antibodies to the M protein inhibit growth of GAS in blood.</title>
  <p>Growth and viability of GAS in murine blood. GAS was pre-incubated for 30 min. with IgG to the M protein or non-immune IgG (ctrl) prior to suspension in murine blood that contained, or not, cytochalasin D. After an additional 30 min., viable bacteria were enumerated by dilution plating. The results shown are the means Â± sem from 4 independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined with the Student's t-test.</p>
