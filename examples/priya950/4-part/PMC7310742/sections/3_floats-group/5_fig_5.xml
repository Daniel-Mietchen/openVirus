  <title>Quantification of GAS in the lungs, blood, and spleens of mice treated with antisera 2 h after superinfection.</title>
  <p>Mice were infected i.n. with 0.1 LD
   <sub>50</sub> IAV on day 0 and GAS on day 7 followed 2 h later by treatment with antisera to the M protein, SLO, or non-immune sera as a control (ctrl). Mice were euthanized 24 h later and the number of GAS present in blood, lungs, and spleens was determined by dilution plating. Differences between the individual groups were not statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05); however, there were fewer GAS in the lungs and spleen of mice treated with either antisera to SLO or the M protein compared to those treated with non-immune sera (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; *). Statistical significance was determined with the Student's t-test.
