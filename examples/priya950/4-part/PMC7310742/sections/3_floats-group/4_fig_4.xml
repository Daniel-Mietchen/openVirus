  <title>Determination of the effect of prophylactic administration of antisera to SLO (α-SLO) or the M protein (α-M) on morbidity (weight loss) and mortality of IAV-GAS superinfected mice.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A)</bold> Treatment with α-SLO and α-M decreased morbidity compared to groups of mice treated with non-immune sera (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) 
   <bold>B)</bold> The mortality associated with IAV-GAS superinfection was slightly reduced following administration of either α-SLO or α-M compared to treatment with non-immune sera (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Control groups also included untreated mice inoculated with IAV alone (day 0) or GAS alone (day 7). The area under the curve analysis (days 8–15) was completed prior to an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test to compare the differences in morbidity. A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to compare the differences in mortality.
