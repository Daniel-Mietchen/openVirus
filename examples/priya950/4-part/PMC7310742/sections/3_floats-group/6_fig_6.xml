  <title>Determination of the effect of therapeutic administration of antisera to SLO (α-SLO) or the M protein (α-M) on morbidity (weight loss) and mortality of IAV-GAS superinfected mice.</title>
  <p>Mice were injected with antibodies specific to SLO (α-SLO) or the M protein (α-M) 2 h after superinfection with GAS. For controls, groups of mice were treated with non-immune sera (α-ctrl). Treatment with α-SLO decreased morbidity compared to treatment with non-immune sera (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in mortality between treated and untreated groups of mice (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The area under the curve analysis (days 8–15) was completed prior to an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test to compare the differences in morbidity. A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to compare the differences in mortality between the groups.
