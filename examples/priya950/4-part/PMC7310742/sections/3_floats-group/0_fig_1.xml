   <bold>(A)</bold>. The titers were determined with ELISA. Data shown are the means ± sem from 4 to 5 independent experiments. n.d. indicates antibody binding was not detected; α refers to antisera. ELISA was also used to determine the titers of antibodies specific to SLO (open square) or the M protein (open diamond) in the blood and lungs of mice 24 hours after
