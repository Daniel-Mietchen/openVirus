As such, according to the Diagnostic Center of the Taiwan CDC, a confirmed case of dengue fever requires positive detection of RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or serological diagnosis through an IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A standard protocol was adopted by local physicians and epidemiologists to collect individual-level information on each dengue fever case, including the onset of dengue illness, age, gender, clinical manifestations, reporting hospital, diagnosis results and travel history. Dengue case collection and surveillance involved both passive (hospital-based reporting systems) and active (fever screening at airports, self-reporting, expanded screening for contacts of confirmed cases, patients with fever of unknown origin and school-based reporting) detection.
