<p id="Par29">However, actual clinical surveillance reports were delayed by approximately 1–2 months during local epidemics of dengue fever; furthermore, a concealment period ≥2 days was common. Therefore, instead of investigating correlations between reported cases in the same month, we tested for relationships between the number of imported cases in a single month and the number of indigenous cases reported 2 months later, also accounting for differences in the concealment period. When accounting for concealment periods &gt; 2 days, we found significant positive correlations between the number of imported cases and the number of indigenous cases reported 2 months later (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.459, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), &gt; 3 days (r = 0.394, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and &gt; 4 days (r = 0.387, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) (Table
