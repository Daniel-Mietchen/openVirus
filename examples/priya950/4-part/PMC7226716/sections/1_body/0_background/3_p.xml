<p id="Par14">Transmission of dengue in Taiwan is driven by two species of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes: 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The former is found throughout Taiwan, while the latter is restricted to the south [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indigenous dengue is not considered endemic in Taiwan; thus, importation of DENV (due to close commercial ties and human migration from neighboring Southeast Asian countries) is thought to be the underlying cause of DENV outbreaks. Preventing the importation of disease has therefore become the major objective of quarantine for dengue fever and the epidemic prevention network in Taiwan.
