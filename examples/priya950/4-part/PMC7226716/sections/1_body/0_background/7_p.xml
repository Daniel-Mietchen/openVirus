<p id="Par18">In this study, we investigated the number of indigenous and imported cases of dengue fever in Kaohsiung City between 2013 and 2018, including the country of importation and status/occupation of the infected individual. We also mapped out the monthly number of cases confirmed by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC) surveillance system throughout this period. We subsequently tested for correlations between indigenous and imported cases, testing both the number of cases and the month in which they were reported. We found a significant correlation between the two types of infection after accounting for the disease latency period and delays in case reporting. Our results suggest that importation of the virus is indeed driving outbreaks of dengue fever in Taiwan, indicating that disease prevention strategies should continue to focus on human migration patterns and the efficient identification of dengue fever to reduce the incidence of disease.</p>
