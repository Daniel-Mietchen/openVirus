  <title>Geometric mean titers of dengue and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies.</title>
  <p>Dilution titers against ZIKV during days 6 and 7 post ZIKV infection. Animals from cohort 1 are shown in blue, animals from cohort 2 are shown in orange and naïve animals from cohort 3 are shown in black in all panels. Dotted line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. Non-neutralizing sera were assigned a value of one-half of the limit of detection for visualization and calculation of the geometric means and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001, ***P≤0.001 and ****P&lt;0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
