  <title>Geometric mean titers of dengue and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies.</title>
  <p>The 50% effective concentration of neutralizing antibodies was determined. Animals from cohort 1 are shown in blue, animals from cohort 2 are shown in orange and naïve animals from cohort 3 are shown in black in all panels. Dotted line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. Non-neutralizing sera were assigned a value of one-half of the limit of detection for visualization and calculation of the geometric means and confidence intervals. (A) EC50 values of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV after ZIKV infection. (B) EC50 values of neutralizing antibodies against DENV2 after ZIKV infection. Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05 and ***P≤0.001). Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001, ***P≤0.001 and ****P&lt;0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
