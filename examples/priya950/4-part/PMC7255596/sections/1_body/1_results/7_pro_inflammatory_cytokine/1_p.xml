<p>Next, we determined how DENV immunity impacts the cytokine secretion during a subsequent ZIKV infection (

DENV 12M animals had seemingly higher levels compared to their DENV 3M counterparts, although no statistical significance was reached. From days 2 to 7 p.i., animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection had a consistently higher expression of IFNγ compared to naïve animals although this difference did not reach statistical significance (

This same group of DENV-middle convalescent animals showed a trend towards higher MIP-1α levels, reaching significant differences in day 5 and 7 p.i. (P&lt;0.01), while naïve animals showed an increase in MIP-1β levels by day 1 p.i. (P&lt;0.01), followed by a sudden drop (

Likewise, an increase in IL-1Ra levels, which is considered an inflammatory marker, was detected in naïve animals at day 1 p.i. that is significantly higher than levels in DENV-immune animals (P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: -1723, CI95%: -3060 to -385.1 versus DENV 12M; P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: -1809, CI95%: -3305 to -313.18 versus DENV 3M), but it decreased in the next 24 hours (

A similar event can be observed with CXCL10, where naïve animals had a significant boost by day 1 p.i. in comparison with the two DENV-immune groups, although a dramatic drop occurs on the following 24 hrs (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -533, CI95%: -22.69 to -1.98) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). Lastly, DENV 12M animals showed higher levels of circulating perforin, reaching a significant difference compared to the other two groups at day 7 p.i. (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -419.9, CI95%: -824.2 to -15.68) (
