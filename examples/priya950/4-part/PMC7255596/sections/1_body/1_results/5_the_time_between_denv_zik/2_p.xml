<p>The 50% effective concentration (EC) of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) is shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As expected, all three groups had low or absent nAbs against ZIKV at baseline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As early as 6 days after the infection an increase in the neutralizing activity against ZIKV is detected in all groups with a slight non-significant trend to be higher in the DENV 12M group. This increase continues on day 7 with the trend to be higher in both preimmunized groups. By day 30 p.i., neutralizing titers had boosted in the three groups, with DENV-middle convalescent animals showing a slight trend towards higher levels of dilution effective for half-maximum neutralization compared to DENV 3M and na√Øve groups. These levels decline slightly by day 60 p.i but still maintained a similar relation among groups (
