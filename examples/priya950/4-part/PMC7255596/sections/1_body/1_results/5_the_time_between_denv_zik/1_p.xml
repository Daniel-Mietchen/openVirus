<p>To determine the contribution of binding Abs to the neutralization and the impact of a previous DENV infection in a subsequent ZIKV infection in terms of neutralization potential, all three groups were tested using PRNT and FRNT assays against ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes respectively. Neutralization assays were completed for baseline, days 30 and 60 for DENV and ZIKV. To better understand if the previous DENV immunity plays a role in the neutralization of ZIKV early after the infection, we also ran PRNT assays for days 3, 5, 6 and 7. The endpoint titers are showed in
