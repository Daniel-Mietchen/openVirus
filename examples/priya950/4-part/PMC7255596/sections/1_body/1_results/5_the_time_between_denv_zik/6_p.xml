<p>In order to determine if there were any strain-specific neutralization differences, neutralization assays were performed at 30 days p.i. against two recently circulating contemporary ZIKV strains, ZIKVH/PF/2013 and ZIKVPRVABC-59. No differences in the neutralization magnitude were seen for any group (

When evaluating the neutralizing titers against all four DENV serotypes, we observed a boost in neutralization against all serotypes in all three groups, suggesting that a subsequent ZIKV infection impact the levels of heterologous DENV-neutralizing Abs (

Interestingly 30 days after ZIKV infection there was a non-significant trend to higher neutralizing titers against DENV2 and DENV4 compared to the other two DENV serotypes in the DENV naive group. The hierarchy of neutralizing Abs generated 30 days p.i. was the same for both DENV immune groups (D2&gt;ZIKV&gt;D4&gt;D3&gt;D1), and for the na√Øve group it was ZIKV&gt;D4&gt;D2&gt;D3&gt;D1 (
