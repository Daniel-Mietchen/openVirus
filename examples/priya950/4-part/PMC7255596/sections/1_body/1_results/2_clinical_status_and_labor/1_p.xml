<p>To determine how a previous DENV infection affects the clinical status of non-human primates after infection with ZIKV, day 0 (baseline), day 6 p.i. and day 30 p.i. were compared in terms of complete blood count. All sixteen animals belonging to this study were continuously monitored and evaluated twice daily for evidence of disease or injury. All animals were inside the range in terms of weight and similar of age (

Although no differences were detected between groups, monocytes (MON) were significantly higher in the na√Øve animals on day 6 p.i. compared to their baseline levels (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: 0.25, CI95%: 0.00 to 0.46) (
