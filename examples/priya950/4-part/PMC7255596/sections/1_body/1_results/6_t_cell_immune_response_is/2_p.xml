<p>DENV 12M animals had also a significantly higher frequency of CD107a+ cells prior to ZIKV infection (P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: -0.8775, CI95%: -1.25 to -0.503) against the whole DENV antigen (

(P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -0.4421, CI95%: -0.8616 to -0.02263 and P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -0.8775, CI95%: -1.251 to -0.5035, respectively) (

In contrast, data from CD8+ T cells denote similar responses between DENV immune animals, with no significant variations compared to the naïve animals (
