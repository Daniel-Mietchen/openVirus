<p>From our work, we can infer a role of the cellular immune response in facilitating the initial significant decrease of ZIKV replication between days 4 to 7 p.i. is very likely. The cytotoxic profile of the CD4+ T cells present 12 months after DENV infection and during heterologous ZIKV challenge correlates with better performance relative to the early (3 months) or late (2.8 years) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Importantly, Weiskopf et al. and others have shown that DENV CD4+ T cells are readily detectable early following DENV infection, and the frequency of DENV-specific CD107a+ CD4+ T correlate with enhanced protection against DENV disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and play a key role in controlling secondary flavivirus infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our work builds on these observations and demonstrates that DENV specific CD4+ T cells isolated one year after DENV infection were highly responsive to the whole DENV virus prior to ZIKV infection (characterized by a significantly higher frequency of IFN-γ production or CD107a expression). Additionally, this group showed a strong trend to higher frequency of CD107a expressing CD4+ T cells in response to the whole ZIKV and of IFN-γ CD4+ T cells after the other stimuli including the whole ZIKV, ZIKV and DENV envelope and ZIKV nonstructural proteins compared to the other two groups. In fact, after 30 days of infection the focus of CD4+ T cells reactivity was ZIKV envelope and non-structural antigens. That switch was a trend, but not significant in animals with an early period of convalescence to DENV compared to the DENV-naïve group. Interestingly, it has been shown that a higher frequency of DENV-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells are associated with subclinical manifestations in children suffering from secondary DENV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Notably, the data for CD8+T cells did not recapitulate the observations of the CD4+ T cells. We noted relatively similar responses between CD8+T cells isolated from the 12M DENV immune animals compared to the 3M DENV immune animals. Our finding on CD4+ T cells is consistent with a previous report confirming that pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells (and not CD8+ T cells or Abs) are responsible also for limiting the severity of illness caused by influenza [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This suggests that the CD4+ T cell response changed over time, leading to potential differences in disease outcome.
