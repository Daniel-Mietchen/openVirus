<p>Macaques provide a robust model to study the immunological profile after sequential flavivirus infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Using the macaque model allows among other factors, to normalize the quantity of viral inoculum, the age and sex of the animals exposed, and the timing of the infection. Controlling the timing of exposure between heterologous flavivirus infections allows for the measurement of the impact of time on the immune response to the second infecting agent. These studies are important not only for understanding the impact of the duration of exposure between natural heterologous flavivirus infections in endemic areas but also provide a model to evaluate possible pan-flavivirus protective windows for vaccine candidates.
