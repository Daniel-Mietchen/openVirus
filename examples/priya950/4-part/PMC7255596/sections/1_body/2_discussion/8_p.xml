<p>It is well documented that secondary flavivirus infections, including ZIKV, lead to an increase in cross-reactive Abs and nAbs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Consistent with that, we found a transient but significant expansion in the magnitude of DENV2 cross-reactive Abs in the pre-immune groups 30 days after ZIKV infection with a rapid decline similar to baseline levels by day 60 p.i. DENV cross-neutralizing Abs also show a slight but not significant expansion by day 30 p.i. compared to their baseline values. These results confirm that ZIKV infection contributes to a transient expansion of DENV neutralization which may play a role modifying the course of a subsequent DENV infection in a DENV endemic region. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neutralization against the others 3 DENV serotypes was also boosted but without significant differences among serotypes, regardless of the time between infections. This result is in contrast with our previous work showing that time between ZIKV and DENV infection significantly modify the magnitude of neutralization to the other DENV serotypes suggesting that different immune mechanisms are triggered when the sequence of infections are different [
