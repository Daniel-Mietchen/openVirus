<p>pDC-mediated mechanisms have been described as key in antiviral responses against DENV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It has been documented that mature pDCs produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN α and IFN β, activating innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Virus-stimulated pDCs are responsible for a wider and faster response, and additionally contribute to expand antigen-specific memory CD4 and CD8 T cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, their recruitment to lymphoid and some peripheral tissues leads to an ongoing inflammatory response and the activation of lymphocytes by expressing co-stimulatory molecules and in turn, modulate T cell effector functions. Our results are in agreement with this, showing a significant increase of circulating perforin by day 7 p.i. correlating with a higher expression of CD107a and higher frequency of IFN-γ production on CD4+ T cells in animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection.
