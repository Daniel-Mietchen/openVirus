<p>A cross-reactive DENV-binding Ab (1M7) was conjugated to M280 Tosylactivated Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 100 μg 1M7 to 5 mg Dynabeads as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Beads were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Purified DENV-2 (S-16803) was bound to the 1M7-Dynabead mixture at a ratio of 100 μg antigen to 5 mg DENV2-bound Dynabeads for 1 h at 37 °C and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Control beads were incubated with an equal amount of BSA. For depletion, sera were diluted 1:10 and incubated with 5 μg of DENV2-bound Dynabeads in 3 successive rounds at 37 °C for 1 h each, using a magnet to remove Abs bound to beads after each round. Confirmation of DENV-2 Ab depletion was performed by ELISA (see above). After depletions, neutralization titers were determined using a micro neutralization test (MNT) in which serially diluted sera (depleted and undepleted controls) were incubated with ~50 focus forming units of DENV-2 (S-16803) in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The serum-virus mixtures were added to Vero cells (2 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in a 96-well plate and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 1 mL of overlay was added to the plates containing serum-virus dilutions, followed by an incubation period of 48 hours at 37C/5%CO2. After 2 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS 1X, blocked with 3% nonfat dairy milk and stained with 4G2 and 2H2 mAbs, diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab diluted 1:800 in blocking buffer. Foci were developed with TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL) and counted using an Elispot reader.
