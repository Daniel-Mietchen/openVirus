<p>ZIKV PRVABC59 strain was obtained from ATCC, BEI Resources (Manassas, VA), was used in order to compare results to our previously published data. This ZIKV strain replicates well in rhesus macaques but has a lower viremia peak than ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain. We aimed to use a strain from the recent epidemic in the Americas region. Virus was expanded and titered by plaque assay and qRT-PCR using protocols standardized in our laboratories. DENV-1 Western Pacific 74, DENV-2 New Guinea 44, DENV-3 Sleman 73 and DENV-4 Dominique strains kindly provided by Steve Whitehead (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) were used for neutralization assays. DENV-2 New Guinea 44 strain was also used to infect macaques in September 2016 and June 2017.</p>
