<p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). For viral burden analysis, the log titers and levels of vRNA were analyzed unpaired multiple t tests and two-way ANOVA. Also, a Chi-squared test was used to analyze a contingency table created from obtained viremia data. The statistical significance between or within groups evaluated at different time points was determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Tukey’s, Sidak’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test) or unpaired t-test to compare the means. The p values are expressed in relational terms with the alpha values. The significance threshold for all analyses was set at 0.05; p values less than 0.01 are expressed as P&lt;0.01, while p values less than 0.001 are expressed as P&lt;0.001. Similarly, values less than 0.005 are expressed as P&lt;0.005. In figures, p values from 0.01 to 0.05 are depicted as *, 0.001 to 0.01 as **, 0.0001 to 0.001 as ***, and lastly, values less than 0.0001 are depicted as ****.</p>
