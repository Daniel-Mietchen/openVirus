<p>Intracellular cytokine staining of PBMCs from rhesus macaques was performed by multicolor flow cytometry using methods similar to those described by Meyer et al. Briefly, PBMC samples were thawed 1 day prior to stimulation. Approx. 1.5 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs were infected overnight with DENV-2 (NGC44) at a MOI of 0.1 or ZIKV at a MOI of 0.5 in RPMI medium with 5% FBS. The remaining PBMCs were rested overnight as described earlier in 5ml of RPMI with 10% FBS. These PBMCs were then stimulated for 6 h at 37C/5%/CO2 with ZIKV-E peptides (15-mers overlapping by 10 amino acids, 2.5 ug/ml
 <sup>-1</sup> per peptide), ZIKV-NS1 protein peptides (15-mers overlapping by 10 amino acids, 475 ng/ml
 <sup>-1</sup> per peptide), or DENV-2 E peptides (1.25 ug/ml
 <sup>-1</sup>), all in the presence of brefeldin A (10 ug/ml
 <sup>-1</sup>), a-CD107a-FITC (H4A3) (10 ul), and co-stimulated with a-CD28.2 (1 ug/ml
 <sup>-1</sup>) and a-CD49d (1 ug/ml
 <sup>-1</sup>). After stimulation, the cells were stained for the following markers: CD4-PerCP Cy5.5 (Leu-3A (SK3), CD8b-Texas Red (2ST8.5H7), CD3-PacBlue (SP34), CD20-BV605 (2H7), CD95-V510 (DX2), CD28.2-PE-Cy5, IFN-γ-APC (B27) and TNF-α-PE-Cy7 (MAB11). The samples were run on an LSRII (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.6.1 (Treestar). Lymphocytes were gated based on their characteristic forward and side scatter pattern, T cells were selected with a second gate on the CD3-positive population, and at the same time CD20 positive cells were excluded. CD8+ T cells were defined as CD3
 <sup>+</sup> CD20
 <sup>-</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4+ T cells as CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD20
 <sup>-</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>. Cytokine expression was determined by the per cent CD4+ or CD8+ positive cells, and then stained positive for the cytokine IFNγ or TNFα. CD107a+ was also measured in these populations to determine functional cytotoxicity.
