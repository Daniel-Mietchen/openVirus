<p>Previously, we showed that a primary DENV infection (&gt;2 years) does not result in an increase in ZIKV viremia or pathogenesis in a non-human primate model (NHP) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, DENV-immune animals showed a shorter viremic period compared to DENV-naive macaques. Our previous results further suggested that the cellular immune response in DENV-experimented individuals may play a key role limiting ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our results on the potential protective role of pre-existing DENV-immunity against ZIKV infection were validated by subsequent NHP works [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and more recently with results from human cohorts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, little is known about the molecular and immune mechanisms behind DENV and ZIKV interactions. It has been shown that primary DENV infections do not induce durable ZIKV cross-neutralizing Abs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but the contribution of previous DENV cross-reacting Abs to controlling early ZIKV replication

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the similarity of their competent immune system with humans is critical for understanding the mechanisms behind disease pathogenesis.
