<p>In addition, we demonstrate that a period of time of at least 12 months between DENV and ZIKV infections results in a significant increase in the frequency of the dendritic plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) in the first days after ZIKV infection and with a trend to higher frequency of interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) or CD107a+ CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that early after ZIKV infection the cellular immune response, and not Abs, may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. This study furthers our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations and is a major contribution to the field of virus-virus interactions and future vaccine designs.</p>
