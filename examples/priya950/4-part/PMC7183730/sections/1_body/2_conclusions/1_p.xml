<p id="Par72">The remarkable multifunctionally of the viral-encoded RBPs and the large diversity of the host RBPs co-opted by flaviviruses highlights the importance of these proteins in determining virus-cell host interactions. Here, we emphasize that in addition to the better characterized functions during vRNA translation and replication, RBPs participate at later stages of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> replication cycle, particularly, during the packaging of vRNA and assembly into virus particles. Furthermore, we propose that the biogenesis of infectious exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination, relies on the recognition of vRNA by host RBPs (Fig.Â
