<p id="Par46">The most recent classification of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses names 89 species divided between four genera within the family: 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic>. This review will focus on the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, which is subdivided into four ecological groups: mosquito-borne, tick-borne, insect-specific and no known arthropod vector flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The vast majority of research relevant to this review has been performed with mosquito and tick-borne flaviviruses including dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), YFV, Zika virus (ZIKV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). These viruses are of clinical importance as they cause major outbreaks with a variety of disease symptoms including hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. DENV in particular is a significant human health concern as it is ubiquitous in the tropics and estimated to cause nearly 100 million symptomatic infections per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The severe manifestation of human DENV infection is dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which can be lethal, especially for patients lacking supportive care.
