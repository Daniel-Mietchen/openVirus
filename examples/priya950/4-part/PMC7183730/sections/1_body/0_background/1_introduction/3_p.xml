<p id="Par47">Vector control strategies are the main countermeasures to limit the burden of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>-related diseases; however, traditional methods have failed mainly due to insecticide resistance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], these are likely to pose complex challenges mainly related to implementation, coverage and public acceptance. Currently, effective vaccines are in use for YFV, JEV and TBEV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The development of an effective vaccine against DENV has proven challenging, with recent concerns raised regarding the safety of the only licensed vaccine [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, encouraging clinical trials suggest the development of a safe and effective tetravalent DENV vaccine in the near future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At this time, there is no specific antiviral therapy against any virus of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus. Thus, although progress has been made to limit the burden of flaviviruses epidemics
 <italic>,</italic> more work needs to be done. In particular, there are concerns about emerging viruses with novel pathogenic potential, exemplified by the recent ZIKV pandemic and its association with birth defects [
