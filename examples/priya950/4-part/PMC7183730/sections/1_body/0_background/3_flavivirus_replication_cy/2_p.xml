<p id="Par52">Once in the cytoplasm the vRNA is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where translation takes place [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The vRNA has a type 1 cap structure and therefore, translation is considered to be cap-dependent, like the majority of the eukaryotic mRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; however, non-canonical mechanisms of translation initiation have also been described for DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Translation and concomitant processing of the ER-bound polyprotein generates three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The NS proteins include NS3 and NS5, which carry enzymatic activities (NS3 is a protease and helicase while NS5 is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and methyltransferase), and NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B, which participate in vRNA replication and virion assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].
