<p id="Par50">In addition to its role during vRNA replication, the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> 3′ UTR is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). sfRNA results from partial degradation of vRNA by the host 5′ ➔ 3′ exoribonuclease XRN1, which stalls at exonuclease resistant RNA structures (xrRNAs) present in the 3′ UTR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> 3′ UTR contains up to four xrRNAs, corresponding with compactly folded RNA elements found in the SL and DB structures. In some instances, XRN1 slips through the first xrRNA and stalls at a downstream structure giving rise to sfRNAs of different lengths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The production of sfRNA is independent of virus replication and viral proteins and is conserved in all flaviviruses studied thus far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Its functions relate to pathogenicity, inhibition of antiviral responses, increased viral transmission and higher replicative fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
