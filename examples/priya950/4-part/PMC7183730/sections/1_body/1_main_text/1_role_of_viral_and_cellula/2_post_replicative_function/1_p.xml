<p id="Par59">The function of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS proteins is best characterized during vRNA replication, however, NS proteins are also required for the assembly and egress of virus particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Studies on the molecular mechanisms by which NS proteins regulate the late stages of the replication cycle are limited because genetic perturbations of most NS proteins lead to the abrogation of RNA replication. Here, we will discuss recent data pointing towards the essential functions of NS2A and NS3 for assembly.
