 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Balinsky et al found that nucleolin interacts with DENV C in both nucleus and cytoplasm in an RNA-independent manner. The interaction, which was verified in DENV-infected cells as well as in cell-free reactions, was abolished by the use of a nucleolin-binding aptamer (AS1411). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleolin as well as treatment with AS1411 resulted in a significant decrease of DENV titers despite similar levels of intracellular vRNA and viral proteins and secreted E and C. These results resemble those of DDX56, however, chemical interference of nucleolin slightly reduced the number of vRNA copies in supernatant and nucleolin knockdown did not affect secreted vRNA at all. The authors failed to investigate why siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleolin resulted in lower virus titers without altering supernatant vRNA. It would be interesting to test whether the lost interactions between nucleolin and C increases the ratio of immature viruses, thus generating virus progeny with the same vRNA levels but with different infectivity.
