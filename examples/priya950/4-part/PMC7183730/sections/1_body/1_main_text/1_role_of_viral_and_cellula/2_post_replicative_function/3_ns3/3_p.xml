<p id="Par65">Interactions of NS3 with several host factors have also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Of importance for assembly, YFV and DENV NS3 were found to interact with apoptosis linked gene-2-interacting protein X (ALIX) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. In both cases knock out of ALIX or transfection with truncated versions of the protein resulted in the inhibition of virus release without affecting vRNA replication. ALIX is an accessory protein for the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that mediates membrane deformation favouring budding away from the cytoplasm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Several ESCRT subunits are required for the membrane deformation during budding of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> viral particle but not for the formation of VPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Because ALIX plays a role in concentrating cargoes that are incorporated into budding vesicles, is tempting to speculate that its interaction with NS3 mediates proper assembly of viral particles, however, this remains to be examined.
