 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS3 (~ 70 KDa) is a multifunctional protein with two domains, the N-terminal domain has chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity and the C-terminal domain has helicase, ATPase and RNA 5′ triphosphatase activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In addition, an ATP-independent RNA annealing activity has also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The protease activity of NS3 is required in 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans</italic> for processing of the viral polyprotein, whereby NS2B functions as cofactor. The precise function of the helicase domain during vRNA replication is not known, but it is presumed that it resolves secondary structures present in the vRNA, displaces other RNA-binding proteins to remodel the viral RNP, and/or separates the dsRNA intermediate formed upon replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Together NS3 and NS5 have all the enzymatic activities required for the replication of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> vRNA, and recently a hand full of studies suggest that the function of NS3 extends outside of the replication complex.
