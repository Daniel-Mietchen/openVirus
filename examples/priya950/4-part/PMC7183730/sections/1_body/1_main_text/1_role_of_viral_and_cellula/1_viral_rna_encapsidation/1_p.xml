<p id="Par55">The molecular details leading to 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> vRNA encapsidation and assembly into new virions remains largely unknown. Notably, the process is thought to be highlys specific, as only a single full length (+)vRNA molecule is packaged into virions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], whereas sfRNA molecules, (âˆ’)RNA and host RNAs are excluded. The selective packaging of single stranded RNA viruses is often attributed to the presence of packaging signals, specific sequences and/or secondary structures that promote interaction with C proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The C-binding signals have not been identified for flaviviruses. Therefore, non-specific electrostatic interactions between highly basic C protein and negatively charged vRNA are likely to mediate 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> nucleocapsid formation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Notably, in spite of C being the least conserved of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> viral proteins (less than 40% sequence identity), the charge distribution is similar among the viruses in the genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Indeed, mutational analysis of two conserved clusters of basic amino acids revealed that no specific residues were required for DENV virus production as long as the number of positive charges were preserved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The study of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> particles by cryo-electron microscopy did not visualize an organized nucleocapsid suggesting that it does not have the same symmetry as the envelope or that it is stochastically arrayed, which could be mediated by non-specific interactions between C and vRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
