  <p>RNA transactions in 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic>-infected cells. Flaviviruses carry a positive-sense RNA that is immediately translated upon delivery into a susceptible host cell. Translation takes place at the ER membrane and generates a single polyprotein processed into three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. Replication of vRNA takes place inside virus-induced invaginations known as vesicle packets (VPs). Newly synthesized vRNA function as template for translation, further replication, generation of sfRNA molecules or is assembled into new virus particles. Assembly takes place at locations juxtaposed to the VPs. The viral proteins NS2A and NS3 have been implicated in the assembly of new virus particles
