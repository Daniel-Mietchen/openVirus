Nalgene pans at a density of 200 larvae per pan in 2.5 L of autoclaved deionized water and fed a 2:3 mixture of brewer’s yeast and liver powder. Adults were housed in 14 in. x 14 in. white PVC cages (BioQuip, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and maintained on 10% sucrose solution and human donor blood (The Blood Center, New Orleans, LA) in an insectary at 27 °C and 80% relative humidity (RH) with a 10 h D:14 h L photoperiod.
