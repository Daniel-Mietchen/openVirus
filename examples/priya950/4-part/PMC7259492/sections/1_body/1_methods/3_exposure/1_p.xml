 <italic>albopictus</italic> at a dose of 4 logs PFU/mL. Females between 2 and 4 days post-eclosion were sorted by aspiration into groups with 10 males each and placed in an environmental chamber at 27 °C and 80% relative humidity on a 15-step (14 hr L: 10 hr D) photoperiod 24 hours prior to oral challenge. Sucrose was withheld for 12 hours prior to feeding. A Hemotek membrane feeding system (Hemotek Ltd, Great Harwood, UK) set to 37°C covered with Hemotek’s collagen membrane was used. Infectious blood-meals were prepared using a mixture of washed, deactivated and defibrinated bovine blood (Lampire Biological Laboratories Inc, Pipersville, PA) and centrifuged infectious cell media at a 1:1 ratio. Additionally, ATP was added as a feeding stimulant to a final concentration of 5 μM in the 12 mL prepared meal [

Infectious media was taken from fresh Vero cell culture of Zika-Panama (PA259249) (GenBank accession # KX156775) obtained from the University of Texas Medical Branch at culture days 3 and 4 and Vero passage 6. A corresponding plaque assay was run on the infectious media to determine the viral titer of each infectious blood-meal (

Post-feeding mosquitoes were cold anesthetized and sorted and engorged females of each species were divided into four groups and replaced in environmental chambers. Mosquitoes were provided 10% sucrose solution on saturated cotton balls for sustenance.
