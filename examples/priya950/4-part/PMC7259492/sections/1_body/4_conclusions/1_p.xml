<p>We observed remarkably low susceptibility of both

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> from New Orleans to a Zika virus strain from Panama after oral challenge with virus doses similar to that of asymptomatic or subclinical infections. These results suggest a limited risk of Zika virus transmission in the New Orleans area due to the silent infections of returning travelers. This likely played a major role in why there was not local transmission in New Orleans compared to Florida and Texas during the 2016 epidemic, despite multiple known travel associated introductions to New Orleans [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquito populations have been shown to be competent vectors for dengue, and thus control measures should not be relaxed.
