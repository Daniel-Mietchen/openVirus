<p>We hypothesized that New Orleans mosquitoes would be at best moderately competent for Zika virus at a dose representing low-viremia cases, given that no autochthonous transmission occurred in New Orleans at the height of the Zika virus epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. Our data indicates that these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations are not competent vectors for Zika virus, though there was some limited susceptibility to infection by a Panama strain of Zika virus. While there is limited chance for transmission given our data, there is the possibility that Zika virus would be detected in mosquito pools by surveillance efforts as a very small number of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> did become infected [
