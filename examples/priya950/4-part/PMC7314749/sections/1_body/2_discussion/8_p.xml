<p id="Par24">The ancestral 
 <italic>K</italic>5 lineage is differentiated in the African populations from Congo that became established in 2011 as a derivation of the 
 <italic>K</italic>5 Amazonian component. Vazeille and colleagues in 2016

 </sup> demonstrated that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> newly introduced in Congo were unable to transmit the ECSA E1-226V genotype with the same efficiency as La Réunion mosquitoes, highlighting that genetic differentiation among these two populations may have impacted their vector competence. Our results are in agreement with this hypothesis: Congo and La Réunion belong to two well differentiated lineages 
 <italic>K</italic>5 and 
 <italic>K</italic>2, respectively, with Congo having half the ECSA E1-226V transmission efficiency when compared to the La Réunion 
 <italic>K</italic>2 lineage.
