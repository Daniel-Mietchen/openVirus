<p id="Par22">In the Mediterranean area, no CHIKV Asian genotype has been related to autochthonous transmission despite the intense influx of travellers returning from Southeast Asia and the Americas. It has been shown that exposure of European 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to low temperatures (20 °C) significantly increased the extrinsic incubation period and reduced the transmission efficiency of Asian CHIKV strains, while for strains from ECSA lineages these parameters remained unaffected

 </sup>. Although other factors influencing vectorial capacity may interact and determine that an infectious bite is received by a susceptible human host

 </sup>, these results firstly highlight the importance of three-way interactions between temperature, the mosquito population and the viral genotype. Secondly, they suggest a higher risk for ECSA strains to emerge in Europe. In addition, the presence in this old-colonized area of different 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> lineages that are highly competent for ECSA genotypes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), coupled to a growing number of imported cases

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. In all these autochthonous transmissions, the strains involved belonged exclusively to the ECSA lineage, which supports the CHIKV emergence hypothesis enounced above. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> genomes in the Mediterranean region has resulted in a patchwork of populations displaying different levels of competence which makes risk assessment for CHIKV highly unpredictable at a finer scale in the area
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. Beyond vector competence, context-specific differences in parameters with greater impact on vectorial capacity (i.e. longevity, density, host feeding preference)

 </sup> may challenge risk prediction for arboviruses and should be taken into account in further studies.
