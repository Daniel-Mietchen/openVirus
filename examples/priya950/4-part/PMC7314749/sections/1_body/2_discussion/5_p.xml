<p id="Par21">If we consider the historical dynamics of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> expansion and the temporal and spatial history of CHIKV evolution and spread, it appears that they are bound by convergent adaptive evolution

 </sup>. Indeed, the historical sequential divergence and admixture of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> lineages out of Southeast Asia determined changes in the level of populations’ competence for CHIKV, thus facilitating the establishment of CHIKV transmission cycles in new regions. All the mosquitoes from the genetic lineages examined were able to disseminate the Asian and ECSA E1-226V CHIKV genotypes, better than ECSA (E1-226A). However, there is a progressive and drastic loss of permissiveness of the mosquito barriers for CHIKV dissemination (i.e. antiviral immune responses at the midgut epithelium) regarding the Asian and ECSA E1-226V genotypes that parallels the historical lineage divergence from the ancestral Asian lineage 
 <italic>K</italic>6 to 
 <italic>K</italic>2, to 
 <italic>K</italic>5 and finally, to the American 
 <italic>K</italic>1 and 
 <italic>K</italic>3 lineages. Indeed, the higher abilities to disseminate CHIKV Asian and ECSA E1-226V genotypes were observed in populations with higher levels of the ancestral 
 <italic>K</italic>6 and 
 <italic>K</italic>5 lineages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), suggesting that the loss or modification of ancestral components in the genome of invading populations resulted in enhanced tissue barriers to CHIKV dissemination in mosquitoes. In contrast to their dissemination efficiency, the lineages displayed reduced transmission efficiency for CHIKV-ASIA genotype with respect to both ECSA genotypes, especially ECSA E1-226V. These results can be explained by the constrained ability of Asian CHIKV strains to adapt to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> due to negative epistatic interactions between the E1 residue 98 (that harbours a threonine in Asian strains; E1-98T) and the E1-226 position
 <sup>

 </sup>. The highest transmission efficiency was displayed by La Réunion 
 <italic>K</italic>2 lineage followed by 
 <italic>K</italic>6 which retains around two-thirds of transmission efficiency. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>K</italic>2 lineage differentiated in La Réunion where the CHIKV E1-226V genotype was identified for the first time in 2005 and established as an adaptive mutation of ECSA lineage for this mosquito

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. ECSA E1-226V, with a valine instead of an alanine at position 226 A of the E1 glycoprotein, significantly increased viral replication in midgut infection and transmission. The association of this mutation with 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> invasiveness impacted CHIKV diffusion in a sort of convergent adaptive evolution between vector populations and viral genomes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, the ECSA E1-226V mutation is thought to have arisen independently in other areas where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is present, supporting this convergent evolution hypothesis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. We have found that the higher the level of the 
 <italic>K</italic>2 lineage in a population is, the higher is its ability to transmit the ECSA E1-226V genotype. After 2007, the ECSA E1-226V genotype was identified in Southeast Asia and quickly spread, supported by the transmission efficiency of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> ancestral lineages (
 <italic>K</italic>6 and 
 <italic>K</italic>5), inducing major chikungunya epidemics
 <sup>

 </sup>. Prior to 2007, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> had never been incriminated in outbreaks involving Asian CHIKV strains, despite the massive presence of the mosquito in this region. These outbreaks were vectored by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> which is also abundant in the area. One plausible reason would be that, as explained above, Asian strains of CHIKV were constrained in their ability to adapt to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> via acquisition of the E1-A226V mutation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. This inability could have facilitated the establishment of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-adapted CHIKV strains that harbour the E1-226V substitution in the region, leading to the ongoing shift from Asian to ECSA E1-A226V genotypes in Southeast Asia
