<p id="Par17">This study provides a picture of the major events which determined, at the macrogeographic level, the demographic history of the adventive populations established in the Indian Ocean island of La RÃ©union, in the Mediterranean area, in the Americas and in Central Africa, as a consequence of the rapid west-oriented invasive processes of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> out of South East Asia starting from the 18th century. We notably found that (1) admixture events had a major role in shaping the genetic makeup of the globally distributed adventive populations, impacting their demographic histories, and (2) the population demographic history impacted their ability to transmit CHIKV. It follows that knowledge of the relationship between demographic history and vector competence is crucial for assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in areas where this mosquito has become established.
