<p id="Par20">Geographic variation in vector competence for different CHIKV genotypes has been observed among 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations, highlighting that distinct barriers to dissemination and to transmission may operate even at small geographic scales depending on the interactions between the vector’s genetic background and the viral genotype

 </sup>. Our data demonstrated that the ability of an 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population to disseminate or transmit the different CHIKV genotypes is strongly associated with their degree of ancestry within a genetic lineage. It follows that if populations from different geographical areas are related by their demographic history notably in terms of ancestry, they will display similar levels of vector competence for a given CHIKV strain. This is true for the La Réunion PROV, STD and the French Mediterranean BL populations in 
 <italic>K</italic>2; the Brazilian Amazonian Manaus and Congo populations in 
 <italic>K</italic>5, and the North and Central American populations in 
 <italic>K</italic>3 (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). On the other hand, this phenomenon generates variation in competence within regions in which different lineages or admixture of lineages coexist, like in the Mediterranean area.
