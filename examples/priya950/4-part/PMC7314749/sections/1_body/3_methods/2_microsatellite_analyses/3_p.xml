 </sup> was genotyped at the following SSR loci: Aealbmic1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 17
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. These loci were chosen due to their high polymorphism and because they are spread across the genome (they map to different scaffolds of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> Foshan genome (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup> and our unpublished data)). They have proven to be efficient markers to detect variability, even in relatively small samples

 </sup>. PCR amplifications and fragment identifications were performed as previously described
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. In order to account for genotyping errors, automated binning of allele lengths was performed with TANDEM v1.09
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup> followed by manual checking. When microsatellite amplification was not successful, or allele scoring was unclear, a new DNA extraction was performed. The generated SSR genotype dataset, in addition to offering continuity with previous studies, allows the formulation of reliable models of recent evolutionary history because of their well‚Äêdocumented mutation rates
