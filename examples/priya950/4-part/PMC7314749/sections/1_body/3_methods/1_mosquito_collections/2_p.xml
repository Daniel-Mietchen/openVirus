 </sup>. The mosquito egg collections in the Americas, La Réunion, France, the North of Italy and in Congo/Central Africa were separated in two batches: one batch was used for population genetic studies and the remaining batch, that gave rise to several hundred individuals, was amplified in the laboratory under controlled conditions to obtain the offspring that was used in vector competence assessments for CHIKV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, the microsatellite genotyping analyses were based on an average of 30 G0 individuals for each population sample, while vector competence assays were performed on the corresponding G1 mosquito populations, with the exception of Brazaville (G2) and Cesena (G3).
