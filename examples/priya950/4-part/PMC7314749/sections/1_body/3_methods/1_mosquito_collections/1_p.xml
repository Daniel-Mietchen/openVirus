<p id="Par26">Twenty-five mosquito populations were considered. Three were from the ancestral East Asian area and 22 were sampled across much of the expansion area: La Réunion in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean basin, Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, North, Central and South America, and Central Africa (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The samples from Southeast Asia (Japan, China, Thailand), La Réunion (St Pierre), the Mediterranean basin (Albania, Greece, Italy1, Italy2), Hawaii and North America (Virginia) were previously described by our laboratory in terms of microsatellite allele frequencies, genetic structure and demographic history

 </sup>. Their integration in this analysis aimed at obtaining a deeper genetic portrait of the demographic history of this species during its invasion process. For the 25 collection sites, samples were collected as eggs at the peak of density to avoid any seasonality effects due to the presence of diapause or pre-diapause periods

 </sup>, a standardized sampling protocol was adopted to minimize inbreeding effects at each breeding site. In each locality, 15–17 ovitraps were placed at a distance of least 500 m one to another, and at least 40 eggs/ovitrap were obtained.
