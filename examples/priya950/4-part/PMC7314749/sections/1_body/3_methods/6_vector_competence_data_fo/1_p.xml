<p id="Par38">Vector competence for CHIKV was assessed on adults derived from field-collected eggs from the Americas, La Réunion Island, France, North Italy and Congo as described above (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Batches of 5–7-day-old females were mono-infected using an artificial feeding system (Hemotek Ltd®, Blackburn, UK) with low passaged CHIKV strains (2–3 passages) belonging to either East-Central-South African genotype (ECSA) or the Asian genotype (see section Viral Strains for more details). Fully engorged females were kept for further estimation of DE, TE and their saliva was collected at the selected days post-infection (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) as described by Vega-Rúa and collegues
