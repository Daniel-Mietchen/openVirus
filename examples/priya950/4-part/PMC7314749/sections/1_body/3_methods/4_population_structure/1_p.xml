<p id="Par32">The structure and degree of ancestry in the 25 population samples were inferred using the Bayesian clustering analysis implemented in STRUCTURE V 2.3.2 under the admixture model and assuming independent allele frequencies. The “burn-in” phase was set to 500,000 iterations, then 1,000,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replications were considered. For each number of possible clusters (
 <italic>K</italic>), 20 independent runs were repeated. The cluster (
 <italic>K</italic>) interval was set between 1 and 25 (i.e. the number of considered populations).
