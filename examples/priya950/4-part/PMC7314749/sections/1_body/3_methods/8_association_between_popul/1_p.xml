<p id="Par40">The effect of viral genotype, dpi, and population ancestry on DE and TE were investigated using logistic regression models. In case of complete prediction of the outcome in one category, a penalized likelihood estimation was considered

 </sup>. For TE, only mosquitoes that had disseminated CHIKV infections were considered. The Odds Ratio (OR) has been considered as a measure of the risk of CHIKV dissemination and transmission. The main factor of interest was the degree of ancestry among populations (
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry) and two approaches were used. First, each geographical population is defined by its major 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Second, all 6 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry components were considered but dichotomised as above or below the threshold of 0.25; this threshold was deliberately chosen so that some populations could be characterized by a mixture of several 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestors. For both dissemination and transmission, factors that presented 
 <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 in univariate analysis were introduced in multivariate models. Two multivariate models were considered using either the major 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry or the binary 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry factors.
