 </sup>, uncertainty regarding the duration of the bottleneck was taken into account. Therefore, we assumed a bottleneck period with a uniform prior distribution bounded between 0 and 50 generations. During colonization, the number of founder individuals for each colonization event was described as 
 <italic>NF</italic> and its size was drawn from a uniform distribution bounded between 1 and 100 individuals. If necessary, the rate of admixture between two populations was drawn in a uniform distribution and set from 0.001 to 0.999. For the genetic parameters, the microsatellite Generalized Stepwise Mutation model was considered, and a mean microsatellite mutation rate across loci was set between 10
 <sup>−5</sup> and 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. The parameter of geometric distribution was specified with a uniform prior distribution bounded between 0.1–0.3. For each locus, the above considered mutation parameters were allowed to vary using Gamma distributions. Finally, the possibility of single nucleotide insertion/deletion mutations were considered with a mean frequency of 10
