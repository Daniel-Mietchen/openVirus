<p id="Par35">Several competing invasion scenarios were considered taking into account the available historical information regarding the first records in invaded countries and population genetic data. The posterior probability for each scenario was computed. The competing scenarios were set using prior definitions and distribution of demographic parameters, as described in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>. For some of these analyses, we referred to and reran the scenarios that we had previously validated

 </sup>. We took into account the effective population size, the time range in which split or admixure events occurred, the number of founders that contributed to the establishment of adventive populations, the duration of the eventual bottlenecks occurring during colonization and the rate of admixture, if considered

 </sup>. When no prior information was available, the prior parameters were kept deliberately broad. For the effective population sizes, broad priors [500–100,000] with uniform distributions were chosen for all the populations. For each event, the time range chosen was less broad if it was supported by historical data. The timing of events was expressed in numbers of generations back in time. Considering that the number of generations/year is dependent on bioclimatic conditions, we assumed around 4–7 generations/year in temperate regions, and 12–17 generations/year in tropical regions. In the cases where the climate situation is not so clear-cut, the broadest interval was considered (i.e. 4–17 generations/year).
