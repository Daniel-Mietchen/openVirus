<p id="Par4">The identification of the main dispersal routes of this mosquito vector can help in mitigating its spread and preventing/reducing the risks of arboviral outbreaks as once a vector is introduced, autochthonous transmission of its associated arboviruses may rapidly follow. But this implies knowledge of the demographic history of invading populations, their degree of connectivity and their vectorial capacities

 </sup>. Several genetic, ecological and behavioural studies were performed to unravel different aspects of the invasion process and to infer the degree of genetic connectivity among populations at the micro- and macro-geographic levels

 </sup>. However, vector competence for CHIKV has been found to be highly variable within and between populations, with transmission efficiencies that are strictly dependent on specific combinations of mosquito genome, viral genetic characteristics and temperature in a genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interaction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. On this basis, we previously proposed that admixture events and dynamics of different genetic backgrounds during the invasion process of this mosquito may have impacted competence for CHIKV in adventive populations

 </sup>. In this study, we tested this hypothesis. We first provided a picture of the major events that determined, at the macrogeographic level, the demographic history of the adventive populations out of Southeast Asia starting from the 18th century. Secondly, we notably found that the population demographic history impacted their vector competence for CHIKV. We have demonstrated that the demographic history of populations was tightly related to CHIKV genotypes in a sort of adaptive coevolution, where genotype-by-genotype interactions influenced the corresponding
