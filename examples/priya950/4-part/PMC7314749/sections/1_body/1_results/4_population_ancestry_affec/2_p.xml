<p id="Par14">A total of 1290 mosquitoes were considered in the dissemination analysis of which 1120 (86.8%) showed disseminated infection. CHIKV genotypes, dpi and blood titre were significantly associated with DE in univariate analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When populations were grouped according to their major 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry (as listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), DE significantly differed according to 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry in univariate analysis (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This remained true after adjusting on CHIKV genotypes, dpi and blood meal titre (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As compared to mosquitoes with main 
 <italic>K</italic>3-ancestry (North and Central America: OR = 1), those with major 
 <italic>K</italic>6 (IT1, Italy), 
 <italic>K</italic>2 (BL-France), 
 <italic>K</italic>5 (Brazilian MAN and CONG1) and 
 <italic>K</italic>1 (South America) ancestries showed significantly higher dissemination efficiencies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Dissemination of CHIKV strains from Asian genotype (CHIKV-ASIA) and, to a lesser degree, those of CHIKV ECSA 226 V strains significantly decreased across the 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry lineages: from 
 <italic>K</italic>6 (IT1, Italy) to the derived 
 <italic>K</italic>2 (BL, France), to 
 <italic>K</italic>5 (Manaus, Congo) to 
 <italic>K</italic>1 (South America) and 
 <italic>K</italic>3 (North and Central America) which displayed similar efficiencies. Another approach consisted in introducing all 6 
 <italic>K-</italic>ancestries when dichotomised. In univariate analysis, levels of 
 <italic>K</italic>1, 
 <italic>K</italic>5 and 
 <italic>K</italic>6-ancestries &gt;0.25 were significantly associated with DE. It appeared that these three dichotomised factors defined only four distinct population profiles (low 
 <italic>K</italic>1, 
 <italic>K</italic>5 and 
 <italic>K</italic>6-ancestries, high 
 <italic>K</italic>1-ancestry only, high 
 <italic>K</italic>5-ancestry only and high 
 <italic>K</italic>6-ancestry only); to simplify model interpretation, a new variable was defined allowing comparison of these 4 populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). After adjusting for CHIKV genotype, dpi and blood meal titre, as compared to the populations with lower 
 <italic>K</italic>5 and 
 <italic>K</italic>6-ancestries, those with higher 
 <italic>K</italic>5 or 
 <italic>K</italic>6 presented higher DE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Both multivariate models showed a tendency for DE to decrease from populations with major 
 <italic>K</italic>6-ancestry to major 
 <italic>K</italic>5-ancestry and finally to the other populations.
