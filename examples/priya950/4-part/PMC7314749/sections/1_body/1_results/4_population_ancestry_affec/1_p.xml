<p id="Par13">Based on the above results, we selected 13 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations for which vector competence data obtained from experimental CHIKV infections were available (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) to explore whether, and to what extent, the degree of ancestry detected among the populations impacted their dissemination efficiency (DE) and transmission efficiency (TE) for CHIKV. DE and TE respectively refer to the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious viral particles in the head and in the saliva among the number of mosquitoes tested.
