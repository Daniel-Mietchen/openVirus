<p id="Par6">Six clusters/lineages represent the most parsimonious partitioning of the ancestry among individuals from the 25 populations (
 <italic>K</italic>1–
 <italic>K</italic>6 in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) displaying a clear geographic distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The genomes from the ancestral Asian populations, China and Japan, were distributed differently across clusters, but display the highest ancestry in 
 <italic>K</italic>6. The other Asian population, Thailand, was fragmented mainly between 
 <italic>K</italic>4 (55%) and 
 <italic>K</italic>6 (24%). The ancestry heterogeneity of La Réunion and Mediterranean populations was obvious. The La Réunion mosquitoes from the southwest coast (RE) were mainly structured between 
 <italic>K</italic>6 and 
 <italic>K</italic>4 together with the majority of Mediterranean samples. By contrast, the two La Réunion populations from the north-eastern part (PROV and STD) were clustered with the French Mediterranean sample (BL) in 
 <italic>K</italic>2. Hawaii was also fragmented between 
 <italic>K</italic>6 and 
 <italic>K</italic>4. North America appeared as a transition area in which populations such as Virginia (VA) still maintained membership in the two Asian clusters 
 <italic>K</italic>4 (63%) and 
 <italic>K</italic>6 (23%), while others such as Florida (VRB) and Missouri (TYS) exhibited ancestry profiles that transitioned to those typical of Central America (
 <italic>K</italic>3) and South America (
 <italic>K</italic>1). The Brazilian Amazonian (MAN) was fragmented across 
 <italic>K</italic>1 (24%), 
 <italic>K</italic>3 (17%) and notably the Southeast Asian 
 <italic>K</italic>5 (45%). It is noteworthy that high percentages of 
 <italic>K</italic>5 outside of Asia were recovered only in Manaus and in Congo, Africa (79%).
