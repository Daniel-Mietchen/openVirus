<p id="Par10">The analysis of this area was considered before that of Central America, where the documented presence of this mosquito was more recent (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The tested hypothesis (analyses 3a–d, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>) was whether the demographic histories of South American populations were related to those of North America, considering the concomitant historical presence of the species. Indeed, the most probable hypothesis indicated that the Brazilian coastal Parnamirim population (PNM) originated from Florida (VRB). Subsequent admixture events between Florida (VRB) and Parnamirim (PNM) (58% and 42% respectively) gave origin to the Rio de Janeiro state/Jurujuba (JRB) population. Among the Brazilian populations, the Amazonas State sample from Manaus (MAN) appeared to be the most differentiated. Its most likely origin (analysis 3d) was an admixture event between VRB-Florida and JP (52% and 48%, respectively). In Argentina, the mosquito has been recorded in Misiones Province near the border with Brazil. Thus, we tested whether the Misiones sample (MIA) was also a derivation from the Brazilian and/or Florida populations. The Argentinian mosquitoes appear to have originated as a split from the Brazilian JRB population (analysis 3c, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
