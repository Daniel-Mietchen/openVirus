 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were compared to acquire a macro geographic picture of the demographic history of invasive populations out of the Southeast Asian home range to La Réunion, to Mediterranean Basin, to Americas and Africa.
