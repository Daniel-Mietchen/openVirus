<p id="Par11">The relatively recent demographic histories of the populations Tapachula in Mexico (MXC) and Colòn in Panama (PAN) were considered under the hypothesis of a North American and/or a Brazilian derivation (analyses 4a, b, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). The most likely origin of MXC was a split from Florida-VRB. Regarding PAN, the most statistically supported scenario suggests that it originated from an admixture between VRB in Florida and Brazilian PNM.
