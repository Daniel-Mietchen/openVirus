<p id="Par5">AMOVA analyses of molecular variance across mosquitoes from 25 localities spanning from Asia to Mediterranean area, the Americas and Central Africa (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), indicated that 83% of variance occurred within populations, while only 11% and 6% were detected between populations and regions, respectively. The highest level of within-population variability was detected in the ancestral Southeast Asia region, where China displays the highest number of alleles and private alleles/individual. Outside this area, the adventive populations displayed different degrees of variability erosion (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). No signs of isolation by distance (IBD) were detected globally (
 <italic>y</italic> = 1e−06× + 0.0805; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.015) nor within regions (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.023 in South America, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.15 in the Mediterranean area). Moreover, the population differentiation has been found to be heterogeneous not only between but also within geographical regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The most homogeneous area, in terms of non-significant or very low 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> values, was the ancestral Southeast Asia (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> 0.014 – 0.069), which maintains low levels of differentiation with La Réunion and the Mediterranean Basin (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> 0.041 – 0.140), and with North America (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> 0.056 – 0.124). The Mediterranean area appears to be heterogeneous (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> 0.081 – 0.186). Within North America, Florida (VRB) was the least differentiated population (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> 0.065 − 0.070), sharing connectivity with the populations from Asia, La Réunion, and the Mediterranean area. It was the only population that maintained genetic connectivity with Central and South America. These latter two regions were the most heterogeneous based on 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> values. The Brazilian and Argentinian populations had no genetic affinities with those from Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean area or North America, with the exception of Manaus (MAN) in the Brazilian State of Amazonas that, in turn, maintained low levels of genetic differentiation with the populations from Congo in Africa.
