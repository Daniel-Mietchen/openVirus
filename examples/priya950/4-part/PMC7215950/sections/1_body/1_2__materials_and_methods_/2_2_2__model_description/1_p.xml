<p>A SEIR-ward model has been used by researchers for infectious disease modeling spread of coronavirus [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-02936" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The model uses the key epidemiological features from the MERS-CoV outbreak in KAMC-R that occurred in summer 2015 focusing on human-to-human and environment-to-human transmission in the hospital setting [

The nature of the model is important to consider as many large hospital infectious disease outbreaks, like the Saudi Arabiaâ€™s MERS-CoV outbreak, often show low disease incidence due to the limited number of individuals (patients and health care workers) in the hospital during outbreak events.
