 </inline-formula>, which we still call environmental transmission rates for brevity, are the transmission rates multiplied by the virus shedding rate into the environment. Getting infected through the environment is, in essence, a consequence of a delayed transmission from other exposed and infected patients, HCWs, and mobile HCWs. While the model is introduced in its general form, we identified 20 parameters that can be estimated from the epidemic data while the rest are found in the literature or estimated from an independent data provided by KAMC if they are not related to the epidemic, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-17-02936">Tables S1–S3 in the Supplementary Materials</xref>. The data size over the 102 days in the four units is relatively larger than the number of parameters in the different units.
