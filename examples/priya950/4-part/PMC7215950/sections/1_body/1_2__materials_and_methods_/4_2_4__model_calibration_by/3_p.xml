<p>The number of beds and HCWs working in the hospital, transitions of patients between the wards, as well as the number of infected individuals and times of their diagnosis were used. The parameters’ values were then estimated using the method of ordinary least squares (OLS) with the objective function given by the sum of squares of difference between the actual proportion of infected patients and the numerical solution of the system of ordinary differential equations, (ODEs). The system of ODEs was solved using Runge–Kutta methods of hybrid order 4 and 5 in MatLab. The OLS was coded in MatLab and the initial values of the optimization algorithm were found using the smallest sums of squares of errors for different random samples from the parameters space performed using the method of Latin-hypercube. The optimization was run from different initial values to make sure of a global optimal solution was reached. The uncertainty in the parameter estimates were estimated using the sensitivity matrices of the curves to the parameter values [
