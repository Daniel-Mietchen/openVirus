<p>Further, while MERS-CoV is known and prepared for in the Middle East, as was demonstrated by KAMC-R, air travel may spread the virus to other countries not as familiar with or prepared to deal with MERS-CoV in their hospital systems. This was the case in South Koreaâ€™s MERS-CoV outbreak with the delayed recognition and diagnosis of the disease, along with a prolonged exposure to other patients prior to admittance of the index case into isolation [

Factors such as long-stays in the ED and high mobility of infected patients due to lack of early recognition and diagnosis of the virus contributed to the healthcare acquired infections spread and transmission between gulf cities. Finally, preventative care for the virus remains rudimentary with lack of an efficacious vaccine. The development of preventative care for both humans and dromedary camels as a community vector could potentially decrease or eradicate infections (see
