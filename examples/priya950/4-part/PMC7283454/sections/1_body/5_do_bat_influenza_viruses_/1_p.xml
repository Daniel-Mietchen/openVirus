<p>Reassortment of gene segments between co-infecting viruses is a key process mediating the genetic evolution of influenza viruses and the generation of novel epidemic and pandemic strains. BatIVs are able to reassort between themselves but not with conventional IAVs

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Generation of bat chimeric viruses was only possible when the HA/NA coding regions were flanked with the authentic BatIV packaging signals demonstrating packaging incompatibilities between IAVs and BatIVs (Juozapaitis et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This finding dismisses the scenario of emergence of a new “reassortant” virus with human/avian IAVs unless the bat viruses undergo major genetic changes over time.
