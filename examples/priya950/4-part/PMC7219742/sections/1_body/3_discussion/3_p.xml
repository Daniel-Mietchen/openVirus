 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the main vector of arboviruses in the Pacific region, was not found in the islands of Futuna and Alofi. It was however sampled in four sites on Wallis. The presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> on Wallis was already reported during the last two entomological surveys in 2003 and 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At that time, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was sampled in a single garden in the vicinity of the wharf of the Mata'Utu locality, and no expansion of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> distribution was observed in the territory a few years later in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our study now shows an expansion of the range of this 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species to the localities of Akaâ€™aka and Lano to the North (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008250.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in used tires at the Valeipo garbage dump station, 5 km apart, might arise from the same initial site or from another source of introduction on the island. Although it is still much less abundant than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is therefore well established on Wallis. Entomological monitoring of these sites, with active search for immature stages and adults, and destruction of breeding sites is recommended in order to control the spread of this species to other localities on the island, or to other 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> free islands, like Futuna and Alofi.
