<p>Five to seven day-old females (F3) were fed with independent infectious blood meals containing CHIKV at a titer of 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml. The CHIKV strain, isolated in 2011 from a patient in New Caledonia (NC/2011-568) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], belongs to the Asian genotype and harbors an alanine at position 226 in the E1 envelope glycoprotein (GenBank HE806461) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The infectious blood meal was composed of a virus suspension (1:3) and washed rabbit erythrocytes obtained directly from a rabbit (New Zealand white rabbit, Charles River) (2:3) supplemented with 5 mM adenosine triphosphate. The female mosquitoes were allowed to take the infectious blood meal through a capsule (Hemotek system) covered by a pig intestine casing (obtained from a commercially purchased pig intestine) as membrane. After the blood meal, fully engorged females were transferred to new containers and maintained at 28Â°C, 80% humidity, under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle and fed with a 10% sucrose solution in free access.
