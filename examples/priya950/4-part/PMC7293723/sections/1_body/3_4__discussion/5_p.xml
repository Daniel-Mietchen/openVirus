<p>Despite limitations, our study has detected the presence of various LPAI, a new strain H5N6 HPAI, and potential risks of these strain recombinants in the bordering area. These findings suggested that HPAI is being spread silently across geographical areas. Because LBMs in Vietnam are formed as a traditional culture and could not be banned, intervention programs to improve the biosecurity measures applied in LBM are important. Further studies should be focused on the genetic characteristics of circulating avian influenza strains in these LBMs.</p>
