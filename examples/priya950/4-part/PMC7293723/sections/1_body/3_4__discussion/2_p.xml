<p>Study results suggested that the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was more common than the presence of high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the study site. After isolation, we found 15 duck samples with subtypes of H3N6 and H6N6 and two chicken samples with the H9N2 subtype. A previous study reported that LPAI viruses were diverse among ducks in different live bird markets across Vietnam, which may be due to domestic trade [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A study in four border provinces in Cambodia also reported that the A/H9 subtype was common in chicken in LBM in this country [

Although LPAI was predominant among samples, the common occurrence of the H6N6 strain from duck swab samples is considered as a potential risk of AIV/H5N6 virus reassortant. Previous studies in Lao PDR and China reported that the new H5N6 HPAI virus was reassortment of H5N1 and H6N6 virus [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Besides, the detection of different strains of the virus in a poultry body suggested the risks of gene recombination among influenza viruses. In this study, we found four among 14 duck cloacal swabs with two subtypes of H3N6 and H6N6.
