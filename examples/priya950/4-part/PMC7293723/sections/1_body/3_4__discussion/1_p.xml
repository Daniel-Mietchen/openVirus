<p>Although the national surveillance program for avian influenza has been applied widely across the country, it has not reached mountainous and less populated areas [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In rural and mountainous areas of Vietnam, domestic poultry is mainly raised in households in a free-range manner. Poultry is transported to LBMs by their owners or poultry sellers. Therefore, LBMs provide a favorable environment for the spreading of influenza virus within the poultry population. Our study is the first study in Vietnam conducted at a bordering district to examine the presence of the poultry influenza strain at LBMs. Findings showed that the presence of the avian influenza virus in the Khe Sanh market was significant, while the avian influenza virus in the Lao Báº£o market was not detected. The prevalence of AIV among healthy chicken and duck samples was 27.5% and 24.8%, respectively. This number is slightly higher than the national rate in one previous study, which reported a prevalence of 22.1% influenza virus A positive among 9790 pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from chicken and duck in live bird markets in 44 provinces throughout Vietnam during 2011-2013 [

A recent study in four border provinces in Cambodia reported that they found that 20.0% of chicken samples and 32.6% of duck samples in domestic markets were positive with AIV by RT-PCR [
