<p>At the Vietnam National Centre for Veterinary Diagnostics, the samples were tested for the presence of influenza type A viruses (M gene detection) using a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) method. The threshold cycle applied to determine a positive sample was Ct ≤ 35. At this step, samples having M gene were examined with H5 HA primer/probe pairs. Then, samples having H5 were tested for the N1 and N6 neuraminidase (NA). Next, all positive samples having a threshold cycle Ct ≤ 28 were isolated through the infusion method in embryonated chicken eggs. Samples were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and harvested after 72 hours. Eggs were provided by a commercial hatchery and certified as influenza virus-free since 2003. Allantoic fluids were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C, and the presence of the virus was determined by the hemagglutination test (HA test). After isolation, the subtypes of the avian influenza virus were identified by RT-PCR with the specific primers for H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, and H9 and N1, N2, N3, N5, N6, N7, N8, and N9. Genes of influenza virus samples positive with H5 were sequenced to identify H and N clades of the influenza virus.</p>
