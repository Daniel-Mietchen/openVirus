<p>Avian influenza viruses are generally species-specific and are primarily pathogenic to poultry. They are widely distributed geographically but rarely cross the species barrier to infect humans and other mammals. However, influenza viruses have fragmented genomes that allow them to be significantly and rapidly altered through the mechanism of drift and exchange of antigens [
