<p>Spinal MRI was performed for all 18 patients and 17 patients underwent brain MRI within 7 days after admission. Consistent with previous reports (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was observed in spinal gray matter in confirmed AFM cases. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 11/18 patients had spinal gray matter abnormalities, mainly with anterior horn involvement. Longitudinal cord lesions spanning a median of 4 vertebral levels (range, 2–13) were observed in all confirmed AFM cases, and the cervical spine was the most often affected region (9/11). Brainstem lesions were found in three (17.6%) cases involving focal lesions in the pons (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), medulla oblongata (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), and one (5.9%) had abnormalities in cortical gray matter (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1). Five of 11 confirmed AFM cases were EV-D68 positive, the length of spinal lesion of EV-D68-positive patients was spanning a median of 3 spinal segments (range, 2–5 spinal segments), and EV-D68 negative patients were spanning a median of 7 spinal segments (range, 3–13 spinal segments); however, there is no difference of spinal lesion between EV-D68-positive cases and -negative cases (
