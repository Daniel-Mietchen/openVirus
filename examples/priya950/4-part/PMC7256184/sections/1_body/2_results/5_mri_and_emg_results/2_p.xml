<p>EMG and nerve conduction velocity assessments were conducted in 17/18 patients at a median of 10 days (range, 4–15 days) after onset of neurological symptoms. In 17/18 patients at a median of 10 days (range, 4–15 days) after onset of neurological symptoms. Of the 17 patients, 9 had diminished compound muscle action potential, 14 had self-generated muscle action potential, 4 had prolonged nerve conduction velocity accompanied by self-generated muscle action potential and diminished compound muscle action potential in the acute phase, and none had sensory nerve conduction abnormalities or abnormal F-waves. Thus, unlike in Guillain–Barré syndrome, there were no sensory EMG abnormalities in any of the AFM patients (
