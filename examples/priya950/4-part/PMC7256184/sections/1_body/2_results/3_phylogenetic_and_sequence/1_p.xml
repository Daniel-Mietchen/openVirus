<p>A phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region of EV-D68 genomes was conducted, which involved 59 VP1 sequences, including nine obtained from the EV-D68-positive patients in this study. The results suggested that all nine strains detected in this study belonged to subclade B3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The nine VP1 sequences detected in this study had nucleotide identities with each other of 98–100%; the VP1 sequence of the strain designated “18-128” had the lowest nucleotide identity (98%).
