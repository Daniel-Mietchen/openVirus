<p>We did not detect EV-D68 in the CSF or whole blood specimens from the nine EV-D68-positive patients. Previous studies have determined that CSF detection rates for known neurotropic EVs (such as polioviruses and EV-A71) are as low as 0–5% (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In addition, the delayed collection of clinical specimens relative to symptom onset (2–19 days) may have led to actual low viral loads or RNA degradation, thus resulting in insufficient EV-D68 RNA levels for detection (
