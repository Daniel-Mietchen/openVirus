<p>Total DNA/RNA was extracted from 200 μl of clinical specimens using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time (RT)-PCR or PCR assay panels (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) assay, and the FilmArray Meningitis-Encephalitis (ME) Panel (BioFire Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) were used to detect and assess the titers of the following viruses: human enterovirus (HEV); human rhinovirus (HRV); influenza virus A and B (including subtype determination); human adenovirus; human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) types 1–4; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B; human coronavirus (hCoV)-OC43,−229E, -NL63, and -HKU1; human metapneumovirus (hMPV); measles virus; mumps virus; herpes simplex virus; and West Nile virus. Additionally, for EV detection, the extracted samples were amplified and sequenced using RT-PCR, with primers targeting the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). EV-positive samples were subjected to confirmatory EV-D68 assessment by RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and the VP1 of EV-D68 strains detected from the clinical specimens were amplified and sequenced using the primers and the strategy as described previously (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The sequences were assembled using Sequencer software version 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and aligned with MEGA version 5.
