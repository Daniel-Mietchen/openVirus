<p>In 2014, an outbreak of EV-D68 infection, an emerging infectious disease, was determined to be associated with a cluster of AFP cases in children in Colorado, USA (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), with subsequent cases being reported in a number of other countries (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several large outbreaks of EV-D68 were associated temporally and geographically with AFM outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Application of the Bradford Hill criteria (for establishing causal relationships) indicated that EV-D68 causes AFM (
