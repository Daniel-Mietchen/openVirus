   <sup>−/-</sup> mice. Mice were passively administered (i.p.) with 20 µl anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum [‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6], 200 µl anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum [‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4], or 200 µl mock-immune serum [‘Mock immune (200 µl)’ group, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4] and challenged i.d. with ZIKV MR766 (10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU/mouse). A fourth group of mice, which received neither passive serum transfer nor the challenge virus (‘Un-infected’ group) was included for comparison. Mice were bled on day 4 post-challenge for ZIKV RNA determination. All mice were monitored for the criteria listed for up to 15 days. (b) Blood plasma viral RNA levels (ZIKV genome copies/ml plasma) in ZIKV MR766-challenged mice, determined by q-RTPCR on day 4 post-challenge as described (
   <italic>Methods S1</italic>). The different groups are designated by the following symbols: empty purple squares, ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group; solid purple squares, ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group; and solid grey squares, ‘Mock immune (200 µl)’ group. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation. The twin star symbol denotes significant difference between viremia in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group, compared to either the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0044) or the ‘Mock immune (200 µl)’ group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0017), based on unpaired 
   <italic>t-</italic>test with Welch's correction. (c) Kaplan–Meier survival curves of the different mice groups described in ‘a’. Survival of mice in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group was significantly higher than that in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0074) and ‘Mock-immune (200 µl)’ group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.010), but comparable to that in the ‘Un-infected’ group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0888), based on the Log-Rank (Mantel–Cox) test. (d) Clinical progression (using a slightly modified scoring system described earlier 
   <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>) of the same mice groups in ‘c’. (e) Body weight loss profiles of the same groups of mice during the course of the experiment. In panels ‘c-e’ the different mouse groups are indicated by: dashed purple curve, ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group; solid purple curve, ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group; solid grey curve, ‘Mock immune (200 µl)’ group; and sold brown curve, ‘Un-infected’ group.
