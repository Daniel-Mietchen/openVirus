   <bold>Depletion of EDIII-specific antibodies from anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum is accompanied by reduction in ZIKV nAb titres.</bold> (a) Pooled serum (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) collected on day 170 from BALB/c mice immunised with 4 doses of ZIKV-80E NPs (on days 0, 14, 28, and 160) was analysed for ZIKV EDIII-specific antibody titres by indirect ELISA using MBP-ZIKV EDIII as the coating antigen. The pooled serum was tested either before (solid curve) or after depletion on amylose resin-bound MBP protein (dotted curve) or MBP-ZIKV EDIII (dashed curve). Data are plotted as ELISA reactivity, in terms of absorbance at 450 nm (
   <italic>A</italic>
   <sub>450</sub>), as a function of serum dilution. Each data point represents the average of duplicates. The ELISA titration curves shown depict one of two independent experiments. (b) The pooled serum described in panel ‘a’ was assayed for ZIKV nAb titres either before (solid curve) or after (dashed curve) depletion on amylose resin-bound MBP-ZIKV EDIII using ZIKV RVP neutralisation assay. Note that in this experiment, MBP-depleted serum was omitted as its total IgG titres did not change significantly after MBP depletion, as shown in panel ‘a’ (dotted curve). The data are represented as percent infection (in terms of 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity of ZIKV RVPs) as a function of immune serum dilution, with luciferase activity of ZIKV RVP in absence of immune serum taken to represent 100% infection. The dashed horizontal line denotes 50% inhibition of ZIKV reporter activity.
