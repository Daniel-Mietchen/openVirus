<p id="para0043">ADE can also ensue when neutralising antibodies are diluted down to sub-neutralising levels 
 <xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. What if the ZIKV nAb titres were to wane to sub-neutralising level? Would it result in homotypic ADE of ZIKV infection? Thus, a final question we addressed was whether the polyclonal antibody repertoire induced by ZIKV-80E NPs could potentially cause enhancement of ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo,</italic> under conditions of sub-neutralising nAb levels. To this end, we used C57BL/6 
 <italic>Stat2</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse model, in conjunction with ZIKV strain PRVABC59. Infection with this ZIKV strain, which is least pathogenic to this model, can be escalated to severe disease, in the presence of DENV immune serum, marked by significant weight loss, enhanced clinical symptoms and rapid mortality
