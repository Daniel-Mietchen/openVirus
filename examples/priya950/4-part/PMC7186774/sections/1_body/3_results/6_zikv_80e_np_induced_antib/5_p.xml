<p id="para0044">To test for possible homotypic ADE of ZIKV, we injected (i.p.) anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum (mouse α-ZIKV-80E) into 
 <italic>Stat2</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (to result in sub-neutralising circulating nAb titres, with expected NT
 <sub>50</sub> &lt;10) and challenged them 2 h later with ZIKV strain PRVABC59, administered i.d. For comparison, groups of mice which received i.p. injections of naïve mouse serum (NMS), DENV-positive human plasma (human α-DENV) and DENV-negative human plasma (Dengue-naïve human plasma), were also similarly challenged. These were monitored for survival, clinical symptoms and weight loss. The data are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. As expected, mice which received DENV-positive human plasma, but not those which received DENV-naïve human plasma, displayed severe clinical symptoms and weight loss, succumbing by day 8 post ZIKV challenge. On the other hand, survival of mice which had received anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum was ∼80%, manifesting similar symptoms and weight-loss profile, but recovering at the end of the experiment, as mice in the groups which received NMS or naïve human plasma, prior to challenge. A careful look at the data would seem to suggest that, despite a clear survival difference (
 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a), administration of DENV-positive human plasma and mouse anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum may drive an ‘early weight loss phenotype’ (days 3 and 4) in 
 <italic>Stat2</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (
 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>c), although no statistically significant difference was observed. Overall, the data lead to the conclusion that antibodies elicited by ZIKV-80E NPs, at sub-neutralising levels, may not be capable of enhancing ZIKV infection. However, it is to be noted that the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the FcR pathway, in the context of ZIKV infection is unknown at this time.
