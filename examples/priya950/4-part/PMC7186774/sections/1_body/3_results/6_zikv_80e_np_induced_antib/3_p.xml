<p id="para0042">That anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibodies did not enhance DENV infection is notable. How relevant are the data on ADE obtained with K562 cells to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situation? To address this, we used the interferon α/β and γ receptor double knock-out DENV-sensitive AG129 mouse-based ADE model (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>e). This mouse can sustain a sub-lethal DENV-2 S221 infection without succumbing to it. But in the presence of an enhancing antibody, the sub-lethal infection escalates to a lethal infection [

 <xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. When these mice were injected with immune complexes (ICs) generated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by pre-incubating a sub-lethal dose of the challenge strain DENV-2 S221, either with mAb 4G2 (4G2 group) or murine polyclonal anti-DENV-2 antiserum (α-DENV-2 group), there was 100% mortality by day 5 post-challenge, in contrast to control mice which received the same sub-lethal dose of DENV-2 S221, but which had been pre-incubated with naive mouse serum (NMS group) (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>f). It is noteworthy that in both these types of ICs (4G2 and α-DENV-2 groups), DENV-2 S221 was 100% neutralised, in terms of its ability to infect Vero cells. However, ICs generated by pre-incubating the sub-lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 with anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum (α-ZIKV-80E group) were largely non-lethal to the mice, with overall survival (∼70%) comparable to that of mice challenged with just the non-lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 (NMS group). This survival was despite the inability of the anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum to neutralise DENV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We interpret this as clear evidence of lack of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> ADE of DENV-2 by polyclonal antibodies elicited by ZIKV-80E NPs. Survival of mice in the α-ZIKV-80E group was not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5282) from that of the NMS group, but significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0095) than those of the 4G2 group and α-DENV-2 group.
