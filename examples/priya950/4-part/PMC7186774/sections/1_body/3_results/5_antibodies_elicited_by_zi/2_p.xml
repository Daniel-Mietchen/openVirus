<p id="para0040">Can the anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibodies which block ZIKV infectivity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> be effective in countering lethal ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>? To address this question, we used C57BL/6 
 <italic>Stat2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice, which are not only susceptible to ZIKV infection, but also display several key aspects of ZIKV pathogenesis. When challenged with ZIKV MR766 (10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mouse), these mice lose body weight starting on day 3, become morbid, show limited movement and completely succumb by the end of the week 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In this experiment, groups of C57BL/6 
 <italic>Stat2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice were given i.p. injections of immune sera from BALB/c mice and then challenged 2 h later with a lethal dose of ZIKV MR766 strain (10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mouse), and monitored for 15 days (
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). One group of mice received mock-immune serum (200 µl/mouse), while two groups received anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum, with one group receiving 20 µl/mouse [α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl) group] and the other, 200 µl/mouse [α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl) group]. All three groups were challenged at 2 h post serum transfer, as mentioned above. A fourth group comprised of mice which received neither serum transfer nor lethal ZIKV inoculation (‘Un-infected’). On day 4 post-challenge, mice were bled and ZIKV RNA levels determined by RT-qPCR. The resultant viremia data, presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b, revealed that, the mean ZIKV RNA level in the α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl) group was ∼3 logs lower, compared to the mean ZIKV RNA levels in the groups which received 10-fold lower amount of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum [α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl) group, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0044] and mock immune serum (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0017). In fact, viremia levels in the latter 2 groups were very similar to each other (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.76). The viremia data closely reflected survival outcome shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c. Passive transfer of mock immune serum at 200 µl/mouse failed to confer protection against lethal ZIKV challenge, with all mice succumbing by post-challenge day 8. Survival in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group was slightly better, but there was 100% mortality by post-challenge day 11. In contrast, 50% mice receiving the higher dose of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum [α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl) group] were protected when challenged with ZIKV MR766. This was statistically significant, compared to the survival of mice either in the ‘Mock-immune (200 µl)’ group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) or in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0074). The difference in survival between the mice of the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ and ‘Un-infected’ groups was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0888). Mice in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group showed milder clinical symptoms, which resolved after day 12 post-challenge, compared to mice in the ‘Mock-immune (200 µl)’and ‘α-ZIKV-80E (20 µl)’ groups. Body weight loss in the ‘α-ZIKV-80E (200 µl)’ group, which was similar to that in the other challenged groups during the early phase, tended to show a recovery in the later phase (
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>e). Taken together, the data suggest that antibodies induced by the ZIKV-80E NPs manifest clear evidence of a dose-dependent protective effect against lethal ZIKV challenge.
