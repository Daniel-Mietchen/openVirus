<p id="para0033">We had previously observed that purified recombinant DENV-80E proteins, of all four DENV serotypes, when expressed using the 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> host system self-assemble into unique NPs, in the absence of the cognate prM proteins

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Therefore, we examined if ZIKV-80E expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> in the absence of prM also would possess the ability to form higher order structures through self-assembly. Laser-based DLS analysis revealed a single major homogenous peak (PdI=0.359), representing particles of an average size of ∼29 nm. This suggests that the purified ZIKV-80E preparation does indeed self-assemble into discrete higher order structures (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d). We corroborated this finding by analysis of the purified material by EM, which showed discrete particles of ∼25–35 nm (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d, right inset). Collectively, these data demonstrate that purified ZIKV-80E protein prepared using the 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> host system does self-assemble into discrete NPs, in the absence of any prM. The capacity of recombinant ZIKV-80E protein to self-assemble is interesting given that there are several reports which suggest that ZIKV VLPs are formed only when prM and E proteins are co-expressed together

 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This may reflect subtle differences in the disposition of the E protein molecules in the prM-lacking NPs and prM-containing VLPs, leading to the conclusion that the NPs may be structurally distinct from the VLPs.
