<p id="para0034">We next asked the question: Do the prM-lacking ZIKV-80E NPs preserve the antigenic integrity of neutralising epitopes? To answer this question, we probed these NPs with a panel of ZIKV-specific human and murine conformational mAbs. Since potent ZIKV-specific neutralising epitopes map to EDIII, we focused on a set of ZIKV EDIII-specific mAbs and carried out indirect ELISAs using the purified ZIKV-80E NPs as the coating antigen. The data are summarised in 
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The ZIKV-80E protein NPs were recognised efficiently by the murine mAbs ZV-48 and ZV-67, but not by ZV-2. Their binding sites on the ZIKV E protein have been mapped using recombinant protein-binding studies in conjunction with X-ray crystallography 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. ZV-2, ZV-48 and ZV-67 bind to the ABDE sheet, the C–C’ loop and the lateral ridge (LR), respectively of ZIKV EDIII. Of these, the LR epitope is quite complex in that it is comprised of several secondary structure elements that include the A-strand, the B–C loop, 
 <sc>D</sc>–E loop and F–G loop involving 21 contact residues 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The efficient recognition by mAb ZV-67, a potent neutraliser of ZIKV infectivity, suggests that the antigenic integrity of the LR epitope is largely preserved in the ZIKV-80E NPs. The binding of mAb ZV-48 (also a strong neutraliser of ZIKV infectivity, but not as potent as ZV-67), which recognises another distinct secondary structural element, the C–C’ loop, suggest subtle difference(s) between ZIKV-80E NPs and the ZIKV particle, as the C–C’ loop is not predicted to be accessible on the virion surface [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, ABDE sheet recognised by mAb ZV-2, a weak neutraliser, and also not predicted to be accessible on the ZIKV particle [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was not detectable on the ZIKV-80E NPs as well. ZIKV-80E NPs were also recognised by a human mAb, ZKA-64, a highly potent nAb, specific to ZIKV EDIII 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, none of these ZIKV mAbs recognised ZIKV EDIII displayed on HBV S-based VLPs, providing an explanation for why ZIKV EDIII displayed on HBV S VLPs elicits very modest ZIKV nAb titres 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. As expected none of the ZIKV mAbs recognised DSV4 VLPs (which display the EDIIIs of all four DENV serotypes 
 <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>) as well as DENV-2-80E NPs 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, the cross-reactive mAb 24A12 recognised EDIII moieties of ZIKV and DENV-2, regardless of the particle platform. We also tested the ZIKV-80E NPs using the FLE-specific flavivirus cross-reactive mAb 4G2 (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, this mAb did not manifest any discernible reactivity towards ZIKV-80E NPs, suggesting that in these NPs the ZIKV E FLE is not accessible. Taken collectively, the mAb probing data suggest that the ZIKV-80E NPs preserve the overall antigenic integrity of EDIII, but with subtle differences.
