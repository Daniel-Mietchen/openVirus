<p id="para0032">Recombinant ZIKV-80E protein was purified using Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-NTA affinity chromatography, taking advantage of the C-terminally engineered 6x-His tag. The 
 <italic>P</italic> fraction obtained after glass-bead lysis of induced cells in a Dynomill was solubilised in the presence of a denaturant. We used 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (Gu-HCl) instead of 8 M urea as the extraction is twice as efficient with the former compared to the latter denaturant 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The solubilised 
 <italic>P</italic> fraction was clarified by centrifugation and bound to Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-NTA resin. As column fractions in 6 M Gu-HCl are not suitable for analysis on SDS-PAGE, the column was washed extensively with 8 M urea-containing buffer, followed by subsequent elution using an imidazole step-gradient in 8 M urea-buffer. This resulted in the emergence of two peaks, one at ∼100 mM and the other at ∼250 mM imidazole (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of a ∼45 kDa protein in all fractions across both peaks 1 and 2 (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>f). This essentially reflects that 100 mM imidazole was adequate to displace only a small fraction of the bound recombinant protein, with more effective elution occurring at 250 mM imidazole. Thus, both peaks were pooled together, dialysed to remove urea and imidazole and stored frozen in aliquots until use. An aliquot of the pooled material was analysed by SDS-PAGE and found to contain a single protein band of ∼45 kDa (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). This band was recognised by mAb 24A12, which recognises ZIKV EDIII 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> in a Western blot (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). As mentioned above, a prM signal peptide (34 
 <italic>aa</italic>) was included at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein to ensure proper processing. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the prM signal peptide had been cleaved off from the 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic>-expressed recombinant ZIKV-80E protein (data not shown), consistent with the observed size of the purified protein. N-linked glycan analysis of the purified recombinant ZIKV-80E protein was carried out using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). Oligomannose structures up to Man13 were observed with Man9 being the most abundant species. Starting from a 2 L shake-flask culture (∼50 g induced biomass), the typical yield of purified recombinant protein was ∼50 mg (∼1 mg purified protein/gram wet weight of induced cell biomass). Purity was assessed to be &gt;95%.
