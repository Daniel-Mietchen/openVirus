<p id="para0030">We created a synthetic ZIKV-80E gene based on the previous design of the DENV 
 <italic>80E</italic> genes. Thus, the ZIKV-80E gene (codon-optimised for expression in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic>) encoded the last 34 
 <italic>aa</italic> residues of the ZIKV prM protein followed by the first 403 
 <italic>aa</italic> residues of the ZIKV E protein (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a and b). These sequences were derived from the ZikaSPH2015 Brazilian strain. ZikaSPH2015 E protein displays at least 99% sequence identity with the E proteins of Asian ZIKV strains, at least 96% sequence identity with the E proteins of African ZIKV strains and 55â€“57% sequence identity with respect to E proteins of the four DENVs (
