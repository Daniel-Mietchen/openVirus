<p id="para0035">Having obtained ZIKV-80E NPs and found that they present EDIII on their surface, (particularly the LR epitope) we examined their immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. Mice were immunised with ZIKV-80E NPs as described in methods (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). Immune sera drawn 10 days after the final dose were analysed by indirect ELISA using different coating antigens, as depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b. Pooled immune sera displayed very high anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibody titres (serum log
 <sub>10</sub> titres &gt;10
 <sup>5</sup>), using the purified ZIKV-80E NPs as the coating antigen. As this experiment used pooled immune sera, it is likely that differences in individual mice may be masked, with only a subset responding efficiently to the antigen. To address this concern, we analysed all 14 individual sera, at a single dilution, within the linear dose-response range of the pooled sera. These results confirmed that all mice respond quite efficiently and comparably to the ZIKV-80E NPs (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.33, Mann–Whitney test). Next, we examined the degree to which the anti-ZIKV-80E NP antisera can cross-react with DENV-80E NP antigens, in this indirect ELISA. Consistent with the antigenic similarity which exists between ZIKV E and the E proteins of the four DENV serotypes (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S1</italic>), we observed that the anti-ZIKV-80E NP antisera indeed manifested cross-reactivity against the DENV-80E NPs (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). However, the DENV-80E NP-cross-reactive end-point titres were more than an order of magnitude lower than those against ZIKV E NPs (
