<p id="para0038">Can this ZIKV-specific nAb response be re-called? To answer this, a subset of immunised mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were allowed to rest for &gt;4 months after the 3rd immunisation, and then given a 4th dose (day 160). Mice were bled one day before (day 159) and 10 days after (day 170) the 4th dose (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S6</italic>), for nAb estimation using the ZIKV RVP luciferase assay. This experiment, the results of which are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b, demonstrated &gt;4-fold increase in resting titres following recall (NT
 <sub>50</sub> =55 before and 241 after recall, 
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S6, table on the left</italic>). This reflects a specific recall response, and is indicative of the generation of memory B cells as a result of the primary immunisation. Specific T-cell stimulation studies may shed further light on this. Interestingly, the day 170 immune serum also failed to neutralise any of the four DENV serotypes (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S6, table on the right</italic>). This suggests that memory recall preserves the absolute specificity for ZIKV and does not expand to DENVs.
