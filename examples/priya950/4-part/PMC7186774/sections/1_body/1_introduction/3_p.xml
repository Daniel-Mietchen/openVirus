<p id="para0012">ZIKV vaccine development is complicated by the existence of the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Antibodies to one virus can cross-react with and promote cellular entry of another phylogenetically related heterologous virus

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The corollary that ZIKV-induced antibodies may possess the potential to promote ADE of DENV infection, which in turn could lead to severe dengue disease, poses a significant hurdle to ZIKV vaccine development.
