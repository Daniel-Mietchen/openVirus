<p id="para0013">Numerous ZIKV vaccine candidates, employing multiple technologies and platforms, are being explored by various investigators. These include live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, as well as those based on recombinant virus vectors, nucleic acids, proteins and peptides [

 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Several of these, including an mRNA-based vaccine, a recombinant measles virus-vectored vaccine and several plasmid DNA-based and inactivated ZIKV candidates are in phase 1 trials, with the mRNA vaccine and one of the plasmid DNA-based vaccines in phase 2 [
