<p id="para0049">Consistent with their ability to display EDIII, the ZIKV-80E NPs elicited predominantly ZIKV EDIII-specific total antibody titres (log
 <sub>10</sub> serum titres, &gt;5). Importantly, the ZIKV-80E NPs elicited high ZIKV-specific nAb titres (NT
 <sub>50</sub>≥300). This finding also implies that the ZIKV-80E NPs offer a more efficient EDIII display platform, in the light of recent findings that ZIKV EDIII displayed on Hepatitis B surface antigen VLP platform elicited much lower nAb titres, by comparison 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Many ZIKV vaccine development studies, investigating multiple delivery formats have consistently and compellingly demonstrated that protection against ZIKV challenge is dependent on ZIKV-specific nAbs [

 <sub>10</sub> serum antibody titres ≥2.35, specific to recombinant ZIKV E, and ZIKV-specific nAb titres &gt;10 can confer effective protection against live ZIKV challenge 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In contrast, another study using ZIKV prM+E VLPs found that NT
 <sub>50</sub> ≥125 protects mice against lethal challenge 
 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. A purified inactivated ZIKV vaccine that could elicit nAb titres of NT
 <sub>50</sub> ∼100 was capable of conferring protection against ZIKV challenge in mice 
 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. By these criteria, we surmise that the

 <sup>−/−</sup> challenged with a lethal dose of ZIKV MR766 by passively transferred anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum was dose-dependent. While a dose of 20 µl immune serum was ineffective, 200 µl immune serum effectively suppressed viremia and conferred 50% protection. Paucity of immune serum precluded the testing of higher doses of immune serum. Additionally, the passive transfer strategy has an inherent limitation in that it only simulates waning ZIKV nAb titres. Assuming that the 200 µl immune serum (NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre against ZIKV MR766=461), passive-transferred per mouse, undergoes ∼12-fold dilution (assuming a total blood volume of ∼2.5 ml/mouse), one may argue that the resulting circulating ZIKV NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre of ∼36 affords 50% protection against lethal challenge. Comparison of the survival curves of the groups receiving mock-immune serum and anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum (both at 200 µl/mouse) showed the survival of the latter group was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, Mantel–Cox test). Also, survival of mice in this anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum group was not statistically significant compared to survival of mice in the un-infected group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0888, Mantel–Cox test). Thus, it is likely that active immunisation with ZIKV-80E NPs, which has the potential to result in much higher circulating nAb titres, can afford full protection. However, it is not possible to make an absolute comparison of our efficacy data with those published in the literature. This is because protective efficacy has been reported based on different criteria, under different experimental conditions, using different animal models and different ZIKV challenge viruses. For example, using either DNA-based ZIKV vaccine or a purified inactivated ZIKV vaccine, some investigators have actively immunised BALB/c or AG129 mice and assessed protective efficacy following challenge with Brazilian, Puerto Rican or African ZIKV strains, in terms of either suppression of viremia or survival [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. One study which used passive transfer of immune sera from ZIKV prM+E VLP vaccinated CB6F1 mice, into AG129 mice as we did, however used a Nicaraguan strain of ZIKV for challenge 
 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Standardisation of the efficacy assay will help meaningful comparison of different vaccine candidates. As severe ZIKV infection is associated with fetal abnormalities, it would be relevant to test vaccine efficacy in a suitable pregnancy mouse model 
 <xref rid="bib0067" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, with the caveat that this model has a genetic defect in the innate immune signalling pathway.
