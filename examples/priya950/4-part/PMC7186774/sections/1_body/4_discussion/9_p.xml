<p id="para0052">There are certain limitations to the work presented in this study. As the primary purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of ZIKV-80E as a putative vaccine candidate, an affinity tag was engineered into it, to facilitate purification. In a vaccine intended eventually for human trials, it is preferable to eliminate such tags and devise alternate purification strategies. Another potential shortcoming is that this study has carried out only a limited biophysical characterisation of the ZIKV-80E NPs. A more comprehensive biophysical characterisation including composition, conformation and stability, would be essential. Finally, vaccine efficacy data obtained is based on the use of the

 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse, which lacks types I and III interferon signalling. As this model is based on passive transfer of immune serum, it does not address a possible role for T cell activity in protective efficacy. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise caution while extrapolating vaccine efficacy in the mouse model to ZIKV infection in humans.
