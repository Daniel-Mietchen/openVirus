<p id="para0053">That 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expressed ZIKV-80E can self-assemble into immunogenic NPs is associated with some desirable features. The absence of prM eliminates any potential safety concern relating to ADE of both ZIKV as well as DENVs. Further, in the absence of prM, the E protein self-assembly process appears to favour efficient display of EDIII on the NP surface, while at the same time masking FLE in its interior. From a vaccine perspective this appears to be advantageous, as the data show that the antibodies elicited by these NPs are EDIII-directed and possess potent neutralising ability. Importantly, antibodies induced by ZIKV-80E NPs lack ADE potential, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, both towards DENV as well as ZIKV. To our knowledge, this is the first ZIKV vaccine candidate to demonstrate lack of ADE 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, the high expression potential of the 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> system [

 <xref rid="bib0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] using inexpensive media is another advantage of this ZIKV vaccine candidate. Taken together, the data justify further research on this ZIKV-80E-based NP vaccine to evaluate its utility as a possible ZIKV subunit vaccine candidate.
