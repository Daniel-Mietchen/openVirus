<p id="para0019">Recombinant ZIKV-80E protein was purified starting from a 2 L culture using Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-NTA affinity chromatography, under denaturing conditions essentially as reported earlier 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, with minor modifications. Details of purification are provided in Methods S1 (
 <italic>Supplementary File</italic>). Purity was assessed by image analysis (Bio Rad Gel Doc EZ imager). Yields were typically ∼1 mg ZIKV-80E protein of ∼95% purity, per g wet weight of induced cell pellet.
