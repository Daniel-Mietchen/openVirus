 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were injected i.p. with indicated amounts of pooled serum either from mock-immunised (200 µl/mouse) or ZIKV-80E NP-immunised (at two dose levels: 20 µl/mouse and 200 µl/mouse) BALB/c mice. Two hours following passive transfer, mice were challenged i.d. with 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> plaque forming units (PFUs) of the highly pathogenic ZIKV strain MR766. A group of mice that received neither immune plasma nor the ZIKV challenge was included for comparison. Mice were bled on day 4 to determine viremia by q-RTPCR (
 <italic>Methods S1</italic>). All mice were monitored for 15 days post-infection for survival, development of clinical symptoms and weight loss, as previously described [
