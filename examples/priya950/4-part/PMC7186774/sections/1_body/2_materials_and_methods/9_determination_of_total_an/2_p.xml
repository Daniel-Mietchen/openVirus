<p id="para0023">Total antibody titres in immune sera were estimated by indirect ELISA, using five different MBP-EDIII fusion proteins (in which the EDIII moieties were from ZIKV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) and five different 80E proteins (corresponding to ZIKV and DENV serotypes 1–4), as the capture antigens (

ELISA end-point titres, defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance ∼4-fold over background (that is, a cut-off absorbance value of 0.2), were determined from extrapolation of non-linear regression curves using GraphPad Prism (v7.0) software.
