<p id="para0021">A single immunisation dose consisted of 20 µg purified ZIKV-80E NPs adsorbed onto 500 µg alhydrogel in a volume of 100 µl 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Groups of 4–6 week old BALB/c mice were either mock-immunised (500 µg alhydrogel in 100 µl 1× PBS), or immunised with alhydrogel-formulated ZIKV-80E NPs. Three doses were administered on days 0, 14 and 28, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Sera were collected on day 38 for determination of total antibody titres by indirect ELISA and nAb titres by ZIKV and DENV virus neutralisation assays.</p>
