 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For DENV nAbs, NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre of the immune serum is defined as the dilution corresponding to 50% reduction in the number of DENV-infected cells with reference to the number of cells infected by DENV in absence of immune serum, taken as 100%.
