<p id="para0028">The capacity of polyclonal anti-ZIKV-80E antisera to promote ADE of DENV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated using the FcγII-R-expressing K562 cell line. The ability of these antibodies to promote ADE of DENV 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> was assessed by monitoring survival of interferon α/β and γ receptor double knock-out AG129 mice 
 <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> following challenge with a sub-lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 that had been pre-incubated with anti-ZIKV-80E antiserum (
 <italic>Methods S1</italic>). This antiserum was also assessed for its ability to mediate ADE of a non-pathogenic ZIKV infection
