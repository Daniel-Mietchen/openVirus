    "BACKGROUND:Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus capable of causing neurological abnormalities, is a recognised human pathogen, for which a vaccine is required. As ZIKV antibodies can mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection, a ZIKV vaccine must not only protect against ZIKV but must also not sensitise vaccinees to severe dengue. METHODS:The N-terminal 80% of ZIKV envelope protein (80E) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and its capacity to self-assemble into particulate structures evaluated using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Antigenic integrity of the 80E protein was evaluated using ZIKV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were assessed in BALB/c and C57BL/6 Stat2-/- mice, respectively. Its capacity to enhance DENV and ZIKV infection was assessed in AG129 and C57BL/6 Stat2-/- mice, respectively. FINDINGS:ZIKV-80E protein self-assembled into discrete nanoparticles (NPs), which preserved the antigenic integrity of neutralising epitopes on E domain III (EDIII) and elicited potent ZIKV-neutralising antibodies predominantly against this domain in BALB/c mice. These antibodies conferred statistically significant protection in vivo (p = 0.01, Mantel-Cox test), and did not exacerbate sub-lethal DENV-2 or ZIKV challenges in vivo. INTERPRETATION:Yeast-expressed ZIKV-80E, which forms highly immunogenic EDIII-displaying NPs, elicits ZIKV EDIII-specific antibodies capable of offering significant protection in vivo, without the potential risk of ADE upon subsequent DENV-2 or ZIKV infection. This offers a promising vaccine candidate for further development. FUNDING:This study was supported partly by ICGEB, India, and by NIAID, USA."
