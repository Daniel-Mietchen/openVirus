According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer will kill more than 443,000 people worldwide each year by 2030, and 98% of these deaths will occur in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the HIV epidemic and other risk factors further increase the burden of this cancer [
