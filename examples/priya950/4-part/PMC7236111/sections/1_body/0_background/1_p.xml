<p id="Par16">Human papilloma viruses (HPV) are non-enveloped DNA viruses that represent the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with more than 200 species. HPV genotypes are responsible for 95% of the occurrence of cervical cancer in women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Notably, HPV causes benign and malignant tumours in humans and viral genotypes that are oncogenic are classified as high-risk (HR-HPV) or low-risk oncogenic HPV (LR-HPV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although all HR-HPV genotypes have oncogenic potential, some are more frequently involved in cancers than others. Thus, HPV 16 and 18 represent approximately 70% of all cervical cancers worldwide, followed by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 and 68 which are among the ten most commonly isolated HR-HPV genotypes from cervical tumor biopsies [
