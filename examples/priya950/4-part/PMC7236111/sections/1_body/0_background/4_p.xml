<p id="Par19">Factors that contribute to HPV infections include: early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, smoking, prolonged oral contraception and immuno-compromission (due to HIV essentially) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. HIV infection also promotes HPV infection at molecular and cellular levels during different phases of HPV replication cycle such as, penetration into the target cell, HPV multiplication and HPV immune evasion from the hostâ€™s defences. Direct consequences are clinical manifestations of HPV-associated dysplasia, which has been recognized in early HIV epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As reported by Kevin A. Ault in 2006, High-risk, oncogenic HPV types (including HPV 16 and HPV 18) are associated with 99.7% of all cervical cancers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These observations are very concerning and suggest a high burden of HPV in these settings where HIV is also highly prevalent [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We therefore hypothesised that HPV-infection is significantly higher among Cameroonian HIV-seropositive women as compared to their seronegative peers. Thus, in the light of evidence generated from countries with similar programmatic challenges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], understanding the burden of HPV among women, its circulating genotypes and the effect of HIV-infection on HPV-positivity, might help in shaping HPV preventive measures according to local realities in Cameroon.
