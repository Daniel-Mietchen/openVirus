<p id="Par42">After adjusting the different variables based on a multi-variate analysis, HIV status remains the independent factor associated with the risk of infection with this high-risk oncogenic HPV (12 times higher risk), as previously demonstrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similar to our findings, the study by Tartaglia E. et al. also supports HIV-status as the main independent factor associated with risk of HPV infection among women, likely due to immunodeficiency. In other words, following multivariate analysis, none of the other parameters (except CD4 which is strongly related to the HIV condition) were found to be significantly associated with HPV infection [
