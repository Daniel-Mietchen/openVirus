<p id="Par40">HIV is confirmed as a contributing factor to HPV-infection (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.019), also confirmed by multi-variate analysis. As expected, women infected with HIV have a weaker immune status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which henceforth increases risk of acquiring HPV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This calls for the need to regularly test people with HPV infection for HIV [
