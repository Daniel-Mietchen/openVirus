<p>Anti-HEV IgM appears in the early phase of acute hepatitis E. The antibodies can be detected as early as four days after the onset of jaundice and last up to five months (

There are two main methods in anti-HEV IgM serological assays: the capture method with anti-human IgM μ chain (Wantai, Kehua and Lizhu), and the indirect method (Genelabs). The sensitivity and specificity of different methods present variations in anti-HEV IgM assays with a recent study demonstrating a high cross-reactivity of HEV IgM compared to EBV and CMV (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Drobeniuc et al. 2010</xref>). However, in the present study, no false-positive results due to cross-reaction with EBV- or CMV-infected patients were observed, indicating the highly specific nature of the anti-HEV IgM assays. Moreover, these findings were found to be consistent with those of the other groups, including immunocompromised patients (

This finding supports the opinion that the capture method using the antihuman IgM μ chain is more specific than the indirect method using the anti-HEV IgM assay.
