<p>In this study, all four anti-HEV IgG serological assays used the indirect method. There are two major types of antigens coated on the plates for binding of anti-HEV IgG antibodies, including synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins (

Since recombinant proteins can replicate the HEV neutralizing epitope better than the synthetic peptides, the results in the Wantai anti-HEV IgG assay were more sensitive. A French research group also substantiated that the Wantai IgG assay was the most sensitive amongst all other eight commercial ELISA kits used to detect HEV of genotypes 1 and 3 (
