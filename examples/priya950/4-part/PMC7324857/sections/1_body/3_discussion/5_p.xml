<p>The latest reports have indicated that this novel HEV Ag is a resourceful serum marker to detect the acute HEV infection and has a good consistency with HEV RNA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), which provided no direct evidence to support that Ag detection could improve diagnostic efficiency. Furthermore, six samples were only positive for HEV RNA but negative for anti-HEV IgM and IgG, as well as Ag in all ELISA kits employed, which showed that 6.98% of acute HEV infection patients have a chance to be misdiagnosed if reliant on serological assays detection alone. It indirectly indicates that HEV RNA detection can improve diagnostic efficiency. However, despite the highly specific and sensitive capability of some PCR assays for the detection of HEV RNA, their utility has been restricted due to the short period of HEV viremia detection. Therefore, the incidence of acute HEV infection cannot be completely ruled out by a negative HEV PCR result.
