 <bold>The HEV RNA assay</bold>. One-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was set up by our research team and had been approved for clinical use. Primers and probes were designed based on a multiple sequence alignment of the HEV genome sequences in the ORF3 region, and synthesized by the Sangon Biotech Company (Shanghai, China): forward primer, 5’-GGTGGTTTCTGGGGT-GAC-3’ (T
 <sub>m</sub> = 61.2°C); reverse primer, 5’-AGGGGTTG-GTTGGATGAA-3’ (T
 <sub>m</sub> = 61.2°C); probe, 5’-TGATTC-TCAGCCCTTCGC-3’ (T
 <sub>m</sub> = 62.5°C). NCBI-Primer-BLAST searches for the primers and probe showed that the genetic sequences of the different HEV genotypes 1–4 were highly conserved in the ORF3 region. Firstly, the target fragment of 70 bp was amplified from the strain of HEV genotype 4 (CHNXJ-SW13) by the forward and reverse primers mentioned above, and then inserted the fragment into Promega T-easy Vector (3105 bp) to obtain the standard plasmid. Serial dilutions plasmids of 5 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> ~ 5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies/2 μl were obtained by 10-fold dilution, and the standard curve was established. Total RNA was extracted from 140 μl serum using TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The One-Step PrimeScript’ RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) enabled the performance of RT-qPCR in a total 20-μl reaction system, including 10 μl GoTaq Probe qPCR Master Mix (1×), 0.4 μl GoScript RT Mix for one-step RT-qPCR (1×), 1 μl forward primer (500 mM), 1 μl reverse primer (500 mM), 0.5 μl probe (250 nM), 5.1 μl RNase-Free H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 2 μl RNA template or standard plasmid of HEV. Subsequently, the reaction was conducted with the MX3000P Real-Time QPCR System (Aligent, California, USA). The conditions for PCR amplification involved the following: 1 cycle at 45°C for 30 min, 1 cycle at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, at 55°C for 20 sec and at 72°C for 15 sec. The expression of the HEV RNA was calculated according to the standard curve established by plasmids with different dilutions.
