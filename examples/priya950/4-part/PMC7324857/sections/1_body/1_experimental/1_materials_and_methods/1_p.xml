Meanwhile, 96 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Five milliliters of venous blood was collected and agglutinated for 10 min at 37°C, and subsequently centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The serum was taken and stored at –80°C before analysis. This study received approval from the Branch of Tianjin Third Central Hospital Ethics Committee (2019028). Our study was non-interventional and did not involve any specific sampling or addition to the usual procedures. An anonymized database provided analytical support. Therefore, the ethics committee waived the need for patient consent.
