<p>HEV RNA is frequently used as a marker for acute hepatitis E infection. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) assays are available that can detect genetically divergent HEV strains. Molecular studies and phylogenetic analysis have shown that the swine HEV strains are clustered in the same genotype as human HEV strains [

A single-step betaine-free RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with a 100-fold greater sensitivity than ordinary RT–PCR was developed to diagnosis HEV rapidly [
