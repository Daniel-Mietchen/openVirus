<p>Conversely, there are reports where the rates of anti-HEV antibody were lower than in the CHD patients compared to the general population. Fabrizi et al. (1997) reported a 3% seroprevalence of anti-HEV in Italy [

Nonetheless, the CHD sample was not from the same region of Iran and could potentially be the cause of the conflicting result [
