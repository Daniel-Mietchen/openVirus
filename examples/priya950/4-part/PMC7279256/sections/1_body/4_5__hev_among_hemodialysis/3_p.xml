<p>Psichogiou et al. (1996) carried out a multicenter hemodialysis cohort study. Although their study reported higher rates of anti-HEV antibodies in CHD patients when compared to a reference of normal population, they determined that this difference was not significant. CHD patients were not at higher risk of being infected with HEV and there was no substantial difference in HEV seroprevalence of patients with a history of blood transfusions compared to a healthy reference population [

These results were further corroborated by studies which failed to find a substantial correlation between anti-HEV IgG positivity and CHD in Turkey (20.6% HEV seropositivity in hemodialysis (HD) patients) and Greece (4.8% HEV seropositivity in HD patients) [
