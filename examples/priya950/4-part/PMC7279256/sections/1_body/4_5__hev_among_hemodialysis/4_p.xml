<p>Data concerning anti-HEV antibody prevalence among CHD patients are insufficient and provide contrasting results. Different HEV prevalences in the healthy population in different geographical locations, the selection criteria of the different studies, and the different transmission routes of HEV could be key in understanding these contrasting results. Additionally, regional differences, genetic variations of HEV and false-positive outcomes from other infections could explain the different results [

More retrospective studies with large number of HD patients or case control studies, where patients are matched with a control, are needed. Lastly, standardization of assay methods used will help pinpoint whether anti-HEV IgG seropositivity is acquired during hemodialysis.
