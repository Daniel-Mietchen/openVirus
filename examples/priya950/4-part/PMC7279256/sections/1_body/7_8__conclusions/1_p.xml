<p>In order to prevent the spread of HEV in endemic settings, proper sanitation must be maintained and contamination of water sources must be avoided. 
 <italic>HEV1</italic> and 
 <italic>HEV2</italic> are commonly found in this setting and are transmitted by the fecalâ€“oral route. Educating the masses and exposure to information on HEV and its mode of transmission, along with a strong system of sanitation awareness is key in preventing hepatitis E. 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> and 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> spread can be prevented by adequately cooking swine and game meats. Transplant recipients must be advised to improve personal hygiene, avoid eating high-risk food such as shellfish and pork products, especially pig livers and pig liver sausages. Travel to endemic areas must be limited by transplant patients and well-treated water must only be consumed by them in these areas. Regular testing of transplant recipients on the day of transplant followed by regular yearly testing can discourage chronic HEV infections.
