<p>In hemodialysis patients, parenteral route may play a salient role in the transfer of HEV. Hemodialysis is implicated as a source of nosocomial HEV in some studies; however, other researchers report a lack of association between higher HEV prevalence and hemodialysis. In fact, though HCV is associated with higher risk of HEV infections in liver transplant recipients, there is no association between presence of HCV and higher risk of HEV in CHD patients.</p>
