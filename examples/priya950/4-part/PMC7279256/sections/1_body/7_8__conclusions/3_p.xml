<p>HEV seroprevalences in blood donors may shed light on the overall prevalence in a given population. Besides fecalâ€“oral and zoonotic transmission, blood transfusion appears to be a possible mode of HEV transmission. Yearly studies are warranted for each area to prevent widespread dissemination of HEV. However, the HEV antibody detection assays show different results and there is a lack of consensus between them. The same region can be marked as moderate zone of HEV or hyperendemic depending on the assay method used. Seroprevalence data must be interpreted carefully and caution should be applied while comparing seroprevalences from different regions using different assay methods. Additionally, studies must be undertaken to develop standardized detection kits.</p>
