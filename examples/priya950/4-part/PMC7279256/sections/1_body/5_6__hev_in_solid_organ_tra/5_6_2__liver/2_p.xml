<p>Another study on 145 liver transplant recipients with chronic HCV found the seroprevalence of HEV to be 42.5% [

The conditions of a liver transplant patient may be aggravated by a chronic HEV infection if they have pre-existing liver damage due to HCV. Interestingly the higher rates of HEV seroprevalence in the study involving transplant recipients with chronic HCV can be explained by HCV causing liver injury and HEV being transmitted through blood transfusions. As HEV is a zoonotic pathogen, eating contaminated pork products may cause the chronic infection [
