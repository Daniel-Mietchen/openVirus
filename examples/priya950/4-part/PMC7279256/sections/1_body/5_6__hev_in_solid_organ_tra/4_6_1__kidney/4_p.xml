<p>Researchers consistently report that chronic HEV infections lead to a rapid cirrhosis, especially in kidney transplantation setting [

Therapeutic options for chronic HEV infection in renal transplant recipients is not widely studied and reducing immunosuppressive drugs may be the best possible therapy [
 <xref rid="B109-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] as a reduction of immunosuppression has shown to cause viral clearance. However, after reducing immunosuppression, patient progress must be monitored closely to circumvent the danger of acute rejection [
