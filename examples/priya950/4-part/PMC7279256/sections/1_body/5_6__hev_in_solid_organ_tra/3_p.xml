<p>Kamar et al. (2011) carried out the largest reported retrospective multicenter study that included 17 centers and 85 transplant patients to assess the relationship between solid organ transplant and HEV infection and to establish the predictive causes for chronic hepatitis. They stated that in solid organ transplant recipients infected with HEV, 60% of cases evolve to chronicity. There is a strong association between usage of tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug, and development of chronic hepatitis. Amongst the transplant recipients, 32.1% had HEV clearance after a dose-decrease of immunosuppressive therapy that can be explained by reduced downregulation of T-cell response. Subsequent to HEV clearance, no reappearance of HEV viraemia was reported [
