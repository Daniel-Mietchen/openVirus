<p>Organ-transplant recipients are susceptible to chronic active hepatitis due to HEV infection that may lead to a prompt progression to cirrhosis [

 <xref rid="B17-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the absence of an established definition, Kamar et al. (2012) defined chronic hepatitis as the carriage of HEV for more than six months [
 <xref rid="B97-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and should be diagnosed when HEV replication persists for 3 months after the acute phase [
 <xref rid="B98-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Transplant recipients who developed the chronic state have a significantly shorter time from transplant to diagnosis. As a result, they have lower total lymphocyte counts, CD2, CD3, and CD4 lymphocyte counts [
