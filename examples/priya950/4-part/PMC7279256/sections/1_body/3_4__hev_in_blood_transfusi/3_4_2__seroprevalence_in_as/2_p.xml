<p>The prevalence of HEV infection in the war-stricken Khuzestan Province, Iran, was 11.5% among blood donors. Interestingly, all patients were free of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV, and HCV [

High HEV seroprevalence in this region might be due to river pollution from surrounding factories and also unsanitary living conditions caused by war. Egypt is endemic to HEV as the incidence of anti-HEV IgG was 45.2% among blood donors [

However, non-swine meats are also implicated in the transmission of HEV. Despite the prohibition of swine in Islamic countries, rates of HEV seroprevalence are quite high. Thus, studies on HEV from other animals’ meats used for human consumption may assist us to know better the epidemiology of HEV.
