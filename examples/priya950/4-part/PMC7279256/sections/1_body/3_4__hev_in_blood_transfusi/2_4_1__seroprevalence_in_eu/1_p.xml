<p>In developed European countries, HEV ranges between 0.4% and 3% [

 <italic>HEV3</italic> genotype, which was identical to the genotype from the implicated donor [
 <xref rid="B64-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Further research on 880 plasma mini pools (42,000 individual donors) from London showed that HEV RNA exists in 0.7% of the samples. Additionally, 73% of HEV RNA negative samples were HEV IgG reactive, indicating a high rate of asymptomatic infection [

 <xref rid="B66-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Hewitt et al. suggested that 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> infections are present in the English blood donors but with low seroprevalence of 0.04% [
