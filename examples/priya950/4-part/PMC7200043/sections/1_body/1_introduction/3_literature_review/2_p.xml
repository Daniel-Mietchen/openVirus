<p>Evidence for the currently recommended ribavirin treatment (30 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days followed by 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for 6 days) adds up to one clinical study by McCormick 
 <italic>et al</italic> published in 1986.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In patients with a high risk of fatal outcome (aspartate aminotransferase/glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/GOT) values ≥150 U/L), initiation of treatment within 6 days after onset of fever reduced the case fatality rate from 55% to 5%.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Similarly, in patients with high viraemia (≥10
 <sup>3.6</sup> 50% tissue culture infection dose per millilitre), treatment reduced the case fatality rate from 76% to 9%. Even if treatment was initiated at day 7 or later, the case fatality could be reduced in these groups to 26% and 47%, respectively. No major differences were seen between oral and intravenous treatment. When, however, reviewing the publication thoroughly, several deficits become apparent. Research participants had not been randomised to either control or treatment group but a historic cohort of untreated patients was taken as control group. The treatment group was further separated into several subgroups with different treatment options (oral ribavirin, intravenous ribavirin, convalescent plasma) and different time points of treatment (within 6 days after onset of symptoms or later). The authors yet did not describe how patients had been allocated to the different subgroups and whether allocation had happened before or after inclusion in the study. There was, furthermore, a questionable deviation from the planned research design as subgroups were merged together after the end of the study. Additionally, total participant numbers in treatment and control groups remain unclear. Still, despite these serious biases this study is taken as reference for LF treatment since &gt;30 years.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The dose used in the 1986 study is recommended by WHO for treatment of LF.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, no data exist about the rational for this dose, the achieved ribavirin blood levels under this dose or the efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of other dosing schemes. Clinical experience and expert opinion in the endemic countries agree with the results but scientific evidence is still largely lacking behind. PK assessments of ribavirin are only available for different dosing regimens used for hepatitis C.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The multiple dose half-life of ribavirin is estimated to be approximately 300 hours (12.5 days), which would justify less frequent or daily dosing in principle.
