<p>Following the Ebola virus disease crisis, WHO has initiated the research and development (R&amp;D) Blueprint as a global strategy and preparedness plan to ensure that targeted R&amp;D brings medical technologies to patients during epidemics.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> WHO and international experts have agreed on a list of priority diseases for urgent R&amp;D, which also includes LF. WHO recognises that there is insufficient research for epidemic-prone diseases mainly affecting LMICs. The research needs of LMICs span from ‘proof of principle/preclinical studies to the implementation and regulation of clinical studies, innovative strategies for the production of health technologies, development of key enabling capacities, such as pathogenesis studies of the priority pathogens and surveillance methodologies and regulatory science needed to enhance regulatory preparedness’.
