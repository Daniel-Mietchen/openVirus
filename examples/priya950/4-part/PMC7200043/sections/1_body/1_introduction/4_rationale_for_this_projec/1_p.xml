<p>LF is a dangerous infection with a high lethality rate. During the past years, cases of LASV infection increased markedly and more evidence on an efficacious therapy of this disease is direly needed. The standard treatment for patients with LF is ribavirin, as the study by McCormick 
 <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated efficacy of ribavirin in reducing the fatality rate of LF; ribavirin also increases survival in in vivo animal models of LASV infection.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Ribavirin at ISTH is used at a dose that deviates from the WHO recommendation. From clinical experience during the last decade, the standard Irrua regimen of ribavirin is postulated to be efficacious. Yet it is easier to use and a safer alternative to the McCormick regimen, because the exposure of personnel to LF diseased patients is reduced. However, to our knowledge, the PK properties of the Irrua ribavirin regimen have never been described. It is not known if this dose reaches blood levels that would be sufficient to exert an antiviral effect in the patients. Therefore, in this prospective observational study we aim to obtain evidence on ribavirin PKs in patients who receive the Irrua ribavirin regimen as standard of care at ISTH. The Irrua regimen entails the following ribavirin dosages for intravenous use:
