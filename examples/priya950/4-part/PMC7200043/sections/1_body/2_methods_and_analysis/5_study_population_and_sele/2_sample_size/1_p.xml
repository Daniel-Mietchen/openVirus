<p>A sample size of 20 evaluable patients as defined by sponsor is proposed. The sample size and sampling design was evaluated using stochastic clinical trial simulation and estimation (SSE) in NONMEM (V.7.4, ICON development solutions, Hanover, USA). In the SSE approach, population PK parameters including their intra-individual and inter-individual variability of a published two-compartment model
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> were used and 500 clinical trials with the proposed sampling design (0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 24â€‰hours after the 1st, 4th and 10th dose) were simulated using the Irrua dosing regimen. The population PK parameters were re-estimated and compared against the known values from the simulation step.
