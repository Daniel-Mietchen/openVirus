<p>Protocol deviations will be defined as non-compliance with the protocol by the investigator team that are not considered protocol violations (eg, missing one blood sample). Protocol violation will be defined as non-compliance to the protocol which reduces the quality or completeness of the data, makes the ICF inaccurate or impacts a participantâ€™s safety, rights or welfare. A protocol violation constitutes serious non-compliance and may lead to exclusion of participants from eligibility analysis and/or their discontinuation from the study.</p>
