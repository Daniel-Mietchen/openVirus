<p>This is a non-interventional observational study with minimal study-related risk for the participant. The biological risk in this study is limited to repeated draws of small amounts of venous blood. This risk encompasses local pain at the venepuncture site, the risk for the development of local haemorrhage due to the blood sampling and bleeding. However, even in haemorrhagic participants bleeding can be stopped by mechanical compression.</p>
