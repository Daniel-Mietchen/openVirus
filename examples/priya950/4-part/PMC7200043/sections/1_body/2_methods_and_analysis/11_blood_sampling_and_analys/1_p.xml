<p>Blood will be taken by laboratory staff of ISTH. Appropriate training in phlebotomy, with the aim to reduce the burden and risk on participants will be provided to all personnel involved prior to the commencement of the trial. A peripheral venous catheter will be inserted on days where more than two blood draws are necessary. Before each blood withdrawal, the catheter will be rinsed and the first 3â€‰mL will be discarded to ensure adequate quality of the blood. At the end of the study, leftover material (eg, heparin plasma which is leftover after all biochemistry analyses have been performed), will be stored at ISTH and BNITM.</p>
