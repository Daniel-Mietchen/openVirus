<p>A non-compartmental analysis (eg, using Phoenix WinNonlin) will be performed to elucidate the classical PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, T1/2, CL, Vd). AUC will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Impairments of renal function and reductions in glomerular filtration, as assessed during routine care, will be accounted for in PK analysis, details will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.</p>
