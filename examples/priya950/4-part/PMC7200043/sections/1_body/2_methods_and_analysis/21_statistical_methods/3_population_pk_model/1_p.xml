<p>A full population PK model will be developed, with the goal to characterise the typical PK parameters of ribavirin and PK variability. Linear as well as non-linear compartmental PK models will be tested using non-linear mixed-effects modelling using NONMEM. Once a suitable structural and variability model is built, all participant data will be used to find covariates significantly determining the interindividual variability in PK.</p>
