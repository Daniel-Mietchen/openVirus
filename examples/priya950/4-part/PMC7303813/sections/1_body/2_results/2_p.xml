 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> displays the incidence rate and hazard ratio (HR) of 5 major events in the EV cohort group and control group. The incidence of ADHD was 28.0/10,000 person-years in the EV cohort group and 21.3/10,000 person-years in the control group. After adjusting for age, sex, paternal occupation, and urbanization level of residence, the EV cohort group had a 1.25 times greater risk for ADHD compared with the control group (HR = 1.25, 95%CI-1.11–1.41). The incidence rates of epilepsy were 13.7/10,000 person-years and 10.7/10,000 person-years in the EV cohort and control group, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was a 1.25 times higher risk for epilepsy in the EV cohort group compared with the control group. Three major allergic diseases were analyzed in this study: asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. The incidence of asthma was 150/10,000 person-years in the EV cohort group and 93.0/10,000 person-years in the control group. The risk of asthma was higher in the EV cohort group after adjusting for confounders (HR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.41–1.58). The incidence of allergic rhinitis in the EV cohort group was 1.37 times higher than that of the control group (incidence rate = 462/10,000 person-years vs. 316/10,000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for confounding factors, there was a 1.37 times higher risk for allergic rhinitis in the EV cohort group (HR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.33–1.42). The incidence rates of atopic dermatitis were 45.6 and 39.3/10,000 person-years, respectively. However, after adjusting for confounders, there was no significant difference in the risk of atopic dermatitis between the two groups (HR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.99–1.19). The cumulative risks for the five major events in the EV cohort group and control group were compared (
