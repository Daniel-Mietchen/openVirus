<p>A comparison of the risks of the five major events between patients with severe or non-severe EV infection was demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. With regard to neurologic diseases, the incidence and risk of ADHD between the severe EV and non-severe EV patients showed no difference (incidence rate = 34.2 vs. 27.4/10,000 person-years, respectively) (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.84–1.47). The incidence of epilepsy was 29.5/10,000 person-years in patients with severe EV infection and 12.1/10,000 person-years in patients with non-severe EV infection. After adjusting for age, sex, paternal occupation, and urbanization of residence, compared with non-severe EV patients, severe EV patients had a 2.36 times greater risk for epilepsy (HR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.62–3.24). Comparing the risk of allergic diseases between the two groups, there was no difference in risk of atopic dermatitis (HR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.88–1.38), but there was a higher risk of asthma (HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.18–1.50) and allergic rhinitis (HR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.08–1.28) in patients with severe EV infection. The cumulative risks for the five major events were compared between the severe EV and non-severe infection groups (
