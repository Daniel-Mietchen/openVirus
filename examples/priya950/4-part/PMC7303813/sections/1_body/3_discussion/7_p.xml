<p>The main strength of this study is that it is the first epidemiological study demonstrating associations of common pediatric diseases with enterovirus infection using data from a nationally representative cohort with a long period of follow-up. Although the data used in this study were obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which is a large, population-based databased with highly reliable in diagnoses due to strict peer review process by qualified specialists, there is certain limitations. It does not contain data related to laboratory tests including viral isolation from tissue, viral serum titer or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the causal relationship cannot be further explored in this study.</p>
