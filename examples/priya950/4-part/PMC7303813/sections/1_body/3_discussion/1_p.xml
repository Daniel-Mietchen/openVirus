The reasons for these changes are thought to be due to improved nutrition and sanitation, implementation of childhood immunization programs for preventing severe pathogens, medical advances in both treating primary diseases and managing serious complications, and better public awareness of chronic health conditions (

Much of the rise in chronic health conditions can be attributed to four common diseases, namely asthma, obesity, mental health disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders. There is a growing recognition that certain chronic diseases stem from infectious diseases. Recent advances in diagnostic techniques have enabled researchers to prove a causal relationship between various infectious agents and chronic diseases (
