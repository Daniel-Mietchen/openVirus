<p>Allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in the general population and their symptoms can last for a long time causing negative effects on quality of life (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Moreover, allergic diseases are a major social burden due to school absence and results in significant medical expenditure worldwide (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Multiple environmental factors also increase the risk of allergic diseases, including increased use of antibiotics, improved hygiene, smaller family sizes, use of volatile products (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and personal factors (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) (obesity and resident lung microbiome). The innate immune response to viral infections was reported to be an important factor for inducing allergic disease during childhood. Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus-induced respiratory infection were shown to be significantly correlated with an increased occurrence of asthma (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Human enterovirus has been reported to be correlated with development of allergic disease (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was identified in 1962, but was previously rare until an outbreak occurred in the United States in 2014. EV-D68 can cause severe respiratory disease similar to human rhinovirus, and exacerbates the severity of symptoms in children with asthma and wheezing (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies reported an increased seroprevalence of enterovirus 71 IgE antibodies and lowered anti-echovirus antibodies in asthmatic children with HFMD (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). An elevated level of circulating follicular helper T cells in children with HFMD has been also reported (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It is reasonable to postulate that enteroviruses influence subsequent risks of allergic diseases in children via the immune system. Recently, Lee et al. observed an increased risk of subsequently developing allergic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis in children who had previously been infected with herpangina and a decreased risk of subsequent occurrence of asthma in children with a prior diagnosis of HFMD compared to the general population, based on an analysis of a large population-based database (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, in our study, increased risks of asthma and allergic rhinitis were noted in children who had previously had an enterovirus infection compared to the general population. We also found an increased risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children who had been hospitalized with severe enterovirus infection compared to children with non-severe enterovirus infection. Nonetheless, there was only a borderline significant difference in risk of atopic dermatitis between the EV cohort and control group. A significantly increased cumulative risk of atopic dermatitis in the follow-up period was observed. The difference between our result and the finding of the aforementioned study might be due to the definitions of disease that were used.
