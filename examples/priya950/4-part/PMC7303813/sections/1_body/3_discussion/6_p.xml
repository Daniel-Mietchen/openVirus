<p>Enteroviruses have been investigated for several decades. A previous study explored associations between the genotypes of enterovirus and the clinical spectrum, but the results showed considerable diversity between causative genotypes in each clinical presentation (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), tic disorders (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and cardiovascular diseases might be associated with enterovirus infections (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). While some of these disorders and diseases have been reported to have a strong causal relationship with enterovirus, such as type I DM, others have shown conflicting findings in the literature. Thus, taken together, the current body of available evidence indicates that enterovirus is closely linked with numerous chronic health conditions, and that for children, this pathogen may confer a considerable long-term health burden extending well into adulthood.
