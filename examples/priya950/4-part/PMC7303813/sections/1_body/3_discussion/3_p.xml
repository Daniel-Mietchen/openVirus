<p>In this study, we compared children with and without EV infection, and found a higher risk of CNS and allergic sequelae in the former group. There was a higher risk of ADHD, epilepsy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis in children with severe EV infection compared with children with non-severe EV infection. The cumulative risks for ADHD, epilepsy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were significantly increased in children with EV infection, especially in children with severe EV infection in the follow-up period.</p>
