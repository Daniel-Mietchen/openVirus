<p>SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA.) was used for data retrieval and data analysis. The descriptive statistical analysis of the EV and control groups, mean and standard deviation was performed to describe the continuous variables, such as age, number and, percentage were used to describe the categorical variables, such as gender, place of residence, and paternal occupation. The differences in the distribution of variables between the EV and control group were compared. 
 <italic>T</italic>-test was used for comparing the continuous variables. Chi-square test was used for comparing categorical variables. The incidence of each disease was calculated using the incidence density. For assessing the risk of major outcomes after EV infection, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Log-Rank test were used for survival analysis. Cox regression models were used to control for confounding factors.
