<p id="p0015">B19V is considered a potential contaminant of blood transfusion products, since virus clearance studies have indicated that solvent detergent-treated plasma lots containing &gt;10
 <sup>7</sup> IU/ml B19V DNA can transmit the virus to patients and seronegative volunteers [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, in some individuals, B19V may persist and the viral genome remain detectable during many months at low (&lt;10
 <sup>3</sup> IU/ml) or high titers (&gt;10
 <sup>4</sup> IU/ml) [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, some blood donors can continue donating while carrying the virus (and potentially infectious virions) in their blood [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, the potential risk of B19V infection for blood recipients should be surveyed.
