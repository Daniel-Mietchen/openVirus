<p id="p0045">The study population included men and women aged 18–65 years who attended Fundación Banco Central de Sangre (FBCS) at Córdoba, Argentina, between July 1 and December 31, 2014. This period was selected for being a post-epidemic year, since during the previous year (2013) an epidemic outbreak of B19V had occurred. Considering 8,400 average donors attending FBCS in a 6-month period, a 95% confidence level, 5% error, and 10% expected loss, the maximized minimum study sample required was 408. For seroprevalence, the estimated IgG frequency was 70% [
