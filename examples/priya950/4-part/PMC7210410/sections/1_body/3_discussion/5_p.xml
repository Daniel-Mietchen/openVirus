<p id="p0110">Prevalence of specific IgG determined in a representative sample was 78%, which is higher than the local prevalence in asymptomatic controls in 2007 and 2012 [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the prevalence in Chile (55%), Brazil (60%), Australia and England (60%) [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Some attribute a higher prevalence in developing countries to widespread circulation and greater transmission of the virus in insufficient conditions of hygiene and bioprotection [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However a seroprevalence rate of nearly 100% in developed countries has also been reported [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], thus the differences observed can be linked to the variability in the circulation of the virus, as considered above. The local 2013 epidemic outbreak supports the high percentage of immune individuals in our 2014 epidemiological scenario.
