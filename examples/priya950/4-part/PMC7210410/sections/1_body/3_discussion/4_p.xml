<p id="p0105">B19V was detected equally in first-time and repeat donors, which is sound given its transmission mainly through the respiratory tract (any type of donor would have a similar risk of acquiring the infection). In contrast, a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted and parenteral pathogens (HIV, 
 <italic>Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus</italic>) has been demonstrated in first-time donors compared to repeat donors [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the other hand, no coinfection with HIV, HBV, HCV, 
 <italic>Human T Lymphotropic Virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, or 
 <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> was detected in B19V-positive cases. Therefore, blood components from these individuals were considered suitable and used for transfusion or production of blood derivatives. This implies that recipient patients were exposed to a potential risk of infection through transfusion, particularly concerning direct blood transfusion.
