<p id="p0095">We demonstrate B19V infection by viral-DNA detection in 0.96% blood donors from Argentina, using a representative sample. Analogous frequency have been documented in Brazil (1.1%) [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Chile (0.8%) [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], United Kingdom (0.9%) and Ghana (1.3%) [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], South Africa (0.9%) [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the United States (0.9%) [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At global level, the detection rate seems more variable: while some European countries have reported the lowest prevalence (The Netherlands, 0.06% [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Belgium, 0.16% [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), the frequency depends on the series studied [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Part of the differences can be assumed to be due to the primers, since the genetic diversity influences the detection of infection especially when nucleic acid based techniques are used [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. But mainly the type of study and sampling and the natural variation in the circulation of B19V can be influencing the results. Being an endemic-epidemic infection, B19V incidence is shaped by spring outbreaks and major epidemics every several years [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The records in our country indicate epidemic outbreaks in the years 2007 and 2013 [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As 2014 was a post-epidemic year and B19V persistence in blood for up to two years has been confirmed [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], these factors can explain the high seroprevalence and viral DNA frequency in our study compared to others.
