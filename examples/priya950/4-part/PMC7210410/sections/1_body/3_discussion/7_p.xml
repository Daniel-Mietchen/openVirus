<p id="p0120">Among the seven B19V-positive individuals, one had no detectable specific antibodies and the rest had IgG (not IgM), which can be interpreted as one ongoing acute infection and six long-term or potential persistent infections. Thereby, local rates of acute and long-term/persistent infections found were high (1.4 and 8.2 per 1,000 donors, respectively). Viremic donors had B19V DNA under the limit of quantification (1 Ã— 10
 <sup>3</sup> IU/ml). Unless it is a very early stage of infection, low viral load detected in donors having ongoing acute infections might not seem in agreement with what could be expected for this stage of infection (this applies for the one case classified as acute infection). In this regard, underestimation of viral load due to B19V genome polymorphisms leading to mismatches in primer binding regions is possible [

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Determination of viral loads should be achieved with a different molecular target assay, but currently, there is not any other available in Argentina. Moreover, the study of blood recipients should be considered in future haemo-surveillance programs in regional blood banks.
