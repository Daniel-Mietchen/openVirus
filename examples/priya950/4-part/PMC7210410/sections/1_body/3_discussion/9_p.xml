<p id="p0130">For pooled-plasma products, FDA recommends B19V nucleic acid testing to identify and prevent the use of plasma units containing B19V DNA. No B19V transmission from pooled-plasma products has been documented when less than 10
 <sup>4</sup> IU/ml B19V DNA are present in an infused product, thus the proposed limit of 10
 <sup>4</sup> IU/ml for the production of plasma pools destined for all plasma derivatives. In contrast, measures to avoid potential B19V transmission by single donation blood products have not been established so far in many countries, although the first cases of transfusion-transmitted B19V infection were reported in the 90s [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since after acute infection B19V DNA can remain detectable in blood for months to years [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], in a repeat-blood donor population this could mean that multiple consecutive B19V DNA-positive donations can be taken from a single donor. In addition, in our series all viremic donors had undetectable IgM, thus strategies to avoid transfusion-transmitted B19V cannot be based on serological screening (anti-B19V IgM is undetectable very early in the infection and in persistent infections). Taking this into account, the molecular screening of blood seems to be the most efficient method to avoid B19V.
