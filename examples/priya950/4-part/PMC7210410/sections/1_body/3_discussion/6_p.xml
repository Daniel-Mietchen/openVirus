<p id="p0115">As expected, anti-B19V IgG prevalence was not different between men and women [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Regarding age distribution, the frequency of IgG-positive individuals was high and also not significantly different between age subgroups (76–79%). However, the frequency of individuals with an indeterminate result of IgG test increased significantly with age (p &lt; 0.0001). This could indicate a decay of detectable levels of circulating antibodies in older adults long time after the primary infection, as observed by Candotti et al. [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, given the possibility of vanishing specific immunity, we could in fact hypothesize about the possible occurrence of B19V reinfections in adults, which has been suggested by others [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this matter, further research on B19V-specific long-time immunity is required, since populations are increasingly long-lived accompanied by increasing probabilities of comorbidity. Consequently, older adults could be a risk-group of reinfection, both acquired in the community and by transfusion.
