<p>In the cross-sectional study of Pacheco et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], data on 11,944 cases of pregnant women were collected from the Colombian National Public Health Surveillance System. In the cases of symptoms reporting, we see that from the reported start date and after serum sample collection for RT-PCR viremia can last up to 21 days. In another case, the virus was detected in the blood serum at 4 and 10 weeks, but not after childbirth, which indicates a persistence of viremia in pregnancy. In the Calvet et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], case study with data from the Brazilian National Public Health Surveillance System, two cases of embryos with microcephaly were studied. Amniotic fluid samples were examined by RT-PCR, and the Zika virus genome was identified in two pregnant women, while at the same time tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus,
