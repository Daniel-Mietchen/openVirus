<p>During the period October 2015â€“February 2016, several cases of fetuses with microcephaly were reported to the Paraiba Institute of Embryonic Medicine, Brazil. Eleven of the 150 pregnant women were selected for this particular study of Melo et al., 2016 [

Amniocentesis was performed on all women for laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection by (PCR). After an initial evaluation of the ultrasound indications, periodic follow-up was performed by fetal medicine specialists as well as magnetic resonance imaging MRI of fetuses; however, 3 of the 11 newborns died shortly after birth. This study analyzes the course from pregnancy to childbirth of 11 embryos exposed to endometrial Zika infection, presenting with prenatal and postnatal brain damage as well as other developmental abnormalities. Moreover, despite the fact that most infants had microcephaly measuring the circumference of the skull, some infants had a measurement that was consistent with their gestational age, as brain atrophy was offset by the circumference of the skull.
