Prevention in pregnancy involves appropriate family planning methods in the endemic areas, thorough parental care in affected countries, avoiding unnecessary trips to endemic countries, especially by people of reproductive age. Based on the available data, a woman who is not pregnant will not be at risk for birth defects in future pregnancies, as long as relative immunity has developed. According to the above recommendations, the importance of prevention by avoiding travel to endemic countries by people of both sexes is emphasized. Contraceptive measures in confirmed cases are proposed at least for a period of 6 months after infection in men. Currently there is no cure or vaccine to prevent Zika virus, the treatment is coincidental and the only way to prevent it is to prevent mosquitoes breeding in stagnant waters, insecticides, and bite protections [
