<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the Zika virus as a flavivirus transmitted in humans by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and infection in early pregnancy is linked with microcephaly and other malformations such as damage to the central nervous system and severe developmental disabilities in children [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference measure that is smaller than a certain measure for infants of the same age and sex. The measure value for microcephaly is more than 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the average. During routine ultrasounds in pregnancy, microcephaly can be diagnosed in the second or early third trimester [
