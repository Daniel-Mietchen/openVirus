<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is a Zika virus transmission risk in Europe and this varies from country to country. Thus, on 2 June 2016, the ongoing transmission of Zika virus by mosquitoes was reported from 60 countries/regions worldwide [

In Europe, from January 2016 to 26 May 2016, the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) recorded 638 imported cases in 18 European countries (36 involving pregnant women), while no native mosquito transmission was recorded. In 2018, in European countries, there were 51 reported non-autochthonous vector-borne cases. A percentage of 56.8% of the virus infection in Europe came from the Caribbean, South East Asia, and American travelers. In 2019, a local vector-borne transmission of Zika virus was reported in France. This is the first time that vector-borne transmission of Zika virus through 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was reported in Europe [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito has not been recorded for many decades (since the early 1950s); however, in 2003â€“2004 the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito was recorded in the country and from then on it was recorded in many parts of the country. In Greece, there is also the risk of the introduction of Zika virus mainly by infected travelers from countries with active virus transmission (or less likely by migrants or by infected mosquitoes, which can be transported by public transport or through commercial activities) [
