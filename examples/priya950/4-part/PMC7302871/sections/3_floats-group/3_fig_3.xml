  <title>Clustering of prophage genes based on sequence identity indicates related families and potential recombination.</title>
  <p>Genes from all prophage identified in complete and closed whole genome sequence of eleven reference strains of 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium were assigned to families based on sequence identity (&gt;90% identity). Prophage genes (columns) were clustered to identify related prophage. The presence of a gene is indicated with a box predicted function based on 
   <italic>in silico</italic> annotation are colour coded based on annotation, terminase (black), capsid (green), recombinase/integrase (purple), tail fibre (blue), other phage associated (red), and hypothetical protein (grey). A cladogram showing the relationship of prophage is based on the pattern of gene presence or absence is indicated (top).
