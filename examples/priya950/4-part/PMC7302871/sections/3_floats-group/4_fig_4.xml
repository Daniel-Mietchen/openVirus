  <title>Genome alignment and phylogenetic relationship of complete and closed reference strains of 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium or used in this study.
  </title>
  <p>Sequence with &gt;90% nucleotide sequence identity are indicated where this is direct alignment (green) or reverse and complement (red). The location of prophage sequence (red bars) or integrative elements (blue bars) are indicated. A maximum likelihood tree based on sequence variation (SNPs) in the core genome with reference to 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain SL1344 (left) is annotated with the most likely order of acquisition (black arrow) or loss (red arrow) of prophage and integrative elements, based on the principle of parsimony.
