<p>In this study we report the population structure, gene flux, recombination and signatures of functional diversification in the whole genome sequence of 131 strains of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium with well characterised epidemiology. To assist in our analysis, we also report high quality complete and closed whole genome sequence of six additional reference genomes, representing diversity within the population structure not represented by previously reported sequence data.
