<p>Resistance to fluoroquinolone and nitrofuran antimicrobials is associated with sequence polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>gyrA</italic> and 
 <italic>parC</italic>, and 
 <italic>nsfA</italic> and 
 <italic>nsfB</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Of four substitutions in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of GyrA and ParC, just GyrA S83F was present in six isolates, four from α12 (pig-associated U288) and two from α8 (DT104 complex), had a sequence polymorphism resulting in GyrA S83F. No other mutations affecting the QRDR were detected. Nitrofuran resistance has been linked to HDCS due to insertion sequence (IS) elements or sequence polymorphisms, primarily of the 
 <italic>nsfA</italic> gene, but occasional secondary mutations in 
 <italic>nsfB</italic> [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The 
 <italic>nsfA</italic> gene was present as an HDCS in just two isolates from subclade β1 and 
 <italic>nsfB</italic> in 22 isolates from subclade β5 (DT56 complex).
