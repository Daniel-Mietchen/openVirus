<p>AMR genes are commonly present on plasmids and we therefore determined the presence of plasmid replicon sequence in short read sequence data from the 131 strains in clades α and β. The IncQ1 plasmid replicon, previously associated with antibiotic resistance [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was widespread, particularly in clade α. The IncF replicon corresponding to the presence of the virulence plasmid pSLT [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was also widespread in 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium as expected, and associated with antibiotic resistance in a number of subclades including ST313 and U288 complex [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The pSLT plasmid varied in size ranging from 96 to 167kb (
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and assembly of pSLT from short read sequence from all 131 isolates indicated no significant difference in the mean size between clades α and β. The pSLT plasmid was notably absent from a number of third-level clades including β5 (DT56), α11 and α17 (monophasic 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST34).
