<p>The presence of multiple third-level clades associated with recent livestock associated epidemic strains in the first level clade α and the relative paucity in clade β suggested that they may be under differential anthropogenic selection pressure. A key anthropogenic selection pressure on microbial populations circulating in livestock is the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs in animal husbandry. Consistent with their distinct epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were common in clades α (mean of 2.7 per strain) and relatively rare in β (mean 0.38 per strain) (
