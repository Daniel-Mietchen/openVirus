<p>A pangenome analysis of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (excluding the ST36 phylogroup) identified 9167 total gene families. The core genome (present in 99–100% of strains) was 3672 genes, soft core genome (95–99%) 388 genes. Shell genome (15–95%) 792 genes, and cloud genes (0–15%) 4315 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). We defined gene families of the accessory genome as non-prophage chromosomal, prophage, plasmid and undefined, based on their location and annotation in the complete and closed genomes of eleven reference strains phylogenetically distributed across S. Typhimurium (
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Gene families not present in reference genomes were classified as ‘undefined’. The accessory genome was defined as genes present in 95% or fewer of isolates and thus represents the major source of genetic variation between strains.
