<p>Together, our analyses are consistent with the view that the common ancestor of the main 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium phylogroup was a broad host range pathogen with little genome degradation capable of circulating within multiple species of livestock. The age of the common ancestor of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is not known and previous attempts to calculate this using Bayesian approaches have been frustrated by a weak molecular clock signal [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. However, the common ancestor of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A was estimated to have existed approximately 500 years ago and provides a frame of reference [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The main 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium phylogroup exhibited greater genetic diversity than reported for 
 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A, with an estimated maximum root to tip SNP accumulation of approximately 750 and 250, respectively. Therefore, the common ancestor of the main 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium phylogroup is likely to have existed earlier than that of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A. However, the S. Typhimurium most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is unlikely to have predated the domestication of livestock, that began around ten thousand years ago [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], raising the possibility that the emergence of this phylogroup was linked to the anthropogenic selection provided by entry into a niche within the domesticated livestock. Subsequent to the emergence of the common ancestor of this phylogroup, a single lineage appears to have spawned multiple lineages, some of which have become highly host adapted to various wild avian species, by a process of convergent evolution with that observed in host adapted serotypes of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> such as 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhi.
