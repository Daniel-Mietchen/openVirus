<p>The annotated assemblies of 131 predominantly 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST19 isolates were used as the input to the pangenome pipeline ROARY [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The presence or absence of genes was determined without splitting orthologues. In order to characterise the contribution of prophage and plasmids to the pangenome, genes were assigned to one of four categories, non-prophage genes located on the chromosome, prophage genes, plasmid genes and undefined genes, based on the similarity to annotated genes of complete and closed whole genome sequence of eleven reference strains. Orthologous genes were identified based on &gt; 90% nucleotide sequence identity using nucmer [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A core-genome reference sequence (genes present in at least 99% of reference strains), was also constructed and used to determine the invasiveness index.
