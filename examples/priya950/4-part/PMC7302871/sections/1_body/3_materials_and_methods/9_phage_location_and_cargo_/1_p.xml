<p>The location of prophage elements in assembled long-read sequences and published reference genome was determined using PHASTER [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], which identified regions as being intact, questionable or incomplete. This yielded a total of 83 potential complete and partial sequences across the 11 representative strains. Prophage sequences were annotated using PROKKA that identified terminase, tail fibre, recombinase/integrase proteins capsid proteins, phage related proteins, and hypothetical proteins.
