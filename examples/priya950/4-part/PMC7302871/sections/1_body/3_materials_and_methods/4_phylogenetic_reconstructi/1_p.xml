<p>The paired-end sequence files for each strain were mapped to the SL1344 reference genome (FQ312003) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] using the Rapid haploid variant calling and core SNP phylogeny pipeline SNIPPY (version 3.0) (

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], outputting monomorphic as well as variant sites and only sites containing A,C,T or G. Variant sites were identified and a core genome variation multifasta alignment generated. The core genome of 134

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was used to estimate population structure using three nested levels of molecular variation and 10 independent runs of the optimization algorithm as reported previously [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The input for this analysis was the same SNP variant matrix for the 131 strains with reference to SL1344 that was used to generate the GTRCAT phylogeny above. Estimation of coverage for our dataset was by determination of CCs with fewer than 100 allelic variants in 1679 whole genome sequences from human clinical infections in the UK in 2014 to 2015, and approximately 20,000 non-UK
