<p>Despite the plausibility of a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, few studies have been conducted to explain the possible molecular mechanism of this phenomenon. It is likely that the flu vaccination may have its protective effect by preventing the activation of the previously described inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, in a study published in 2014, Veljkovic

The results of the study show that the interaction of the antibody with the BKB2R stimulates the production of nitroxide (NO) and induces cardio-protection by increase in myocardial perfusion both through NO-mediated vasodilation and through phenomena of neo-angiogenesis.
