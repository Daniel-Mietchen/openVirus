<p>The FLUVACS, published in 2003, was a randomized, prospective, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial conducted in hospitalized patients whose goal was to test the potential beneficial effect of influenza vaccination in secondary prevention. Two hundred patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction were enrolled within 72 h of the event and 101 patients to be subjected to elective coronary angioplasty. Subjects were randomized to receive influenza or placebo vaccination. In the intention to treat analysis, the primary outcome measure, i.e. the incidence of cardiovascular death at 1 year, was significantly lower among patients receiving vaccination than in the control group (6% and 17%, respectively; 95% CI: 0.17–0.71;

 </xref> However, the results of the subsequent FLUCAD trial, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which 658 patients were already in optimal medical therapy for cardiovascular disease were contrasting. In it, 325 subjects received influenza vaccine and 333 received placebo. The average follow-up was 298 days. With regard to the primary outcome measure of cardiovascular death, the results showed no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups (the cumulative incidence of events was 0.63% in the vaccine group and 0.76% in the control group; 95% CI: 0.15–7.56, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.95). However, the authors showed a tendency to the lower incidence of the composite outcome measure of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization (major adverse cardiac event, MACE) although not statistically significant. However, influenza vaccination statistically significantly reduced the composite outcome measure of MACE occurrence or hospitalizations due to ischaemia compared to the placebo group.
