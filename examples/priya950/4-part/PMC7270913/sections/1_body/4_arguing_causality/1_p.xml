<p>Based on the available evidence, the causal link cannot be defined as certain but at least highly probable. There is a strength of association, as some data, although observational, show that the flu syndrome is associated with an increased risk of ACS; this increase is transient and higher in the first days after infection; therefore, a temporal relationship is highlighted. There is a principle of consistency since many studies, although different because they are conducted on different populations using different designs and different methods of statistical analysis, are globally consistent in results. A principle of coherence is respected: the possibility that the influenza triggers an ACS agrees with the current scientific data according to which both conditions have the same seasonality (winter peak), occur in people with similar characteristics (subjects at higher risk), and both show a similar pathophysiology in the immune, coagulation, and vascular systems. There is a principle of analogy, according to which acute infections can trigger other vascular events, such as stroke similar to ACS and, analogously, ACS can be triggered by other situations or stressful events. There is a strong biological plausibility. However, although an ideal causal link should consist of a univocal relationship between a specific factor and a given outcome (principle of specificity), this criterion is rarely met also in other already widely accepted causal relationships, such as tobacco consumption and development of lung tumour. Therefore, in light of the other characteristics of association, its absence by itself would not be sufficient to disqualify our argument.

 </xref> Furthermore, although there are more generic evidences that show the existence of a biological gradient between type and severity of an infection and ACS risk, specific data to report to the flu syndrome are lacking. For example, the risk of myocardial infarction would be greater after lower respiratory tract infections rather than after urinary tract infection. Furthermore, in pneumococcal infections, the more severe the infection would be, the higher the risk of ACS would result.

 </xref> Finally, there is a lack of solid experimental evidence, since only two randomized clinical trials have been conducted, the FLUVACS and the FLUCAD, with conflicting results.
