<p>The incidence of AMI was still high even after infection with non-influenza respiratory virus, although minor compared to the secondary forms of influenza infection. Specifically, an incidence ratio for AMI emerged for Type B influenza (95% CI: 4.37–23.38), 5.17 for Type A influenza (95% CI: 3.02–8.84), 3.51 for respiratory syncytial virus (95% CI: 1.11–11.12), and 2.77 for other viruses (95% CI: 1.23–6.24).

 </xref> According to these most recent results, therefore acute respiratory infections, and in particular—but not only—the flu, would seem to act as triggers for AMI.
