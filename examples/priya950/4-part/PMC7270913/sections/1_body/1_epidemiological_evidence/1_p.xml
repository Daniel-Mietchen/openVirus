<p>Several studies have shown the existence of an association between respiratory infections and the development of AMI. However, in many of them, the clinical diagnosis of infectious disease was neither sensitive nor specific for the confirmation of influenza virus infection. In this regard, Smeeth

 </xref> in a case–control study, analysed 11 208 subjects hospitalized for ACS, of which 3927 with recent acute respiratory infection. They showed a significantly higher risk of AMI during the first 3 days of acute respiratory infection, with an incidence ratio of 4.19 (95% CI: 3.18–5.53) and a progressive reduction in risk over time. Among other things, it emerged that infections occurring during the influenza epidemic and those coded as ‘likely to be influenza’ were associated with a consistent higher risk of incidence of AMI.
