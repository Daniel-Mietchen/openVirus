<p>Although several studies have analysed the association between various types of infection and acute cardio and cerebrovascular events, convincing evidence of a stronger association has emerged for the flu syndrome. The epidemiological relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and flu syndrome was first observed in 1930 with an increased mortality due to cardiovascular causes in conjunction with the epidemic influenza peak.

 </xref> To date, during influenza epidemics, there is an increased rate of hospitalization and death from cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, and especially for AMI. In this review, we will, therefore, examine the possible causal link between influenza infection and AMI. In general, the search for a causal link is a stimulating but often problematic process. The nine guiding principles that must be respected to provide the foundation for a valid argumentation of this process are the evidence of strength of association, a temporal relation, consistency, coherence, analogy, and biological plausibility; biological gradient, experimental evidence, and specificity.

 </xref> On the basis of these principles, we can now hypothesize the existence of a true causal relationship between flu syndrome and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Arguing this causality is, moreover, not an intellectual exercise for its own sake, since if demonstrated, it would entail important repercussions in the clinical setting as a means to provide further cardiovascular prevention through the systematic use of vaccination.
