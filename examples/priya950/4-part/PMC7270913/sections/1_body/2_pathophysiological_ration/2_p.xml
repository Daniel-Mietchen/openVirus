<p>Influenza infection, in addition to inducing a systemic inflammatory response, would appear to have a direct inflammatory effect on atherosclerotic plaque and coronary arteries, as evidenced experimentally in murine models. Specifically, it was observed that in apo-lipoprotein E-knockout mice, an animal model used for the study of atherosclerosis, infection with influenza virus induces acute inflammation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and fibrin deposition in pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques, showing an ‘histopathological evolution similar to that of culprit lesions of an ACS
