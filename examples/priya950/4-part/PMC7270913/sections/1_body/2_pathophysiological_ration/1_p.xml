<p>The crucial role of inflammation in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now well known; in this sense, it would not be surprising how an acute infection, with all its inflammatory potential, can contribute to the development of myocardial infarction.

 </xref> The physiopathological characteristics of AMI are heterogeneous; while Type 1 myocardial infarction is secondary to thrombosis due to rupture and/or plaque ulceration, Type 2 myocardial infarction is defined as a myocardial necrosis secondary to a discrepancy between oxygen supply and demand.

 </xref> Influenza can be clearly related to Type 2 myocardial infarction due to tachycardia, fever, hypoxia, and changes in vessel tone; and in this case, it is the septic state, rather than coronary thrombosis, the underlying cause of the flu-related myocardial necrosis. However, it has been hypothesized that the influenza through multiple mechanisms can induce or facilitate occlusive phenomena on pre-existing subcritical atherosclerotic plaques. Following the release of inflammatory cytokines, the flu syndrome can favour the triggering of a prothrombotic state, facilitating platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction.

 </xref> Simultaneously, the sympathetic activation and the increased concentration of endogenous catecholamines determine a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response and changes in systemic and coronary vasal tone, with consequent vasoconstriction. Coronary vasoconstriction causes narrowing of the vasal lumen and, due to increased frictional stress (shear stress), further platelet activation.

 </xref> Added to this are changes in the volume status, such as hypovolaemia or hypervolaemia. All these factors at the same time are responsible for an increased biomechanical stress on pre-existing atherosclerotic coronary plaques which facilitate their rupture.
