  <p>The multiple pathways that can lead from a flu syndrome to an acute coronary syndrome. It has been hypothesized that the flu infection leads to acute myocardial infarction through the development of thrombosis on pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques. The increased systemic and coronary inflammatory state and the increased biomechanical stress facilitate the rupture of pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques, with exposure of the underlying thrombogenic material. Add to this, the increased platelet activation, phenomena of endothelial dysfunction and the imbalance of the blood coagulation system in favour of procoagulant factors with consequent formation of occlusive or subocclusive thrombus. Furthermore, the acute infection causes tachycardia, hypoxia, fever, and changes in the volume status. This contributes to the evolution of acute coronary syndrome as it increases metabolic demand and accentuates the discrepancy between oxygen demand and supply. ACS, acute coronary syndrome.</p>
