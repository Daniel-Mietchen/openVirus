<p>The main limitation of this study is the lack of clinical severity and RV vaccination history of patients and their families. Although rotavirus vaccines were licensed in Thailand as optional vaccines since 2006, the vaccine coverage was low. In January 2020, Thailand implemented rotavirus vaccine to all infants. Vaccine introduction was not likely to be the factor contributing to the prevalence of the unusual DS-1-like genogroup in this study and the underlying reason remains to be established. Although our study subjects were mainly Bangkok resident which may not represent the overall national population, data were obtained from a large number of patients.</p>
