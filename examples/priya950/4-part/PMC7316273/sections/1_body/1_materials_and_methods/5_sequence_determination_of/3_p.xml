Phylogenetic trees were constructed and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA 6.0 software. The Kimura-2 correction parameter model and Maximum likelihood method were applied to construct the phylograms of

 <italic>VP4</italic>, and 
 <italic>VP6</italic>. The best-fit models were determined through testing the model parameter. Tree robustness was determined by bootstrapping (1,000 replicates), with bootstrap values &gt;70% considered significant.
