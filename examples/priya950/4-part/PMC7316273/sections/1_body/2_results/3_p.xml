<p>Based on the sequence of 
 <italic>VP6</italic>, an unusual DS-1-like backbone (
 <italic>G1/3/8/9-P[4/6/8]-I2</italic>) was detected predominately in 48.2% (109/226) of RV-positive samples, followed by Wa-like strain (
 <italic>G1/3/8/9-P[6/8]-I1</italic>) (31.9%, 72/226), usual DS-1-like strain (
 <italic>G2-P[4]-I2</italic>) (19.4%, 44/226), and AU-1-like strain (
 <italic>G3-P[10]-I3</italic>) (0.4%, 1/226). When analyzed together with the distribution of 
 <italic>G</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> types, our results showed that 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> (33.2%, 75/226) (unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> (29.6%, 67/226) and Wa-like 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> (3.5%, 8/226)) was the most common genotype, followed by 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> (17.3%, 39/226) (Wa-like 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> (16.4%, 37/226) and unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> (0.9%, 2/226)), 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic> (15.0%, 34/226), and 
 <italic>G1P[6]</italic> (8.4%, 19/226). Uncommon G and P types were additionally detected at low frequencies such as 
 <italic>G3P[4]</italic> (3.5%, 8/226), 
 <italic>G3P[10]</italic> (0.4%, 1/226), and 
 <italic>G4P[8]</italic> (0.4%, 1/226) (
