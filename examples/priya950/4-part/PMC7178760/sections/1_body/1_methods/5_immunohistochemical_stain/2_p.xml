 <sub>646–755</sub>, or the fusion protein vaccine candidate were used as primary antibodies. Frozen human brain sections were washed thrice with PBS after incubation with mice sera. Thereafter, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution, sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the sections were developed with 3–3′-diaminobenzidine and examined using a light microscope, as described previously [
