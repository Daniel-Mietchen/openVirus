<p id="Par14">Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Clinically isolated EV71 strains FY0805 (GenBank accession no. HQ882182) and a mouse-adapted EV71 strain MP10 (GenBank accession no. HQ712020) derived from FY0805 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] were cultured along with RD cells, respectively. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by observing CPE using Reed-Muench method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, working stocks of EV71 containing 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL were prepared for subsequent experiments.
