<p id="Par31">In the previous study, we initially screened the EV71 viral capsid protein for peptide fragments inducing high neutralizing active antibodies, and selected the best combination; its genes were fused via recombinant DNA technology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Subsequently, using a highly efficient prokaryotic expression system, the fused protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and dissolved, purified, and refolded to form pentameric molecules, and finally assembled into spherical particles [

The highest dosage of the fusion protein (10 μg for immunization) and booster immunization induced specific serum antibodies with the highest neutralization titers, and the protective antibodies were transmitted from the dams to the progeny, thereby protecting the neonatal mice from EV71-mediated damage. Meantime, immunoprotective effects were also observed in neonatal mice after immunization with the fusion protein. Combined with the increased proliferation of splenocytes and secretion of cytokines (including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5), according to our previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the fusion protein effectively induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.
