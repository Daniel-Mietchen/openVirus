<p id="Par33">The fusion protein vaccine used herein is derived from our optimization of a previous vaccine comprising a combination of peptides. Upon fusing the four gene fragments, the expression and purification of the four proteins was reduced to that of one corresponding protein, thereby saving time and production expenses. Moreover, compared with vaccines containing inactivated virus, the present vaccine candidate containing this fusion protein has a greater advantage with respect to its production and aggregation of dominant epitopes. Although its immunoprotective effect was inferior to that of the vaccine containing inactivated virus, it evidently exerted adequate immunoprotective effects via antibody production to prevent EV71-mediated damage to neonatal mice, thereby being a promising therapeutic alternative.</p>
