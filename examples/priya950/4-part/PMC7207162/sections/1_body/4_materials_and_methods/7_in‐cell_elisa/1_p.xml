<p>MDCKII cells were transfected with pAAV‐HA, pAAV‐mHL1 + transmembrane region or with pcHA3 for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with AAV‐HA, AAV‐cHA, or AAV‐GFP mouse serum (1:250), or C179 (1:250) for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, cells were incubated with anti‐mouse‐IgG‐HRP (1:1,000; Agilent Technologies) for 1 h at 37°C before plates were washed again, and 1‐Step™ Ultra TMB‐ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was added for 10 min until color reaction was stopped with 1 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. Optical density was measured at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450 nm</sub>), and values were normalized to AAV‐GFP‐negative control values.
