<p>Animal sera were inactivated with trypsin‐heat‐KIO
 <sub>4</sub> treatment (WHO, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Twofold dilutions of sera in PBS were prepared in 25 μl per 96‐well. Four HAU per 25 μl PBS of influenza virus were added to each well, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. 50 μl of 1% chicken red blood cells in PBS was added to each well, and samples were incubated at 4°C for 20 min before agglutination inhibition titers were determined as lowest serum dilution with a clear agglutination clot. The limit of detection was a dilution of 1:40.
