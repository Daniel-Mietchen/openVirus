<p>Unmodified 15‐mer peptides overlapping by five amino acids (peptides &amp; elephants GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) were reconstituted in 50% DMSO in H
 <sub>2</sub>O. MaxiSorb ELISA plates (Thermo Fischer Scientific) were coated with 1 μg of peptide in 50 μl carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH = 9.6) per well overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked 1 h at 37°C with 1% BSA in PBST
 <sup>1%</sup> before mouse serum (1:200) in 50 μl blocking buffer was added and plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After washing, plates were incubated with anti‐mouse‐IgG‐HRP (1:500; Agilent Technologies) for 45 min at 37°C, before plates were washed again and ‐Step™ Ultra TMB‐ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was added for 10–20 min until color reaction was stopped with 1 M H

 <sub>4</sub>. Optical density was measured at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450 nm</sub>). Values were normalized to negative control serum (AAV‐GFP).
