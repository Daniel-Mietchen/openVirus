<p>293T were maintained in DMEM, and MDCKII cells in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 
 <sc>l</sc>‐glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were taken from the tissue culture collection of RKI's unit 17 and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Infections with influenza viruses were performed in cell culture medium with 0.2% BSA and TPCK‐treated trypsin. Influenza A viruses (BSL2: A/California/7/2009 ((H1N1)pdm); A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1); A/Widgeon/DK/66174/2004 (H2N3); X31 (H3N2); A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2); A/Mallard/NVP/9417/2004 (H10N7); A/Gull/MD/704/1977 (H13N6); BSL3: HA/NA‐1918 × WSN/1933 reassortant (H1N1); A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1); A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)) were propagated in 11‐day‐old embryonated chicken eggs. Allantoic fluid harvested from infected eggs was purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion and resuspended in PBS before protein content was determined via BCA (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Infectious titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCKII cells. Whole‐inactivated Cal/7/9 reassortant virus (X‐181) (WIV) used for vaccination of mice was kindly provided by Othmar Engelhardt (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), Potters Bar, UK). Briefly, virus was grown on 11‐day‐old embryonated chicken eggs, inactivated with β‐propiolactone, and purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. Protein content was determined by Lowry assay. A sample was deglycosylated and separated on reducing SDS–PAGE, and viral protein content was determined with Coomassie staining. Antigenicity of the preparation was verified using single‐radial diffusion assay with Cal/7/9‐specific sheep serum.
