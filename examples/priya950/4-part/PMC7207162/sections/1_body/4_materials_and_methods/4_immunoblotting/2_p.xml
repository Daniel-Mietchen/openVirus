<p>4–8 μg per lane of sucrose‐purified influenza viruses was separated on SDS–PAGE under denaturing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Amount loaded per lane was normalized to yield equal intensities of HA2 with an anti‐HA2 antibody (1:500; orb10765; Biorbyt, Eching, Germany). Western blotting was performed by incubation with mouse serum (1:500) and suited secondary antibody coupled to HRP (1:10,000; Agilent Technologies). Blots were developed on X‐ray films (Thermo Fischer Scientific) after addition of SuperSignal™ West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fischer Scientific).</p>
