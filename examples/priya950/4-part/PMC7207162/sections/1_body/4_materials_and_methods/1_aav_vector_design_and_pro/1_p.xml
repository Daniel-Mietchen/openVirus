<p>All antigens were based on HA or NP of Cal/7/9 (H1N1)pdm virus and were codon‐optimized to mammalian gene expression and 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized (GeneArt
 <sup>®</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Regensburg, Germany). The construction of AAV‐HA and AV‐NP has been described before (Sipo 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The initial headless HA (HL) gene was constructed by replacement of the sequence between codons of cysteine52 and cysteine277 (“head”) of HA1 with a tetra‐glycine linker as described before (Steel 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Three different chimeric HAs (cHA) were constructed by insertion of the head regions, i.e., regions cysteine
 <sub>52</sub>–cysteine
 <sub>277</sub>, derived from of avian influenza A viruses of the subtypes H2, H10, or H13 into the respective region of the headless HA, thereby removing the glycine linker. Modified headless proteins 1 and 2 (mHL1 and mHL2) were constructed by transferring the mutations described (Impagliazzo 
 <italic>et al</italic>,

 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) into the Cal/7/9 HA. All constructs were inserted into the AAV vector plasmid in between the AAV2 ITRs, downstream of a CMV promoter and an irrelevant intron and upstream of a V5‐tag and polyadenylation/termination signal. AAV9‐vector stocks were prepared by triple transfection of the AAV‐vector plasmid (pAAV), p5E18‐VD2/9 (AAV2 Rep, AAV9 Cap), and pHelper (adenovirus helper genes; Addgene) into 293T cells for 72 h. Cells were lysed with sodium deoxycholate, and non‐encapsidated DNA was digested with benzonase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). AAV vector particles were purified via isopycnic centrifugation through an iodixanol (Axis‐Shield, Dundee, UK) step gradient and concentrated with Amicon Ultra‐15 filter units (Merck). High quantity and quality of AAV9‐vector stocks were verified by infectious titer determination, electron microscopy, ELISA, and TaqMan qPCR (forward primer: 5′‐TGGAGTTCCGCGTTACATAACTTAC‐3′; reverse primer: 5′‐CTATTGGCGTTACTATGGGAACATAC‐3′, probe: 5′‐FAM‐CCTGGCTGACCGCCCAACGAC‐BBQ‐3′) using Platinum‐Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany) with an initial denaturation step at 95°C—10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C—15 s; 60°C—20 s; 72°C—10 s in a Roche LightCycler 480. Tenfold dilutions of 
 <italic>SmaI</italic>‐digested pAAV plasmid DNA (1 ng/μl) were used as standard to calculate absolute amounts of AAV vector genomes per microliter.
