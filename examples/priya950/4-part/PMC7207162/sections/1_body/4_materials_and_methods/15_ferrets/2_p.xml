<p>Ferrets were monitored daily for signs of disease using a 0‐1‐2 scale for each activity (normal, calm, depressed), respiratory signs (sneezing, nose exudate, and congestion), and general clinical signs. Zero indicates minimal deviation from the physiological state, 1 indicates moderate nasal discharge, congestion, and/or occasional sneezing and/or calm temper, while 2 indicates severe nasal discharge and/or labored breathing, dyspnea, and frequent sneezing and/or depressed manner (Walz

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Final clinical scores were calculated by summation of activity, respiratory signs, and general clinical sign records per ferret per time point. Changes in body weight and body temperature were measured. On day 3 post‐infection, animals were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg), exsanguinated, and nasal turbinates, trachea and lung were harvested. Nasal turbinates and samples of the trachea and the lung were homogenized, and virus titers were determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay as described before (Walz 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Lung samples were immersion‐fixed in formalin for histopathological examination.
