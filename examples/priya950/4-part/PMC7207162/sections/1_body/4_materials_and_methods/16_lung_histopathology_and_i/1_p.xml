<p>Formalin‐fixed trachea and lung samples were embedded in paraffin, cut in 2‐μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) after dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in decreasing ethanols. Lung sections were microscopically evaluated by board‐certified veterinary pathologists (KD, ADG) in a blinded fashion to assess character and severity of pathologic lesions using lung‐specific inflammation score parameters for quantifying influenza virus‐induced pneumonia as described (Dietert 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). These parameters included severity of (i) interstitial pneumonia with infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils (ii) bronchitis, (iii) epithelial necrosis of bronchi, alveoli, and submucosal glands, (iv) perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, and (v) hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes.
