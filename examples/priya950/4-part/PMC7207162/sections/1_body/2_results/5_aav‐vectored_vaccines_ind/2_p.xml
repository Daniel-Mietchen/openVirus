<p>While it was initially proposed that only HA‐stalk antibodies rely on activation of FcγR to execute their protective effect, this view has recently been revised to acknowledge that all broadly reactive HA antibodies require activation of FcγR to mediate protection (DiLillo 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether both head and stalk antibodies contained in the AAV‐HA sera could activate FcγR. To quantify the influence of the HA‐head domain on FcγR activation, we assessed serum antibodies with transfected target cells expressing either complete HA or a stalk‐only HA (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>C and D). In fact, the signal observed with the complete HA was much more pronounced in comparison with HA‐stalk‐only expressing cells, indicating that AAV‐HA induces FcγR‐activating stalk and head antibodies (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). As expected, as AAV‐cHA‐induced sera contained mainly HA‐stalk antibodies (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), signal intensities were comparable with both antigens, whereas WIV antiserum stimulated very poorly (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). These results indicate that AAV‐HA, AAV‐NP, and AAV‐cHA vaccines potently induce broadly reactive FcγR‐activating antibodies. Furthermore, AAV‐HA, in contrast to AAV‐cHA, induced FcγR‐activating antibodies against the HA‐stalk and HA‐head regions.
