<p>Recent work on humoral responses against HA has raised great interest into non‐neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the canonical antigenic sites, but are capable of activating ADCC or other protective responses (Henry Dunand

 <italic>via</italic> immunoblot the differential binding to HA1 and HA2 subunits of four different H1N1 viruses spanning more than 90 years of influenza virus evolution (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>A). HA1 contains the head region, whereas most of the stalk is located on HA2. All serum pools were diluted equally allowing to compare the relative abundances of antibodies recognizing either HA1 or HA2, respectively, among the vaccine groups. AAV‐HA vaccination induced antibodies reacting with the HA1 domain of the pandemic Cal/7/9 and A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (BM/1/1918) viruses, but not of PR8 or seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 (Bris/59/7) virus (Figs

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>B). This is in line with the related antigenicity of the two pandemic strains (Medina 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>A). AAV‐HA serum also detected the HA2 of the Cal/7/9, PR8, and Bris/59/7 strains, indicating the additional induction of antibodies binding to the HA stalk (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>B). The induction of stalk antibodies was also suggested by reactivity of AAV‐HA serum toward headless and chimeric HAs that were in parallel confirmed to carry a native stalk conformation as judged by C179 binding (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>C). Compared to that, AAV‐cHA immunization induced a stronger HA2 antibody response recognizing all four H1N1 viruses, but no antibodies against HA1 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Interestingly, the difference in reactivity between AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA induced antibodies toward a natively folded H1‐stalk‐antigen as measured by in‐cell ELISA was not as pronounced as toward the denatured antigen in immunoblot, indicating that AAV‐HA sera contain a considerable proportion of conformational HA‐stalk antibodies (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>C). An epitope screen with overlapping 15‐mer peptides derived from Cal/7/9 HA verified the presence of HA‐head and HA‐stalk antibodies in the AAV‐HA sera as it identified five surface‐exposed peptides including amino acid positions 168–182 (Pep16), 308–322 (Pep30), 398–412 (Pep39), 418–432 (Pep41), and 488–502 (Pep48) reacting significantly stronger with AAV‐HA serum compared to AAV‐GFP negative control serum (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>D). Mapping of these peptides onto the 3D‐structure of H1N1 HA revealed that the identified epitopes included amino acids surrounding the RBS, at the lateral site of the head and/or the upper part of the stalk region, as well as at the membrane proximal part of the HA stalk (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Interestingly, and quite unexpected, intranasal WIV consistently induced mostly HA2‐specific antibodies, too (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). When given by the i.m route, however, the WIV preparation elicited the expected spectrum of antibodies binding also to HA1 and containing HAI
 <sup>+</sup> and MN
 <sup>+</sup> activity confirming its immunogenicity (
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S2</xref>). No peptide with significant binding was identified in the epitope screen with intranasal WIV or AAV‐cHA antisera, although a peptide with increased reactivity was identified with AAV‐cHA sera, which appeared to be buried within the HA stalk (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>E (arrow) and F).
