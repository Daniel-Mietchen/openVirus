<p>We evaluated the potency of AAV vectors expressing influenza virus wild‐type HA and NP, or cHA and headless HA antigens to confer broad protection from influenza virus challenge in comparison with an inactivated vaccine (Fig

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). The cHA contained the stalk region of Cal/7/9 and head regions derived from influenza A virus subtypes H2 (cHA1), H10 (cHA2), or H13 (cHA3) that currently not circulate in humans. Furthermore, three different headless HA constructs were tested, either containing merely the deletion of the head region (headless HA, HL), or further modifications that increase their antigenicity (modified headless 1 and 2, mHL1 and mHL2; Fig

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Initially, we assessed correct folding of the HA‐stalk within the constructs with the prototypic conformational stalk antibody C179, as several broadly reactive antibodies recognize conformational epitopes (Fig

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Wild‐type HA and cHA3 displayed the C179 epitope, while cHA1 and mHL1 showed reduced binding to C179 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). cHA2, headless HA and mHL2 were only faintly detectable with C179 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Of note, all cHA were detected by immune sera raised against the respective parental influenza virus HA subtype, i.e., H2, H10, or H13, indicating correct recapitulation of the structure of the respective HA head (
