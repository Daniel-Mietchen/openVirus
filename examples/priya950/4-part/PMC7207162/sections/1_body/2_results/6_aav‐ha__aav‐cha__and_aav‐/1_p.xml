<p>To assess homologous and heterologous protection, groups of mice were challenged with lethal doses of the divergent H1N1 viruses Cal/7/9 or PR8 that differ in their HA1 amino acid sequence by more than 25% (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>A). After Cal/7/9 challenge, AAV‐HA‐ and AAV‐NP‐immunized animals were completely protected, while all animals of the negative control group (AAV‐GFP) succumbed to the infection (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). AAV‐cHA and WIV protected four out of five animals. Only AAV‐HA‐immunized mice did not show any sign of weight loss, likely corresponding to the presence of neutralizing antibodies (Figs

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>A, and Table 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All other groups showed about 10% mean maximum weight loss. Nevertheless, surviving animals recovered quickly and were able to clear the virus at the end of the 14‐day monitoring period (Figs
