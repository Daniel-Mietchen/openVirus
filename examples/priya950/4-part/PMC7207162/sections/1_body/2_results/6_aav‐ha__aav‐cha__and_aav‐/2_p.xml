<p>To evaluate protection against a heterologous H1N1 strain, mice were challenged with PR8. Although lethal for control animals (AAV‐GFP), the dose used for the first challenge experiment did not reveal differences in survival rates of vaccinated groups (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). However, AAV‐HA‐, AAV‐cHA‐, and AAV‐NP‐immunized animals showed only moderate mean maximum weight loss (3–4.5%), which was significantly less than in the AAV‐GFP‐vaccinated animals (21%) (Figs

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>C). In contrast, WIV‐immunized animals experienced up to 10% mean maximum weight loss. As with Cal/7/9 challenge, those animals were finally able to clear the virus, despite the absence of pre‐existing neutralizing antibodies against PR8 (Fig

This result indicated that the AAV‐vectored vaccines were superior to the inactivated vaccine against heterologous challenge in reducing the extent of weight loss. To evaluate the effect of the HA‐based AAV vector vaccines on protection, we conducted another PR8 challenge with a higher inoculation dose. Here, the majority of mice immunized with AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA were protected from severe disease and death (71%; 5/7), which was also reflected by mean maximum weight loss of 10% (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E and F, and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>E). In contrast, WIV‐immunized and negative control (AAV‐GFP) animals were not protected (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E and F). Interestingly, at 3 days post‐infection with PR8, virus titers in the lungs were comparable among all groups. At the end of the monitoring period, however, only AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA vaccination led to a significant reduction in mean lung virus titers compared to the other groups (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>F). In summary, these results indicate that three doses of AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA were superior to two doses of WIV in reducing mortality and disease severity against heterologous influenza challenge in mice.
