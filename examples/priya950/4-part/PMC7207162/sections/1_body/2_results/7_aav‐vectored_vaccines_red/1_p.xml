<p>The protective efficacy of AAV‐vectored vaccines was finally assessed in ferrets, as they most closely reproduce the course of human influenza (Enkirch &amp; von Messling, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). While focusing on HA‐based vaccines, groups of four animals were vaccinated three times in 4‐week intervals with AAV‐HA, AAV‐cHA, or AAV‐GFP (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). As control, one group was given two doses of the commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) of season 2017/18 by the intramuscular route. The H1N1 component of QIV of this season contained A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm which is closely related to Cal/7/9. In fact, ferret convalescent sera raised against Cal/7/9 react undistinguishably with A/Michigan/45/2015 (WHO,

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). However, a statistically significant continuous increase of antibody titers over time was only seen in the AAV‐HA group. As observed in mice, HAI
 <sup>+</sup> and MN
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies against the homologous Cal/7/9 viruses were only found in AAV‐HA‐immunized animals (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). To exclude that QIV immunization induced HAI
 <sup>+</sup> and MN
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies specific for A/Michigan/45/2015 virus but not Cal/7/09, we repeated these assays with the respective virus. As with Cal/7/9, only AAV‐HA‐immunized ferrets mounted MN
 <sup>+</sup> or HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies against A/Michigan/45/2015 (Fig
