 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). During the 3‐day challenge period, clinical signs of influenza were monitored, and weight and temperature were measured. At day 3 post‐infection, animals were sacrificed, and nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs were collected and processed for virus titration and/or histopathological examination (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). All animals developed classical signs of influenza disease starting on day 1, including serous nasal exudate, congestion, frequent sneezing, wheezing, and depression (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). However, ferrets receiving AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA recovered more quickly as evidenced by a return to normal activity levels and improvement of respiratory signs compared to QIV and AAV‐GFP‐immunized groups. Moreover, for AAV‐HA‐immunized animals, a milder clinical course was associated with high MN
 <sup>+</sup> and HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibody titers (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>D). Upon infection, body temperature increased in all animals, which continued to increase in QIV‐immunized animals until day 3 post‐infection, while only a short fever peak was seen in the AAV vector vaccinated groups (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Moreover, maximum weight loss of QIV‐immunized animals was more severe (up to 10%) compared to the other groups (3–6%; Fig
