<p>To analyze the characteristics of the serum antibody responses, we initially determined hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody titers. The level of HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies that block the RBS and interfere with attachment is a key parameter for evaluation of currently licensed inactivated vaccines. Neutralizing antibodies, though not necessarily binding directly to the RBS, can also inhibit later steps in the viral replication cycle as well (Brandenburg 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). To capture such effects, we performed microneutralization (MN) assays (He 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). HAI
 <sup>+</sup> and MN
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies against the homologous Cal/7/9 virus were found only in animals immunized with AAV‐HA (Table 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, these antibodies were specific for Cal/7/9 and did not react with another H1N1 or H3N2 virus. Sera from AAV‐cHA‐immunized animals were MN
 <sup>+</sup> and HAI
 <sup>+</sup> against H13N6, i.e., the parental subtype of cHA3 used for prime immunization, but were negative for all other tested viruses including the parental subtypes of the cHA used for immunization 2 and 3 (H2, H10) (

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Intranasal WIV, as well as AAV‐NP and AAV‐GFP did not induce HAI
 <sup>+</sup> or MN
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies (Table 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The lack of MN
 <sup>+</sup> and HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies following WIV application depended on the intranasal immunization route, as intramuscular (i.m.) injection with the same vaccine preparation led to the expected robust induction of MN
 <sup>+</sup> and HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies (
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S2</xref>). These results indicate that immunization by AAV in our scheme elicited MN
 <sup>+</sup> and HAI
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies toward the HA‐head domain of the virus used for prime immunization.
