<p>IgA antibodies confer protection to respiratory pathogens due to their high local abundance in the airway mucosa (Asahi

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). We determined pre‐challenge levels of serum IgA (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>H) as well as post‐challenge levels of IgA in lung homogenates (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>I). AAV‐HA and AAV‐NP immunization induced IgA antibodies in the serum as well as in the lung against Cal/7/9. In contrast, IgA was not or barely detectable in serum and lung, respectively, after AAV‐cHA immunization. Only AAV‐NP‐immunized mice mounted serum and lung IgA antibodies against heterologous A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>H and I). Interestingly, increased levels of IgA were detectable in lung homogenates but not in sera of WIV‐immunized mice against both Cal/7/9 and PR8 (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>H and I). In summary, antibodies were induced at least against some group 1 HA including the subtypes H1N1 and H5N1 after immunization with AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA, while AAV‐NP and WIV immunization led to antibody responses reacting with influenza A viruses from both antigenic groups.
