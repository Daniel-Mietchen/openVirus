<p>AAV‐HA, AAV‐cHA, AAV‐NP, and WIV induced broadened antibody responses (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D–G). AAV‐HA triggered a strong response mainly against H1N1 viruses, including pandemic H1N1 virus from 1918, but also H5N1 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Although reacting weaker with Cal/7/9 and the 1918 pandemic H1N1 viruses, AAV‐cHA sera reacted also with H5N1 and two of the cHA parental group 1 viruses (subtypes H2 and H13) (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). Both, AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA, did, however, not induce antibodies against group 2 viruses (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D and E). In contrast, AAV‐NP induced a strong antibody response covering viruses from both antigenic HA groups, including subtypes H3N2 and H7N9, most likely due to the high conservation of NP (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). Unexpectedly, WIV vaccination also induced broadly reactive antibodies covering several subtypes of group 1 and 2, though at lower intensities (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G).
