  <title>Problem</title>
  <p>Current seasonal influenza vaccines show low effectiveness and protection is limited to the virus strains contained within the vaccine. High morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza and the risk of emergence of pandemic and/or zoonotic virus strains emphasize the urgent need for a broadly reactive vaccine.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>AAV vectors were used to deliver influenza antigens to the lung of mice and ferrets to induce protective immunity. AAV vectors expressing HA, NP, or chimeric HA were shown to protect mice from challenge with divergent H1N1 virus strains. This was associated with the induction of non‐neutralizing but FcγR‐activating antibodies. AAV‐HA was also shown to induce protective immunity in ferrets against a homologous H1N1 challenge.</p>

  <title>Impact</title>
  <p>The results of this work demonstrate that the AAV vectors are promising carriers for a broadly reactive influenza vaccine. The vectored expression of the antigen was shown to balance the immune response toward more conserved broadly reactive epitopes within the influenza virus antigens and to induce high levels of FcγR‐activating antibodies. Furthermore, the licensure of AAV vector for human gene therapy could ease further clinical development of a vaccine.</p>
