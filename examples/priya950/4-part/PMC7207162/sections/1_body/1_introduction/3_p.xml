<p>The seasonal vaccine predominantly induces antibodies targeting epitopes at or surrounding the receptor binding site (RBS) within the globular HA‐head region (Caton

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>). Since these epitopes are highly variable, antibodies show limited cross‐protection (Yu 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Significantly, broadly protective antibodies recognizing conserved epitopes in the membrane proximal HA‐stalk or in the HA‐head region have been discovered in mice and humans recently (Wu &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The majority of broadly reactive HA antibodies does not interfere with receptor attachment (Brandenburg 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). They rather execute their protective effect 
 <italic>via</italic> interference with later steps in the viral replicative cycle or 
 <italic>via</italic> Fc‐receptor (FcR)‐mediated mechanisms, including antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (DiLillo 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Vaccination with inactivated influenza antigen alone is not able to efficiently induce ADCC‐activating antibodies in a non‐human primate model (Jegaskanda 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, pre‐existing ADCC‐activating antibody titers induced following natural infection could be boosted in humans by inactivated vaccine, indicating that efficient priming is imperative to elicit such antibodies (Jegaskanda
