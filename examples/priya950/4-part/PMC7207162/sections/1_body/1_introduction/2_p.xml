<p>Currently, the most effective prophylaxis against influenza is immunization with trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccines, most of which contain inactivated antigenic components of current seasonal influenza A and B viruses. However, protection is mainly virus strain‐specific, and the efficacy against non‐matched strains is generally poor. Although a more broadly reactive live‐attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is available for children, its usefulness is limited in adults due to pre‐existing immunity against previously encountered influenza viruses (Belshe

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Seasonal influenza vaccination also does not provide protection against shifted or emerging zoonotic influenza A virus strains, e.g., H5N1 or H7N9, which can be associated with increased disease severity (WHO,
