<p>Influenza remains a severe public health threat. The infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in very young or very old individuals, and has thus considerable socio‐economic impact (WHO, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2018b</xref>). Currently, influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 as well as the influenza B virus lineages Victoria and Yamagata circulate in humans. Influenza viruses are genetically and antigenically highly variable, resulting in recurrent epidemics in humans (“flu season”). The main mechanism driving this variability is antigen drift caused by the accumulation of point mutations in the antigenic surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Moreover, reassortment between influenza A virus subtypes can generate even larger antigenic alterations, which may allow for a pandemic circulation in a naïve population (Palese,
