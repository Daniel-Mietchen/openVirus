<p>Here, we show that vaccine delivery by the AAV‐HA and cHA vectors resulted in the favorable induction of broadly reactive and FcγR‐activating antibodies, which was not achieved with inactivated vaccine given either by the intranasal (this study) or intramuscular routes (Angeletti

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Important factors leading to this finding included most likely continuous generation of antigen by respiratory cells after mucosal immunization, and the lung‐specific environment, which influences processing and presentation of antigen to cells of the adaptive immune system (Angeletti 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We speculate that this vectored delivery resulted in more effective priming of rare B cells recognizing conserved epitopes in the HA stalk (Ellebedy 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Hence, AAV vectors might be usable in a naïve human population to efficiently prime a broadly reactive B‐cell memory, or to boost and maintain such a response in influenza experienced individuals (Andrews 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In conclusion, the data suggest a large potential for the development of AAV vectors into a carrier for a broadly protective influenza vaccine.
