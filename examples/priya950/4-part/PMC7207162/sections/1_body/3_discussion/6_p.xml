<p>AAV‐NP immunization induced a remarkably broad antibody response covering all tested influenza viruses and capable to activate FcγR, despite the fact that NP is considered a major stimulus of cytotoxic T‐cell immunity (Sipo

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Previous studies suggested a protective capacity of NP‐specific FcγR‐activating antibodies (Vanderven 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). However, the exact mechanism remains unclear, since these antibodies target a viral antigen supposedly localized in the interior of the virion or host cell (Bodewes 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Besides ADCC induction, FcγR regulates innate and adaptive immunity, including antibody responses themselves by regulation of B‐cell selection, maturation, and survival (Bournazos &amp; Ravetch, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The finding that AAV‐NP induced antibodies potently activated the murine inhibitory FcγRIIB might suggest rather a regulatory role of these antibodies. However, both humoral and cellular immunity will likely contribute to NP‐mediated protection. Further experiments are needed to extend knowledge on involved protective mechanisms (Carragher
