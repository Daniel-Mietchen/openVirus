<p>In ferrets that are considered the animal model recapitulating most aspects of human influenza, we could for the first time show that active immunization with AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA confers protection against a homologous viral challenge. However, only AAV‐HA‐immunized ferrets showed reduced virus replication and lung pathology, likely due to induction of neutralizing antibodies against (H1N1)pdm viruses in these animals. Though AAV‐cHA immunization symptomatically protected ferrets as indicated by a reduced clinical score, no reduction in virus titer was seen. This is in contrast to a study where vaccination with different cHA expressed by influenza B‐, VSV‐, or AdV vectors reduced viral titers (Krammer

It can only be speculated on the reasons, but this might be a consequence of the lack of protective antibody allowing for more efficient replication and severe damage of the upper respiratory tract compared to the other groups, which might have resulted in a different manifestation of disease. This topic clearly requires further investigations.
