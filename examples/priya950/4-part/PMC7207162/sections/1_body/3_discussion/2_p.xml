<p>Using the AAV vector, our study confirmed that sequential immunization with different cHA focuses the humoral response to the HA stalk and provides heterologous protection. However, it was unexpected to find that also AAV‐vectored full‐length HA was able to elicit not only neutralizing, but also substantial levels of HA‐stalk‐specific antibodies. This conclusion is supported by the observations that AAV‐HA‐induced antibodies (i) detected the HA2 domain in the immunoblot assay (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), (ii) bound to peptides derived from the HA‐stalk region (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), and (iii) reacted with a natively folded HA‐stalk construct, as measured by in‐cell ELISA (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>C). Hence, AAV‐HA immunization induced conformational and non‐conformational HA‐stalk antibodies. Additionally, AAV‐HA immunization had in contrast to AAV‐cHA the benefit of mounting HAI
 <sup>+</sup> and MN
 <sup>+</sup> antibodies toward the HA head of the homologous H1N1 virus. The importance of broadly reactive antibodies against the HA head employing novel modes of action has been demonstrated recently (Bangaru

 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Such antibodies might be induced by AAV‐HA as well. AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA also induced FcγR‐activating antibodies targeting homologous and heterologous viruses (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which is a desirable property as most broadly reactive antibodies require activation of FcR to mediate protection (DiLillo 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Interestingly, AAV‐HA immunization triggered FcγR‐activating antibodies not only toward the HA stalk, but also against epitopes present only in the context of full‐length HA, likely located in the HA‐head domain (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Consequently, we observed that immunization with AAV‐HA conferred sterile immunity against a homologous virus, and heterologous protection toward a drifted H1N1 virus. The precise extent of FcγR‐mediated effector functions in the observed heterologous protection by AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA remains to be determined. While Cal/7/9‐specific FcγR‐activating responses were more potent with the activating FcγR (I, III, and IV), which are associated with induction of ADCC, highest titers of heterologous FcγR‐activating antibodies were reached with the inhibitory FcγR‐IIB. Thus, a regulatory role of these antibodies might be indicated, favoring for example enhanced B‐cell responses (Wang
