<p>Unexpectedly, none of three tested headless HA appeared to be immunogenic or conferred protection when expressed from an AAV vector (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>G–J). Other headless HA‐based approaches relied on heterologous prime/boost regimens (DNA/VLP, i.n./i.m.), carrier particles, or adjuvants to increase immunogenicity and stimulate immune responses (Steel

A recent study suggested that poor immunogenicity of headless HA was associated with the inability to robustly induce T‐follicular helper cells, thus limiting B‐cell responses, which could only be overcome by linkage to an immunogenic carrier (Tan 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Interestingly, lack of immunogenicity was also found with a MVA vector expressing headless HA (Hessel 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This could be circumvented by vectored co‐expression of the strongly immunogenic NP, probably allowing for more efficient induction of HA‐stalk antibody‐secreting cells after intermolecular help by NP‐specific CD4 T cells (Hessel 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Alam 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In our study, a bivalent AAV‐mHL1 + AAV‐NP vaccine had no such effect, probably because mHL1 and NP had to be expressed from two AAV vectors due to the restricted packaging capacity, thereby limiting simultaneous uptake of both antigens into one cell. Thus, an AAV‐vectored approach solely based on headless HA does currently not seem to be feasible.
