 <p>The current seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine protects only against a narrow range of virus strains as it triggers a dominant antibody response toward the hypervariable hemagglutinin (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content>) head region. The discovery of rare broadly protective antibodies against conserved regions in influenza virus proteins has propelled research on distinct antigens and delivery methods to efficiently induce broad immunity toward drifted or shifted virus strains. Here, we report that adeno‐associated virus (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">AAV</styled-content>) vectors expressing influenza virus 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> or chimeric 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. Unexpectedly, immunization even with wild‐type 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> induced antibodies recognizing the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content>‐stalk and activating FcγR‐dependent responses indicating that 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">AAV</styled-content>‐vectored expression balances 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> head‐ and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> stalk‐specific humoral responses. Immunization with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">AAV</styled-content>‐
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">HA</styled-content> partially protected also ferrets against a harsh virus challenge. Results from this study provide a rationale for further clinical development of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">AAV</styled-content> vectors as influenza vaccine platform, which could benefit from their approved use in human gene therapy.
