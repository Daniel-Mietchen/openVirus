<p>Antibiotic resistance is considered nowadays as one of the greatest threats to human health (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Cases of antibiotic resistance are constantly reported, and the time needed for bacteria to become resistant to newly introduced antibiotics, is getting shorter. In fact, antimicrobial use exerts evolutionary pressure for the creation and transmission of resistant pathogens, thus reducing antimicrobial effectiveness and raising the incidence of severe disease (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, this is not a new phenomenon and is commonly observed as soon as the introduction of new classes of antibiotics occurs (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In 1946, Alexander Fleming anticipated this global burden with the renowned sentence “There is probably no chemotherapeutic drug to which in suitable circumstances the bacteria cannot react by in some way acquiring “fastness” [resistance]” (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In fact, penicillin became commercially available in 1943 and resistance was observed for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> by 1948. In this context, the discovery by Barbara McClintok that transposons play a major role in the genomic diversity and evolution paved the way for a deeper understanding of the genetic basis underlying the antimicrobial resistance dissemination. Transduction, conjugation, transformation and other mobile genetic materials (transposons and integrons) are all possible mechanisms for the transmission of genetic determinants involved in AMR (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and in the generation of “superbugs” (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Worryingly, the transmission of multiple resistance genes is not only relatively common among organisms within the same genus but also among evolutionarily distant organisms.
