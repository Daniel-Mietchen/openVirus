<p>The other mechanism responsible for drug resistance is represented by the modification of the target by genetic mutations or post-translational modifications. Mutations in target genes can enable bacteria to overcome the toxic effects of antibiotics. Examples are provided by mutations in bacterial DNA gyrases (e.g. 
 <italic>gyrA</italic>) and topoisomerase (e.g. 
 <italic>parC</italic>) for fluoroquinolones, the β subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) for rifampin, 16S rRNA (rrs) for tetracyclines and aminoglycosides and 23S rRNA (rrl) for linezolid (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The clinical use of linezolid has selected 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) resistant lineages by a mutation in one of the rrl copies. The high recombination frequency has subsequently enabled the allele enrichment in the bacterial population. Another example of a target change is the acquisition of specific genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as in methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA). In this case, the methicillin resistance is obtained by the acquisition of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element. This cassette encodes for a mutated form of PBP2 that is not recognized as a target by the β-lactamase enzyme but is still able to mediate a regular cell wall biosynthesis. Additional antibiotic resistance mechanisms consist in the protection by modification of the target molecule. This is exemplified by the polymyxin resistance in 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanni</italic> (polymyxin B and polymyxin E, also known as colistin). The polymyxin antibiotics, are cyclic antimicrobial peptides with long, hydrophobic tails that bind to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria disrupting cell membranes. This resistance is often associated with changes in the expression of regulators affecting LPS production. For example, the addition of phosphoethanolamine (PE) to lipid A due to overexpression of 
 <italic>pmrC</italic> results in a substantial reduction of colistin binding as the negative charge of the LPS is hugely lowered (
