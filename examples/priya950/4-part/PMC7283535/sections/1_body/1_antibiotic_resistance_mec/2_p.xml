<p>A plethora of mechanisms has contributed to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and to their spread. The first classification is between natural and acquired resistance mechanisms. The natural resistance relies on the bacterial ability to block the antibiotic function as a result of inherent structural or functional characteristics. For example, vancomycin (glycopeptide antibiotic) which inhibits peptidoglycan crosslinking, is generally effective only against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, due to its inability to cross the outer membrane to get access to the d-Ala-d-Ala peptides. By contrast, the acquired resistance is based on the gaining of new functions; bacteria that would be originally susceptible, became resistant to one or more antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The main mechanisms exploited by bacteria to tackle the action of antibiotics are based on (i) the inactivation of the drug by its hydrolysis or structural modification, (ii) the prevention of the access to the target by reducing membrane permeability or overexpression of efflux pumps, (iii) changes in the antibiotic targets by mutation or post-translational modifications (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–C</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The mechanisms of antibiotics inactivation comprise both the production of enzymes that destroys the antibiotic itself (for example, β-lactamases) and the production of enzymes that modify its structure (for example, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes). β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin and cephalosporins, are hydrolyzed by a wide variety of β-lactamases. Since the early discovery of these enzymes, bacteria resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics have emerged (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this regard, the genes encoding for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs with activity against oxyimino-cephalosporins) and carbapenemases (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), including the IMP (imipenemase), VIM (Verona integron encoded metallo β-lactamase), 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> carbapenemase (KPC) and OXA (oxacillinase) have been identified not only on the chromosomes, but also on plasmids as in the case of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Among them, there is the New Delhi metallo-β- lactamase 1 (NDM-1), an enzyme that confers high level of resistance to multiple antibiotics, including penicillin, cephalosporins and carbapenems and that is capable of rapid worldwide dissemination (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This is of high concern since there are few available treatment options beyond the carbapenems. The main producers of the NDM-1 enzyme are 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> such as 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, but also 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Lastly, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes are able to modify the structure of the antibiotic molecule by the transfer of different chemical groups such as acyl, phosphate, nucleotidyl and ribitoyl groups. This modification prevents the antibiotic from binding to its target protein mainly due to the steric hindrance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). For example, in 2012 a novel genomic island encoding six aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, including gentamycin, was identified in 
 <italic>Campylobacter coli</italic> isolated from broiler chickens in China (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and more recently in Group B streptococcus (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Yet, the prevention of antibiotic access to a specific target can occur by reducing the permeability of the membrane and/or increasing efflux in order to reduce the intracellular concentration of a drug (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Differently from Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically less permeable to many antibiotics as their outer membrane forms a sort of permeability barrier. Generally, the permeability is reduced by the downregulation of the major porins, which results in a decrease in antibiotics entry into the bacterial cell. Porins are beta barrel proteins that cross the cellular membranes acting as channels for passive diffusion of certain molecules (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The expression or the structure of a specific porin can be influenced by mutations that decrease membrane permeability, reducing the entry of antibiotics inside the cell. For instance, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> OprD-deficient strains are characterized by high level of resistance to carbapenems (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Bacterial efflux pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family are not selective for a specific class of antibiotic and confer intrinsic resistance to multiple and structurally distinct classes of drugs, including the β-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The high-level expression of efflux genes is often due to mutations in their regulatory network that generally occur within a local repressor, a global transcription factor, promoter regions or intergenic sites. For example, by mutations and gene duplication mechanisms the overexpression of MexAB-OprM multidrug efflux systems confers to some 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates the ability to became resistant to carbenicillin antibiotics. Moreover, Nicoloff et al. identified a large tandem duplication of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> acrAB locus in a mutant isolated in the presence of tetracycline (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Such a mutation was found to overexpress the AcrAB drug efflux pump, producing an MDR phenotype (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In 
 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, a mutation in the consensus −10 sequence upstream of 
 <italic>mtrC s</italic>trengthens its promoter activity determining constitutive overexpression of the efflux pump (
