<p>Attempts to “vaccinate” begin even before the Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccination was introduced. In the 7th century, some Indian Buddhists drank snake venom in an attempt to become immune to its effect. The process of variolation, consisting in the introduction of dried pus from smallpox pustules into the skin of a patient, was practiced at regular intervals by the Brahmin caste of Hindus in India in the 16th century (

Nevertheless, Edward Jenner is considered the real father of vaccinology; in 1796 he tested the protective effect of a prior cowpox infection against smallpox by actively immunizing an eight-year-old-boy with cowpox and then carrying out smallpox challenge (variolation) (

The main principle of Pasteur was to “isolate, inactivate and inject” the causative agent of a disease. His rationale was to attenuate or inactivate the virulence of the disease-causing organisms while preserving their immunogenicity (

Live attenuated vaccines (LAV) have been available since the last century and derive from viruses or bacteria that have been weakened under laboratory conditions, so that they induce immunity by simulating natural infections causing no or very mild disease (

An example is provided by the TB treatment with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) developed in 1922. Killed microorganisms are safer, do not induce disease and have an excellent stability profile, even if the immune response that they induce is reduced in terms of magnitude compared to LAV and several doses of vaccine may be required. For many viral diseases, the risk of reinfection is null due to the induction of antibodies directed against invariable antigens (e.g., smallpox, yellow fever, polio, rabies, mumps, measles, rubella, varicella, herpes zoster, hepatitis A, and Japanese encephalitis). Therefore, vaccines that were developed following the principles described in this paragraph have proven to be successful (

A further development of Pasteur's strategy was the so-called “subunit” vaccine that contains only the antigenic determinants that are able to induce an effective immune response. This approach has been successfully applied to diphtheria and tetanus, two diseases caused by bacterial toxins (
