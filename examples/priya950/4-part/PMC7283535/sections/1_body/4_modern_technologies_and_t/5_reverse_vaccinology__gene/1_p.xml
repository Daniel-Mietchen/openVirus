<p>A new era in vaccine design is started through the use of the bacterial genomes to discover new vaccine candidates. “
 <italic>in silico</italic>” prediction tools are applied to identify genes encoding for surface-exposed or secreted antigens. Newly discovered antigens are expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as recombinant proteins, and their immunogenicity evaluated in preclinical models (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). This approach, named “reverse vaccinology” has allowed the development of the first multivalent protein-based vaccine against meningococcus B, 4CMenB, that is now approved in many countries worldwide. In addition to the recombinant proteins identified by the reverse vaccinology approach, the licensed 4CMenB vaccine contains the highly immunogenic outer membrane vesicles (OMV) component produced through detergent extraction (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Interestingly, by using genetic approaches, it is possible to induce an over-blebbing phenotype without using detergents leading to a new generation of improved bacterial OMVs called generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMAs). The vesicles are obtained by mutation in genes responsible for stabilizing the link between the bacterial outer membrane and peptidoglycan (e.g., 
 <italic>tolR, tolB, nlpl</italic>). GMMAs can also be further engineered by targeting genes responsible for LPS acetylation, such as 
 <italic>lpxlM</italic> and 
 <italic>lpxL1</italic> therefore reducing LPS reactogenicity (

In this regard, thanks to advancement in structural biology the rational design of molecule structures with desired size, shape, stability, improved immunogenicity and functionality became feasible (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Nanoparticles were initially discovered in virus such as those from Hepatitis B. Once produced recombinantly these particles were found to be composed either of the surface antigen (HBsAg) or the core antigen (HBcAg). The HBcAg was shown to be assembled into particles of 24–31 nm diameter resembling the highly immunogenic viral cores obtained from HBV-infected human liver. Other class of self-assembling protein nanoparticles has been identified from a wide variety of source. For example, one of these is represented by a 24 subunits molecule, each composed of a four-alpha-helix bundle, that self-assembles in a quaternary structure with octahedral symmetry named Ferritin. DNA technology can be also used to construct genes that encode for self-assembling polypeptides fused with the desired immunogenic epitope for expression of the chimeric molecule in a selected cell expression system. The chimeric polypeptide then self-assembles within the cell, with an ordered pattern of surface exposed epitopes (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). An important advantage of this approach is that proteins of interest are exposed on the surface of the nanoparticle in the correct conformation thus eliciting a high specific immune response.
