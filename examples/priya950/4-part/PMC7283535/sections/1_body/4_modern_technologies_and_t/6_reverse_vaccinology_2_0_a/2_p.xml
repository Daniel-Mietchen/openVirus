<p>The Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach has allowed the identification of the cytomegalovirus CMV pentameric complex (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>) and of the pre-fusion of F protein of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Although this approach has been exploited for viral pathogens, it is expected that the same technologies may also be applied to bacterial pathogens. Growing knowledge in this field could lead to rational design of new antigens more stable and able to elicit high level of functional antibodies. An example of structure-based design of bacterial antigens is the factor H binding protein (fHbp) of 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. This is a key meningococcal vaccine which exists as more than 300 peptides that can be grouped into three variants that do not elicit cross-protective immunity. Definition of the 3D structure and the mapping of all protective epitopes has guided the design of a new chimeric molecule containing combination of the main epitopes of the three variants but maintaining the overall conformation and the same structural features. The new chimeric fHbp was able to induce, in mice, cross-reactive immunity against the three variants (
