<p>Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 is aimed at the identification of antigens inducing high functional antibodies (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). By single B cells sorting and culturing, antibodies (Ab) with the desired functionality are selected and the corresponding Ig gene sequenced, and Abs produced as recombinant proteins. Three-dimensional structure resolution of the Ag–Ab (Fab) complex leads to a detailed definition of the protective epitope. Structural information and identification of the protective epitopes can drive the design of a novel optimized immunogens (“structure-based Ag design”). The new Ag can then be included in the best formulation or delivery system and tested in humans.
