<p>The development of safer live-attenuated vaccines and subunit vaccines through rational design has been possible when in the 1980s recombinant DNA techniques were introduced and revolutionized the field of vaccinology. This new approach enabled the generation of the genetically detoxified Bordetella pertussis toxin (

Genetic engineering has also been applied to generate attenuated viral and bacterial strains as antigen and delivery system for heterologous antigens, or to develop genetic “reassortants,” as in the case of the influenza attenuated vaccine or the rotavirus vaccine, which is based on a bovine rotavirus “reassorted” with 5 human rotavirus strains (
