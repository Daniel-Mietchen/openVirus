  <p>(I) By lowering the inappropriate use of antimicrobial compounds. Perhaps counterintuitive is the evidence that viral vaccines are also very effective in reducing AMR. For istance, vaccines against influenza virus reduce the incidence of fever and sickness which affect a significant proportion of community-dwelling elderly population each year in the US (
   <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). By preventing a proportion of these cases, vaccines can reduce both, the inappropriate use of antibiotics prescribed in case of viral infections and the need of antibiotic treatment to cure secondary bacterial infections (

  <p>(II) By reducing the insurgence of resistant serotypes. For example, the pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccines had an effect of direct protection of infants and of herd immunity in adults initially not targeted by routine immunization (
   <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Remarkably, also the antibiotic prescriptions and the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains decreased. In the 1990s, before the introduction of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), more than 63,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease occurred each year in the US. Between 2000 and 2004, a 57% reduction in the incidence of penicillin-non-susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and 84% reduction in the rate of multidrug-resistant strains were achieved. These data indicate that vaccination is effective, regardless of the bacterial resistance phenotype. However, the universal use of PCV-7 led to increased prevalence of serotype 19A, a non-vaccine serotype with high rate of penicillin resistance (
   <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Introduction of 13-valent PCV in 2010, which contains 6 additional serotypes, including 19A, further reduced the incidence of IPD and of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci. Nevertheless, the risk of the evolution of AMR in pneumococcal serotypes not contained in the vaccine is still high. In this context, the design of a vaccine aimed to specifically target resistance determinants or resistant strains is highly valuable (

  <p>(III) By reducing infection rate of resistant strains in closely related species. Between 2004 and 2008, in New Zealand, 1 million people were vaccinated with the Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) based vaccine (MeNZB) to fight a meningococcus B outbreak. A retrospective case-control study has shown that the immunization with MeNZB resulted in 31% reduction of 
   <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> infection (
   <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). 
   <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), with ~100 million cases worldwide. One of the main concerns of gonococcal infection is the emergence of strains resistant to nearly all classes of antibiotics including the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and the lack of an effective vaccine. Hence, 
   <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infections are becoming as the most prevalent and difficult to treat. Despite causing very different diseases, 
   <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and 
   <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> share 80â€“90% nucleotide identity at the genome level. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that antibodies against common antigens could induce a cross-protective effect (
   <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Bioinformatic analyses has revealed that 57 OMPs are of 
   <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> are conserved also in 970 
   <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains isolated in US (
   <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Among them, PilQ, Omp85 (BamA), NspA, MtrE, MetQ, and LbpA show 93% amino acid sequence similarity to 
   <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, suggesting their potential contribution to cross-protection (
   <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of MenB-4C vaccine in preventing gonococcal infections (
   <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).

  <p>(IV) By directly targeting antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Although many different vaccine formulations have been proposed to prevent infection by antimicrobial resistant pathogens, (such as 
   <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, Clostridium difficile</italic> etc.) no successful phase III clinical trial data have been published yet (
   <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). A possible reason for the failure in developing vaccines against these pathogens are the multiple virulence mechanisms a vaccine should target, as well as the absence of animal models that are representative of human diseases (
   <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). A better understanding of host-pathogen interactions such as immune evasion, and increased knowledge in the epidemiology and variability of the main antigens, could help in the development of novel effective vaccine. However, new incentives may be necessary for the development of novel vaccines leading to the refinement of health care system against AMR infections and eventually saving millions of lives.
