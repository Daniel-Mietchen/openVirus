<p>In combination with the vaccination practice, the discovery of antibiotics and their successful use in medicine is considered one the most relevant findings from a global health perspective (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of antibiotics has weakened to the point that our lives can be severely threatened. In fact, the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most daunting problems that is causing the spread of infectious diseases and the increase in the number of deaths caused by infections that were previously considered uncomplicated (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For example, the bloodstream infections caused by bacteria resistant to one or several drugs (multidrug-resistant; MDR) such as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are characterized by a 50% of mortality compared with the 24% of the non-multidrug-resistant infections (

In addition, medical procedures such as surgeries, immunosuppressive chemotherapy and organ transplantation are becoming more critical and, in some cases, even prohibitive considering the need of effective antibiotics against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, the consequences of such microbial evolution can be dramatic with infectious diseases that could severely reduce our lifespan to an extent similar to the pre-antibiotic era. Globally, AMR pathogens are causing 700,000 deaths/year, and 10 million deaths/year are expected by 2050, a number even, higher than the 8.2 million caused by cancer today (
