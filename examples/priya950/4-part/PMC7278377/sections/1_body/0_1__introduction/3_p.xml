<p>The recent Animal Health Law (AHL) EU 2016/429 [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] issued by the European Parliament and Council was passed on 31 March 2016 and set out a new, robust legal framework for animal health in Europe. The AHL brings together, in a single act, all the provisions applicable to animal trade within the EU, the entry of animals, and products into the EU, the eradication of diseases, veterinary checks, notification of diseases, and financial support. The next application of the AHL, scheduled for 2021, will modify or repeal 38 decisions, directives, and regulations adopted between 1964 to the present day on animal health.
