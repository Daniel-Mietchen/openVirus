<p>The provisions set out in the new Delegated Act art. 8 and 9 provide that the new intervention measures are addressed not only to species known to be the main target of a particular disease but also to all other species susceptible to infection. Thus, some diseases communicable between different domestic and wild species such as TB, brucellosis, rabies, and BT will be defined as "multi-species diseases" in this regulation and have different levels of intervention (B, C, D, and E) depending on the species involved. Bovine TB, for example, requires obligatory eradication from the European territory (cat. B) and has also been found in the genus 
 <italic>Capra</italic> (specifically listed in Annex IV). TB can also infect swine and camelids to varying degrees and, thus, is subjected to category D measures. However, category E applies only if other mammals like badgers and all susceptible carnivores are at risk of infection.
