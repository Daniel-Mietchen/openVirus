  <p>Lack of laboratory evidence for 
   <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> attraction to human odor. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Flight activity is the percentage of female mosquitoes that exited the release chamber after 20 min. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Attraction to human odor was estimated as the percentage of trapped mosquitoes that chose the trap with human odor, which ranges from 0% (full attraction to CO
   <sub>2</sub> without human odor) to 100% (full attraction to CO
   <sub>2</sub> with human odor). The red, vertical dashed lines indicate the expected percentage of trapped mosquitoes when there is no preference for either trap (50%). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals of the percentages. Letters next to or above the bars indicate statistical significance. Conditions with a letter in common are not significantly different from each other. The data shown in (
   <bold>A</bold>) and (
   <bold>B</bold>) are pooled from 6 and 9 separate replicate trials of 20 to 30 females each for CO
   <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
   <sub>2</sub> only and CO
   <sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO
   <sub>2</sub> only designs, respectively, which did not differ significantly. The 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population was included as a positive control.
