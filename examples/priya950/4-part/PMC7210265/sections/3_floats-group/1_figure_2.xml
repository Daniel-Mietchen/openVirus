  <p>Vector competence of sylvatic 
   <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> controls after exposure to 1.84 ×10
   <sup>6</sup> FFUs/ml of YFV. Bars represent the percentage of virus-positive mosquitoes 14 days post infectious blood meal and the error bars are the 95% confidence intervals of the percentages. Infection rate (IR) is the proportion of blood-fed females with an infected body. Dissemination rate (DR) is the proportion of infected females with virus disseminated to the head tissues. Transmission rate (TR) is the proportion of females with a disseminated infection that shed virus in their saliva. Transmission efficiency (TE) is the overall proportion of blood-fed females that shed virus in their saliva. The 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population was included as a positive control. ***
