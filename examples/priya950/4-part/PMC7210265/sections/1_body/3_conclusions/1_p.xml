<p id="Par17">The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV, combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor, indicate a low potential for this sylvatic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However, we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles. The presence of susceptible NHPs combined with theÂ possibility of a human-mediated introduction of DENV into the sylvatic environment are additional risk factors that should be taken into account. Once entrenched, a newly established sylvatic cycle would undermine long-term DENV control in Laos.
