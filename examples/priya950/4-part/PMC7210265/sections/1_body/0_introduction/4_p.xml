<p id="Par5">Here, we evaluated the potential of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> to act as an arbovirus bridge vector in the Nakai National Biodiversity Conservation Area, using a combination of vector competence assays and behavioral experiments. Relative to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> controls, we found that our field-derived 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> colony had similar vector competence indices for DENV type 1, but a lower susceptibility to YFV. In addition, olfactometer bioassay measurements showed that this 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population was not significantly attracted to human odor in laboratory conditions. We conclude that although this sylvatic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population does not display a strong attraction to human odor, its vector competence for arboviruses such as DENV may contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles when it engages in opportunistic blood feeding on humans.
