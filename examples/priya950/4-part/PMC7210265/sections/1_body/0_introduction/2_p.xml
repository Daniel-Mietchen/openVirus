<p id="Par3">Another related, but less studied concern, is the risk of ‘spillback’ of arboviruses from the human population into novel sylvatic cycles in regions where they were previously absent

 </sup>. Not only are newly established sylvatic arbovirus cycles virtually impossible to eradicate, but such spillback events can have potentially serious consequences for wildlife. This was exemplified by yellow fever virus (YFV), which was introduced into the Americas from West Africa about 400 years ago during the slave trade and contributed to shape the expansion of settlements and colonial powers
