<p id="Par16">To more fully assess the potential of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> as an arbovirus bridge vector, future studies will need to consider additional populations of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> found in various ecological habitats both in Laos and in surrounding countries of South-East Asia, as well as other virus strains and serotypes including sylvatic DENV isolates. In addition, it will be important to account for other parameters underlying the vectorial capacity such as the longevity of female mosquitoes.
