<p id="Par14">Arbovirus bridge vectors represent the most likely mechanism of arbovirus spillover transmission to humans. Whereas sylvatic YFV transmission is only known to occur in Africa and South America, sylvatic DENV transmission cycles have been documented in the forests of South-East Asia. In particular, sylvatic DENV transmission was reported in peninsular Malaysia where sylvatic DENV strains were isolated from sentinel monkeys such as the crab-eating macaque (
