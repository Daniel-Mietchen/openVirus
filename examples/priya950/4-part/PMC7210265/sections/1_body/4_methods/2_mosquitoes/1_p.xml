 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> colony was initiated with mosquito larvae collected along the Nam Noy River (17.768548°N, 105.381989°E) in the Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT NPA), known as the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA), located in the Nakai district, Khammuane province, Laos

 </sup>. A laboratory colony of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (7
 <sup>th</sup> generation) maintained at the Institut Pasteur du Laos was used as a control. The 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> colony originated in the town of Paksan (18.37134°N, 103.66586°E), Paksan district, Bolikhamxay province, Laos. Mosquitoes were reared under controlled insectary conditions (28 °C, 70% relative humidity, 12:12 hour light cycle) as previously described

 </sup>. Eggs were hatched synchronously in a vacuum chamber for 1 hour. Larvae were reared in 24 ×34 ×9 cm plastic trays containing 1.5 L of dechlorinated tap water and fed with Tetramin (Tetra) fish food at a density of 400 larvae per tray. Eight hundred adults were kept in 30 ×30 ×30 cm Bugdorm-1 insect cages with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution. For olfactometer studies at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, eggs from the 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> colonies were shipped to London and reared under similar insectary conditions.
