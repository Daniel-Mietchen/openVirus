 </sup> with low-passage DENV type 1 (DENV-1) and YFV isolates. The DENV-1 isolate (H15â€“3000) was originally obtained in 2015 through the Institut Pasteur du Laos DENV surveillance network in Vientiane capital, and was passaged three times in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells before it was used in this study. Virus stocks were produced during the third passage following as previously described

A commercial mouse anti-dengue virus complex monoclonal antibody (MAB8705; Merck Millipore) diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Interchim) was used as primary antibody for DENV. A commercial mouse anti-flavivirus group antigen monoclonal antibody (MAB10216; Merck Millipore) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (Interchim) was used as primary antibody for YFV.
