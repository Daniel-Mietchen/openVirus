<p id="Par6">We measured the DENV-1 vector competence of 39 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> females and 53 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females in two separate experiments. The data from both experiments were combined because initial analyses showed that none of the vector competence indices differed significantly between them. In each experiment, mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious dose of 1.16–1.38 ×10
 <sup>7</sup> FFU/ml of DENV-1. Vector competence was analyzed 14 days post infectious blood meal. The proportion of blood-fed females that became infected (i.e., the infection rate; IR) was 69.2% (27/39) and 100% (53/53) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The difference in IR between the two species was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of infected females that developed a disseminated infection (i.e., the dissemination rate; DR) was 66.7% (18/27) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 93.3% (42/45) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The difference in DR between the two species was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). The proportion of females with a disseminated infection that also released virus in their saliva (i.e., the transmission rate; TR) was 33.3% (6/18) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 54.8% (23/42) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The difference in TR between the two species was not statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.125). The overall proportion of blood-fed females with virus-positive saliva (i.e., the transmission efficiency; TE) was 15.4% (6/39) and 51.1% (23/45) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The difference in TE between the two species, which summarizes their relative vector competence, was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004). Together, these data indicate that 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> is a competent DENV-1 vector, but to a lesser extent than the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control population.
