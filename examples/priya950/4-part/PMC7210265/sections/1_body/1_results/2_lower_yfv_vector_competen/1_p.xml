<p id="Par7">We analyzed the YFV vector competence of 22 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 31 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> 14 days after oral exposure to an infectious blood meal containing 1.84 ×10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml of YFV. The IR was 45.5% (10/22) and 96.8% (30/31) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and the difference between the two species was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The DR was 10% (1/10) and 36.7% (11/30) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and the difference between the two species was not statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.087). The TR was 0% (0/1) and 9.1% (1/11) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and the difference between the two species could not be statistically tested because there was only 1 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> female and thus no replication. Overall, there was no evidence for a statistically significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.297) in vector competence between the two species, as TE was 0% (0/22) and 3.2% (1/31) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the very small proportion of positive saliva samples overall (a single 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> saliva sample was found positive) limited our ability to detect differences. Together, these data do not conclusively demonstrate the YFV vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic>, but suggest that it is likely lower than that of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control population.
