<p>After 48 h of growth, viral progeny was estimated in the supernatant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This time point was selected because viral release occurred at this time with minimal viral particle degradation in the supernatant (data not shown). Across each experiment, the addition of either DG-d1 or DG-d2 defective genomes had reduced the numbers of viral progeny by ~50% (estimated by qRT-PCR) when compared to cells infected with just EBOV or EBOV and a non-specific control RNA). Each deletion defective genome was compared to controls 4 times for statistical rigor and this effect on release of EBOV RNA from cells was robust (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, for both DG-d1 and DG-d2). The assay was of sufficient power to identify that the transfection of control RNA had a small negative effect on viral release (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024).
