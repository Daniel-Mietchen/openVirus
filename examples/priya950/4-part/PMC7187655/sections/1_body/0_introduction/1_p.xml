<p>Like all of the filoviridae, the Ebola virus (EBOV) genome is composed of a negative sense single stranded RNA, which is present in the cell as a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). During virus assembly this RNP becomes enveloped in a host-cell phospholipid membrane, by incorporating various viral membrane proteins, including the glycoprotein (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The virus is believed to survive long term in an environmental niche that is likely to involve species of African bats (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Occasionally the virus jumps the species barrier and causes outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans, which is severe with characteristic fever, viraemia and occasionally hemorrhage (Brown et al.,

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The virus is transmissible between people via contact with body fluids and is therefore capable of causing epidemics of varying sizes (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). At the time of writing this article, the most serious epidemic to date occurred in West Africa in 2014; however there is currently an uncontrolled outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (World Health Organization,
