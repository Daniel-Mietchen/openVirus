<p>In order to test the effect of the defective genomes in cells infected with EBOV-Ecran the genetic material of EBOV-Ecran was quantified using the RealStar® Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit (Altona diagnostics, Country) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Relevant positive controls were included. We have performed this assay many times against a standard curve of plasmid containing the L gene from EBOV-Ecran (the plasmid was taken from an established mini-replicon assay Mühlberger,

However, we do not believe that these will be common (&lt;5%) based upon observations made with next generation sequencing (paper in preparation).
