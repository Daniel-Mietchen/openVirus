<p>For the first deletion defective genome (hereafter referred to as DG-d1) described by Calain et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) a T7 promoter sequence was cloned along with the last 618 nt of the 5′ end of the EBOV-Makona genome and the first 373 nt of the 3′ end of the EBOV-Makona genome including the translational start codon of the NP gene (antisense strand from 5′ to 3′), a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence and the T7 terminator sequence. For one of the other deletion defective genomes described by Calain et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) (hereafter referred to as DG-d2) a T7 promoter sequence was inserted along with the last 672 nt of the 5′ end of the EBOV-Makona genome and the first 155 nt of the 3′ end of the EBOV-Makona genome (Genebank Accession

All plasmids preparations and synthesis were done by GeneArt™ (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK). The DIs were synthesized and then inserted into a cloning plasmid (pMK-RQ), after that the insert was cut and put into the appropriate expression plasmid (pUC 57_A338), which is the same backbone plasmids used for the EBOV min-genome system. This genome template was used so that a mini-genome system might be used as part of an initial screen (Mühlberger, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The output of mini-genome-based assay broadly correlated with that of the high containment assay (data not shown).
