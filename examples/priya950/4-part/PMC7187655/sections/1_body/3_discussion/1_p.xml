<p>Two deletion defective genomes (Calain et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) were synthetically reproduced. An experimental, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, co-infection system was developed for the analysis of the effect of defective genomes on the growth of EBOV-Ecran. The defective genomes were transfected after infection had occurred and residual virus had been washed away. This was to reduce the likelihood of artifacts in the virus replication cycle occurring because of the lipofectamine used to transfect the cells with the defective genome. Cumulative control data suggest that our experimental system is robust. Some variation is observed in the quantified viral uptake; however, this does not persist throughout the experiment. Therefore, this variation is likely to be due to slight differences in when samples were taken, rather than actual differences in initial conditions. We found that the two deletion defective genomes repeatedly reduced viral replication by ~2-fold compared to controls. This effect was most evident when viral release was measured by qRT-PCR and the number of genomes released; however, we observed some evidence that this was the case also with infectious units (measured by TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). The disparity in levels of confidence between these two measures can be explained by the difference in precision of the two assays. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay measurements are ordinal to the level of number replicate wells and the number of dilutions and the qRT-PCR is not and Ct/Cq values can be calculate to many decimal points. We acknowledge however the possibility exists that only released RNA is affected by the addition of defective genomes. Additional work should be performed to determine the function of these molecules in a dose dependent manner, in line with Koch's postulates. Indeed it is possible that more favorable ratios of MOIs may exist. Here we used one MOI of 5, which is quite high deliberately to maximize the potential for cells to be co-infected by virus and defective genome. Another way that the effect might be maximized would be to change the time of defective genome intervention in relation to viral infection. In single experiments (not shown here) we looked at transfection of defective genome RNA prior infection and close to the end of the anticipated eclipse stage but saw no effect. The work we present here has infection prior to transfection in case the transfections might be deleterious to infection.
