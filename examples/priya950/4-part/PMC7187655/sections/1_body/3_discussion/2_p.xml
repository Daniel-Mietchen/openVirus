<p>When Calain et al. co-infected na√Øve cells with the diversity of DIPs and wild type virus and low passage virus, they observed a near complete cessation of cytopathology (Calain et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The effect we observed was more modest. We also found that the RNA control also had a lesser but measurable negative effect on EBOV release (measured by qRT-PCR). This may be driven by low level immune activation. Vero cells are capable of responding to interferon, thus demonstrating their immuno-competence; however, the cells do not release interferon (Desmyter et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>). There are multiple points where single stranded RNA can be recognized by the mammalian cell, reviewed in Jensen and Thomsen (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and it is likely that the effect observed was driven by one of these. It is unclear whether such an immune-stimulating effect would be additive for the sequences encoding the defective genomes.
