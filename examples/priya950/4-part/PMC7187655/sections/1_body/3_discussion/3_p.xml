<p>We found that it is unlikely that defective genomes are being released from infected cells as particles (or otherwise) in our system. Despite this, it was still possible that the defective genomes were being replicated within the cell. This presents two possibilities: (1) defective particles were made but not released or (2) they were not made. We were only able to test the intracellular component of the assay once and saw no replication of DG-d1 RNA (data not shown); however both possibilities are possible when only a single experiment is available for evidence. If we presume that the defective genomes are not being replicated in the system, we might further propose that the mechanism of action is that defective genomes sequester protein resources. It is unclear why the defective genomes were not replicated to a significant extent in the presence of EBOV. However, understanding this phenomenon could potentially inform about how viruses are able to evade parasitisation by DIPs. Such adaptations would clearly convey a selective advantage to the virus. We might postulate that the RDRP might have some yet unknown ability to detect truncated genomes, or that the EBOV genomes are chemically modified in some way that the recombinately produced defective genomes are not and the RDRP recognizes this. However this is highly unlikely otherwise laboratory systems such as the mini-replicon would not function and they do (Garcia-Dorival et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that the defective genomes were not sufficiently co-located to interact with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). This is also not true because some restricting effect on viral release was observed where defective genomes and EBOV were placed inside cells together. Moreover, we observed high numbers of both defective genome and wild-type genome per cell. The only credible explanation these authors have been able to postulate is that the RNP has some way of prioritizing longer genomes. If the RNP is able to bind anywhere to the RNA genome and then translocate to the origin of synthesis; then, purely on the merit of its size alone, our defective genomes will associate to an RNP once for every 20 wild-type genomes. At this ratio, it is clear that the defective genomes will quickly be out competed, especially if RNPs stay associated to their genomes and are a rare resource. This is likely to be true as the L protein is that last to be transcribed during an EBOV infection of a cell (MÃ¼hlberger,
