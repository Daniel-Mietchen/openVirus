  <p>The effect of defective genomes on viral release. 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> Vero c1008 cells were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> infectious units of EBOV strain Ecran (~1 × 10
   <sup>12</sup> genomes) for 2 h then washed. The cells were then transfected with 1 μg of control RNA (red dots) or DG-d1 RNA (blue dots) RNA or DG-d2 RNA (purple dots) for 4 h. Un-treated Ebola virus only infection was used for comparison. The cells were then incubated and cell culture supernatants at 48 h post infection were taken and analyzed. The virus was enumerated using qRT-PCR 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and TCID50 assay 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. Data shown are normalized to the EBOV-Ecran only control for each experiment. One sample 
   <italic>T</italic>-tests were performed to indicate the likelihood that the difference would have occurred through random chance. The 
   <italic>P</italic>-values are given for the 95% level. Each data point is an independent experiment and the geometric mean of 3 replicates generated from independent wells within the same experiment.
