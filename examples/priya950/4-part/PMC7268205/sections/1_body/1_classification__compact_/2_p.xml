<p id="p0105">Influenza C virus (ICV) was first isolated in 1947 from a human patient having mild respiratory symptoms. Since the virus showed no cross-reactivity with antisera against influenza A or B viruses, it was classified as a new genus of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (influenza C virus). The virus has a worldwide distribution and the majority of humans develop antibodies against ICV early in life. Humans are the main reservoir of ICV, but occasionally the virus may also infect dogs and pigs.
