<p id="p0205">The intracellular localization of the IBV NS1 protein is highly dynamic throughout the infection. At early times of infection, NS1 accumulates in nuclear SC35-positive speckle domains enriched in RNA processing factors and leads to a rounding of their usually irregular appearance. This activity was localized within the N-terminal 90 amino acids which also displays a monopartite NLS at position 46â€“57 inside the N-terminal RNA binding domain. However, speckle association of NS1 is resolved in late phases of infection when vRNPs are exported to the cytosol, and is accompanied by a cytosolic relocalization to downregulate cellular immune receptors such as PKR and RIG-I. It has been speculated that the transient interaction of the IBV NS1 protein with speckles reflects a role in promoting export of viral mRNAs. The IBV NS1 protein lacks two important properties, which are found in IAV NS1 proteins: First, the absence of interference with the cellular polyadenylation machinery, which is mediated by binding to a 30 kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation factor. Second, IBV NS1 has the inability to activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling by binding to its p85beta subunit, which has been suggested to prevent premature apoptosis in infected cells.</p>
