<p id="p0155">Within the nucleus each vRNP acts as an independent unit that can either be transcribed into polyadenylated positive-sense viral mRNA using a cap-snatching mechanism, or serves as the template for synthesis of a positive-sense complementary RNA (cRNA) which in turn directs the replication of another virion RNA (vRNA) molecule. The IBV PB2 subunit binds not only to methylated G-capped RNAs like its IAV counterpart, but also to unmethylated GpppG caps indicating a larger flexibility of the IBV PB2 cap binding domain. The viral RNA polymerase complex binds the vRNA or the cRNA at the promoter sites located on the highly conserved stretches of nearly complementary nucleotides at the 3′- and 5′-termini. Successful expression and purification of soluble recombinant IBV polymerase has recently facilitated detailed in vitro studies of binding parameters to viral vRNA and cRNA mimics as well as characterizations of the enzymatic activities of IBV P proteins. It is generally believed that influenza viruses express an error-prone RNA polymerase which contributes to high viral evolutionary rates, but this has not been determined experimentally for the IBV polymerase.</p>
