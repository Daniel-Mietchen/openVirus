<p id="p0180">The neuraminidase, the receptor destroying enzyme of influenza A and B viruses, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein found on the surface of virus-infected cells and in the membrane of the virions. Its main function is thought to be the removal of inhibitory receptor determinants from mucus in the respiratory tract to facilitate virion docking to the host cell, as well as to mediate the release of progeny virions from the host cell, which is the last step of the virus replication cycle. Hence, inhibition of NA by small molecules or antibodies diminishes virus propagation. There are many structural similarities between the NA molecules of type A and B viruses. In both viruses NA matures into a tetrameric structure despite the low degree of sequence identity of 30%. The monomers form a head domain composed of six-bladed Î²-propellers that are linked to membrane-proximal elongated stalks, which together build a box-like tetramer. The enzymatic and antigenic sites are located in the head domain. The eight NA amino acids that directly bind to sialic acid and are important for the catalytic activity of NA (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406; N2 numbering) are highly conserved among type A and B viruses. NA is the main target for current antiviral therapy of human infections by circulating influenza A and B viruses (see below).</p>
