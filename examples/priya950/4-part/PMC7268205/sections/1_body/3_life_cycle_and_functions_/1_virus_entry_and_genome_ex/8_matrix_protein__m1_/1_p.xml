<p id="p0190">The M1 proteins are the most abundant morphogenic virion proteins of IBV and IAV. The IBV M1 protein has a conserved length of 248 amino acid and it shares about 30% sequence identity with its type A virus counterpart. The physicochemical properties, domain structure and regulatory roles of the IAV M1 protein in facilitating nucleocytoplasmic export of vRNPs late in infection have been well studied, but considerably less is known about the characteristics of the IBV M1. However, IBV M1 has been suggested to engage into a binding interaction with the viral BM2 protein and that this interaction is important for incorporation of M1 and vRNPs into virions. Mutational analysis identified within the IBV M1 protein a bipartite nuclear localization signal (amino acids 74–94) and two leucine-rich exportin 1-dependent nuclear export signals at positions 3–14 and 124–133. However, the role of these topogenic sequences in the viral replication cycle remain to be determined. In case of IAV the M1 protein is thought to bridge an interaction between vRNP and the viral nuclear export protein (NEP), which facilitates nuclear export of the viral genome via the exportin 1-pathway. However, the IBV NEP has a reported ability to bind directly to vRNPs suggesting that M1-mediated complex formation would be dispensable or redundant for IBV.</p>
