<p id="p0165">Intracellular expression of viral mRNA directs the synthesis of eleven known IBV proteins that facilitate amplification and nucleo-cytoplasmic export of the viral genome, the production of progeny virions and/or manipulate innate antiviral defenses. The newly synthesized vRNPs are exported to the cytosol with the support of the viral NEP and, possibly, the M1 protein, which both contain nuclear export signals. The nuclear export of vRNPs is sensitive to inhibition by leptomycin B indicating a dependency on the exportin 1-dependent pathway. IBV encoded NS1 protein suppresses the stimulation of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors such as RIG-I and PKR through newly replicated vRNPs. IBV replication triggers an apoptotic response in infected cells and the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic induction pathways has been described. The assembly and budding of IBV progeny virions occurs at the plasma membrane, which is followed by virion release that depends on NA activity. In the following we will discuss the remaining structural and regulatory IBV gene products with a focus on their virus type-characteristics.</p>
