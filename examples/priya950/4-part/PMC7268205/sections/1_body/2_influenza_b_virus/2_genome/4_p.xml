<p id="p0140">The NS segment (segment 8) of IBV encodes NS1 and NEP proteins, which are expressed either from a collinear mRNA (NS1) or from a spliced transcript, from which an intronic sequence is removed (NEP). NEP exon 1 mRNAs utilizes the AUG start and ten codons of the NS1 reading frame, which is directly spliced to exon 2 that overlaps with the NS1 coding region for 155 nucleotides in a +1 reading frame. No homologs of accessory protein genes identified in IAV such as PB1-F2 or PA-X have been reported for IBV.</p>
