<p id="p0145">Reassortment, i.e., the exchange of gene segments between two viruses infecting one cell, is a general evolutionary mechanism of segmented RNA viruses, which is also a major driving force for the appearance of novel epidemic IBV strains both from within and in between the Victoria- and Yamagata lineages (see below). Classical coinfection experiments indicated that there can be phenotypic mixing of type A and B viruses generating particles that contain antigenic determinants derived from both parental types. However, IBV has never been observed to produce stable reassortant viruses harboring a gene segment(s) of IAV and vice versa. At least some part of this restriction appears to operate on the level of genome incorporation. Recombinant viral gene segments carrying the IBV HA or NA reading frames could be incorporated together with six other IAV segments into infectious chimeric influenza A/B viruses, when the coding regions were flanked with the packaging signals of the type HA and NA segments. The unique packaging signals of each of the viral gene segments have been mapped for IAV to contain the non-coding regions (NCRs) as well as terminal parts of the coding sequences, but have been less well studied for IBV. The appearance of defective interfering (DI) RNAs derived from viral gene segments containing the conserved terminal promoter sites with large internal deletions of the coding regions, especially in cells infected at high multiplicity, has also been described for IBV. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which the viral polymerase generates viral DI RNA remain to be elucidated.</p>
