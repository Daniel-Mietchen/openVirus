<p id="p0220">The IBV HA genes evolve at a rate of 2.0 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, which is somewhat slower compared to the seasonal IAV HA subtypes H3N2 (5.5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year) and H1N1 (4.0 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year). This finding correlates with a slower antigenic drift of IBV and may indicate higher structural and/or functional constraints on its HA. The B-Yamagata and B-Victoria lineages split in the 1970s and the lineages were distinguished based upon genetic and antigenic differences of their HA and NA genes (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). During their co-circulation multiple reassortment events occurred either within or in between the lineages. Recent molecular genetic analyzes indicated that only the HA, PB1 and PB2 genes continue to evolve in a lineage-specific manner. Current viruses with the Yamagata-like HA have diverged into clades 2 and 3, whereas most strains with a Victoria-like HA belong to clade 1A. There is low antigenic cross-reactivity between the two IBV lineages and often circulating strains and the IBV vaccine component in trivalent vaccines have not matched well.
