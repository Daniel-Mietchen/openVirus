<p id="p0215">IBV is considered to cause seasonal influenza epidemics every 2–4 years, but less comprehensive systematic analyzes on its epidemiology are available compared to IAV. Two IBV lineages derived from the prototypic B/Victoria/2/87- and B/Yamagata/16/88-strains co-circulate with the IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes to cause seasonal influenza. However, the extent of human infections for each of the four viruses is highly variable and can differ from one geographic region to the other even in the same epidemic season. Sentinel surveillance data in Europe since 2001 showed that the detection of IBV among circulating influenza viruses ranged from 1% to 70% through all age groups and that IBV was in five seasons the most prevalent virus type. A long-term global comparison suggested that IBV is the most prevalent influenza virus type affecting older children (5–17 years) and is second behind A(H3N2) in the elderly (&gt; 65 years). Moreover, in Germany the rates for hospitalization attributable to IBV infection were estimated to be 81 per 100.000, which was in between the rates for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) influenza (99 and 56 per 100.000). Significantly, IBV infections were the main cause of mortality attributable to influenza in the US in four epidemic seasons between 1997 and 2009. IBV was detected in 1222 (73%) of the 1674 fatal influenza cases reported through the German Public Health notification system for infectious diseases in the severe 2017/2018 season. Taken together, studies show that IBV imposes a substantial burden of disease.</p>
