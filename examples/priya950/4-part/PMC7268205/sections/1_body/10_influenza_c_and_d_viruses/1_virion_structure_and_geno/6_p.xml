<p id="p0280">The seventh vRNA encodes the two non-structural proteins NS1 (246 amino acids) and NS2 (182 amino acids) that are generated via mRNA splicing: the unspliced mRNA is translated into NS1 and the spliced mRNA translates the shorter NS2 protein. The N-terminal residues of NS1 and NS2 are identical in sequence, splicing then generates a shift in the ORF in such a way that the remaining residues are translated from a different reading frame. Similar to IAV and IBV, it is believed that NS1 counteracts the cellular interferon response and NS2, which is also designated nuclear export protein (NEP), mediates the nuclear export of RNPs. Small amounts of NEP may be incorporated into virus particles.</p>
