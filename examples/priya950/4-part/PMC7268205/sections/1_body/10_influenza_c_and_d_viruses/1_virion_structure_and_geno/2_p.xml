<p id="p0260">The interior of the virus particle contains the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which consists of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA bound to the nucleoprotein NP and to three polymerase proteins (

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but most virus particles nevertheless package eight RNPs arranged in the typical 1 plus 7 pattern in which a central RNP is surrounded by seven circularly arranged RNPs. It is still not known how specific packaging of genome segments is achieved, but the segmented genome provides an evolutionary advantage of allowing the exchange of individual genome segments with those of other strains .
