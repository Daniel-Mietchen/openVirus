<p id="p0265">All RNA segments are flanked by non-coding sequences, which are more variable in length than those of influenza A and B viruses. The first twelve nucleotides at each 3′ end as well as the first eleven nucleotides at each 5′ end are conserved between genome segments and are partially complementary to each other, which enables the single stranded RNAs to form “panhandle” structures. This unique structure serves as the promotor for transcription of mRNAs and plays a pivotal role in genome replication and packaging. A uridine-rich region at the 5′ end of each segment serves as the poly A tail template for mRNA transcription.</p>
