<p id="p0270">The longest three gene segments encode the proteins PB2, PB1 and PA/P3 that form the trimeric polymerase complex, which is bound to one end of each RNP. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas PB2 and PA/P3 contain cap-binding and endonuclease activities, respectively, required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching, a process during which a short nucleotide sequence is cleaved from the 5´ end of cellular pre-mRNAs. The 3D-structure of polymerase proteins and the active site of the polymerase and endonuclease as determined by X-ray crystallography are conserved between influenza viruses suggesting that the mechanism of transcription and replication is very similar in all influenza virus types. The fourth segment of ICV encodes the glycoprotein HEF, the only spike of the viral membrane, which is discussed in more detail below. The fifth segment encodes the nucleoprotein NP that associates with the viral genome segments in a double-helical conformation in which two NP strands of opposite polarity are associated with each other. The sixth segment encodes two proteins, the matrix protein M1, a peripheral membrane protein that covers the viral envelope on its inside, and CM2, a short transmembrane protein with proton-channel activity required for virus entry. M1 contributes to the morphology of virus particles and also to another unique feature of ICV, the formation of cord-like structures, very long (up to 500 µm) tubules containing HEF and M1, but no RNPs emanating from the surface of virus-infected cells.</p>
