There is a large spectrum in the severity of symptoms ranging from an inapparent infection with no virus shedding to a fulminant disease, which may depend on the immune status, underlying risk factors, and age of the patient. Some studies on pediatric populations reported slightly increased frequencies of myalgia, sore throat and hoarseness in IBV infection compared to IAV, but other studies have not confirmed this observation. From outpatient-attended influenza infections or experimental analyzes there are no data suggesting that the clinical features of IBV infection are different from the ones caused by IAV. Complications of IBV infection affect the lungs (e.g., bronchiolitis or pneumonia), but have also been observed in other organ systems leading to neurological (encephalitis), muscular (myositis) or cardiologic presentations (myocarditis).</p>
