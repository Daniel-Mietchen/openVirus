<p id="p0305">Influenza C virus is proposed to enter cells via the endocytic pathway and to subsequently fuse with the membrane of the endosome. This process is also mediated by HEF and requires its proteolytic cleavage into HEF
 <sub>1</sub> and HEF
 <sub>2</sub> subunits and subsequent exposure to mildly acidic pH. Although the fusion mechanism of HEF has not been investigated, it is believed to be similar to HA where well-studied conformational changes catalyze membrane fusion. This assumption is based on the very similar structures of HA and HEF at neutral pH and especially the presence of a long central α-helix in HEF
 <sub>2</sub> and a smaller helix on the outside packed in an antiparallel fashion, which undergo large acid-induced conformational changes that are the main drivers for membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The long α-helix contains a predicted heptad-repeat, a characteristic element of most viral fusion proteins that interact in the low pH structure to form a stable 6-helix coiled-coil domain.
