<p id="p0285">Research on ICV and IDV has concentrated mainly on its only glycoprotein HEF that combines the function of HA and NA of IAV and IBV, i.e., it possesses receptor-binding, receptor-destroying and membrane fusion activities. HEF (like HA) is a typical type 1 transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal, cleavable signal peptide, a long ectodomain, a transmembrane region and a very short, cytoplasmic tail which contains (in contrast to HA of Flu B) the longer acyl chain stearate. HEF is synthesized as a precursor HEF
 <sub>0</sub>, which is cleaved into the N-terminal HEF
 <sub>1</sub> subunit and the membrane-anchored HEF
 <sub>2</sub> subunit. Although there is only 12% amino acid identity between HA and HEF, crystallography of their ectodomains revealed that the overall structures as well as the folding of individual domains are quite similar. Both glycoproteins form a mushroom-shaped trimer consisting of a membrane-near stalk (containing the regions involved in membrane fusion) and a globular head domain carrying the receptor-binding site. HEF contains an additional bulge located at the lower part of the globular domain that carries the receptor-destroying region that is not present in HA (
