<p id="p0320">The last step in the viral replication cycle is the release of virus particles from infected cells, which requires the removal of all putative receptors. In influenza A and B the receptor-destroying activity is carried out by the second viral glycoprotein, the neuraminidase NA, whereas HEF performs this activity for ICV. In accordance with its receptor binding specificity, HEF is not a neuraminidase, but an esterase that cleaves acetyl from the C9 position of terminal 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac. The esterase activity, which belongs to the class of serine hydrolase, is included in an additional domain of HEF
 <sub>1</sub>. The esterase domain is structurally the most conserved part of HEF; the position of the catalytic triad characteristic for serine hydrolases (serine 57, aspartic acid 356 and histidine 359) is identical in ICV and IDV HEFs, which exhibit 55% amino acid identity and an almost identical 3D-structure. The structure of the esterase site is also very similar between HEF and coronavirus HE and it has been proposed that the HE arose from Influenza C-like HEF by a lateral gene transfer of the middle part of the HEF gene encoding mainly the receptor-binding and esterase domains.
