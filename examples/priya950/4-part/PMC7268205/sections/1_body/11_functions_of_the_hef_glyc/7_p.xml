<p id="p0315">HEF from both ICV and IDV possess a monobasic cleavage site (one arginine at the C-terminus of HEF
 <sub>1</sub>) and it is in this respect similar to the HAs from mammalian and low pathogenic avian IAVs. The replication of these viruses is restricted to the site of virus infection, usually the respiratory tract. Interestingly, the amino acids surrounding the monobasic cleavage site of HEF differ between ICV and IDV. HEF from ICV contains three closely spaced basic residues at the C-terminus of HEF
 <sub>1</sub> (TVT
 <italic>K</italic>P
 <italic>K</italic>S
 <italic>R</italic>), whereas HEF
 <sub>1</sub> from IDV contains only two, widely spaced basic residues (
 <italic>R</italic>TLTPAT
 <italic>R</italic>). The molecular features of the cleavage site in viral glycoproteins determine which of the many trypsin-like serine proteases recognize the precursor protein and the expression of this protease determines whether a certain cell type produces infectious virus particles. Thus, differential cleavage activation of HEF may contribute to the differences in host range of ICV and IDV, i.e., human versus cattle.
