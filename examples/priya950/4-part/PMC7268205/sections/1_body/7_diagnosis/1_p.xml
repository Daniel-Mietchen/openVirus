<p id="p0235">It is not possible to diagnose an influenza B virus infection based on clinical presentation alone as there is a large range in symptom severity and a number of other respiratory pathogens that cause similar or identical illness. Hence, laboratory testing of respiratory patient samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid is required to confirm a suspected IBV infection by the presence of viral RNA or antigen. In principle, reverse transcription-dependent real-time PCR assays, viral culture or rapid point-of-care tests detecting viral antigen or the viral genome are used, which differ in sensitivity and testing time. RT-PCR assays have a high sensitivity close to 100% and can be completed within a few hours, but usually RT-PCR analyzes require the samples to be transported to a diagnostic laboratory operating the required equipment (e.g., thermocyclers). PCR primers and probes often target the M gene to detect IBV and utilize the HA sequence for discrimination between the B-Yamagata and Victoria lineages. Results from rapid antigen detection or isothermal nucleic acid amplification may be available within 30 min, but these assays have on an average slightly lower sensitivity and specificity.</p>
