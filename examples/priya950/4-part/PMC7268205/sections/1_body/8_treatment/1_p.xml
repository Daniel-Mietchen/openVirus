<p id="p0240">There are two classes of compounds licensed for the treatment of acute influenza A and B virus infections, which target either the viral NA or the PA subunit of the viral RNA polymerase. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) include the oral oseltamivir (given as the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate), the inhaled zanamivir and the intravenous peramivir, which all target the substrate binding pocket of NA and reduce enzymatic activity in the nanomolar range to stall the spread of newly synthesized virions to other host cells. It is a consistent finding that IC50 values for IBV NA are up to tenfold higher compared to concentrations needed to inhibit IAV NA. For oseltamivir this observation has been explained by a lower flexibility of the active site residue E276 that impedes high affinity binding to the hydrophobic pocket. The development of resistance towards NAI in IBV has been observed in experimental studies as well as in patients undergoing antiviral treatment. However, the genetic barrier to acquire resistance mutations appears to be high, possibly due to a loss of viral fitness. Global surveillance by the GISRS detected NAI resistance in circulating IBV in five consecutive seasons between 2012–13 and 2016–17 at frequencies between 0.2% and 2.0% using phenotypic assays suggesting that these compounds remain suitable for clinical use. Single amino acid mutations conferring NAI-resistance in clinical isolates have been identified either directly at the catalytic site (R152K), at the NA framework (D198N) or near the sialidase center (G109E, G402S).</p>
