<p>The 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> species complex causes one of the most important plant diseases in the world, bacterial wilt. 
 <bold>Clara Torres–Barceló</bold> (INRA–PACA, Monfavet, France) presented a study aiming at isolating and characterising new 
 <italic>Ralstonia</italic> spp. phages to be used as biocontrol tools. The work also addressed evolutionary questions on the host range of phages, regarding a potential trade-off between the generality and efficiency of phages at controlling their hosts. Forty-two phages were isolated from agricultural samples in Mauritius and the Reunion islands and their host range was tested on 64 
 <italic>Ralstonia</italic> spp. strains, from local or international origins. Although phages preferentially attacked bacterial strains present in the islands, 18 of them were able to multiply in bacteria never detected in the islands. Phages also exhibited variations in their efficacy at decreasing bacterial growth. Finally, Reunion phages appeared to be quite specialised and efficient against genetically homogeneous local 
 <italic>Ralstonia</italic> spp. strains, whereas Mauritius ones were more generalised but not as competent at controlling all of them. The results of this study suggest that the host range should not be the only selection criteria for phage therapy and that they should integrate the phylogenetic information of the targeted bacteria.
