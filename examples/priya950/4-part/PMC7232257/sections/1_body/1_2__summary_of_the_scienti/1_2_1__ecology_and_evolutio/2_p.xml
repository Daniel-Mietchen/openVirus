<p>Bacteriophages, as an important group of predators of bacteria in the ocean, are thought to play an important role in controlling fine-scale blooms within these communities. Using the case of the oyster pathogen 
 <italic>Vibrio crassostreae</italic>, 
 <bold>Frédérique Le Roux</bold> (Ifremer, Marine station of Roscoff, France) wanted to understand whether phages are major drivers of microbial abundance and diversity, and how they evolve in response to 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> resistance. Her team performed seawater and oyster tissue time series sampling over several months and at two distant sites (Brest and Sylt) to assess the dynamic of 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> and their phages. They showed that their abundances are inversely correlated. Investigating the host range of Vibriophages also strongly suggested local adaptation or co-evolution, the phage populations exhibiting a good connection with 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> clones. This work also allowed the characterisation of broad host phages to be used for the rational design of phage cocktails against oyster pathogens.
