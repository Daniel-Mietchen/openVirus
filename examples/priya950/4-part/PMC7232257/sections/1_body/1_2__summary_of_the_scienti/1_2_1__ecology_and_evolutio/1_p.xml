 <bold>Evelien Adriaenssens</bold> (Quadram Institute, Norwich, UK) opened this session, chaired by Damien Piel (PhD student, LM2E, Roscoff, France) and Jack Dorling (PhD student, I2BC, Gif–sur–Yvette, France), with a keynote lecture entitled “Phage Taxonomy: what, how and why?”. Phage taxonomy recently experienced an important evolution linked to sequencing technologies and metagenomics. Although tailed phages were historically classified into families based on morphological analysis of their tail structure (Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae), for example, thousands of bacteriophage sequences recently deposited in public databases show little to no sequence homology between members of the same family, challenging the current classification scheme. Being chair of the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) Bacterial and Archaeal Viruses Subcommittee, Evelien described how the subcommittee is currently reorganizing the morphology-based families in favour of genome-based ones, using an ensemble of genomic, proteomic and phylogenetic methods. Using the case study of a group of large Myoviruses, the Spounaviruses, now grouped into a new family called Herelleviridae, she presented a large-scale, genome-based taxonomic classification that can robustly be carried into the future, fit for high-throughput and metagenomic analyses. She also discussed the rules for naming newly discovered phage (sub)families and suggested working with taxonomists upon these matters. Finally, she presented a series of useful tools for taxonomy (ViPTree server, GRAVity, vConTACT, VICTOR).
