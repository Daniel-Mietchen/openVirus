 <bold>Marie–Agnès Petit</bold> (MICALIS, Jouy–en–Josas, France) and her team previously showed that antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) were infrequent in phage genome and virome contigs [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fourteen pig (five piglets and nine adults) fecal samples were processed to obtain clean and pure pig viromes. Subsequent sequencing led to the conclusion that phage contigs reconstructed from these pig viromes were indeed poor in ARG, although some were found on phage contigs from four of the piglet samples. Also, Inoviridae appeared to be much more prevalent in viromes than previously thought [
