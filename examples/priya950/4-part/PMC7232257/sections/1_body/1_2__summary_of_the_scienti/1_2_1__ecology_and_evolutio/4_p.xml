<p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as 
 <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> are widely used for industrial food fermentation, but also generate great interest for their food-grade expression capabilities (proteins or metabolites) [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To do so, replicating plasmids are often used to introduce genetic material into LAB cells [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but these plasmids need to be maintained into the cells. This can be achieved by several methods, including recently the use of CRISPR–Cas technology [

 <bold>Cécile Philippe</bold> (postdoctoral fellow, Laval University, Quebec City, Canada) demonstrated that streptococcal phage proteins also can be used to increase plasmid stability in LAB cultures and, thus, could be a new tool for food-grade vector applications. Moreover, she showed that this plasmid stability phenotype was not strain-dependant, using various industrial strains.
