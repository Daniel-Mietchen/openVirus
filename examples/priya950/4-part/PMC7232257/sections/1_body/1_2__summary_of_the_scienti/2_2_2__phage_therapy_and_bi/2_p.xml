<p>It opened with a keynote lecture by 
 <bold>Claire Geslin</bold> (LM2E, Brest (UBO), France). Phages are a driving force in many evolutionary processes, even in extreme conditions such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Only a few viruses have been isolated from microorganisms living in these environments. Geslin’s group has characterised some of them. PAV1 and TPV1 are two lemon-shaped viruses from the Thermococcales order that infect hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea; they have two homologous genes encoding proteins containing a concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain, probably involved in virus–host recognition. MFV1 is the first head–tailed virus isolated from a deep-sea hyperthermophilic archaea. To contrast, MPV1 infects a thermophilic, anaerobic and piezophilic bacterium, and is able to package a 13.3 kb plasmid originating from its bacterial host (lateral gene transfer or molecular piracy events). Overall, Claire provided evidences of a morphological and genetic diversity among viruses of (hyper)thermophilic archaea and bacteria, with a prevalence of lysogeny that might contribute to viral DNA stability under extreme conditions [
