<p>The two following talks were given by researchers from the Institute for Structural Biology, Grenoble, studying the structure of the coli-siphophage T5. 
 <bold>Romain Linares</bold> (research fellow), presented his latest data on the structural analysis of the tail of phage T5. Taken from cryo grids of purified T5 tails obtained from a capsid Amber mutant [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Structural analysis shows remarkable structure conservation between the different proteins, but also with proteins of homologous functions in tails of myophages, a type 6 Secretion System, and other phage-derived perforating apparatus.
