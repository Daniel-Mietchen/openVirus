<p>During the vulnerable time during which the bacterium is turned into a viral factory, phages protect their host from over-infection. Regarding T5, this mechanism is mediated by a periplasmic lipoprotein, Llp, targeted to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane, which binds the phage receptor FhuA. Llp’s main biological function probably also is to prevent the inactivation of progeny phage by active receptors present in the outer-membrane debris of lysed cells and increasing their chance of infecting a new host. 
 <bold>Séraphine Degroux</bold> (PhD student) presented her project aiming at deciphering this immunity mechanism using a structural approach. She already produced the Llp protein as an acylated form and as a soluble form. The proteins behaved properly, auguring well for future studies.
