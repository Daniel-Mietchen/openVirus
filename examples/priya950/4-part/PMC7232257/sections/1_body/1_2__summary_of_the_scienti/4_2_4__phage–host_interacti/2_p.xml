<p>The second talk of the session was presented by 
 <bold>Marie Vasse</bold> (research fellow, ETH, Switzerland), where 
 <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> was used to study the impact of phages on its host lifecycle. 
 <italic>M. xanthus</italic> is a bacterium that displays a complex lifecycle alternating between vegetative cells and fruiting bodies that form upon starvation, leading to the production of spores [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When bacteria are challenged with the MX1 virulent phage, germination is delayed, indicating that spores might sense phage or infected/dead cell components. Moreover, the fruiting bodies aspect can be modified when exposed to different phages.
