<p>This large session, chaired first by 
 <bold>Maud Billaud</bold> (PhD student, MICALIS, Jouy–en–Josas, France) then by 
 <bold>Adelaïde Renard</bold> (PhD student, Bactéries et risques materno-foetal, Tours, France), started with a keynote lecture by 
 <bold>Călin Guet</bold> (Institute of Science and Technology, Austria) entitled “The cost of immigration control and the benefits of illegal Immigration”, a metaphoric way to describe the impact of Restriction–Modification (RM) systems on prophage acquisition. This study lies on the assumption that RMs could be costly for their hosts. Conversely, it was noticed that the more bacterial genomes contain RMs, the more they contain prophages. It, therefore, was assessed whether RM efficacy could differ during lysogenic and lytic infections. Using 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and a Lambda phage, it was demonstrated that carrying RMs is costly for the host at the individual level, which relies on self-restriction phenomena. Efficiency of plating and lysogenisation measurements showed that RM activities do not differ within lytic and lysogenic infections, but that, at the population level, RMs promote prophage acquisition. An explanation would be that RMs delay population infection by the phage until bacteria reach high densities, where the lysogenic cycle is predominant [
