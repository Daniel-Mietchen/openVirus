 <bold>Quentin Lamy–Besnier</bold> (PhD student, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) presented an overview of the utilisation of the Viral Host Range database (VHRdb) developed by his team. The identification of host–virus pairs can be difficult and time-consuming due to the accumulation of information and the variety of appellations in public databases. This lack of uniformity results in publication of host ranges that are often incomplete. Additionally, the results of host range experiences performed routinely in many laboratories are rarely publicly available. The ambition of the VHRdb is to provide a tool for the analysis of the host range of viruses and to become a public resource to centralise the experimental information linking viruses to hosts. The VHRdb will be launched during the first semester of 2020.
