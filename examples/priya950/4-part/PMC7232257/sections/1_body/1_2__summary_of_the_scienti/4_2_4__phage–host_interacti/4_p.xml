 <bold>Amel Chaïb</bold> (PhD student, ISVV Œnologie, University of Bordeaux, France) made a presentation on lysogeny in 
 <italic>Oenococcus oeni</italic>, the main agent responsible for malolactic fermentation of wine. Although prophage prevalence in 
 <italic>O. oeni</italic> species is high, its roles on bacterial fitness are still poorly understood. An elegant, colorimetric method, to discriminate lysogenic derivatives of 
 <italic>O. oeni</italic> was presented (lysogens grow red on red grape juice agar medium, while non-lysogenic clones are white). It simplified the construction of isogenic pairs of strains that do or do not carry prophages for further characterization. Different approaches demonstrated that a white to red colony colour switch is linked to prophage spontaneous induction within the intracolonial population. Red grape polyphenolic compounds were shown to interact with dead cell material. The method was further adapted to other LAB species [
