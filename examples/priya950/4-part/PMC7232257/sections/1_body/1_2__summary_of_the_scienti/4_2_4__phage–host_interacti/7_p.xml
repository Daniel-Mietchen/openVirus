 <bold>Naoual Derdouri</bold> (PhD student, Laboratoire de Chimie Bact√©rienne, Marseille, France) then presented her work on the AppY protein, encoded by an 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 DLP12 defective prophage. AppY is a transcriptional regulator of the AraC family, also suspected to improve RNA polymerase sigma S factor (RpoS) stability under stress conditions [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. During the exponential growth phase, RpoS interaction with RssB triggers its degradation by the ClpXP protease. When needed, the RpoS degradation pathway is inhibited by Ira proteins that titrate RssB. Mutation within the HTH motif of the AppY regulator indicated that its transcriptional regulator function is not needed for RpoS stabilisation. Different molecular approaches demonstrated that AppY interacts directly with RssB and that the full-length protein is required, its N-terminal conformation is particularly important. AppY might be a new member of the Ira proteins family. This work shows, for the first time, a prophage-encoded protein-stabilising RpoS.
