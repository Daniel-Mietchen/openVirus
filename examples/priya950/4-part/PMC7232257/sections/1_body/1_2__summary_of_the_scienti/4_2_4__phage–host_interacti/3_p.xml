<p>The session continued with a presentation by 
 <bold>Pauline Misson</bold> (PhD student, MICALIS, Jouy–en–Josas, France) about the impact of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82 prophages on the macrophage-induced persistence of their host. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82 is frequently associated with the microbiota of Crohn’s disease patients. This strain can survive within macrophages and produce persisters (i.e. phenotypic variants with low metabolic activity and transient resistance to antibiotics) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. LF82 harbours five prophages. One of them, Gally, a P22-homologue, is most frequently found in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> associated with Crohn’s disease [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and seems to have a positive impact on the macrophage-induced persistence of its host 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82. Three Gally genes were shown to be overexpressed within macrophages, and their inactivation led to a 3,4-fold less persister production. These genes could be implicated in a non-canonical DNA recombination mechanism, combining homologous and non-homologous recombination to promote DNA repair in persister cells.
