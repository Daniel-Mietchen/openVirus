 <bold>Luis Ramirez</bold> (PhD student, I2BC, Orsay, France) presented his work on the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> T5 phage early gene function in host takeover. The T5 phage delivers its DNA in two sequential steps into the bacterial cell. First, only 8% of the T5 genome is injected, allowing the expression of 17 early genes, then injection resumes. Products of these early genes cause host genome degradation and deactivate its defence mechanisms. Among them, only A1 and A2, a putative DNase and a putative transcriptional regulator, respectively, are known to be essential [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As a first step in studying the significance of early genes in T5 infection, genetic engineering strategies were successfully developed to introduce amber mutations, as well as single and multiple gene deletions in T5. Several T5 mutants exhibited changes during the latent period, burst size and host lysis. These data help to identify critical T5 early genes needed for host takeover.
