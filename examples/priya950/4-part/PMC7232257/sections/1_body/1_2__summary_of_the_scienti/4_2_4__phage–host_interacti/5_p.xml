 <bold>Mehdi El Sadek Fadel</bold> (PhD student, I2BC, Gif–sur–Yvette, France) then reported a study on the molecular mechanism of selective viral DNA recognition and packaging of bacteriophage SPP1. Encapsidation depends on the recognition of a 
 <italic>pac</italic> sequence present on the SPP1 genome by the viral terminase [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Despite the specificity of the terminase for a 
 <italic>pac</italic> sequence, bacterial DNA encapsidation can occur and lead to generalised transduction. Interactions between SPP1 terminase and 
 <italic>pac</italic> were characterized through sequential deletions and substitution mutagenesis of the 
 <italic>pac</italic> region. Results show that a large part of a 
 <italic>pac</italic> sequence is dispensable. Extensive degenerations of 
 <italic>pacL</italic> and 
 <italic>pacR</italic> sub-regions are compensated through suppressor mutations leading to overexpression of the terminase complex or changes in the gp1 protein, respectively, indicating the importance of the concerned sites for viral DNA recognition and cleavage.
