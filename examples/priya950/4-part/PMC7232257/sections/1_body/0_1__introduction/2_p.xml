<p>The Phages.fr network aims at federating researchers mainly located in France who use bacteriophages or their applications in their research, in a very large range of projects (ecology and evolution, molecular mechanisms of infection, genetic regulation, industrial and therapeutic applications, etc.). Our yearly meeting gives them the opportunity to interact, discuss, share experiences and initiate new collaborations. This year, this community met at the Institute for Structural Biology, on the European Photon and Neutron Campus in Grenoble, 8â€“9 October 2019 (

Two private companies, Myriade and Cellexus, presented their technologies related to a rapid method for counting viral particles and a disposable system for the production of phages, respectively.
