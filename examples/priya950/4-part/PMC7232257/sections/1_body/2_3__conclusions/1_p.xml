<p>Similar to previous years, our French Phage Network annual conference favoured many discussions and exchanges in a very friendly atmosphere, and the conference covered a wide range of topics, as can be seen in the summary above. A notable trend is the increasing number of different phage–host systems, witnessing a very active and growing community in France. Furthermore, the activity of our network extends beyond those yearly meetings, and several workshops took place including “Viromathon” organised by Annie Château and Marie–Agnès Petit, 18 October 2018 in Montpellier, “Phage ecology” organised by Mai Huong Chatain and Xavier Bellanger, 27 March 2019 in Lyon, “Genome sequencing and annotation” organised by Mireille Ansaldi and Marie–Agnès Petit, 8–9 October 2019 in Grenoble, and “Phage therapy applied to bone and joint infections” organised by Rémy Froissart and Tristan Ferry, 3 December 2019 in Lyon. During 2020, two workshops are already planned: “Phage Ecology” in Avignon, by Xavier Bellanger and Clara Tores–Barcelò, 27 March, and “Phage therapy” in Paris by Rémy Froissart, Aleandre Bleibtreu and Charlotte Brives, 25 June. More details on past and coming workshops are on our web site

Delattre). Our 2020 conference is scheduled for 7–8 October, at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
