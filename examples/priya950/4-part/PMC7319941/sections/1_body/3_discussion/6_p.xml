In addition, the strict application of standard IPC with compliance with best practices in wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) needs to be reinforced in all areas of HCFs especially in the emergency room and in all specialist inpatient wards where there are a large MERS-CoV susceptible co-morbid patients. An additional challenge when it comes to HCWs in KSA, is that they are housed in special shared facilities next to hospitals, something unique to this region, leading to continued exposure of HCWs in their accommodation and magnifying nosocomial outbreaks. At KKUH, nurses live in two compounds where they share the same amenities, cafeteria and gymnastics hall.
