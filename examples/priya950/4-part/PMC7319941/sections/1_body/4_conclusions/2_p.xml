<p id="p0140">We report a detailed analysis of a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV within the King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. During 2 months in 2015, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases of which 13 were HCWs. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses identified an index case as different from that assumed from clinico-epidemiological investigation. This manuscript highlights the need to use genomic/phylogenetic analyses to identify the index case and possible transmission routes so as to improve infection control (
