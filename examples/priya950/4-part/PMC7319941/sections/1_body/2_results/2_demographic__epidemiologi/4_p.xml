<p id="p0060">On the 4th post-operative day Case #1 developed fever, chest pain, shortness of breath (SOB), and was diagnosed with pneumonia and a MERS-CoV PCR test from a respiratory sample returned to be positive. He was transferred to critical care unit where he died four weeks later, he was identified epidemiologically as the index case, in the meantime Case #2 was discharged home before onset of symptoms, only to return to ER nine days later with fever and SOB, he was placed in RU without AIIR adjacent to Case #4 who was already in RU for an upper gastrointestinal bleed, nine days later she developed SOB and fever. Case #3 who was still in cardiac surgery ward at the same time developed fever and SOB and was transferred to ICU, all three new cases nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) tested positive by PCR for MERS-CoV, and all died. First HCW identified be infected (HCW#1) developed fever and cough two days after caring for Case #4 in RU. Case #5 was placed in RU between Case #2 and Case #4 in a “disaster bed” without any barrier due to an overwhelmingly busy ER and was transferred to cardiac ward prior to onset of respiratory symptoms that developed ten days later in the form of cough, he ultimately recovered, while both other two cases died. Second, third, fourth and fifth infected HCWs (HCW #2, HCW #3, HCW #4 and HCW #5) cared for both Case #2 and Case #4 and were commonly mingling with HCW #1. The 6th HCW (HCW #6) did NPS for Case #4 without personal protective equipment (PPE). Case #6 was in a common room in cardiac ward adjacent to Case #5. HCW #7 and HCW #8 worked in RU and cared for Case #2. Case #7 was diagnosed in a separate ward and was not linked epidemiologically to any of the previous cases or HCWs, she died. HCW# 9 worked in RU and cared for Case #4. HCW# 10 was in direct contact with HCW #3. Case #8 was in also in a common room with Case #5 and Case #6, both Case#8 and Case#6 died. HCW #11 was also in contact with Case #4. HCW #12 was in contact with HCW#1 and was asymptomatic only detected by contact tracing. Case #9 was admitted in a common room adjacent to Case #7, and ultimately recovered. HCW #13 intubated Case #6 without PPE. Case #10 was admitted in a common room adjacent to Case #5. The outbreak primarily affected RU in ER and Cardiac ward and was declared clear 14 days after the death of Case #10.</p>
