  <p>Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the 18 MERS-CoV genomes from this reported hospital outbreak. The genome name was annotated with ‘cs’ for ‘case’ and ‘ct’ for contact (HCW). The taxon node was colored according to their corresponding clinical outcome, symptomatic/recovered (turquoise) or died (red). The Bayesian posterior probabilities of higher than 0.75 were given at each node. The tree was mid-point rooted for clarity. All horizontal branch lengths were drawn to the scale of nucleotide substitutions per site with the scale bar indicated in nt substitutions per site. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)</p>
