  <p>Genomes sequences from the outbreak were aligned in MAFFT (please refer to Materials and Methods for more info), and nucleotide differences from the putative index genome from Case 2 (16023_1_cs2_0734) were identified. Nucleotide changes to A were marked in orange, to T in red, to G in dark blue, to C in light blue and gaps in the second genome with marked in grey. The positions of the major MERS-CoV genes are shown in the upper panel. The lineages A0, A1 and B are marked to the left of the panel,A. The four polymorphic positions (3932, 9365, 9839 and 24029 and 27482 are indicated. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)</p>

   <xref rid="fig1b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b: All genomes or partial genome sequence from the outbreak were aligned in MAFFT (please refer to Materials and Methods for more info), based on which the nucleotide differences from the putative index genome from Case 2 (16023_1_cs2_0734) were identified. Nucleotide changes to A were marked in orange, to T in red, to G in dark blue, to C in light blue and gaps in the second genome with marked in grey. The positions of the major MERS-CoV genes are shown in the upper panel. The major cluster A1, the minor clusters A0 and B and the outlier genome from Case_#1 and HCW#16 are marked to the right of the panel.
