<p id="Par18">Influenza presents with non-specific symptoms, including sudden onset fever, headache, a sore throat and cough. Kilbourne suggested that the disease features caused by different influenza virus subtypes are clinically indistinguishable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several studies have examined the hypothesis that the severity of illness caused by influenza is associated with causal virus types. For example, Mosnier &amp; Irving found that the clinical symptoms and outcomes for patients with influenza A and B infections were comparable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies by Kaji and colleagues showed that influenza A infection was more severe than influenza B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The outcomes of different studies have been variable in terms of sample size, study settings, populations, and the ability to control potential confounders. Despite inconsistent findings, to understand the differences of the severity and outcomes between specific influenza virus types is of great significance to arrange rational diagnositic testings, carry out prompt antiviral treatment and make other clinical decisions in the management of severe influenza.
