<p id="Par40">Our data were consistent with Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that included 369 patients with flu A infection and 205 patients with flu B infection. After adjustment for age, sex, heart disease, malignancies and time from illness onset to antiviral treatment, logistic regression models showed a higher probability of clinical improvement (

 <italic>CI:</italic> 1.019–1.573) and weaning oxygen supplementation (
 <italic>HR:</italic> 1.285, 95% 
 <italic>CI:</italic> 1.030–1.603) in flu B patients. The in-hospital mortality of flu A patients was marginally higher than flu B patients (11.4% vs 6.8%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.078), which might be due to the relatively small number of deaths (56 in total). Similarly, Chaves and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] performed a retrospective study using population-based influenza hospitalization surveillance data. They found that A (H1N1) pdm09 infection was an independent predictor for illness severity both in children (

 <italic>CI:</italic> 1.11–4.33) and adults (
 <italic>aOR:</italic> 2.21, 95%
