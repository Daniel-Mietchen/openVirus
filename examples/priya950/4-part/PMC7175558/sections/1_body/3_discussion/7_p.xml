<p id="Par44">To our knowledge, this is the first real-word cohort study (with a large population of adolescents and adults admitted to general hospital wards or ICUs) that focused on the association of influenza viruses types with illness severity and clinical outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related pneumonia patients. Methods were taken to reduce selection bias and control confounders, but some limitations should be noted. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, potential selection bias may have influenced the data. For example, during each influenza season, patients with influenza-like illness (such as fever, sore throat or cough) were assessed through influenza RNA tests by the subjective judgement of attending physicians in the five hospitals. It was possible that more severe (or milder) patients were tested for influenza. Not all respiratory cases were eligible for swabbing and some selection bias occurred. Secondly, due to the retrospective design, the impact of vaccination on disease severity could not be evaluated, and the inclusion of incomplete data may have lowered the accuracy of our results. Thirdly, there is evidence of different severities of influenza A virus subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, over 50% of patients were not tested for subtypes in our study. Further work is required to compare the clinical features according to subtype. Finally, our study population were immunocompetent, adolescent and adult hospitalized patients. The conclusions should be assessed prudently prior to similar assessments in immunocompromised patients, pediatrics and outpatients.
