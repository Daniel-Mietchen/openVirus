<p id="Par41">In ferret models, A (H1N1) pdm09 strains led to more severe clinical symptoms and histopathology, followed by A (H3N2) strains, whilst Flu B strains had a milder illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although the specific pathogenesis governing these effects has not been elucidated, some mechanisms have been postulated. Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza B virus strains is heavily glycosylated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since glycosylated HA binds collagenous lectins in lung surfactants, it is easily cleared from the lungs. HA of human influenza B viruses also preferentially bind to α-2,6-linked sialic acids present in the human upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses bind both α-2,6-linked and α-2,3-linked sialic acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Influenza B viruses are therefore restricted to the upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses are more prevalent in the lower respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Compared to influenza A viruses, influenza B has lower receptor-binding affinity due to the presence of a Phe-95 versus a Tyr-98 in the HA protein, resulting in a loss of hydrogen bonds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The innate IFN response is also more rapidly initiated following influenza B as opposed to influenza A virus infection. This leads to more rapid viral clearance and lower viral titers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In vivo, both influenza A and B viruses downregulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). A more pronounced reduction in surface MHC-I expression was observed in influenza B patients, leading to milder immunologic reactions, followed by significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and lung tissue injury [
