<p id="Par39">In this study, the 30-day mortality was 19.6%, which was accordant with the 5–50% reported in previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The median age was 61.0 years and over 50% of patients had co-morbidities, delayed NAI therapy and systemic corticosteroid (70 and 25% of patients respectively), which may explain the high mortality rates. The proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation and ICU admission were higher for FluB-p patients. Although the death rates between the two groups were comparable. Significant differences in the 30-day mortality were observed after controlling for confounders.
