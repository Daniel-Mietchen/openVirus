<p id="p0265">The spread of super virus mainly includes horizontal and vertical transmission. Horizontal transmission refers to the spread of viruses between different individuals in the population, including the spread of viruses from animals to humans. Common levels of horizontal transmission are as follows: through the respiratory tract, the digestive tract, the genitourinary tract, the skin wound, and the blood. The way that the virus passes through the placenta, the birth canal, and breastfeeding from the mother to the fetus or newborn is called vertical transmission. </p>
