<p id="p0275">After the virus invades the body, it relies on hemagglutinin to adsorb to the surface of the host cell and enters the cytosol after swallowing. With entering the cytosol, the viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane to release the contained ss-RNA. The eight segments of ss-RNA encode RNA polymerase, nuclear protein, matrix protein, membrane protein, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nonstructural protein, and other components in the cytoplasm. Matrix protein, membrane protein, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and other encoded proteins assemble M protein and envelope on endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. In the nucleus, the genetic material of the virus continuously replicates and forms a viral core with nuclear proteins, RNA polymerases, etc. The final viral core binds to the M protein and envelope on the membrane and is released outside the cell by budding. The replication cycle is within 8Â h.</p>
