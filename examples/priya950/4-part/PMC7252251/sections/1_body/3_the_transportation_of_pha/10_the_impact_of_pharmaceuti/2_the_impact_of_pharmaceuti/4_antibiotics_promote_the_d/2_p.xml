<p id="p0245">The widespread of antibiotics in nature leads to a general change in the community structure of the bacteria, and the ARGs of the bacteria continue to increase. It is speculated that the cause may be the rapid proliferation of pathogens with ARGs present at low basal levels in the pathogen community and the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs mediated by mobile genetic elements such as phage and plasmid. For example, phage particles have recently been found in

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. At the same time, phage can also indirectly lead to bacterial resistance, for example, by altering the cell surface structure of the host bacteria and the structure of the cell envelope to render the antibiotics ineffective. A wide range of host-wide plasmids can rapidly transfer multiple ARGs by ligation or movement to produce antibiotic genes in bacteria in their surrounding environment. In the process of antibiotic transmission, the bacteria can also enhance the expression level of the resistance gene through mutations in the p-endosaminotransferase promoter, thereby increasing their resistance to antibiotics.
