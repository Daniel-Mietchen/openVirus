<p id="p0240">Certain bacteria are inherent in resistance genes to antibiotics, which are genetically intrinsic to encode antibiotic resistance. These pathogens with intrinsic resistance genes are distributed in the environment, and large-scale use of antibiotics will exert selective pressure on these bacteria. These pathogens carrying ARGs can survive in the environment where antibiotics exist and gradually become dominant bacteria in specific environments, and thus leads to changes in the community structure of pathogens in the environment. The drug-resistant genes are highly transferable 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. After these strains carrying the resistance genes become dominant bacteria, the spread of ARGs in the same species and between different species of bacteria is accelerated.
