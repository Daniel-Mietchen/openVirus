<p id="p0235">Antibiotics are chemical compounds derived from organisms (mainly fungi, actinomycetes, or bacteria). They are used to kill or inhibit the action of other organisms (mainly microorganisms) in its metabolism. Antibiotics are not only extracted from microbial culture fluids, but also obtained by artificial synthesis or semisynthesis. Antibiotics can have antibacterial, sterilization, and bacteriostatic effects at different levels. Its mechanism of action mainly includes: death by inhibiting the formation of bacterial cell walls, causing the loss of bacterial cell wall protection, changing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane to hinder the function of the bacterial barrier and the transportation of substances, blocking protein synthesis and causing bacterial growth to be persecuted, affecting DNA and RNA metabolism, and hindering bacterial growth and division
