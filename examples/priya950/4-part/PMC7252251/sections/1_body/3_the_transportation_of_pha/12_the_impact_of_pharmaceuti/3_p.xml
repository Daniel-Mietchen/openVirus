It was also found the pharmaceuticals could induce problem of the reproduction on humans, and the impact was much bigger in the aquatic organisms such as fish

In the cancer and tumor treatment, large amount of the antitumor agents are prescribed. Most of the unused agents and their metabolites would end up in the HWW, municipal wastewater treatment processes cannot eliminate pharmaceuticals; they would remain in the effluent and finally go to receiving water bodies, and then causes genotoxic and carcinogenic effects on humans. Due to the lack of specific risk assessment mechanisms, carcinogens in the water environment cannot be accurately quantified, but existing studies have been able to determine that they have a greater impact on newborns and children than adults
