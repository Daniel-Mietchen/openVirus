<p id="p0350">The impact of HWW on humans, in addition to direct exposure to intake, its toxicity can also be affected by the bioconcentration of the food chain and the flow of substances through the biological chain, which is considered as bioaccumulation. It is another important pathway of pharmaceuticals transported to humans. For example, antibiotics are a major class of drugs. Antibiotics discharged into the water with the hospital’s wastewater are accumulated in drinking water and aquatic foods. Humans can accumulate antibiotics in the body by taking water which are contaminated by antibiotics or taking the aquatic products obtained from the antibiotic contaminated waste. It then can cause biomagnifications to increase their concentration, and then lead to chronic toxicity, allergic reactions, and “three-in-one.” It will also break the balance of normal flora in the human body; thereby impact on various physiological functions of human beings to threaten human health. In addition, antibiotics can produce drug resistance genes in migration and transformation, and drug resistance genes transmit mutations in different bacteria
