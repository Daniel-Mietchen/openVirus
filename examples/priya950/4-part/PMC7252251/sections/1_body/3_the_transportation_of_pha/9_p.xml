<p id="p0230">Pathogens in HWW flow into the sewage treatment plant along the pipeline. It also transported to the soil and then groundwater along the pipeline leakage. Hence, pathogen pollution is possible in the groundwater. In addition, as mentioned wastewater treatment processes cannot completely remove the pathogens in wastewater, and thus rivers, lakes, and reservoirs would suffer from different degrees of pollution when they are the receiving water bodies of the effluent of WWTPs 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Many pathogenic microorganisms accumulate in plants and animals in water. When human gets contact with these plants and animals, they will pose a threat to human health and cause many intestinal diseases. For example, typhoid and paratyphoid could be caused by salmonella typhi or salmonella paratyphoid. Air is also an important route for the spread of pathogens. Some pathogens live in the air for a long time and spread between human and animals as the air moves
