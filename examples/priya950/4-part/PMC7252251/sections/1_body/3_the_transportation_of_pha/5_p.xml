<p id="p0210">At present, the general wastewater treatment processes are screening, gritting, primary sedimentation, biological treatment, and secondary sedimentation. The conventional processes are not specially designed for removal of antibiotics; thus, they will not be able to be removed. It was reported that the removal rate of antiepileptic drug carbamazepine was only 8% and the removal rate of cholesterol-lowering drug clofibrate almost zero

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. It suggests that the residual antibiotics after wastewater treatment will be discharged to the receiving water bodies along with the WWTP effluent. As the surface water circulates with the groundwater, the water in the river will enter the groundwater through the soil, which will then not only contaminate the groundwater, but also accumulate antibiotic drugs in the soil. Especially, the antibiotic content in the river sediment will be higher, which will also bring pollution to the farmland soil environment. So far, antibiotics have become a very common pollutant in the environment.
