<p id="p0300">Marine life refers to various organisms in the ocean, including marine animals, marine plants, microorganisms, and viruses. The marine animals include invertebrates and vertebrates. The primary contact pathways of marine organisms with pollutants are ingestion, including both adsorption and assimilation 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Adsorption is the process by which a substance binds to the cell wall of a body surface. There are both reversible physical adsorption and less reversible chemical adsorption. Assimilation is the passage of contaminants through the body surface (through the wall of the digestive tract) into the body, actively or passively transferring (via the blood, circulation of the hemolymph) to other tissues and organs. The second important biological process of pollutants in the ocean is accumulation, which depends on factors such as the assimilation efficiency, concentration, and acute or chronic pollution of the pollutants
