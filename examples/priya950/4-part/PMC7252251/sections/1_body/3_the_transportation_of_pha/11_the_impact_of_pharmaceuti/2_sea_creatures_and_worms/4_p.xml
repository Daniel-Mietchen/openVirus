<p id="p0305">Marine worms include polychaete worms, ribbon worms, tube worms, and flatworms 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. These marine caterpillars belong to the annelid gate. The most important feature of an annelid is the body that is divided into similar links from beginning to end. The new link of the worm will come out from the tail, and there is a sensory organ on the head to sense the environment. There are many caterpillars in the ocean. They are mainly benthic animals. In general, plankton in the ocean or other floating foods are the main food source of marine worms. Marine worms are an important source of food for many fish and wading birds, and this can have an impact on the entire food chain.
