If these elements are not removed, they will enter the water environment and may even migrate and transform 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Marine organisms have an enrichment effect on radioactive materials. They can absorb and accumulate nuclides directly from seawater or through feeding. Nuclide can be transferred along the marine food chain (food web), and some can be expanded along the food chain. In addition, in a polluted environment, marine organisms are exposed to radiation from inside and outside the body, and genes are prone to mutations that affect the growth and reproduction of offspring.
