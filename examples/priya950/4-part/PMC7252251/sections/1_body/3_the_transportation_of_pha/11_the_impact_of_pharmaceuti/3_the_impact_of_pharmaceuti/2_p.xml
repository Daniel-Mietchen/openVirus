<p id="p0315">Studies have shown that pharmaceuticals enter environment mainly through three pathways 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>: (1)the cleaning of unused pharmaceuticals in the containers, (2)the dumping of the unused pharmaceuticals, and (3)the unabsorbed fraction of the patientâ€™s metabolites. Usually, these unused pharmaceuticals have little or no change in their chemical structure when discharged from HWW. They are easy to form conjugated compounds with polar molecules, and these conjugated bonds are very easy to be broken in municipal wastewater treatment. Therefore the original pharmaceuticals are released into the water environment through the effluent from the WWTP.
