<p id="p0320">Antibiotics are mainly used to treat various bacterial infections or pathogenic microbial infections, and generally do not cause serious side effects to their hosts. It is believed that antibiotics commonly used in medicine such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and metronidazole are almost impossible to be biodegraded in water, and their reproductive toxicity does not only harm human health, but also affects biological organisms in the water environment 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Excessive exposure of antibiotics into the water environment can lead to increased resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Studies have shown that

 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, which are associated with aquatic animal infections, have developed resistance to commonly used antibiotics
