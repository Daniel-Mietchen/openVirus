<p id="p0295">As HWW contains a large number of pathogens and drugs, it must be treated before it is discharged. Otherwise, pathogens and drugs in the wastewater will pollute the water and cause diseases. The pathogens in medical wastewater are pathogenic pollutants in water. Pathogenic pollutants are pathogenic microorganisms and bacteria that can cause diseases in humans and animals. Hospitals often need to disinfect and treat patients. Therefore the hospitalâ€™s wastewater usually contains a certain amount of toxic substances such as antibiotics, mercury, and phenols
