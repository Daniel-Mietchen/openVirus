<p id="p0335">Pathogens derived from HWW can enter the ocean and contaminate seawater, adversely affecting marine life and marine worms. After host cells are infected by pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites), it may directly or indirectly cause problem on the host cell such as genotoxic agents, tumor proteins, pathogen replication, and inflammatory reactions, and thus affecting the activation of the DDR pathway. This puts tremendous pressure on the stability and integrity of the cell genome 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In addition, due to the presence of pathogens, marine organisms often carry pathogenic bacteria. For example, the contaminated parts of fish are mainly oral cavity, sputum, stomach, intestines, and excretory cavities. Moreover, oysters, which are closely related to pathogens in shellfish, can spread typhoid fever. Besides, marine worms also carry pathogens due to predation, thereby expanding the spread of pathogenic bacteria.
