<p id="p0395">It is revealed that nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes are potential technology for further removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens from HWW after being treated with MBR. Residues of pharmaceuticals in the effluent of MBR can be further separated from water by NF or by RO being retained due to molecular weight and size, sorption, and charge attraction. Among all, sorption is considered as the primary removal mechanism for poorly soluble nonpolar compounds
