<p id="p0030">Generally, the HWW is required to be treated in situ to reduce the discharge of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, there are still some places cotreating the HWW along with municipal wastewater. In fact, municipal WWTPs are designed to remove the general contaminants including fats, oils, organic matters, nitrogen, and phosphorus from human wastes 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore the traditional wastewater treatment processes are not suitable for the removal of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and ARGs. It reveals that these substances would discharge to the environment along with wastewater treatment effluent when HWW was treated with municipal wastewater treatment processes. HWW containing all kinds of hazard materials is often transported to the traditional urban WWTPs. Unfortunately, HWW may not be properly treated in the WWTP 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is found that substances, such as antitumor agents, antibiotics, and organ halogen compounds, are barely degraded by the WWTPs and left in the effluents 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nowadays, pharmaceuticals can be detected in surface waters, ground waters, and drinking water due to their inefficient removal in WWTP
