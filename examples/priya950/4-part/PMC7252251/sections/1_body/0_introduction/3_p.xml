<p id="p0015">HWW may contain various hazardous materials which can be classified into physical remaining, chemical substances, and biological risks 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The majority of physical hazards presenting in HWW are the radioactive substances which are utilized in nuclear medicine therapies and diagnostics. The common isotope utilized is the 
 <sup>131</sup>I (iodine-131) radio isotope compared to other radionuclides (phosphorus-32, strontium-89, yttrium-90, etc.). The concentration of 
 <sup>131</sup>I in the HWW is in the range of 15.0–61.8 Bq/L 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It normally poses a much higher physical risk.
