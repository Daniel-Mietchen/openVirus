<p id="p0125">The main mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance is revealed to be the direct inactivation of these antibiotics by enzyme modification. Till date, more than 50 modified enzymes have been identified. These enzymes are divided into three groups based on their biochemical effects on aminoglycoside substrates, including acetyltransferases, phosphoryltransferases, and nucleotide transferases (glycosyltransferases). They are encoded by the acetyltransferase (aac), phosphotransferase (aph), and nucleotidyl transferase (ant)genes, respectively
