<p id="p0110">To date, at least 38 different tetracycline resistance genes (tet) and 3 oxytetracycline resistance genes (otr) have been identified 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These genes include 23 genes encoding efflux proteins (efflux pump mechanism), 11 ribosome protective protein genes (targeted modification mechanisms), and 3 inactivated genes. The development of tet is considered due to enzymes and also unknown gene resistance mechanisms.
