<p id="p0155">The β-lactams are the most widely used antibiotics due to their less toxic and effective to a variety of infections. However, their resistance is a serious threat. The β-lactam resistance mechanisms include the inaccessibility of antibiotics to their target enzymes, modification of target enzymes, and/or direct inactivation of 3-lactamases to antibiotics. The main resistance mechanism of Gram-negative bacteria is the cleavage of the β-lactam ring to inactivate the β-lactamase. More than 400 β-lactamases encoded by ARGs (βla) have been identified. They have showed mediate resistance to various β-lactamases, including penicillin and cephalosporins
