<p id="p0145">Sulfonamides are the most widely used antibiotics in clinical practice and their target is recombinant human deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). Trimethoprim competitively used to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. These two biological enzymes are responsible for the biosynthesis of folic acid to some extent. They could impact on the production of thymine and the growth of microorganisms. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim resistance are generally encoded by mutations located in highly conserved regions of the DHPS and DHFR genes.</p>
