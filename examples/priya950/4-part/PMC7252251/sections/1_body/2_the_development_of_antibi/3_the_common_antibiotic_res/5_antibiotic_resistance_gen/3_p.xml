<p id="p0140">Several erm genes were detected in 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> isolated from poultry wastewater and in environmental DNA extracted from farms. Six types of erm genes (A, B, C, F, T, and X) were detected and quantified from samples of mature animal, lagoon, and biological filtration systems employed to treat swine wastewater. Among the factors determining macrolide resistance, ermB is considered to be the most common gene in environmental microorganisms, especially enterococci and streptococcal SPP strains 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The resistance mechanisms of chloramphenicol and fluorophenol include chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (encoded by the cat gene), specific exporters (encoded by the CML gene), and multidrug transporters. Among the currently known antichloramphenicol genes, several types of cat or CML genes have been reported. Vancomycin resistance was first observed in 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and recently in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. It indicates that the ARGsâ€™ transfer between microorganisms exists.
