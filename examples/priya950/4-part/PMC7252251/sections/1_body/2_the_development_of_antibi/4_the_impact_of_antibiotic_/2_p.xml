<p id="p0170">Antibiotics are widely used to protect people’s health, and most antibiotics are naturally discharged into the environment. Therefore currently the potential impact of antibiotic residues on the environment has received increasing attention. Antibiotics are very common in the surface water except the primitive mountains where rivers or streams did not flow through cities or agricultural areas. As reported, some antibiotics were even found in groundwater 10 m depth. In addition to the chemical contamination caused by the antibiotic itself, the use of antibiotics may accelerate the development of ARGs and bacteria
