<p>Figure 1-3: The authors have quantitated the appearance of EGFP-Atg8 punctae upon transient transfection of the plasmid into cells. From the images shown, it appears that the transfection efficiency is extremely low in these cells â€“ hence the quantitative estimates might not be reflective of the whole population. It might be a lot more interpretable if they stably expressed EGFP-Atg8 in these cells. </p>
