<p>Figure 5: Depletion of the three autophagosomal genes needs to be confirmed by immunoblotting at protein expression levels. If the extent of depletion is low, it is possible that the lack of a significant effect on viral titers is because of residual activity of the genes. Also, how do the authors reconcile the discrepancy in the phenotype with genetic depletion versus the pharmacological inhibition experiments? Gene-depletions show non-significant effect on viral titers whereas induction or inhibition with pharmacological compounds clearly increases viral titers.</p>
