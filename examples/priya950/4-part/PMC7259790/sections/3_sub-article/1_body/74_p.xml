<p>Reviewer #2: Specific comments are presented in a separate file. I think the study is interesting overall, but the manuscript as written would greatly benefit from increased explanations, better flow and clarity throughout. Please either complete the experiments necessary to make the study fully factorial, or provide an explanation for why not all experiments were completed (across viruses, chemical modulators and timepoints).</p>
