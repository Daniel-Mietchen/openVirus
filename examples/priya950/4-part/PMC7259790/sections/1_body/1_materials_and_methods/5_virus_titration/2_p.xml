<p>The effect of cell line on DENV-2 virus titers was determined by following the above protocol in a mammalian cell line (BHK21 c15) and a mosquito cell line with a dysfunctional RNA interference pathway (C6/36) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. C6/36 cells were seeded at 1.5x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well and BHK cells were seeded at 5x10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ well in 12 well plates. The following day, both cell lines were infected with DENV-2 and treated with 1% DMSO, 1 μM torin-1 or 10 μM spautin-1. Titers were harvested at 48 hpi. Each experiment was completed in triplicate with two biological replicates per experimental replicate.
