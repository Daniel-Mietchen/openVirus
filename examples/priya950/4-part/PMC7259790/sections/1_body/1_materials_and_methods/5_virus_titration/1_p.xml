<p>Two days after Aag2 cells were seeded at 1.5x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 12-well plate, cells were infected with DENV-2 or CHIKV at an M.O.I. of 0.1. After infection for one hour at 28°C, cells were treated in duplicate with 1% DMSO, 1 μM bafilomycin A1, 1 μM torin-1 or 10 μM spautin-1. Virus supernatants were collected 24 and 48 hours after drug application. Finally, Aag2 cells were seeded and transfected with dsLuciferase, dsAtg5, dsAtg8, or dsAtg14 as previously described. Two days after transfection, the cells were infected with DENV-2 or CHIKV and virus supernatants were harvested at 24 and 48 hpi.
