<p>Silencing efficiency of Atg5 and Atg14 was determined through RT-qPCR with Universal SYBR Green master mix (Bio-Rad), using luciferase samples as the non-targeting control group and GAPDH as a reference gene (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Silencing efficiency of Atg8 was determined by Western blotting. Two days after dsAtg8 was transfected into Aag2 cells, cells were infected with DENV-2 as above. Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer 24 hpi. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described.
