<p>Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is an essential cellular process required for maintaining homeostasis and plays a crucial role in development, cell differentiation and immunity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, abnormal autophagic activity has been linked to a number of pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This evolutionarily conserved pathway mediates the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Upon induction, protein aggregates, damaged or dysfunctional organelles and foreign bodies are sequestered into cup-shaped double-membrane vesicles termed phagophores or isolation membranes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Appropriation of cargo can occur in a non-selective manner known as bulk autophagy whereby cytoplasmic material is indiscriminately engulfed, or through selective autophagy, which specifically targets poly-ubiquitin tagged proteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Through a series of kinase signaling cascades and recruitment events, the phagophore elongates, eventually encompassing the cargo and forming an autophagosome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequently, the mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes resulting in the acidification of the newly formed autophagolysosome and degradation of the cargo [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Targeting aspects of the autophagy pathway has become a promising strategy for combatting a number of diseases [
