<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that arboviruses induce autophagy upon infection of mammalian cells [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To examine if autophagy is similarly induced upon arbovirus infection in mosquito cells, Aag2 cells were infected with DENV-2 (48 hpi) and CHIKV (24 hpi) and autophagic activity quantified. Infection with either DENV-2 or CHIKV alone had no effect on the ratio of Atg8-PE to β-actin as determined by immunoblot (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g003">3A and 3B</xref>). Similar results were observed for another flavivirus, Zika virus (ZIKV) at 48 hpi (

As previously determined, our inability to observe autophagy induction may be due to the high rate of autophagic flux associated with these cells. Consequently, addition of bafilomycin A1 to the DENV-2 infections significantly increased Atg8-PE to β-actin ratios (

To further validate these findings, Aag2 cells were transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing Atg8-EGFP and infected in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1. As with the immunoblot, DENV-2 infections (48 hpi) in the absence of bafilomycin A1 had no effect on autophagic activity, while the addition of bafilomycin A1 significantly increased Atg8+ puncta/ cell compared to the controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Similarly, increases in Atg8+ puncta/ cell were observed during CHIKV (24 hpi) and ZIKV (48 hpi) infection in the presence of bafilomysin A1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007754.s003">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, the totality of the microscopy and immunoblot data provide confidence that, like mammalian systems, arboviruses induce autophagy in mosquito cells.
