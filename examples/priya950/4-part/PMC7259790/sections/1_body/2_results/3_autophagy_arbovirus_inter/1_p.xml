<p>Autophagy plays a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that autophagy can be antiviral; however, some viruses have evolved mechanisms to either circumvent autophagy or usurp components of the pathway for their own benefit [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To ascertain the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquitoes, the impacts of pharmacological modulators of autophagy on arbovirus replication in Aag2 mosquito cells was assessed. If autophagy were functioning in an antiviral manner, inhibition of autophagy would result in increased viral titers and induction would result in decreased titers. Indeed the application of spautin-1 resulted in significantly increased DENV-2 titers at 24 and 48 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Similar results were observed for ZIKV at 48 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007754.s004">S3 Fig</xref>), but not those of CHIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Due to the unexpected and paradoxical findings, we examined the effects of autophagy through suppression of three genes within the autophagy pathway: Atg5 (required for phagophore elongation), Atg8 (required for phagophore elongation and membrane curvature) and Atg14 (essential autophagy regulator). Treatment of Aag2 cells with gene specific dsRNA resulted in significant suppression of Atg5 and Atg14 as determined by RT-qPCR as well as depletion of Atg8 as determined by immunoblot 72 hpt (hours post treatment) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007754.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Suppression of the autophagy related genes had no discernible effect on DENV-2 titers 24 or 48 hpi compared to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Likewise suppression of Atg5 and Atg14 had no effect on CHIKV at 24 or 48 hpi or ZIKV titers at 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g005">Fig 5B</xref>)(
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007754.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Together these results suggest that chemical modulators of autophagy significantly alter arbovirus replication in Aag2 cells, yet it is unclear if this is due to modulation of the autophagy pathway or through an as of yet unidentified non-autophagy mediated mechanisms.
