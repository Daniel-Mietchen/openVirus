  <title>Efficient silencing of autophagy genes in mosquito cells.</title>
  <p>Aag2 cells were treated with dsRNA targeting Atg5, Atg14, or Atg8 and assayed for suppression 48 hours post transfection. Silencing efficiency of A) Atg5 and B) Atg14 was determined by ΔΔC
   <sub>T</sub> analysis with luciferase samples as the non-targeting control group and GAPDH as a reference gene. Data was analyzed with a two-tailed t-test. C) Silencing efficiency of Atg8 was determined by immunoblot.
