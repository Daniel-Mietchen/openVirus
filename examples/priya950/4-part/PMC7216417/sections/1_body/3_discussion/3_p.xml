<p id="Par33">Among the participants, there was no significant difference in ZIKV IgM seroprevalence according to sex. The higher percentage of female participants in this study is due to socioeconomic factors in this region, as adult males have a higher tendency to travel for employment opportunities in urban areas. While statistically insignificant, the proportion of ZIKV IgM seropositivity in the Kinh ethnic group was higher (11.5%) than that of the minority Ede ethnic group (8.6%). This tendency may be due to the Kinh ethic group possessing higher proficiency in the national language, and are thus, more likely to travel and had higher mobility as compared to other minority ethnic groups. This may reflect as increased risk of infectious disease exposure due to ethnic and socio-economical associated activity and behaviors. However, in the context of local socioeconomic development, rural poverty is still predominant, particularly in terms of access to medical care. These socioeconomic factors may further drive inter-city migrant workers to travel between larger cities and rural areas, in addition to low seroprevalence rate in the region, these factors may in turn lead to further Zika epidemic expansion during outbreaks.</p>
