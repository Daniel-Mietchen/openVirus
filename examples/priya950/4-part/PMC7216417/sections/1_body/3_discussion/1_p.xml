<p id="Par31">In this study, we determined the anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies among 801 participants who were recruited during ZIKV epidemic in Vietnam. Of the 83 first samples that demonstrated ZIKV IgM antibodies, only 8 (1.0%) had ZIKV neutralizing antibodies (PRNT = 1:40–1:640) with 3 cases exposed to ZIKV infection confirmed using PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> with ZIKV neutralizing titer ≥4fold of DENVs neutralizing titer. While anti-IgM ZIKV antibodies may have lower specificity than other laboratory assays, the test is useful for identifying probable ZIKV cases during an outbreak [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Due to relatively short detection window for ZIKV IgM antibodies, a combination of tests that determine ZIKV neutralizing antibodies and ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies would be useful for long-term seroprevelance studies. As such, ZIKV IgM test was used to determine ZIKV IgM antibodies during the ZIKV outbreak in Vietnam in 2016, and ZIKV-specific IgG ELISA and PRNT was included in this study. In further tests by using the anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG test, 3 of the 5 probable cases were confirmed positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies. By using both PRNT (ZIKV, DENV1–4) and anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG assays in all 83 participants that demonstrated cross-reactive ZIKV IgM antibodies, only 6 (7.2%) samples fulfilled the criteria of ZIKV PRNT ratio &gt; 4 and presence of ZIKV-specific NS1 cross-reactive antibodies, confirming that these 6 individuals had recently become infected with ZIKV. Using samples from the same participants, the levels of antibodies were determined 18 months after the first sample collection (post-ZIKV epidemic). Among these 6 confirmed cases, 3 samples that were only ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies positive during the first collection also demonstrated high ZIKV neutralization titers 18 months later. None of the ZIKV seropositive participants had an international travel history, suggesting that local transmission in the area.
