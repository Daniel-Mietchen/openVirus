<p id="Par27">Of the 718 samples that were negative for anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies, 5 (Z147a, Z472a, Z606a, Z587a and Z591a) demonstrated neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> = 1:320–1:5120). Among the 5 samples, 2 samples (Z472a and Z606a) demonstrated a 4-fold or greater level of neutralizing antibodies to all 4 DENV serotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, by testing all 879 samples collected in both rounds using PRNT, 13 participants (1.6%, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 801) had detectable ZIKV neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 7 participants (0.9%, Z140, Z141, Z153, Z476, Z735, Z472 and Z606) demonstrated ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers that were at least 4-fold higher than their antibody titers to all 4 DENV serotypes, whereas the other 6 participants (0.8%) demonstrated comparable levels of ZIKV and DENV neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the results suggest that the 7 participants had been exposed to ZIKV during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic.
