<p id="Par26">Consecutive samples were collected from 78 of the 83 participants with anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies collected from the same participants 18â€‰months after the first sample collection. Second consecutive samples were not collected from 5 participants who was not available at the time of second sample collection, including two (Z153 and Z420) of the 8 participants with ZIKV neutralizing antibodies in their initial sample. Two participants (Z120 and Z735) experienced a 2- to 4-fold decrease, and 2 participants (Z140 and Z476) experienced a 4- to 8-fold increase in their ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of the 83 participants with anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies, 5 (6.0%; Z140, Z141, Z153, Z476 and Z735) had ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers that were at least 4-fold greater than their antibody titers against the 4 DENV serotypes tested.
