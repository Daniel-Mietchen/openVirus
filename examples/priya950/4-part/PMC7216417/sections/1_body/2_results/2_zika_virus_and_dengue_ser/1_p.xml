<p id="Par22">Of the 801 samples tested, 83 (10.3%) were positive for anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with an average P/N ratio of 3.30 ± 1.48. While the P/N ratio is not a quantitative method, the ratio was used as a means to determine antibody levels of 83 samples, for the presence or absence of anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies. All participants who tested positive were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. The prevalence of anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies varied moderately by age (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) and was highest in the 46–60 year age group (14.2%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(a)). The seroprevalence of ZIKV IgM did not differ significantly according to sex or ethnicity. Only one of the 66 pregnant women (1.5%) was positive for anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies.
