<p id="Par53">The SIRS criteria have been used to predict outcomes in influenza. Tai et al. conducted a retrospective study that included 409 geriatric ED patients (age ≥ 65 years) who tested positive on RIDT [

The present study included all adult patients with influenza, not merely elderly patients, and we included patients with positive RT-PCR test results for influenza to reduce bias. We found that the SIRS had poor predictivity for outcomes in influenza.
