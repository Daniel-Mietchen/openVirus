<p id="Par56">Patel et al. developed a predictive classification tree model to estimate the mortality rates of the human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 based on significant predictors of influenza mortality, including age, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, country, and per capita government health expenditure. However, the quality of data was inconsistent [

There were wide variations in their database, such as with regard to surveillance and clinical care, vaccination policy, lack of data on antiviral treatment, and time from illness onset to the initiation of antiviral treatment. Furthermore, the abovementioned study was limited to HPAI A/H5N1 and did not include all influenza.
