<p id="Par57">Patients with a qSOFA score ≥ 1 might already have clinically apparent illness. Emergency physicians might not always need the qSOFA score to facilitate patient disposition. However, this quantitative scoring tool could generate a more objective and more representative picture of every individual with influenza. In addition, in our data, the CCI, admission rate, and mortality rate were relatively higher than in previous studies. This means that our cohort had more severe illness and was therefore much closely representative of the real ED. We believe that our results are reliable and can be applied in clinical practice, especially in the ED.</p>
