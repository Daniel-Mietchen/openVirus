<p id="Par59">The definition of “altered mentation” with regard to the qSOFA score has two versions in the literature. One includes a GCS score ≤ 13, which was mentioned in the original study of Sepsis-3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The other was a GCS score &lt; 15, according to the definitions of sepsis and septic specified by the Third International Consensus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, we used the GCS score &lt; 15 for analysis. This might have caused an overestimated qSOFA score because of patients with unclear baseline mental status due to underlying disease.
