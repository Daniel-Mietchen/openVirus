<p id="Par55">Other studies have attempted to use serum biomarkers to predict outcomes in patients with influenza. Zimmerman et al. reported that serum levels of C-reactive protein were an early predictor of outcome in the ED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Another report concluded that serum level of lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 600 IU/L was associated with mortality in influenza-induced pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, both of the abovementioned studies were limited to H1N1 influenza. Moreover, serum biomarkers were not optimal as early prognostic predictors because we blood tests will not be conducted for every patient with influenza in a busy ED, especially during an epidemic outbreak.
