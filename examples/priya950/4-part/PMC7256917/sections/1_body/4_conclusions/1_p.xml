<p id="Par60">The qSOFA score is potentially a useful prognostic predictor for influenza and could be applied in the ED after triage, as an early risk stratification tool. Patients with an initial qSOFA score ≥ 1 might need to be hospitalized patients whereas those with a qSOFA score of 3 might need intensive monitoring and aggressive treatment and ICU admission might be indicated. However, the qSOFA may not be a good screening triage tool because of its poor sensitivity in the detection of high-risk patients. The SIRS criteria had poor predictive performance for influenza outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine whether there exists any role for the SIRS criteria and to confirm a role for the qSOFA score in the assessment of patients with influenza as well as other viral respiratory infections.</p>
