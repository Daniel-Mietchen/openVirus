<p id="Par50">In the SIRS model, when the SIRS score was ≥2 (the cutoff point defined by Sepsis-2), accuracy was merely 25.9 and 25.6% for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). To obtain the best Youden Index (0.195 for ICU admission, 0.207 for in-hospital mortality), the cutoff point should be a SIRS score ≥ 3. However, the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio of SIRS ≥3 were poorer than those of qSOFA ≥1. Thus, the qSOFA score is a better tool to predict influenza outcomes.
