<p id="Par49">The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the qSOFA model for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.861, which was significantly higher than the AUC of the SIRS model (0.79; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). When the qSOFA score was ≥2, which is the cutoff point defined by Sepsis-3, the qSOFA had high predictive accuracy for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality (94.5 and 94.7%, respectively) although the sensitivity was low (26.3 and 24%, respectively). If the cutoff point was set as a qSOFA score ≥ 1, this would ensure the best Youden Index (0.587 for ICU admission, 0.590 for in-hospital mortality) as well as better sensitivity (82.1 and 82.7%, respectively), which could facilitate clinical decision-making by emergency physicians.
