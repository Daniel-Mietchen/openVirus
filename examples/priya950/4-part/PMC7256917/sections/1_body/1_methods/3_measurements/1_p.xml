<p id="Par42">The vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score recorded at triage were collated. The qSOFA score ranges from 0 to 3, with one point for each of the following: respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths per minute, altered mentation, and systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg. We defined altered mentation as a GCS score &lt; 15 at triage or decreased coma scale compared to the baseline level. A positive qSOFA score was defined as a score of 2 or higher. In addition, we collected SIRS criteria, including body temperature &gt; 38 °C or &lt; 36.0 °C, heart rate &gt; 90 beats per min, respiratory rate ≥ 20 breaths per min, WBC count &gt; 12,000 or &lt; 4000 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, or &gt; 10% immature (band) forms. The SIRS score ranges from 0 to 4, and a positive SIRS score was defined as 2 or more points.
