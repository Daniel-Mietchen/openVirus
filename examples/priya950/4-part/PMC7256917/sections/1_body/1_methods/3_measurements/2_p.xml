<p id="Par43">All the results of initial laboratory tests in the ED were extracted from the electronic medical records; trained hospital personnel who were blinded to the objective of the study calculated the qSOFA and SIRS scores.

Associated data were obtained, including sex, age, and comorbidities. We used the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [
