<p id="Par45">Data from the CGRD were statistically analyzed, and results were presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables as well as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. Moreover, we calculated the percentages of outcomes by each level of SIRS and qSOFA. Logistic regression models were built to evaluate the predictive ability of these two scoring tools for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves with c-statistics were used to compare the predictive performance of the tools. All statistical analyses were undertaken using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Significance level α was set at 0.05.</p>
