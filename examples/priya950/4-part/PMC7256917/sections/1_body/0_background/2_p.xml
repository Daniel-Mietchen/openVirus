<p id="Par35">Early recognition of patients with potentially worse outcomes is important in the emergency department (ED) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The first clinical prediction rule of influenza infection, comprising 9 parameters, was published in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2011, Oh et al. reported four risk factors associated with disease severity: altered mental status, hypoxia, bilateral lung infiltration, and old age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The geriatric influenza death (GID) score and the Shock Index were recently reported to be prediction rules for patients with influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, not all prediction rules that have been described have provided satisfactory diagnostic strength. Moreover, some laboratory tests in these studies were not routinely checked in the ED and, therefore, they may not be feasible in all EDs. A simple and accurate prediction rule is yet to be developed.
