<p>In this paper, we have extended a previously developed model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to account for specific features of inter-human transmission. We then compare this model to the previous version (which focussed on sylvatic transmission) and update previous estimates of YF burden and vaccine impact, accounting for indirect effects. Lastly, based on local estimates of the potential for inter-human urban transmission, we propose different scenarios of PMVCs that could be considered for the EYE strategy, evaluating vaccine demand and impact in terms of infections and mortality averted.
