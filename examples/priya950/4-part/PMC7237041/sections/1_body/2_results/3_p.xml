<p>We estimated per-infection probabilities of detection by combining GLM predictions and results of serological surveys. These detection probabilities, which encompass all infections that occurred during the 1984–2013 period including asymptomatic infections, were distributed across several order of magnitude around 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, but spatial heterogeneity was consistent between model variants (
