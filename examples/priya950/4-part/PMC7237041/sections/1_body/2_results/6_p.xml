<p>Estimates of the YF-specific burden are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008304.g004">Fig 4</xref>. We estimate 107,000 deaths (37,000–272,000) occurred in 2017 according to the FOI model and 30,000 (4,000–123,000) according to the

 </sub> model. As expected from its non-linear response to vaccination, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> model was more sensitive to variations in vaccination coverage and predicted a higher burden than the FOI model before the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns (that is, before 2006), but a lower burden thereafter (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s008">S5 Fig</xref>). Of note, with no or low-level of vaccination coverage as in Eastern Africa, both model versions exhibited similar temporal trends (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). Province-based burden estimates are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008304.g004">Fig 4</xref>. While the FOI model structure forced it to predict a non-zero force of infection, large parts of the endemic zone exhibited very low incidence rates (notably in Rwanda and Burundi). In contrast, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> model predicted a zero incidence in all provinces where the vaccination coverage exceeded the local CVC. Large regions of Eastern Africa, that did not benefit from any vaccination activities, still exhibited small incidence rates in both model variants.
