<p>Our estimates of under-reporting of the disease (ranging between 10
 <sup>−7</sup> and 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) may appear low at first glance. However, there are several considerations to keep in mind when interpreting these estimates. Firstly, these are estimates of per-infection detection probability, while only about 10% of all infections are estimated to lead to severe disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Secondly, the symptoms associated with mild or even severe yellow fever infections are wide and non-specific. This leads to cases being frequently confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis or infections with other flaviviruses. Thirdly, our under-reporting estimates constitute an average over a 30-year time period (1984–2013). Regional capacities for laboratory confirmation of diagnostic was quite limited over a large part of this time period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During this time period, official case detection reported the virtual absence of reported cases in some years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the annual burden was estimated around 200,000 cases at the same time [
