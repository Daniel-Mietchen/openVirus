<p>The Yellow Fever burden model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was developed to estimate YF disease burden and vaccine impact across 34 African countries at high or moderate risk for YF [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The original model was developed assuming that the locally-fitted force of infection (the annual probability of infection for a susceptible individual),

Here, we updated the previous constant version of the model by integrating novel serological data updating demographic data as well as recent vaccination activities and records of the disease. Moreover, we present a new, alternative, variant of the model parametrised by the locally-fitted basic reproduction number
