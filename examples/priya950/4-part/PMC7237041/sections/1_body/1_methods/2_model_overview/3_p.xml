<p>The two model versions differ in the way they fit serological data. In the static version of the model (FOI model) a constant, age-independent force of infection (FOI)

 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> model), a basic reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> is fitted, based on the classical SIR model framework under the assumption of endemic equilibrium transmission [
