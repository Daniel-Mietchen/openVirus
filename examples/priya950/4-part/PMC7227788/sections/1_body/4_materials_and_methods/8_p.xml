 </xref> In brief, countries were grouped into four geographic regions consisting of Brazil (n = 86), Central America and Mexico (n = 45), South America (n = 132) and Caribbean (n = 173). Inferred locations at each internal node and corresponding dated phylogenies trees were estimated using BEAST1.10.
