<p>To investigate in more detail the origins of the new DENV2-III BR-4 circulating in Brazil in 2019, we conducted a statistical phylogeographic analysis of 436DENV2 genome sequences representing DENV2 genotypes circulating in the Americas. Our analysis reveals that the DENV2-III BR-4lineage was introduced in or around 2014 (95% Bayesian credible interval: 2012 to 2015) [

However, we note that the new lineage could have also been introduced from countries with tropical climates in South America (e.g. French Guiana or Suriname) from where no recent virus genomic data has been made available. Molecular clock analyses have shown that novel DENV lineages have been introduced in Brazil every 7 to 10 years, after which they are replaced by a novel lineage introduced from other locations. For example, DENV2-IIIBR-1 was introduced in 1990, DENV2-III BR-2 in 1998, DENV2-III BR-3 in 2005.

 </xref> Given that the former lineage replacement in Brazil resulted from a strain introduced around 2005, our dating estimate for the introduction of DENV2-III BR-4 and the noticeable increase in number of DENV2 cases in Sao Paulo State are indicative of a new DENV2 lineage replacement in Brazil.
