<p id="Par44">The obtained “environmental” weights were used to calculate a regression with the branch duration and the corresponding coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>env</sub>) was obtained. A null coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>null</sub>) was also calculated assuming the null raster (i.e. when only the spatial distance of each movement is assumed to affect branch duration). The statistic D = R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>env</sub> – R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>null</sub> was selected as final outcome, and describes how much the regression is strengthened when the spatial variation in the environmental variable is included. To account for the phylogenetic uncertainness, the D statistic was calculated for each tree of the posterior distribution. However, for computational constraints, the number of posterior trees was down-sampled to 1000 after discharging a 20% burn-in. Only the environmental variables with more than 90% of D statistics &gt; 0 were considered for further analysis. Particularly, the significance of D statistic of those variables was assessed against a D null distribution obtained by randomizing 1000 times the phylogenetic nodes location under the constraint that branch length remained equal. A p-value was generated for each initial tree, therefore a percentage of the trees with p-value &lt; 0.05 could be calculated, which can be interpreted as a posterior probability of observing a significant correlation between lineage movements and considered environmental variable. According to Dellicour 
 <italic>et al</italic>., (2016), a percentage of p-value &lt; 0.05 greater than 50% was considered a strong evidence that the environmental variable is associated to viral movement speed
