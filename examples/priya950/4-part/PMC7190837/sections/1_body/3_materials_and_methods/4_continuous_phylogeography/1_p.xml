<p id="Par40">The history of QX dispersal was reconstructed over time using the continuous phyogeographic approach described by Lemey et al.,

 </sup> using BEAST 1.8.4. Substitution and clock models were selected as previously described. Similarly, the Gamma Relaxed Random Walk was preferred over the other phylogeographic continuous diffusion models based on the marginal likelihood calculation and comparison using the Path Sampling and Stepping Stone method

 </sup>. The final estimations were obtained performing a 200 million generation Markov chain Monte Carlo run, sampling parameters and trees every twenty thousand generations. Results were visually inspected using Tracer 1.5 and accepted only if mixing and convergence were adequate and the Estimated Sample Size was greater than 200 for all parameters. The reconstruction of QX movements over time within Italian borders was obtained using SpreaD3, summarizing and visualizing the full posterior distribution of trees obtained in continuous phylogeographic analyses
