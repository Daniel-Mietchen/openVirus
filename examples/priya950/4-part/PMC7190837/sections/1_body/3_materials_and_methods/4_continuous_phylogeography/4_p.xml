<p id="Par43">More in detail, the values in the raster (i.e. altitude, population density, poultry density, temperature, etc.) were used to associate a weight to the abovementioned vector. Two models of spatial movements were considered: (1) “straight line (SL) path” model, assuming a straight movement between the starting and ending locations of each branch (i.e. the branch weight is computed as the sum of raster cells through which the straight line passes); (2) “least cost (LC) path” model, using a least cost algorithm (i.e. the branch weight is computed as the sum of the values of cells transition values between adjacent cells along the least-cost path). In this model, the analyzed environmental variable can be considered both as a conductance (i.e. enhancing viral dispersal through the cells with higher values) or resistance factor (i.e. allowing an easier dispersal through cells with lower values). Both instances were evaluated for each considered factor.</p>
