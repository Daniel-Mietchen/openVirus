 </sup> and a single representative sequence for each cluster was selected. These sequences plus the Valastro 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) references were re-aligned and recombination analysis was performed. Recombinant sequences, including the ones belonging to the same cluster, were removed from the dataset. Finally, the dataset was re-expanded to the original size and sequences identical or closely related (p-distance &lt;0.01) to the QX-based vaccines administered in Italy were also excluded. To evaluate the distribution of Italian GI-19 strains in the international scenario, an extensive dataset of S1 IBV sequences was downloaded from GenBank and a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed as previously described. To reduce computational complexity and increase interpretation easiness (without losing information), only one sequence representative of all identical ones was selected using CD-HIT and included in the analysis.
