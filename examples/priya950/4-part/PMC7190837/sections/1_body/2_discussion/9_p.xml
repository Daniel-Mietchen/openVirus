<p id="Par27">Other environmental factors do not seem to play a relevant role in affecting viral dispersal. While climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and wind could actually affect viral viability and spreading, their effect could be circumvented by a transmission mediated by “fast-moving” vectors like trucks, personnel and, potentially, wild species

 </sup>. More surprising could be the non-significant role of road density. However, it must be stressed that the available raster reported the overall density of roads, which could significantly differ from those preferentially used for live animal or their byproduct transportation, hindering the detection of an otherwise plausible risk factor. Therefore, the mapping of the live animal transportation pathways could provide remarkable benefits in IBV (and other infectious diseases) epidemiology understanding and control.
