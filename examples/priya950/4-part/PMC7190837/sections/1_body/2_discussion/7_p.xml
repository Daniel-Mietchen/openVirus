A less effective control of IBV infection could be speculated for small companies, whose management capability and resources are limited compared to big-integrated companies. In fact, all Italian farms have to follow national legislation

 </sup> dictating the minimum biosecurity measures to be applied. However, integrated poultry farms, part of major companies, enforce additional managerial practices to increase biosecurity levels. Personnel and veterinarian formation, internal audits and periodic controls guarantee a higher level of application of the required standards, compared to most of small non-integrated farms.
