<p id="Par24">The exceptions to this general rule were farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy, where an overlap between the two companies occurs. The unidirectionality of the viral flux from 
 <italic>Company A</italic> to 
 <italic>Company B</italic> implies that other factors, besides spatial proximity, must be in place. A detailed survey could shed some insights into relevant factors like different biosecurity measures, structural factors, vaccination strategy etc.. The mediation of other “actors” cannot also be excluded. In fact, the analysis of just two companies, however predominant they are on the Italian poultry sector, cannot be considered an accurate depiction of the Italian situation. Remarkably, the inclusion of a third 
 <italic>deme</italic> (representative of other unsampled companies and farms) in the analysis model highlighted that several transmission events could be mediated by smaller entities operating in the same region. Actually, the high migration rate estimated between 
 <italic>Company B</italic> and this 
 <italic>ghost deme</italic> poses in favor of its pivotal role in maintaining an active IBV circulation.
