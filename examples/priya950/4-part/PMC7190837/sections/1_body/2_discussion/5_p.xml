<p id="Par23">Continuous phylogeography showed that the areas interested by a more intensive viral circulation were those featured by a higher poultry density, and this evidence was confirmed by a statistically significant correlation between poultry density and dispersal velocity. The association between spatial proximity and farm infection is probably the most consistently reported risk factor for poultry infectious diseases

 </sup>. Although an airborne transmission has been proposed for IBV, its occurrence has rarely been demonstrated experimentally

 </sup>. However, the spatial proximity likely increases the likelihood of a greater number of horizontal contacts between farms, including the movement of people, vehicles and fomites between farms, as well as sharing similar risk factors (e.g. environmental conditions, climate, presence of wild animals, etc.)

 </sup>. Based on these premises, the presence of segregated poultry companies should represent an effective obstacle to viral shedding and the obtained results partially confirm these evidence. The strains from different poultry companies formed two independent clusters, which suggests the effectiveness of independent production flow/chain in protecting farms from exogenous introductions. Additionally, the application of adequate biosecurity measures, enforced also by the Italian legislation, likely contributed in limiting new strain introduction.
