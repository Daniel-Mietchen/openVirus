 </sup>, and despite a relatively long circulation and the efforts devoted to its control, it still remains one of the main menaces for poultry industry profitability. Therefore, the understanding of the forces shaping its epidemiology would be of remarkable relevance in order to prevent the induced damages, rather than try to control them. Remarkably, the Italian IBV strains appear to originate from one introduction events only, as previously reported
