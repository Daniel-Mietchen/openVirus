<p id="Par28">The present study demonstrates that IBV spreading potential is mainly affected by farm and poultry density overall, which can be reasonably claimed as a major risk factor. Other environmental/climatic variables do not seem to affect IBV epidemiology, stressing the pivotal role of human action and thus highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from an improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale. Actually, the integration of poultry production seems to provide a relevant constrain to IBV circulation, even though some differences were noted between the two considered companies. In fact, despite differences in management and applied control strategies likely playing a role, the presence in the same area of other minor poultry companies seems to represent a major issue, probably due to the less effective infection control ascribable to the sometimes lower organization capability and resources of small enterprises. The present study results emphasize the need of an active sharing of sequences and related molecular epidemiology data originating from all the actors in poultry production, allowing a proper depiction of the viral exchange dynamics, based on actual data rather than estimations. The obtained information would represent a fundamental substrate for the implementation of effective and shared efforts for the infection control on a broad regional scale.</p>
