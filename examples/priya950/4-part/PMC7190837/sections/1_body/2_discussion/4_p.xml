<p id="Par22">The implemented approach allowed to reconstruct the migration history of the QX genotype over time. The estimated introduction, in Emilia Romagna region, shortly predates the first detection, posing in favor of the effectiveness of the Italian monitoring and early detection systems. All the analyses, independently of the underlying statistical model, support that 
 <italic>Company A</italic> was the first introduction site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thereafter, the virus circulation was limited to farms belonging to this company for years, until approximatively 2010, when 
 <italic>Company B</italic> became involved. Contextually, a progressive increase in diffusion speed was noticed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), not unexpectedly considering the rising number of involved farms (especially at the border between Veneto and Lombardy regions, where most farms are located) and thus the increase in spreading potential and opportunity. The high farm density of this area has been described as a risk factor for different infectious diseases

 </sup>, and IBV seems to be no exception. Interestingly, the viral population size remained relatively constant in this time period, evidencing that, even if QX strains were able to effectively spread from farm to farm, their replication was adequately controlled, likely by effective vaccination strategies. Actually, a certain slowdown in dispersal velocity was noticed in 2011-12, potentially because of a progressive decrease in naive populations availability. A dramatic change was observed in 2014, when a new spreading wave (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and an increase in diffusion rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and population size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were detected. A more detailed analysis demonstrated that this variation affected Company B only (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A previous study has ascribed this episode to a change in the vaccination scheme adopted by this company, which moved from a heterologous Mass+793B based vaccination to a Mass only vaccination leading to an increased viral circulation and clinical outbreaks number

 </sup>. Moreover, experimental studies demonstrated a significant reduction in R

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. It can therefore be speculated that the increase in infectious pressure within-farm and the higher flock susceptibility to infection could have enhanced the risk of IBV spreading to other farms and regions. In support of this hypothesis, the geographical spreading affected mainly Northern Italian farms (where 
 <italic>Company B</italic> is located). Moreover, when a new double vaccination was implemented, the decrease in viral population size was mirrored by a reduction of dispersal velocity.
