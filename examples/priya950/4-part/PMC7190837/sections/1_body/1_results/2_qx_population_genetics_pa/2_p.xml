<p id="Par11">The tMRCA of the overall QX population in Italy (i.e. QX genotype introduction) was estimated in 2003.52 [95HPD: 1999.73-2006.76] using the structured coalescent approach. Almost identical results were obtained including a third “
 <italic>ghost” deme</italic> (i.e. an estimated 
 <italic>deme</italic> for which no sequences were available, representative of other unsampled companies and farms) in the analysis or using the “traditional” coalescent approach. When strains collected from integrated poultry companies were considered independently, the tMRCA was predicted in 2003.19 [95HPD: 1994.11-2010.3] for 
 <italic>Company A</italic> and in 2010.6 [2007.26-2011.99] for 
 <italic>Company B</italic>. The viral population dynamics evidenced a substantially constant Ne*t (Effective population size * generation time, or relative genetic diversity) with the remarkable exception of the period between mid-2014 and mid-2015, when a sudden fluctuation was observed. However, a quite different scenario was demonstrated between the two integrated poultry companies. In fact, 
 <italic>Company A</italic> was featured by a substantially constant population size, with a minor decrease affecting particularly the period 2013-2015. However, the Ne*t 95HPD were relatively broad and at odds with the significance of the observed variations. On the contrary, a much more changeable pattern was observed in 
 <italic>Company B</italic> (Fig.
