<p id="Par18">The analysis of the effect of different environmental factors on QX genotype dispersal velocity led essentially to negative results (i.e. absence of significant correlation). The only exception was represented by the poultry density SL model, which was positively and significantly correlated to viral dispersal velocity: D = 0.0225, percentage of D with p-value &lt; 0.005 = 74%.</p>
