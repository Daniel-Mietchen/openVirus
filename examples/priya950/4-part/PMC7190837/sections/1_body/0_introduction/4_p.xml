<p id="Par5">Biosecurity measures and the proper understanding of the factors influencing viral spread are thus of primary importance. The risk factors of virus introduction in a farm have been investigated in several studies, and include transport of live poultry, species and productive category, dominant winds

 </sup>. Other routes of transmission are summarized under the umbrella of ‘contiguous spread’. However, most of these studies are based on single outbreaks, during emergency scenarios (e.g. avian influenza outbreaks), and on the evaluation of factors associated to farm infection using a traditional statistical approach

 </sup>. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis of the ecological aspects behind the spread of IBV is largely lacking. Recently, advances in bioinformatics tools have allowed to link viral phylogeny and evolution to epidemiological factors, modeling the process of viral spreading over time, investigating its determinants and integrating landscape ecology with molecular epidemiology
