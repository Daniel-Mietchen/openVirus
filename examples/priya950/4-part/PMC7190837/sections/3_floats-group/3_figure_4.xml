  <p>Results of phylogeographic analysis. The full posterior distribution of trees obtained in the continuous phylogeographic analysis is reported and the uncertainty (95HPD) on these estimates is reflected by contouring them with red polygons. Viral dispersal time has been represented by color coding the respective arrows from black (older) to red (newer).</p>
