  <p id="P51">(a) Schematic of experimental design. (b) At 7 dpi paired bodies and legs were collected and assayed for the presence of ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR (MGI (midgut infection rates) and DI (disseminated infection). (c) ZIKV dissemination rates of paired bodies and legs 5–14 dpi assayed for ZIKV RNA; only DI rates are presented. (d) 6, 8 and 10 dpi paired bodies and saliva were assayed for ZIKV RNA; only transmission rates (TR) are presented. TR data was analyzed by linear regression and analysis of covariance. (e,f) DENV-2 and CHIKV infection and dissemination rates, respectively. (g) Schematic of mouse transmission studies. (h) TR of CHIKV infected
