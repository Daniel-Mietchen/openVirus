 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were intrathoracically inoculated with approximately 70 ZIKV PFUâ€™s. Three days post-inoculation (dpi), half of the individuals were provided a non-infectious bloodmeal. Mosquitoes were housed for nine additional days after which midguts were dissected. RNA was extracted and 15 samples from each group were assayed individually by RT-qPCR as described above. The remaining 10 midguts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Midguts were washed twice in PBS and stained with a 1:200 dilution of the mouse anti-flavivirus E-glycoprotein clone FE1 in blocking buffer (PBS+5 % BSA+0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 hr. at room temperature. Midguts were washed 3 times in PBS+0.1 Tween 20 and incubated with a donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexafluor 488 diluted 1:200 in PBS+0.1% Tween 20. Samples were washed 3 times in PBS+0.1% Tween 20 and mounted on microscope slides with ProLong Gold Antifade with DAPI.
