<p id="P22">RNA standards were generated in order to quantify ZIKV RNA from mosquito midguts. Briefly, an ~ 680 bp fragment spanning the RT-qPCR primer set (positions 837–1520) was amplified with a forward primer containing a T7 promoter and a non-modified reverse primer. The amplicon was purified, sequenced, and used as template to generate RNA transcripts using the T7 Megascript Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA was quantified on a Qubit Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and diluted to achieve serial 10-fold genome equivalent (GE) dilutions. We detected 10

 <sup>7</sup> ZIKV GE/ reaction with a primer efficiency of 78.4% with an R
 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.971, a slope of −3.977, and y-intercept = 46.965.
