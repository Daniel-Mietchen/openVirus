 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, 7 days post emergence, were provided a non-infectious bloodmeal. Midguts were temporally dissected from mosquitoes 15 mpbm, 24 hpbm, 36 hpbm, 48 hpbm, 72 hpbm, and 96 hpbm and fixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 hrs. Extra care was taken to not rupture engorged midguts during dissection. Baseline levels of CHP binding were determined with unfed midguts. Positive control midguts included unfed midguts that were immediately heat denatured at 70°C for 2 min. prior to fixation. Midguts were grouped into five midguts per pool, each pool representing an experiential replicate of each time point. Upon fixation, midguts were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with fluorescein labelled CHP (3Helix) diluted in PBS at a final concentration of 5 μM and incubated overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, samples were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 1μg/ μl elastase in PBS for two hours at 27° C and agitated every 15 min. Samples were transferred to a black 96-well plate ensuring midguts were not transferred and diluted 1:1 with PBS. Fluorescence was determined on a BioTek SYNERGY H1 microplate reader using the area scan feature with and excitation/emission of 485/515.
