<p id="P29">Published data on the EIP of ZIKV were collected by searching the relevant literature using Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar; search terms included 
 <italic>“Aedes aegypti”</italic> AND “Zika” AND (“extrinsic incubation period” OR “dissemination” OR “salivary gland infection” OR “competence” OR “transmission”). We required that ZIKV infection data were collected on mosquitoes at three or more time points post-infection. Exclusions were not made based on language or date of publication. We attempted to account for sources of study variability (e.g. ZIKV strain, utilization of fresh or frozen virus stock, and geographic origin of mosquitos) in our models by incorporating a study-specific random effect. We identified nine papers in total that experimentally assessed ZIKV EIP in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> using traditional single-feed methodology (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). We aggregated dissemination infection (DI) rate data for studies in which temporal infection data were collected on ZIKV dissemination to legs, wings or heads, including our own single-feed experimental results. Separately, we aggregated salivary gland infection (SGI) rate data for studies in which temporal infection data were collected on ZIKV dissemination to heads, salivary glands or in salivary secretions.
