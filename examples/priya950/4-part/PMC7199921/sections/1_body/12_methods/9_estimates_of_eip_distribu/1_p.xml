<p id="P28">We developed models to estimate the distribution of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of Zika virus (ZIKV) under both single-feed and double-feed scenarios. Because the exact moment when a mosquito becomes infectious is not observable, observations of EIP for a particular vector-borne disease are generally reported as a range of days from the time when some proportion of mosquitoes first exhibit dissemination of the virus into the body or salivary glands following an infectious bloodmeal, to the time where a maximum proportion of mosquitoes exhibit disseminated infection or transmission

 </sup>. Whereas transmission studies often report the EIP as a range of days, we attempted to quantitatively describe the distribution of the EIP for ZIKV using our experimental results, and compare these results to published experimental data, in order to more accurately assess changes in the EIP when mosquitos are offered a second bloodmeal during the incubation period.
