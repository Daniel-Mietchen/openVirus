<p id="P18">Three to seven days after the initial infectious bloodmeal, one of the two cartons was provided a second non-infectious bloodmeal. Again, engorged females were collected and placed in a carton with a new egg-laying cup and provided access to 10% sucrose. Following variable extrinsic incubation periods, bodies, midguts, legs and salivary glands were harvested and macerated in 250 μl PBS-G [phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% gelatin, 30% rabbit serum, and 1% 100x antibiotic-antimycotic (10,000 mg/ml of streptomycin, 10,000 U/ml penicillin, and 25 mg/ml of amphotericin B)] with a copper BB using a mixer mill. The inverse feeds (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 1</xref>) followed a similar experimental design; however, the double-feed group received a non-infectious bloodmeal prior to receiving a ZIKV-infectious bloodmeal. Either freshly grown virus or frozen virus stocks were used to complete the studies. Initially, all of the ZIKV studies were performed with frozen stocks of ZIKV (4.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (pfu)/ml); however, in light of the poor midgut infection rates, all subsequent experiments were performed with freshly grown virus (1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> –10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml); C6/36 cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of ~0.1 and harvested 4–5 days post infection. While this change in protocol did increase midgut infection rates, it did not alter the enhanced dissemination rate phenotype associated with multiple bloodmeals. For comparison, mean human viremia titers of ZIKV were estimated in the 10

 <sup>5</sup> genome equivalents/ ml range

 <sup>6</sup> – 3 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml) and frozen aliquots of CHIKV (4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/ml) were used.
