 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, 7 days post emergence, were offered a non-infectious bloodmeal, sorted and housed as described in the main text. Ten midguts from unfed control and engorged mosquitoes were dissected at 24 and 72 hpbm and fixed in a 2% paraformaldehyde/ 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution containing 0.1% (w/v) CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 1% (w/v) sucrose buffered in 100mM Na cacodylate (pH 7.3). Samples were fixed at 4Â°C for three days and postfixed in 1% (w/v) OsO
 <sub>4</sub> in the same buffer at room temperature for one hour. Fixed specimens were dehydrated through a graded ethanol and acetone series and imaged on a Hitachi Tabletop SEM TM3030Plus.
