<p id="P14">The volume of blood ingested during the second blood meal could potentially affect our results by impacting biophysical changes to the basal lamina layer surrounding the mosquito midgut. Most mosquitoes were fully engorged after blood feeding on a membrane feeder; however, in nature, blood feeding can often be interrupted resulting in partial engorgement which could influence virus dissemination associated with multiple feedings. A previous study found that collagen IV declined equally in the midguts of partially-fed vs fully engorged mosqtuioes

 </sup>; however, it is unclear if this reduction in collagen IV results in loss of basal lamina integrity or influences rates of dissemination. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of blood meal volume on basal lamina integrity and virus dissemination rates to better understand the epidemiological significance of this phenomenon.
