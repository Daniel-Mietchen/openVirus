<p id="P8">To ascertain the basis of these findings, we determined whether an influx of energy-rich blood would promote viral replication and midgut escape. The number of virus genome equivalents was similar in mosquitoes regardless of feeding status (single- versus double-feed) or infection status (midgut restricted versus disseminated infection) (
 <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 4</xref>). Our data indicates that once ZIKV has established an infection in the gut, its ability to escape is not conditioned by enhanced viral replication. These findings are consistent with studies that found no correlation between midgut titers and dissemination rates
