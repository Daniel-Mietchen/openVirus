<p id="P5">Once a mosquito ingests an infected bloodmeal, arboviruses must overcome multiple barriers within the mosquito for transmission to occur

 </sup>. The virus must infect the midgut, disseminate out of midgut cells, traverse the basal lamina layer to the hemolymph, and then infect the salivary glands before being transmitted to the next vertebrate host

 </sup>. Failure of virus escape out of the mosquito midgut to the peripheral tissues has been identified as an important barrier to arbovirus transmission, but the underlying factors mediating this process are poorly understood

 </sup>. Blood feeding triggers physiological changes within the mosquito—including mechanical distention of the midgut, apoptosis and regeneration of midgut epithelial cells, and altered permeability of the basal lamina—that could enhance or accelerate virus dissemination out of the midgut

 </sup>. Based on these considerations, we evaluated the hypothesis that virus-infected mosquitoes fed an additional non-infectious bloodmeal will more effectively disseminate and transmit virus than mosquitoes fed only once.
