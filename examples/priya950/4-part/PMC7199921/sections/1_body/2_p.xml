<p id="P6">To test this hypothesis, we provided 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> a second non-infectious bloodmeal 3 days after the infectious blood meal and compared virus infection and dissemination rates to those mosquitoes that received a single bloodmeal (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Midgut infection prevalence of ZIKV was similar in the single- and double-feed groups, but the percentage of mosquitoes with disseminated ZIKV infection to leg tissues was significantly higher in mosquitoes receiving a second bloodmeal than those fed only once (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Enhanced virus dissemination did not occur when mosquitoes were fed a non-infectious bloodmeal prior to receiving a ZIKV infectious bloodmeal (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 1</xref>). This suggests that an established midgut infection is a prerequisite for the observed enhanced rates of virus dissemination following a non-infectious bloodmeal. Temporal examination of this observation revealed that ZIKV disseminated more rapidly in the double-feed group than the single-feed group, but the difference in dissemination rates disappeared by day 10 post-infection (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The increase in dissemination correlated with an increase of ZIKV positive saliva samples as the transmission rate regression line elevations (y-intercepts) were significantly different (p=0.01256) between the double-feed and single-feed cohorts, thus demonstrating enhanced early transmission potential (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 2</xref>). The dissemination and transmission studies were completed in different laboratories using different strains of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> further demonstrating the robustness of the double-feed observation.
