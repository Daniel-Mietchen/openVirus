<p>Before the analysis, we inactivated serum specimens at 56°C for 30 min. We detected ZIKV IgG using a primary ELISA screening (Euroimmun anti-NS1 IgG ELISA kit, Medizinische Labordiagnostika, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.euroimmun.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.euroimmun.com</ext-link>); the sensitivity of the ELISA appears to be high in these studies (
