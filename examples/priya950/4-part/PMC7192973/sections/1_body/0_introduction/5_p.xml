<p id="p0045">Additionally, activation of p38 kinase, a signaling mediator belonging to the MAPK superfamily that transduces intra- and extracellular stimuli and governs various biological processes, supports viral replication and associates with virus-associated dysregulation of inflammatory response. Previous reports revealed that p38 kinase is involved in regulating nuclear export of vRNP as well as virus entry into host cells [
