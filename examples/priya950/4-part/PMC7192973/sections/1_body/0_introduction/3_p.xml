<p id="p0035">To date, the expanding understanding of the pathogenesis of influenza virus infections provided direction for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Analysis of viral components using reverse genetics methods has elucidated their function and virulence in the pathogenicity of influenza diseases. For instance, recombinant viruses carrying PB2 segments from the 1918 pandemic H1N1 or the PB1â€“F2 protein are associated with enhanced inflammation and host cell death [

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which contribute to enhanced disease severity. Moreover, early antiviral therapy provides better therapeutic benefits but is ineffective in critically ill patients with influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Excessive inflammation triggered by viruses is another aspect of pathogenic factors that serve a critical role in determining outcomes of viral infection. A significant correlation between the severity of clinical signs and levels of cytokines was found in humans and ferrets with seasonal influenza virus infections [

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Intense pro-inflammatory responses were observed in fatal cases of high pathogenic H5N1 virus infection [

A reasonable explanation for this paradox seems to be that both viral factors and the host immune response are important contributors of influenza diseases. Indeed, combination of antiviral agents with immunomodulators has been shown to effectively reduce lethal influenza virus-induced morbidity and mortality as a proof of principle [
