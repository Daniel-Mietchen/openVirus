<p id="p0215">Influenza progresses from an initial acute lung injury (ALI) or continues progress to form severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been ascribed to the disordered inflammatory processes. Plasma levels of IL-6 are closely correlated with symptoms and fever in human influenza infection [

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Elevation of IL-17 and IP-10 was reported to mediate ALI during the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Development of ALI or ARDS results from the disruption of normal functions of epithelial sodium channels and tight junctions of epithelial-endothelial barriers based on an array of cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-13 [

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>]. Data obtained in the present study from in vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-17 and RANTES, evoked by viral infection or viral product stimulation, were reversed by erucic acid treatment (

 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F and 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B and C). In addition, it was found that erucic acid treatment prevented IAV-mediated symptoms, including piloerection, reduced physical activity, hunched posture, swaying gait and labored breathing, lung injury, including lung index and protein concentration in BALF, and mortality in mice (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> A-E). Therefore, it was suggested that protective effects of erucic acid against IAV-mediated morbidity were associated with immunomodulatory properties. Previous studies revealed that activation of NF-κB and p38 kinase signaling is involved in influenza virus-induced dysregulation of pro-inflammatory mediator production. NF-κB deficiency markedly reduces H5N1-mediated hypercytokinemia [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activation leads to suppressed expression of various cytokines [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There is no difference in the pattern of NF-κB activation in human primary macrophages with H5N1 and H1N1 virus infection; however, increased p38 activation mediated by H5N1 was observed [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. p38 kinase inhibition resulted in the reduction of H5N1-mediated cytokine and chemokine levels, such as TNF-α, IFN-β, IFN- λ1 and MCP-1 [
