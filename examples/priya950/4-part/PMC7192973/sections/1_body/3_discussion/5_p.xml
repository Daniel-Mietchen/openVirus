 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>G and H). Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 significantly decreases virus-mediated inflammation and body temperature changes [

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A study confirmed that the delayed combination treatment of antiviral agents with COX-2 inhibitors protects mice from lethal H5N1 infections [

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Together with findings that erucic acid inhibited the NF-κB and p38 kinase signaling pathways, it is suggested that erucic acid exerted anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of NF-κB and p38 kinase signaling during influenza virus infection.
