 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms regarding the antiviral action of erucic acid, Western blot analysis of targets of cellular signaling was performed. Representative Western blot images in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A suggested that MAPK (P38, ERK1/2 and JNK), NF-κB and AKT signaling pathways were activated by influenza A virus infection. Moreover, we observed that the activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways was inhibited by erucic acid in a dose-dependent manner; however, the ERK1/2 MAPK, JNK MAPK and AKT signaling pathways were not affected. Next, the effect of erucic acid on virus-induced transcriptional activities in 293 cells which were stably transfected with NF-κB-luc was investigated. Consistent with the Western blot data, erucic acid treatment resulted in decreased virus-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Given that the reduction of the viral polymerase transcription activity was caused by erucic acid, it became necessary to clarify whether the inhibitory effect on viral polymerase transcription activity was associated with p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibition. As expected, the combination of p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibitors and erucic acid caused an additive effect on the inhibition of viral polymerase transcription activity (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). The above results indicated that erucic acid treatment inhibited virus-induced activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling, which may be associated with anti-influenza virus efficacy.
