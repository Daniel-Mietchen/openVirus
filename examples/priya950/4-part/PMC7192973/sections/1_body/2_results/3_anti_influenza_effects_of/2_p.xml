<p id="p0165">The CPE assay was performed to study the efficacy of erucic acid against influenza A viruses. Our results showed that erucic acid treatment significantly reduced the CPE in MDCK cells induced by five influenza virus strains, including A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/GZ/GIRD07/09 (H1N1), A/HK/8/68 (H3N2), A/HK/Y280/97 (H9N2) and A/Duck/Guangdong/1994 (H7N3), with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 0.49 and 1.24 mM and SI values of 1.44–3.65 (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>A and B, antiviral effects of erucic acid were further confirmed by plaque reduction assay (PRA) and progeny virus reduction assay. Next, we employed hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays to test whether the antiviral property of erucic acid was attributed to its inhibitory effect on viral HA and NA. Interestingly, the data suggested that erucic acid did not interfere with viral HA and NA activities (data not shown). Furthermore, we employed IAV minigenome assays for determining the transcription activity driven by the viral polymerase in the presence of erucic acid. Erucic acid treatment exhibited significant decreases in luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (
