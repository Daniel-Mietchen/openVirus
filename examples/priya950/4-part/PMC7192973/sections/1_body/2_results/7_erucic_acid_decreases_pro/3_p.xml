<p id="p0190">To further assess the mechanisms by which erucic acid abrogated IFN-mediated pro-inflammatory responses, reporter gene assays to analyze IFN-β signaling in cells with transient ISRE reporter plasmid transfection were performed. It was observed that IAV-induced ISRE transcriptional activities were inhibited by single treatment with erucic acid or NF-κB and p38 kinase inhibitors and combination treatment led to a further reduction (

Furthermore, experiments were conducted to investigate the ISRE transcriptional activities in ISRE reporter plasmid transfected-cells stimulated with IFN-β prior to IAV infection. It was observed that the ISRE transcriptional activity was significantly higher in IAV-infected cells pretreated with IFN compared with untreated cells. Transcriptional activity was partially reduced by erucic acid and NF-κB or p38 kinase inhibitor treatment, and in combination, treatment led to a further reduction (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E). Collectively, these data suggested that the transcriptional activity of ISRE was suppressed by erucic acid treatment, thus dampening the amplification of pro-inflammatory responses in cells pre-treated with IFN-β via the inhibition of NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling.
