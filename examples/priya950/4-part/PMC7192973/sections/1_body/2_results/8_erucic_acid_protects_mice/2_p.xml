<p id="p0195">To further evaluate pharmacological effects of erucic acid in vivo, mice were intragastrically administered with ration of erucic acid at two days prior to challenge with 5 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza strain (A/FM/1/47). On day 7 p.i., IAV-infected mice exhibited pronounced clinical symptoms, including piloerection, reduced physical activity, hunched posture, swaying gait and labored breathing, and erucic acid-administered mice exhibited relieved disease symptoms or none (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). Similar results were observed when monitoring the survival rate and body weight loss of virus-infected mice. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B, virus-infected mice with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day erucic acid treatment revealed increased survival rates compared with untreated mice (80% and 100%, respectively, vs. 0%). In addition, continuous weight loss caused by viral infection was reversed by erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). Differences in morbidity were reflected in lung injury, where pretreatment with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day erucic acid significantly decreased the lung index and protein concentrations in the BALF (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>D and E). Furthermore, it was observed that erucic acid decreased virus titers and expression of virus antigens, including PB1, PB2 and M1 in the lung (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>F and G). Furthermore, histopathological examination of lung tissues revealed viral infection triggered massive inflammatory cell infiltration leading to extensive alveolar airspace destruction, which was significantly ameliorated by erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>H, upper panel). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that CD3
 <sup>+</sup> immunocytes were enriched in mice infected with IAV compared with mice receiving erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>H, lower panel). In line with this, virus-mediated CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recruitment in BALF was significantly reduced by erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>I). Although antigen-specific CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for pathogen elimination, inappropriate cytolytic activity mediated by CTL-released pro-apoptotic enzyme granzyme B contributes to lung injury. Erucic acid reduced the levels of granzyme B and active caspase-3 in lung homogenates (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>J). Together, these results suggested that erucic acid protected mice from IAV-mediated lung injury and mortality, which was correlated with its anti-viral properties and thereby reduction of CTL recruitment.
