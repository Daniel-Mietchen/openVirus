<p id="p0095">For the plaque assay, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) grown in 6-well plates were inoculated with 100 PFU/well indicated influenza virus diluted in serum-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow initiation of infection. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unbound virus and covered with DMEM containing 0.8% agarose in the presence or absence of the compounds. Plates were inverted and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Cells were fixed using 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for visualization of the viral plaques.
