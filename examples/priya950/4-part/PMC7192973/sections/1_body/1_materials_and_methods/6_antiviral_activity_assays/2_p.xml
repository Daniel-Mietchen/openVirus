<p id="p0085">The antiviral activity of erucic acid against influenza viruses was evaluated in MDCK cells. Monolayers of MDCK cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates. After washing with PBS twice, cells were inoculated with 100-fold of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (100 × TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of the influenza virus strains including A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/GZ/GIRD07/09 (H1N1), A/HK/8/68 (H3N2), A/HK/Y280/97 (H9N2), A/Duck/Guangdong/1994 (H7N3) for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the viral inoculum was discarded and replaced with diluted compounds including erucic acid and the positive control oseltamivir carboxylate (TLC PharmaChem., Inc., Canada) in TPCK-trypsin (1.5 μg/mL) containing medium, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was visualized under a light microscope (DM 3000; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for influenza virus inhibition by the compounds was determined using the Reed-Muench method [

 <sub>50</sub> to IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
