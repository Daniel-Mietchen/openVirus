<p id="p0150">For NF-κB activity assays, 293 cells stably expressing pNF-κB-TATA-F-Luc and pQCXIP-eGFP were infected with influenza virus (MOI = 0.1) in the presence or absence of erucic acid for 24 h. Cells were lysed for luciferase activity measurements using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Results are presented as ratio of firefly luciferase activities normalized to 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activities or to EGFP fluorescence intensity.
