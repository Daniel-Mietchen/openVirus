<p id="p0145">Transfection of the ISRE luciferase reporter plasmid into A549 was performed as previously described. Briefly, cells grown in 96-well plates were co-transfected with 100 ng pISRE-TA-luc (Beyotime) and 10 ng pRL-TK control plasmids (Promega) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h. Subsequently, transfected cells were stimulated with influenza virus (MOI = 0.1) or IFN-β (500 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of erucic acid for 24 h.</p>
