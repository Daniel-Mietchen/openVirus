<p id="p0120">For apoptosis analysis, adherent cells were detached by trypsinization and suspended in 500 μL 1 × binding buffer. Then, cells were incubated with 5 μL Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL propidium iodide (PI) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Within 4 h, the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells was determined by the NovoCyte flow cytometer.</p>
