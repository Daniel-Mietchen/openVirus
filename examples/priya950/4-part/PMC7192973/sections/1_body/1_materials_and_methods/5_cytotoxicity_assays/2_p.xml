<p id="p0080">Cytotoxic effects of erucic acid on MDCK and A549 cells were determined using MTT assays. Briefly, cells were plated at 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates containing 100 μL DMEM/F12 (1:1). After incubation overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or two-fold serial dilutions of erucic acid (9.375 nM - 2.4 μM) for 48 h. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with MTT (0.5 mg/mL in serum free medium) for 4 h. The supernatant was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved using DMSO (100 μL). Then, plates were gently shaken for 30 min to dissolve precipitates. Absorbance at 570 nm was determined and toxicity concentration 50 (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of erucic acid were calculated using the Reed-Muench method [
