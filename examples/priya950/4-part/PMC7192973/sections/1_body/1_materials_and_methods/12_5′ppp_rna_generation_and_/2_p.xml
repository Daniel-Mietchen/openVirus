<p id="p0135">Influenza virus-infected A549 cells derived vRNA (5′ppp-RNA) was prepared using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The 5′-terminal triphosphate was removed using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; Takara) following the manufacturer’s protocol. As a negative control, cellular RNA was obtained from uninfected cells. Cells were transfected with 500 ng/mL vRNA or cellular RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates for 24 h.</p>
