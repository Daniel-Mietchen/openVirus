<p id="p0100">All animal experiments were approved by the Guangzhou Medical University Ethics Committee of Animal Experiments and performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Female BALB/c mice (age, 4–6 weeks; weight, 18–20 g) were obtained from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Guangzhou State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases. Mice were randomly divided into five groups: Control group (non-infected); influenza virus-infected group; erucic acid high dose treatment groups, erucic acid low dose treatment groups, intragastric administration of erucic acid (50 or 100 mg/kg/day for 7 days) at 2 days prior to viral infection; oseltamivir phosphate treatment group, intragastric administration of oseltamivir phosphate (60 mg/kg/d, for 7 days) at 2 days prior to viral challenge. For viral infection, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 5% isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 5 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of mouse-adapted A/FM/1/47(H1N1) influenza virus.
