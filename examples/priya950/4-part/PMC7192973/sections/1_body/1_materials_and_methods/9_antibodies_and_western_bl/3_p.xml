<p id="p0115">Total protein extracts from lung tissues or cells were prepared in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Thermo) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 30 min, crude protein extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo) and equal amounts of protein were resolved on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Then, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. After incubation with HRP-labeled secondary antibody, signals were developed using an ECL detection system (PerkinElmer). The relative intensities of the protein bands were determined using ImageJ 1.44P.</p>
