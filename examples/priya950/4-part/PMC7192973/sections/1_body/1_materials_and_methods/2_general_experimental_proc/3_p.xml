 <italic>Isatis indigotica Fort.</italic> (10 kg) were extracted with 95% EtOH–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (3 × 100 L; 2 h each). After evaporating under reduced pressure, 1.3 kg residues were obtained. The residue was diluted with water and partitioned with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, EtOAc, and n-BuOH, successively. The EtOAc extract was concentrated in vacuum to get 260 g residues. Then the extract subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, and petroleum ether-EtOAc was used as eluent to obtain eight fractions (fractions A−H 20:1–0:1, v/v). Each fraction was detected via TLC combined with fraction B to D. Fraction B-D was applied on a CC column (silica gel) and eluted with petroleum ether-EtOAc from 20:1 to 0:1 to afford fraction 1 to 7. Fraction 3 was purified by further silica gel column chromatography to obtain a compound (25.4 mg), which was identified as erucic acid. The purity of the compound was 95% via HPLC detection.
