  <p>Erucic acid abrogates IFN-β-amplified pro-inflammatory response in IAV infected cells. (A) Levels of IFN-β and IFN-λ1 were determined by Luminex assays in the culture supernatant of A/PR8/34(H1N1) (MOI = 0.1)-infected A549 cells treated with or without erucic acid. Data are presented the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗∗

(B) Levels of IFN-β and IFN-λ1 were determined by Luminex assays in the culture supernatant of vRNA-transfected cells treated with or without erucic acid.

(C) Luminex analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted in IFN-pre-treated cells prior to influenza A/PR8/34(H1N1) (MOI = 0.1) infection. A549 cells were pre-treated with IFN-β (500 ng/mL) for 4 h, infected with influenza A/PR8/34(H1N1) and treated with or without erucic acid. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗

At 6 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/PR8/34(H1N1) (MOI = 0.1) and treated with or without erucic acid for 24 h; then cells were lysed for luciferase assays. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗
