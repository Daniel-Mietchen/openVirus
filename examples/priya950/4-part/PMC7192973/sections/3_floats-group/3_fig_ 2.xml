  <p>Antiviral effect of erucic acid in vitro. (A) Erucic acid inhibited IAV-induced plaque formation in MDCK cells. Monolayers of MDCK were inoculated with influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 [H1N1], A/GZ/GIRD07/09 [H1N1], A/HK/8/68 [H3N2], A/HK/Y280/97 [H9N2] and A/Duck/Guangdong/1994 [H7N3]; 100 PFU/well) for 2 h, prior to treatment with different concentrations of erucic acid for 48 h. Plaque reduction assays were performed. (B) Erucic acid inhibited the production of progeny viruses. MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 [H1N1], A/GZ/GIRD07/09 [H1N1], A/HK/8/68 [H3N2], A/HK/Y280/97 [H9N2] and A/Duck/Guangdong/1994 [H7N3]; MOI = 0.1) and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of erucic acid. Culture supernatants were collected and progeny virus titers were determined. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗
