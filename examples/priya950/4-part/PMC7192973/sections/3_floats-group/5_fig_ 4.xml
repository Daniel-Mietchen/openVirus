  <p>Erucic acid reduces IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. (A) Levels of cytokines and chemokines were determined by Luminex assays in the culture supernatant of A549 cells that were infected with A/PR8/34(H1N1) (MOI = 0.1) and treated with or without erucic acid. (B–C) A/PR8/34(H1N1)-infected A549 cells were incubated with erucic acid for 24 h; total proteins or culture supernatant were collected for analysis of COX-2 and PGE2 levels by Western blot or ELISA, respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗
