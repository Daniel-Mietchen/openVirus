  <p>Erucic acid inhibits IAV-derived vRNA-induced apoptosis and inflammation. IAV-infected cells with erucic acid (0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mM) treatment were evaluated. (A) Flow cytometry analysis of apoptotic cells using annexin V/PI staining. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗

(B) Cleaved caspase-3 and PARP assessed by immunoblotting. vRNA- or cRNA-transfected cells with erucic acid (0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mM) treatment for 24 h were assessed. (C) Apoptosis analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI staining. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗
