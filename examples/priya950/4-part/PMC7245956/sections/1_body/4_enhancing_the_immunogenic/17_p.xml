<p> Summarizing the results of these studies, it may be concluded that the development of safe and highly immunogenic VACV variants should rest on a balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Since our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict the results that might be achieved by the impairment of several target VACV genes, each produced virus variant should be carefully studied in different model animals. </p>
