<p> Given the fact that removal of individual genes of the VACV Bcl-2-like proteins N1, C6, or K7 not only led to an attenuation of the virus but also increased its immunogenicity [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], a VACV WR variant lacking these three genes was created. The obtained triple VACV mutant did not lose its ability to efficiently propagate in cell culture, but in the 
 <italic>in vivo </italic>system it was more attenuated compared to mutants with single deletions of these genes and caused a decreased production of virus-neutralizing antibodies and specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
