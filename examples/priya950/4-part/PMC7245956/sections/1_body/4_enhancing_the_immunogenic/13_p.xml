<p> Genes encoding IL-18-binding (

 <italic>B16R</italic>), and CC-chemokine-binding (
 <italic>A41L</italic>) proteins, as well as a Bcl-2-like protein (
 <italic>A46R</italic>), were deleted from the VACV MVA strain genome [
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The produced VACV variant with four deleted immunomodulatory genes resulted in a higher level of antiviral antibodies in rhesus monkeys compared to the initial VACV MVA.
