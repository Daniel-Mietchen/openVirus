<p> Investigation of the function of the 
 <italic>169R </italic>gene in the VACV WR strain revealed that the protein encoded by the gene inhibits the initiation of mRNA translation in an infected cell, without affecting viral mRNA translation in isolated virosomes. This underlies the wide range of the effects of protein 169, in particular the inhibition of the innate immune response to a viral infection [
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Deletion of the 
 <italic>169R </italic>gene resulted in enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, increased lung infiltration by leukocytes, and, as a result, a stricter CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell immune response and more effective antiviral protection against repeated infection upon intranasal infection of mice with a mutant VACV.
