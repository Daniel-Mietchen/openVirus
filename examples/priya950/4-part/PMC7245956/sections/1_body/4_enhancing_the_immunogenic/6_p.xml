<p> VACV encodes numerous intracellular Bcl-2-like proteins that inhibit different stages of the signaling cascades of the nuclear transcription factor NF-ÎºB and/or IRF3 activation [

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell immune response to VACV infection, and an increased protective effect (protectiveness) against re-infection [
