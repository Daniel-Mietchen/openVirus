<p> Inflammatory processes play an important role in early non-specific protection of the organism against a viral infection. They develop rapidly to limit virus dissemination within the first hours and days that follow an infection, while the adaptive immune response is being erected. Cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-18, TNF, and γ-interferon, which trigger molecular inflammatory cascades in a particular chemokine expression, are known to play the key role in the induction of inflammatory reactions. Chemokines are chemoattractant cytokines that regulate the migration and effector functions of leukocytes, which play an important role in inflammatory response development and protection against pathogens. The complement system consists of more than 20 plasma proteins. The antiviral action mechanisms of the complement system include neutralization of the virus, lysis of virus-infected cells, and enhancement of the inflammatory and adaptive immune response [
