<p> The complex organization of orthopoxviruses is the reason why the mechanism of immune defense against smallpox (and other orthopoxvirus infections) remains not fully understood. Along with the induction of virus- specific antibodies, the response of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) plays an important role in any control of the infection. A generalized VACV infection (progressive vaccinia) can develop in primary vaccinated people with T-cell immunity defects, while this does not occur in the case of an impaired synthesis of gamma globulins, which indicates the need for a cellular immune response in order to control a primary infection with this virus [
