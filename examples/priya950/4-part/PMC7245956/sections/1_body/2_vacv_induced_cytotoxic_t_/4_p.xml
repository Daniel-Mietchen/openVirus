<p> It is important to note that the immune CD8 response, on the one hand, and the CD4/antibody response, on the other hand, respond to different VACV antigens and involve a broad spectrum of viral proteins [

 <italic>Tables 1</italic> and 
 <italic>2</italic>). A pattern of the immune responses to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination with significant personal differences among individuals in the spectrum of antigens inducing an adaptive immune system response was found not only for these viruses, but also for the infectious agents

 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> [
