<p> Poxviruses are unique among DNA-containing animal viruses, because their entire cycle of reproduction occurs in the cellular cytoplasm in isolated structures called viral factories or virosomes. Brick-shaped virions have rounded faces and are 250–300 × 200 × 250 nm in size. The viral genome of orthopoxviruses is double- stranded linear DNA with covalently closed ends 190–220 kb in size (depending on the species), that encodes about 200 proteins, about half of which are highly conserved and provide the vital function of these viruses [
