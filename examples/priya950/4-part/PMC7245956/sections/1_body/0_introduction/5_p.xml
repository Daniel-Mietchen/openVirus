<p> For many years, the variolae vaccinae virus introduced in vaccination by E. Jenner was believed to originate from the cowpox virus (CPXV) [

 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 1939, it was found that strains of the virus used for Jennerian vaccination significantly differed in properties from natural CPXV isolates derived from cows [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, they were assigned to a separate species, 
 <italic>Vaccinia virus </italic>(VACV) [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The issue of the VACV origin was clarified after the sequencing of the complete genome of a horsepox virus (HSPV) in 2006 [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which turned out to be closely related to the studied VACV isolates. It is worth noting that E. Jenner considered horses with the pox-like disease to be a source of infection for cows [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On that basis, it may be assumed that VACV originated from zoonotic HSPV. Apparently, it was HSPV– not CPXV–isolates that were used for Jennerian vaccination in the 19th century. Their descendants were classified as VACV species in the 20th century [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
