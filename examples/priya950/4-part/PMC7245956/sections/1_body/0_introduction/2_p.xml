<p> In 1798, English physician Edward Jenner described a new, safer procedure for protecting against smallpox [

Rural residents who got infected by animals which had a smallpox-like disease (cows or horses) were known to have pustular skin lesions on their hands; they suffered a mild infection that left scars phenotypically resembling those after variolation. In addition, people who had contracted cowpox were known to have become immune to smallpox. In 1796, E. Jenner performed the first experiment in which an eight-year-old child was inoculated intradermally with material from a pustule collected from a cowpox-infected woman. To prove that the child had become resistant to smallpox after the infection, Jenner variolated the child after 6 weeks and found that the boy was resistant to this procedure.
