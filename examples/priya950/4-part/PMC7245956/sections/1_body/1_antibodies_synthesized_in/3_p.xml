<p> Huw Davies et al. [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] used microchips with VACV proteins synthesized in a bacterial cell-free system to characterize the profiles of the humoral immune response to vaccination of volunteers with live VACV. The vaccinees were found to develop an antibody response to 47 different viral proteins, with significant individual variations both in the spectrum of antigens and in the production level of antibodies to specific antigens. The results of this and other studies summarized in

 </italic> show numerous viral antigens that often induce a pronounced humoral immune response. This diversity of antigens is believed to indicate redundancy and plasticity of the antibody response in vaccinees, and the presence of antibodies to a large number of antigens creates a “safety network” that provides effective antiviral protection despite individual differences in the spectrum of the produced antibodies [
