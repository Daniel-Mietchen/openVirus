<p> In most cases, VARV and VACV virion proteins have a high identity of amino acid sequences (93â€“99%) [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which ensures the high cross-antibody response of these viruses. However, a comprehensive analysis of some individual immunodominant viral proteins revealed differences between these viruses in the profile of induced antibodies. For example, the EEV VACV B5 envelope protein and its homolog, VARV B7, exhibit 23 amino acid differences (93.06% identity) [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and polyclonal antibodies to VACV B5 cross-react with the VARV B7 homolog. However, out of the 26 monoclonal antibodies to B5, only 16 reacted with the homologous VARV protein in [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
