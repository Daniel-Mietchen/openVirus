<p>Total viral RNA extractions were performed with Tri Reagent (Product #T9424, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Renfrew, UK) on approximately 1 µg of total RNA in a total volume of 20 µl as per the manufacturer’s instructions, using 2 pmol of JW12 and GT1Mfor2 primers for amplification of the N and G genes, respectively. Two microlitres of RNAse H were added to the reaction mixes after cDNA synthesis to remove the RNA and incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C. The PCR reaction mixes for amplification of the two genomic regions were then assembled using the JW12 and 304R primers to amplify the full nucleoprotein gene (N) of the virus and the GT1Mfor2 and GT1 N-L rev or VIVMF and VIVLR primer pairs for the G gene, depending on whether the virus was a canid or mongoose RABV variant (

One microlitre of cDNA was mixed with 5 µl of 10X buffer, 3 µl of 25 mM MgSO4, 1 µl of 2 mM dNTPs, 15 pmol of each primer and 1 U KOD enzyme (Merck Millipore, Edinburgh, UK). Fifty microlitres of PCR reactions were run on a 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on the following PCR program: 95 °C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 20 sec, 55 °C for 20 sec, 70 °C for 30 sec, and a final extension at 70 °C for 10 min. PCR products were then analyzed on 1.8% agarose gels and visualized by SYBR safe (Invitrogen) DNA gel-staining. The PCR amplicons were purified using spin-columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to sequencing directly (primers available on request), using Big Dye V3.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI3100 machine. Representative historic and contemporary complete N sequences of putative dog-related variants independently established in black-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes, as well dog-maintained lineages, circulating in South Africa were included in the analysis. Conserved specific amino acid signatures (exclusively found in African civets) in the rabies virus isolates originating from African civets (but not in rabid dogs) are consistent over time and may be a good marker correlating with the establishment of formerly dog-maintained RABVs in the African civet population, as was observed in striped skunks (
