<p>Using complete nucleotide sequences of the N gene of the African civet lyssaviruses in our archive, together with other previously sequenced African civet viruses, comprehensive genetic analyses were undertaken. These data support a clear and deeply rooted ancestral division of the represented RABVs into the well-described RABV biotypes from southern Africa: canid and mongoose. Historically, the mongoose RABV sequences from the African civet demonstrated a nucleotide sequence divergence of between 1.3%â€“15.4% over the genomic region studied, displaying a larger genetic diversity compared to African civet sequences (of 15.2%) in the Africa 1 clade [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], at least in the case of the passage of a dog-adapted virus into foxes. Presumably due to a lower contact risk with humans, and possible reduced neurovirulence and pathogenicity compared to the canid RABVs, fewer human cases are attributed to mongoose rabies and it is, therefore, considered less of a public health threat [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Findings from studies by Seo et al. demonstrated pathogenicity differences of South African canid and mongoose RABVs in a murine model by assessing clinical signs and survivorship. The C-termini of the glycoprotein of the South African canid and mongoose RABVs showed that the canid rabies virus exhibited a phenotype associated with survival in their murine model, which was not found in the mongoose variant. These observations confirmed that, indeed, the canid rabies variant is more virulent than the mongoose rabies variant under experimental conditions in a murine model. In contrast, the canid RABV variant has been shown to be more opportunistic, infecting both domestic and wildlife host species. There are fewer host species infected with the mongoose rabies biotype in the Africa 3 RABV clade, with the majority being bona fide mongooses, in comparison to the Africa 1 clade, albeit subject to sampling bias. However, there are two RABV sequences from dogs within the Africa 3 (mongoose rabies biotype) clade, demonstrating that spill-over of the mongoose rabies biotype into other species does occur. The majority of the RABV sequences isolated from civets are found in the Africa 1 (canid biotype) RABV clade. These civet sequences are further divided into two subclades, one with dates of origin ranging from 1981 to 2009 and locations including RSA and Zimbabwe, the other restricted to three sequences from Zimbabwe in the early 1990s. These inferred evolutionary relationships raise the possibility of maintenance of RABV within civet populations for up to 50 years, with recent spill-over into other wild canids and dogs [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The tree topology not only indicates that the African civets have been exposed to dog-maintained RABVs for as long as the dog variant has been maintained in this species in this region, but also that this long term exposure could have led to the establishment of originally dog-maintained RABV in African civet populations.
