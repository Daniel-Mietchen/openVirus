<p>The African civet RABV (within the Africa 1 lineage) have significantly lower bootstrap support values than those in the Africa 3 lineage. The three sub-clusters observed in Africa 1 consist of a mixture of viruses from both Zimbabwe and South Africa with the exception of one of a subclade, which exclusively contains rabies viruses from African civets and a black-backed jackal collected in South Africa. </p>
