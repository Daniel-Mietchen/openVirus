<p>There are currently sixteen classified lyssavirus species listed, with the virus abbreviation in parentheses: 
 <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic> (RABV), 
 <italic>Lagos bat lyssavirus</italic> (LBV), 
 <italic>Mokola lyssavirus</italic> (MOKV), 
 <italic>Duvenhage lyssavirus</italic> (DUVV), 
 <italic>European bat 1 lyssavirus</italic> (EBLV-1), 
 <italic>European bat 2 lyssavirus</italic> (EBLV-2), 
 <italic>Australian bat lyssavirus</italic> (ABLV), 
 <italic>Aravan lyssavirus</italic> (ARAV), 
 <italic>Khujand lyssavirus</italic> (KHUV), 
 <italic>Irkut lyssavirus</italic> (IRKV), 
 <italic>West Caucasian bat lyssavirus</italic> (WCBV), 
 <italic>Shimoni bat lyssavirus</italic> (SHIBV), 
 <italic>Bokeloh bat lyssavirus</italic> (BBLV), 
 <italic>Ikoma lyssavirus</italic> (IKOV) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 
 <italic>Lleida bat lyssavirus</italic> (LLEBV) and 
 <italic>Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus</italic> (GBLV) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, two related and recently discovered and unclassified lyssaviruses, i.e., Taiwan bat lyssavirus (TWBLV) and Kotalahti bat lyssavirus (KBLV), were isolated from bats [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To date, Africa has six lyssaviruses circulating: RABV, LBV, MOKV, DUVV, SHIBVand IKOV, with circulating RABV in terrestrial mammals remaining the most prominent lyssavirus accounting for the vast majority of human and animal rabies cases. The African RABVs have been sub-divided into four lineages: Africa 1a (restricted to North and West Africa), 1b (limited to South-East Africa), 2 (includes wild-type strains from several central and eastern African countries), 3 and 4 (does not group with any of the three African RABV lineages), based on phylogenetic analyses [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These lineages are separated geographically and have different host reservoirs. For instance, Africa 3 RABVs, previously known as “viverrid viruses” and now referred to as the “mongoose rabies biotype”, are predominantly confirmed in the yellow mongoose (
 <italic>Cynictis penicillata</italic>) in South Africa, but also from other wildlife carnivore species, such as the slender mongoose (
 <italic>Galerella sanguinea</italic>) and the African civet (
 <italic>Civettictis civetta</italic>) in Zimbabwe, raising questions of whether the African civet could be a maintenance host species of this biotype [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Historically, the mongoose rabies biotype, genetically distant from all dog RABV variants, was isolated on several occasions in the 1970s from the 
 <italic>Herpestidae</italic> species, primarily the slender mongoose, and this provided some evidence that this host species could potentially be the reservoir host species for the mongoose RABV variant in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Subsequently, this mongoose variant was isolated from mustelids (such as the honey badger 
 <italic>Mellivora capensis</italic>) and, increasingly, from the African civet in the 1990s [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting that there is no single definitive host reservoir for this variant. This observation is in contrast to that of the yellow mongoose 
 <italic>Cynictis penicillata</italic>, clearly the definitive reservoir host for the mongoose rabies variant in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. More recently, a highly divergent lyssavirus, IKOV, was recovered from an African civet in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The continual identification of lyssaviruses from wildlife species such as the African civet raises additional questions as to whether and, if so, how the African civet is involved in the transmission and maintenance of lyssaviruses, or whether it is merely a dead-end host.
