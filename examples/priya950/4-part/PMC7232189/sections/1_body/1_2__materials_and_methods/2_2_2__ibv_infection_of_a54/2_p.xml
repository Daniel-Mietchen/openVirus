<p>Two biological replicates were sequenced for each time point (0, 6, 12, and 24 hpi). The eight samples were barcoded and sequenced in one lane. Each of the eight samples had approximately 5â€“7 million 100-nucleotide single-end reads. All sequencing results passed the quality control. The raw reads of the eight samples were submitted to NCBI SRA database under Biosample ID: SRS1328599.</p>
