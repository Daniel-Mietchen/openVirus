<p>Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus was used to infect A549 cells at an MOI of 1.0. The viral inoculum was removed after 1 h incubation from cells, which was then followed by PBS washing three times. Fresh DMEM containing penicillin-strepto (200 U/mL) and TPCK-treated trypsin (1 μg/mL) was added into IBV-infected cell for further cultivation. Total cellular RNA was isolated from mock-infected cells (0 hpi) and infected cells at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively, with TRIZOL followed by RNA purification with ethanol. Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to assess the quality of extracted RNA. RNA that passed the quality test was further processed for cDNA library construction by using a cDNA library prep kit (catalog number FC-122-1001; Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA library construction and all other procedures were conducted in Genomics Core Research Facility (GCRF) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Briefly, mRNAs were purified from the total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads followed by fragmentation. The resultant mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs that were subjected to an end repair process followed by ligation to the adapters. After separation in agarose gel through electrophoresis, cDNA fragments with a size of about 200 bp were excised, extracted, and amplified by PCR using two primers that match the ends of adaptors. PCR-enriched samples were then sequenced by an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) sequencer in the GCRF at UNL.</p>
