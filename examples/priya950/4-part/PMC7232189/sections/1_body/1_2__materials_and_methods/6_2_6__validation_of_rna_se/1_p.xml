<p>We performed a standard RT-qPCR to validate the gene expression results observed from next-generation sequencing experiment. Total RNA was extracted from A549 cells as 0, 6, 12, and 24 hpi using TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, which was then followed by cDNA synthesis with Oligo dT(18) primer (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). With Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), qPCR reactions were conducted and read in QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the recommended protocol by the manufacturer. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00383">Table S2</xref> summarized sequence information of primers used for expression validation of thirteen genes, including RIG-I, TLR-3, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, IFNβ, TNF, ISG15, Mx1, IRF3, IFNα and IFNα-7 (innate immunity pathway); AMBRA1 (autophagy); and CASP10 (apoptosis). Housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as a control in qPCR experiment, while qPCR data were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method [
