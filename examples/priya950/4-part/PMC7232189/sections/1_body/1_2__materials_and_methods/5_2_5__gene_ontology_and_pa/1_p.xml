<p>We used GSEA database, ClueGO, and STRING database (
 <uri xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://string-db.org/</uri>) to identify significantly enriched biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions, and KEGG pathways for the differentially expressed gene sets of each time point [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] respectively. For the analysis on enrichment of biological processes, a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 and normalized false discovery rate of 0.25 were used to identify significantly enriched terms. A P value adjusted according to Bonferroni step down procedure was used to measure the enrichment significance of a GO term (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in ClueGo. Parent-child GO terms were fused with Kappa cutoff 0.4. The minimal GO level analyzed was set to 3. The enriched KEGG pathways were identified using a false discover rate of 0.05.
