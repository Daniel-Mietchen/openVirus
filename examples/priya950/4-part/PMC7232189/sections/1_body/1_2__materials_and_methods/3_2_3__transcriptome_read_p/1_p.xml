<p>The raw read quality was checked using FastQC. The 3â€™ 5 nucleotides of each read, whose sequencing qualities were low, were removed using fastx_trimmer. GSNAP was then used to map raw reads to human (version: GRCh37.p13) and Influenza B virus genomes [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Samtools was used to index bam files and remove PCR duplicates [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. HTSeq was used to count the number of reads mapped to human genes defined by the Ensemble genome database and viral genes [
