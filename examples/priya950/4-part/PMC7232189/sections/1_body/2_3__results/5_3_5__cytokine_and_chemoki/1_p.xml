<p>TNF signaling pathway, which activates NF-ÎºB signaling pathway to induce transcription of cytokine genes and initiate apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], was also activated in IBV-infected cells. Important players of the TNF signaling pathway, such as TNF, TNFAIP3, and TNFRSF1B, were significantly up regulated (
