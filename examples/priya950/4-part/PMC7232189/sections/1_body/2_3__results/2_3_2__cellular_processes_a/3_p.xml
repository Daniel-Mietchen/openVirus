<p>We then investigated the expression dynamics of the 4365 human genes over the study period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). Most up-regulated genes at earlier time points continued to be up-regulated at later time points. For example, 373 of the 399 up-regulated genes at 6 hpi were also up-regulated at 12 and 24 hpi. 1029 of the 1143 up-regulated genes at 12 hpi were also up-regulated at 24 hpi. Moreover, the expression levels of most up-regulated genes at later time points were comparable to or higher than earlier time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), suggesting immune response to viral infection became stronger over time. Similarly, most down-regulated genes observed at earlier time points continued to be down-regulated, and the expression levels of these down-regulated genes at later time points were comparable to or lower than earlier time points. The comparison of the enriched KEGG pathways in the up-regulated gene sets showed that 36 pathways were persistently activated in the study period (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00383-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), most of which are related to innate immune response to virus infection. We also observed that genes involved in cell cycle continued to be down-regulated from 12 hpi to 24 hpi (
