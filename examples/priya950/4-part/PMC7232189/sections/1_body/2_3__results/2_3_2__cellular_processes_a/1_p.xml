<p>To explore cellular responses to IBV infection, we used DESeq program [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to normalize gene expression levels across time points and to identify human genes significantly regulated by IBV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f001">Figure 1</xref>). We then estimated enriched biological processes and pathways in up-regulated gene set and down-regulated gene set against the gene ontology (GO) database and KEGG pathway database respectively as a function of time following IBV infection.
