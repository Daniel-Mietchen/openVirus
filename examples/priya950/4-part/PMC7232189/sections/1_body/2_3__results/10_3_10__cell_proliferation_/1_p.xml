<p>Genes involved in cell proliferation were dominant in down-regulated gene sets at 12 and 24 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00383">Table S1</xref>). The enriched functions of these affected genes include chromosome segregation, chromosome condensation, protein complex assembly, organelle assembly, cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair, DNA recombination, and DNA replication. In particular, the significant down-regulation of cell cycle checkpoint related genes (Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, CDK1, CDK4, and CDC25C) at 24 hpi was observed (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00383">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that IBV infection may induce cell cycle arrest, which as a result may promote cell survival to enhance IBV replication efficiency in A549 cells.
