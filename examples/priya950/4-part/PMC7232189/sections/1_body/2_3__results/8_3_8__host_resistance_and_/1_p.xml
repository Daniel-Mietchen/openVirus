<p>Host resistance to viral infection or protective host response and disease tolerance play critical roles to modulate viral pathogenicity and severity of damage to host tissues and organs. Previous studies on IAV infection revealed that both processes are modulated by certain key factors [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Host resistance genes improve protection via repressing viral replication with multiple mechanisms, while other genes can modulate disease tolerance by depressing the inflammatory reactions. To understand whether similar mechanisms are used for host resistance and tolerance to IBV infection, we examined the expression levels of reported key regulators in protecting cells from viral infection [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our analysis showed that many genes that are important for repressing viral replication and assembly were up regulated more than 100-fold (

Furthermore, the expression levels of some well-characterized antiviral genes were significantly increased to protect cells from IBV infection. For instance, the myxovirus genes (Mx1 and Mx2), which are GTPases that block influenza A virus replication [
