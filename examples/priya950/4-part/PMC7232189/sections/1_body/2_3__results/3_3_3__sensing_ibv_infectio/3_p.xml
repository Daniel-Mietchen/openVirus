<p>To further validate the gene expression results analyzed by next-generation sequencing, we conducted a conventional RT-qPCR experiment where we measured quantitative changes of a subset of genes in IBV-infected A549 cells as a function of time (post-infection). Selected genes are respectively involved in the innate immune pathway (RIG-I, TLR3, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, IFNβ, TNF, ISG15, and Mx1), autophagy (AMBRA1), and apoptosis (CASP10). As summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f004">Figure 4</xref>, our RT-qPCR experiments confirmed the up-regulation of these genes over time (

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.85; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Interestingly, we did not observe expression of TLR7 and TLR8 at all time points in A549 cells probably because both genes are not expressed in this cell line as demonstrated in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our data suggest that double-strand RNA sensing pathway including RIG-I and TLR3 is rapidly activated following IBV infection, indicating that this pathway is important in induction of the innate immune response to IBV infection in A549 cells. Future study is needed to address a role of single-strand RNA sensing TLR7 and TLR8 in anti-IBV innate immune response.
