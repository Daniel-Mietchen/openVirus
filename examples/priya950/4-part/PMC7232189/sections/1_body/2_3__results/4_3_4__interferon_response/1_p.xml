<p>RIG-I and TLR7 have been reported to activate type I IFN pathway. Consistent with this, we observed that genes of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade were up regulated including IRF9, STAT1, STAT2, and JAK2, suggesting that the IFN signaling pathway was activated as early as 6 hpi. It is also surprising to observe that although TLR7 was not expressed, downstream genes of TLR7 pathway were up-regulated (MyD88, IRAK, and IRF7) (

Further analysis showed that both IFN-III and IFN-I pathways were activated as a function of time following IBV infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For example, IFN-III family genes such as IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3 were constantly expressed over time. IFN-I family genes including IFN-β1, IFN-α20P, IFN-α8, IFN-α2, IFN-α7, IFN-α13) genes, despite relatively low level expressions at earlier time points, were significantly activated at later time points such as 12 hpi and 24 hpi (
