<p>Human A549 cell-specific transcriptome analysis also allowed us confirm the result from a previous study where the authors showed that TLR7 and TLR8 are not expressed in human epithelial A549 cells [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Lacking TLR7/TLR8 molecules apparently prevented us from investigating a function of these viral single-stand RNA recognition receptors for detection of IBV infection. Nevertheless, our study did reveal an important role of TLR3 and RIG-I in sensing IBV genome and triggering the innate immune response in infected A549 cells. Where rapid detection of IBV infection by TLR3 or RIG-1 observed in A549 cells is applicable to other epithelial cells, especially primary human epithelial cells, remains to be studied. In addition, future study also needs to consider employing epithelial cells having a full-spectrum of innate immune activators and regulators rather than TLR7/TLR8-deficient A549 cells. It is also imperative that the antiviral and cellular responses to IBV infection are evaluated in antigen-presentation cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells.
