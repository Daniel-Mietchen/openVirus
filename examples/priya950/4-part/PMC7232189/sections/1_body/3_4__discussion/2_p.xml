<p>In addition, we observed no inducible expression of IFN-γ, representative of type II IFN response, which is in line with the fact that IFN-γ is only expressed in immune cells [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Upon activation of IFN signaling pathway, many IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) were transcribed and up regulated in IBV-infected A549 cells. These ISGs further induced inflammatory responses and activated other cellular pathways. Expression and secretion of chemokines such as IL8 would recruit neutrophil to the infection site. Induction of Mx1 protein expression would be expected to mitigate IBV replication.
