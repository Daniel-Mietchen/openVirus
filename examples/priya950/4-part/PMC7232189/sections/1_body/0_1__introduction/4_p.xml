<p>In this study, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) we investigated cellular response to IBV infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells. Significantly, we observed that the double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, consisting of RIG-I and TLR3, played an essential role in detecting IBV infection. Interestingly, in addition to the antiviral innate immune response, we also found that IBV replication resulted in profound changes in gene transcriptions involving other cellular pathways including immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, mitosis, and cell proliferation. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the interactions between IBV and human lung epithelial cells, which pave the way for further investigation of cellular mechanism in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.</p>
