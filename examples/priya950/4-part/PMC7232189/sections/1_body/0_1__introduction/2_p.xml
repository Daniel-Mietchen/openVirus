<p>As with IAV, IBV contains eight segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. IBV evolves at an estimated rate of ~2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This evolutionary rate is approximately 2–3 times slower than those observed in IAVs. Despite the relatively slow evolutionary rate, new antigenic variants of IBV can emerge, largely driven by genetic reassortment of co-circulating IBV strains [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IBV has evolved into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, Yamagata and Victoria [
