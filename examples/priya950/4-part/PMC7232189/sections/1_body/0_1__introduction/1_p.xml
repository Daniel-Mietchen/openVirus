<p>Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, and C according to their distinct antigenic properties residing in two major structural proteins (matrix 1 and nucleocapsid) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, a new type of influenza virus with bovine as a primary reservoir, officially designated influenza type D, has been described [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these influenza viruses, only influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) are of medical importance. It has been well established that humans are the primary host and reservoir of IBV [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], although sporadic infection episodes of IBVs have been described in seals and pigs [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, IAV circulates in various mammals including humans, swine, and migratory or domestic waterfowl [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IBV-associated mortality has been frequently observed in seasonal influenza epidemics particularly in children and adolescents [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the rate of mortality can be comparable to IAV [
