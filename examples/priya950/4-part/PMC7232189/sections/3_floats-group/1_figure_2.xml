  <p>Top 20 enriched gene ontology biological processes for 6, 12, and 24 hpi. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed on up-regulated gene set and down-regulated gene set of each time point respectively on the GSEA website. The significantly enriched gene ontology processes were ranked by their enrichment scores and the top 20 processes were shown for each gene set. Blue and red panels represent down-regulated and up-regulated gene sets respectively.</p>
