<p id="Par48">The MTL-SGL model was trained on five individual tasks derived from three individual datasets (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). During learning, we optimized three hyper parameters, λ
 <sub>1</sub>, λ
 <sub>2</sub>and λ
 <sub>3</sub>, in the MTL-SGL model by minimizing RMSE for each task through 10-fold cross-validation. Results showed that of the five models tested, our MTL-SGL model achieved the best performance with the combination of λ
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.1, λ
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.1, and λ
 <sub>3</sub> = 5: an average RMSE of 0.6477 units, an average accuracy of 87.28% for identifying antigenic variants, and a sensitivity of 85.35% (Table
