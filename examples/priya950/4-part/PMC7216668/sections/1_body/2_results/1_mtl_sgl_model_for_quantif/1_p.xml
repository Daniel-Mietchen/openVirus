<p id="Par47">Our long-term goal is to develop a genomic sequence–based method to quantify antigenic distances between influenza viruses and to understand the key residues driving antigenic evolution of influenza viruses. In this study, an MTL-SGL model was developed and then applied to the H1N1 IAVs. The model was used to identify genetic determinants from two types of features (i.e. sequence and 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation) affecting influenza virus antigenicity by learning the weights for each feature. A larger weight indicates a higher impact of this feature on influenza virus antigenicity. The unique 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites for HA of H1N1 IAVs are shown in Table S

To avoid potential biases due to data integration processes, a MTL framework was proposed to handle multiple datasets by considering those from individual experiments as individual tasks. The MTL-SGL model comprised three integrated steps: data processing, multi-task feature learning, and antigenic distance prediction and antigenic map construction (Fig.
