<p id="Par50">By applying the MTL-SGL method to 2030 pairs of HI data for A(H1N1)season1977 viruses, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and A(H1N1) swine influenza viruses (SIVs), we determined that among a total of 167 residues with variations, 78 features were associated with antigenicity of the viruses (Figure S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>; Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The 167 residues with variations consisted of 162 amino acid mutations and 5 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The 78 features consisted of 73 residues and 5 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites. Among those 73 selected mutations, 46 are located in antibody binding sites (8 in Sa, 15 in Sb, 7 in Ca1, 7 in Ca2, and 8 in Cb), six (i.e., 130, 132, 183, 187, 191, and 222) were located in receptor binding sites, and 16 were located in regions outside the antibody and receptor binding sites (Figure S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Among these mutations, those at residues 71, 130, 141, 186, and 272 were among those with the highest weights.
