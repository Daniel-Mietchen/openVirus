<p id="Par60">In addition to those high-impact mutations, a few 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites were also considered to be highly associated with H1N1 IAV antigenic drift events. Results from the MTL-SGL model indicated that change of 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites 54 and 125 was the primary cause of the antigenic drift event RU77 → SG86, and both sites were validated to be occupied with 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans using mass spectrometry analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Glycosylation has been well studied in regard to its effect on the antigenicity of various IAV subtypes, such as H1N1 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], H5N1 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], and H3N2 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. For H1N1 viruses, a total of 20 potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation patterns have been observed in HA subunit (HA1) protein sequences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, especially 54 and 125, were confirmed to play an important role in antigenic diversity by masking antigenic sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our study, mutations at three non-conserved 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (54, 125, and 160) were identified to greatly affect antigenic changes in H1N1 IAVs. However, not all the glycosylation sites contribute equally to antigenicity. Our results show that changing 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site 125 has a much bigger effect on antigenicity than a change in any other site. Because prior studies demonstrate that HA glycosylation could affect antigenicity and pathogenicity of human H1N1 IAVs by masking antigenic sites and eliciting protective immune response, HA glycosylation, including the structure and composition of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans present at each site, is extremely important for sequence-based antigenicity quantification and vaccine strain selection; thus, it should always be considered as an essential factor in sequence-based predicting models. Current model only considers the presence or absence of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans at the HA but not the structure and composition of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans present at each site. As future study, we hope to integrate the glycoproteomics approaches to define patterns of the structure and composition of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans for each position, and these features will be integrated and used to optimize the computational model.
