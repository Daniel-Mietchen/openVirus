<p id="Par56">A few models and algorithms of sequence-based predictions of influenza antigenicity were proposed in the past few years. A few computational methods, such as the regression analyses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], decision tree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], random forest regression and support vector regression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], between variations in the serological data (e.g. HI titers) and mutations in HA protein sequences. Under the hypothesis that influenza antigenicity would be determined by a small number of features embedded in the influenza genomic sequence, especially the HA protein sequence and tertiary structure, a machine learning framework using sparse learning was developed and shown to be effective in determining residues associated with antigenicity of H3N2 and H5N1 IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To achieve a robust model for sequence-based prediction, various unique computational components have been developed to improve this framework, such as high-order models to investigate the effect of combinations of multiple individual mutations on antigenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and multitask models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to avoid data integration required by conventional single task learning, which can lead artifical biases from the data integration steps. This MTL framework can be extremely important for large-scale modeling because more and more serologic data are generated by the rapid growth of experimental technology, and the robustness and effectiveness of MTL model handling multiple data sources (different reagents, protocols, labs) have been proved by a prior study on H3N2 influenza data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similar to the sparse learning model proposed by Cai et al. (2012) and Sun et al. (2013), Neher et al. (2016) adapted sparse learning model to identify residues associated with influenza viruses by correlating serological data and protein sequence data. In addition to protein features, the genetic distances and tree topologies in the phylogenetic trees were used as a penalty function in the model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Harvey et al. developed a sparse Bayesian variable selection methods to study mutations in HA sequences affecting antigenic changes of H1N1 seasonal influenza (1997 through 2009) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, none of these methods have considered multiple type of features (e.g. glycosylation) in predicting antigenicity of influenza viruses.
