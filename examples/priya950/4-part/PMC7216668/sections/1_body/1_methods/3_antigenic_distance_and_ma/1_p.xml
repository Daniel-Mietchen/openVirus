<p id="Par43">Both HI-based and sequences-based antigen maps were constructed using AntigenMap (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Specifically, a nuclear norm regularization–based method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] was used to recover a low-rank data matrix for the HI table. The optimal parameter k for nuclear norm regularization was set to 1. The low-reactor threshold for low-rank matrix completion was set to 10, and a spectral clustering method was applied to identify antigenic clusters in antigenic maps as described elsewhere. In the antigenic maps, a threshold of 2 units of antigenic distance, representing a 4-fold HI titer change, was used as the threshold of antigenic variant detection [
