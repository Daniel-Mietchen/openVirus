<p id="Par46">The viral samples purified through ultracentrifuge were subjected to proteomics, glycomics, and glycoproteomics analyses as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Briefly, the samples were digested using trypsin, and proteolytic peptides and glycopeptides were then split into aliquots for performing proteomics and glycoproteomics. Proteomics samples were deglycosylated using PNGase 
 <italic>F</italic>: released glycans were isolated for glycomics analyses; the deglycosylated peptides were analyzed to determine the site-occupancy. Glycoproteomics samples were incubated in the deglycosylation conditions without PNGase 
 <italic>F</italic> (as a control for spontaneous deamidation at non-glycosylated asparagine residues), and the glycosylated peptides were analyzed for glycoproteomics to characterize the site-specific glycosylation patterns. All samples were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The occupancy of glycosylation and site-specific glycosylation patterns were determined using GlycReSoft [
