  <p>Large-scale antigenic evolution profile of H1 influenza A viruses in avian species, swine and humans. Different antigenic clusters are indicated by different colors. Colors of antigenic clusters indicate the antigenic profiles of corresponding clusters. As indicated in the key at the bottom left of the figure, a similar color indicates a small antigenic distance, and a dissimilar color indicates distinct antigenicity</p>
