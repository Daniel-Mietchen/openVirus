<p>The 20 patients who were diagnosed with HAV in our centre were younger than the other HIV-infected patients, and they had been more recently HIV diagnosed (mean = 1.41 year; range: 0–28 months). This suggests the interest to strongly promote HAV vaccination in patients newly diagnosed with HIV in case they are not immunised. Here, none of these 20 cases had been vaccinated against HAV despite recommendations. The HAV vaccine shortage in France that starting 12 months before the 2017 HAV outbreak and that persisted during this outbreak may explain in part that HIV infected patients diagnosed with HAV infection in 2017 in our centre had been recently diagnosed with HIV. In fact, these patients were more likely to miss the opportunity to be vaccinated against HAV following the initiation of the management of their HIV-infection because of this HAV vaccine shortage. At the national scale, it probably contributed to enhance HAV outbreak extent. When the outbreak reached its highest level, we have been able to get HAV vaccines as part of special measures, and vaccinated almost half of the patients recruited among those particularly exposed to HAV. Although the impact on HAV transmission was not measured, vaccinated patients may have reduce the transmission chain as both pre-exposure immunisation as well as immunisation within two weeks post-exposure are effective in reducing HAV infection occurrence. The response to HAV vaccine was likely important as vaccinated patients had high CD4 cell counts (CD4 count &gt;500/mm
 <sup>3</sup> for 74%) and a greater CD4 cell count was associated with an increase response to HAV vaccination [
