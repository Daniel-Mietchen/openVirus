<p>Between 1 June 2017 and 30 September 2017 (3 months), we invited patients at high risk to acquire HAV to be vaccinated in our centre in the framework of a free vaccine immunisation program. These patients were among the 637 HIV infected MSM or bisexual male patients in our HIV cohort. In addition, 310 (49%) of these 637 patients were either identified as not immunised against HAV based on a previous HAV IgG serology found negative (
 <italic>n</italic> = 169; 27%), or were patients for whom we had no result available for a HAV IgG serology (
 <italic>n</italic> = 141; 22%). Out of these 310 patients, 250 patients (81%) could be contacted, and 110 (44%) accepted to be vaccinated.
