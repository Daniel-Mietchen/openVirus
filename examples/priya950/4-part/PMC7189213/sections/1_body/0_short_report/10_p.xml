<p>The causes and mechanisms of the emergence and drying up of the 2016–2017 HAV outbreak are unknown, as that's the case for many outbreaks. This European HAV outbreak illustrates that such epidemics are linked to one, or few clonal strains. Both genomics variants that we identified to circulate in our geographical area were associated with HAV in MSM in European countries. Thus, RIVM-HAV16-090 was identified among MSM who participated in the EuroPride festival in Amsterdam (23 July to 7 August 2016) and was identical to a Taiwanese strain responsible for 275 notified cases from May 2016, while VRD-521-2016 ‘UK Travel to Spain’ was identified several times among UK MSM returning from Spain. This question if these three strains that circulated in Europe, of which two were detected in our geographical area, might have enhanced contagiousness or potential to escape vaccine stimulated responses compared to other strains. Another reason for the occurrence of the European 2016–2017 HAV outbreak could be related to new sexual practices in the MSM population, but we did not find strong support for such hypothesis neither in the literature nor through our anonymous survey. The implementation of antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TasP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent from HIV infections might be associated with the phenomena of risk compensation or behavioural disinhibition, which could lead TasP or PrEP users to engage in overall riskier sexual practices and increase their chances of acquiring STD including HA. In Montreal, Canada, an increase rate of STD in PrEP users was observed following the initiation of PrEP [
