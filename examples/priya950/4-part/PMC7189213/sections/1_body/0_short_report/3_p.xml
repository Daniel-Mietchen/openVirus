<p>Preventive measures implemented during the HAV outbreak were analysed through the NADIS database. NADIS is a medical file and database designed to follow all HIV positive patients. That database has been used in order to identify at risk patients which mean HIV positive, MSM or bisexual, who weren't immunised against HAV. Then, these patients were contacted by phone or mail to provide a free HAV vaccine immunisation, and in the case they accepted to be vaccinated, to respond to an anonymous questionnaire concerning STD transmission routes and sexual behaviours or practices. This questionnaire was divided into two main parts: the first part was about sexual practices during the 2 previous months, including gender of sexual partners, type of practices (oral sex, anal sex, ChemSex (chemical sexuality)), condom use during oral and anal sex (never, sometimes, always), number of sexual partners (0, 1 regular partner, 2–5, 5–10, 10–30, &gt;30) and places where partners were met (bars/clubs, saunas/hammams, backrooms, internet, street). The second part of the questionnaire was focused on the patients’ knowledge about the risks of STD acquisition: HIV infection; syphilis; hepatitis A, B, C; gonorrhoeae and chlamydiosis. For each of these STD, patients had to select the risks to acquire a given STD by ticking the answers they considered to be correct among food, oral sex, vaginal sex, anal sex, other ways (saliva or urine for example) and none.</p>
