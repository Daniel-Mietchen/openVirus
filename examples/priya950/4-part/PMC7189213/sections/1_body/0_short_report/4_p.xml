<p>Twenty HAV infections were diagnosed in 2017 among our cohort of 2300 HIV-infected patients followed-up in our infectious diseases units for their HIV infection [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This represented an overall annual incidence of 0.9%. All these cases involved men between 29 and 52 years of age (mean = 39 years; range: 29–52 years) with homosexual or bisexual practices. These HIV infected patients diagnosed with HAV were younger than HIV infected MSM not immunised to HAV (mean = 39 years; range: 29–52 years 
 <italic>vs.</italic> mean = 45 years; range: 17–71 years, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.095). HAV incidence was 3.2% among the 637 MSM or bisexual male patients of our cohort. The 20 patients HAV diagnosed in 2017 had been recently diagnosed with HIV, with a median time of 1.4 years (mean = 1.41 year; range: 0–28 months) since the HIV diagnosis. All of them were under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Their plasma HIV RNA load was &lt;35 copies/ml (Veris assays, Beckman-Coulter, USA) for 82% of them, and CD4 cell count was &gt;500/mm
 <sup>3</sup> for 60% of them. All these 20 patients had been recently documented with another STD, including syphilis (65%), chlamydiosis (20%), human papillomavirus infection (15%), hepatitis B or C (10%) or gonorrhoeae (10%). Liver cytolysis was observed at time of diagnosis of HAV infection in 30% of the cases, liver transaminases being between 5 and 10-folds the upper normal values, and hospitalisation was required for more than half (52%) of the patients, for a median duration of 4.5 days (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). None of the patients had been vaccinated against HAV. HAV genotype was obtained for 12 of the 20 patients: seven HAV sequences belonged to the VRD-521-2016 ‘UK Travel to Spain’ cluster and five to the RIVM-HAV16-090-Ber:NL ‘NI Europride’ cluster, representing two of the three strains involved in the 2016–2017 European HA outbreak.
