<p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is mostly transmitted in high endemicity countries via the faecalâ€“oral route. In low endemicity countries, HA is most frequently documented after travels abroad, after eating contaminated food or in the setting of secondary transmissions. Notably, HAV has been shown to be transmitted sexually during anal coitus or oral sexual intercourse, and small or even large epidemics have been described among men who have sex with men (MSM) since 1978. In the USA, MSM were identified at higher risk of contracting HAV and transmitting the virus. That's why, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended since 1995 their vaccination against HAV. Subsequently, in 2003, the French High Authority of Health (HAS, a national sanitary institution) ended up at the same recommendations. In 2016 and 2017, an HAV outbreak spread in Europe, mostly affecting MSM, either HIV-positive or negative [

Our goal was (i) to describe HAV incidence in 2017 in our large cohort of HIV-infected patients followed-up in the infectious diseases units of Marseille university hospital, Southeastern France; (ii) to describe the preventive measures implemented during this outbreak and (iii) to assess among patients vaccinated on this occasion their at risk sexual practices and knowledge on sexually transmitted diseases (STD).
