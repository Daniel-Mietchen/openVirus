  <title>Time-point studies of CHIKV protein levels upon bortezomib treatment.</title>
  <p>HeLa cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with either 0.1 μM bortezomib or vehicle control. Protein samples were harvested at different time-points post-infection and probed for CHIKV proteins. (A) Western blot images are representative of two independent experiments. Actin was added as a loading control. Actin for nsP3 and nsP2 are the same because both proteins were probed from the same blot. M: Mock, Veh: Vehicle control, 0.1B: 0.1 μM bortezomib, hpi: hours post-infection (refers to time-points when samples were harvested), +: indicates treatment with either Veh or 0.1B. (B) Band intensities of bortezomib-treated samples relative to vehicle controls for each time-point are shown in the bar graphs. Band intensities were calculated after normalisation with actin for each sample. Error bars represent standard error of means from two independent experiments. *
