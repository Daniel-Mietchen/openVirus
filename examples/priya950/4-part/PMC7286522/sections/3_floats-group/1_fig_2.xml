  <title>Effects of proteasome inhibitors on CHIKV infection in BHK21 cells.</title>
  <p>BHK21 cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with indicated concentrations of (A) MG-132, (B) MLN-9708 (C) MLN-2238, (D) delanzomib, (E) carfilzomib (F) ONX-0914, (G) epoxomicin, (H) oprozomib (I) lactacystin and (J) aclacinomycin A. Virus supernatants were harvested for plaque assays at 24 hpi. Percentage inhibition of CHIKV titers by proteasome inhibitors are presented in the bar graphs corresponding to the primary axis. Percentage inhibition was calculated after normalisation to vehicle controls. Cell viabilities are presented by the line graph corresponding to the secondary axis. Error bars represent standard errors of means from three technical replicates. Proteasome inhibitors tested belong to different compound classes, namely peptide aldehydes: MG132; peptide boronates: MLN-9708, MLN-2238 and delanzomib; peptide epoxyketones: carfilzomib, ONX-0914, epoxomicin and oprozomib; β-lactones: lactacystin; anthracycline derivatives: aclacinomycin A. *** 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test comparing proteasome inhibitor-treated samples to vehicle control).
