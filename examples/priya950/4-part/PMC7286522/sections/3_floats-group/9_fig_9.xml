  <title>Changes in CHIKV RNA levels upon bortezomib treatment.</title>
  <p>HeLa cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with either 0.1 μM bortezomib or vehicle control. Samples were harvested at different time-points post-infection for extraction of total RNA from infected cells. Levels of (A) total CHIKV RNA or (B) strand-specific CHIKV RNA were detected by qRT-PCR. Actin mRNA was used for normalization. The bar graph shows the fold change of CHIKV RNA in bortezomib-treated samples compared to untreated samples. Fold change was calculated using the double delta ct method. Error bars represent standard errors of replicate means from at least two independent experiments. *
