<p>In order to confirm the antiviral effects of proteasome inhibition on CHIKV infection, a panel of proteasome inhibitors from compound classes with different functional groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008336.s001">S1 Table</xref>) was screened in post-treatment assays in BHK21 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2</xref>, most proteasome inhibitors inhibited CHIKV replication at concentrations that were minimally cytotoxic, indicating that proteasomal inhibition is detrimental to CHIKV infection. The inhibition in CHIKV titers observed for MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and lactacystin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2I</xref>) also supports previous data by Karpe and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Inhibitors which exhibited at least a 97% maximal inhibition came from various compound classes and included MG-132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), MLN-9708 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), MLN-2238 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), delanzomib (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), ONX-0914 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), epoxomicin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and lactacystin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Aclacinomycin A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2J</xref>) treatment resulted in an 84% inhibition at 10 μM concentration. Treatment with 100 μM of aclacinomycin A resulted in 100% cell death, likely due to its inhibitory effects on macromolecular synthesis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Treatment with carfilzomib (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) and oprozomib (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2H</xref>) resulted in decreasing cell viabilities, suggesting that the inhibition in CHIKV titers observed for these two compounds may be a result of cytotoxicity. In summary, results from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g002">Fig 2</xref> suggested that the proteasome may play a pro-viral role in CHIKV replication. It is likely that the varying mechanisms of inhibition by different proteasomal inhibitors influenced the magnitude of inhibition of CHIKV infection.
