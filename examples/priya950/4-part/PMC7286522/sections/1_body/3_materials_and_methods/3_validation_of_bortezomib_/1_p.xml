<p>Post-treatment experiments similar to the ones conducted for BHK21 were performed on HeLa and HSMM. HeLa and HSMM cells were seeded in 96-well plates at densities of 15,000 and 20,000 cells per well, respectively, and incubated overnight. HeLa monolayers were infected with different strains of CHIKV at 10 for 1.5h at 37°C and washed twice with PBS. For HSMM, cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 at MOI 10 for 1.5h at 37°C and washed twice with PBS. In this and other experiments, MOI for HeLa and HSMM cells was counted based on virus titer measured in BHK21 cells and actual level of productive infection is expected to differ across cell lines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. After the washing step, infected cells were incubated with bortezomib at various concentrations for 48h (HeLa) or 24h (HSMM) at 37°C, prior to being harvested for plaque assays. In order to measure the therapeutic window of bortezomib in CHIKV-infected HeLa cells, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated. It is expressed as a ratio of the CC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% cytotoxic concentration) to EC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% effective concentration). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of bortezomib in HeLa cells was defined as the concentration of bortezomib required to reduce virus titer by 50%. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of bortezomib required to reduce cell viability by 50%.
