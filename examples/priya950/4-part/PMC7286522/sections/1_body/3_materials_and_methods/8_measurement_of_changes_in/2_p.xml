<p>Samples were then assayed in a one-step qRT-PCR protocol using the SYBR Green Quantitative RT-qPCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Reactions (25 μl) contained 12.5 μl of 2X SYBR green master-mix, 25 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase, 0.2 μM each of forward and reverse primers and 50 ng of RNA. Primers targeting the capsid gene in the CHIKV genome were used (forward primer: 5’-GCGGTACCCCAACAGAAG-3’; reverse primer: 5’-GGTTTCTTTTTAGGTGGCTG-3’). Actin was also detected as a housekeeping gene for normalisation across samples (forward primer: 5’-AGCGCGGCTACAGCTTCA-3’; reverse primer: 5’-GGCGACGTAGCACAGCTTCT-3’). Reactions were carried out in an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus qPCR system, beginning with a 30 min reverse transcription step at 42°C. This was followed by a 5 min step at 95°C for 
 <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase activation. 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min were carried out for amplification and fluorescence measurement. This was followed by melt-curve analysis to verify melting temperatures of PCR products. The fold changes of bortezomib-treated samples compared to untreated samples were calculated by the double-delta ct method.
