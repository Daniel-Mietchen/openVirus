<p>The alterations in ns and structural protein levels upon bortezomib treatment also reflect a similar phenotype recently described for a SINV mutant with increased nsP1 capping activity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This mutant over-produced ns proteins and had somewhat elevated levels of viral RNA synthesis. Importantly, it also had slightly reduced synthesis of structural proteins and strongly reduced infectious virion production [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These similarities indicate that disrupting the balance between ns and structural protein levels is detrimental for alphavirus replication, perhaps by altering the cellular environment in a way that is unfavorable for virion formation and/or by directly interfering with virion formation. Indeed, nsP2 has been recently identified as component of alphavirus virions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and there is genetic evidence that functional linkage of nsP2 and capsid protein is important for alphavirus replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that major changes in their ratio, similar to what is observed during bortezomib treatment, would have a negative impact on viral replication.
