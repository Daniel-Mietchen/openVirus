<p>The fluctuating trend observed for nsP2 and nsP3 may be due to multiple competing effects of bortezomib on these proteins. For instance, bortezomib may either increase nsP2/nsP3 expression or reduce their degradation, causing an increase in their levels within infected cells. However, by reducing virion production, bortezomib also restricts viral spread in the monolayer, reducing the overall amounts of protein detected via western blot at other time-points. A similar explanation can be made for the fact that CHIKV RNA levels were observed to be elevated only at 12 hpi, despite increased nsP4 levels from 6 hpi onwards.</p>
