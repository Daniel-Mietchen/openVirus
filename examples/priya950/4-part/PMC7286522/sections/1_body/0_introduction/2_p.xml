<p>CHIKV belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CHIKV is part of the Old World alphaviruses, which also include the well-studied model viruses, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Chikungunya virions are enveloped, with a positive-sense RNA genome enclosed within a nucleocapsid core [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The CHIKV genome is approximately 11.8 kb long and contains two open reading frames (ORF): a 7.4 kb ORF encoding the non-structural (ns) proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4), and a 3.7 kb ORF encoding the structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, 6K/TF and E1) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Glycoprotein spikes consisting of E1 and E2 on the CHIKV envelope mediate virion binding and entry into host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within the host cell, the viral genome is translated by the eukaryotic translation machinery, producing the polyprotein precursor for the ns proteins, which is then processed into mature proteins. The ns proteins complex with viral genome and cellular components to form the viral replicase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The viral replicase generates the full-length negative-sense CHIKV RNA, which serves as a template for the transcription of full-length positive-sense genomic (G), as well as the subgenomic (SG) CHIKV RNAs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is followed by translation of the viral structural proteins from the SG RNA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the later stages of the CHIKV replication cycle, the nucleocapsid core assembles in the cytoplasm and buds out through the plasma membrane, acquiring a lipid envelope to form mature, infectious progeny [
