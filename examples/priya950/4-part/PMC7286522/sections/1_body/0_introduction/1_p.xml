<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that has re-emerged as a major public health threat in the last decade [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV infection results in a febrile illness accompanied by debilitating polyarthralgia, myalgia and maculopapular rash [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Chronic polyarthralgia lasting for several months to years has been reported in a subset of patients, significantly compromising quality of life [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While historically confined to Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, CHIKV outbreaks have recently also been reported in non-endemic areas, including islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, parts of Europe, as well as countries in the Americas, infecting millions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Factors contributing to the continued waves of CHIKV epidemics worldwide include increased global travel and rising global temperatures, which have resulted in wider distribution of the mosquito vectors,

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the significant medical threat posed by CHIKV, there are currently no licensed therapeutics or prophylactics against CHIKV infection. There remains an urgent need for the discovery of novel antivirals against CHIKV infection, accompanied by an improved understanding of CHIKV replication and pathogenesis.
