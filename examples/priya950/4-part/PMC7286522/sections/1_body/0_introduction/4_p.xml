<p>In this study, we explored the antiviral potential of a panel of proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], was selected for downstream experiments to investigate the potential mechanism of antiviral action. Bortezomib treatment was found to interfere with a post-entry step in the CHIKV replication cycle. Treatment with bortezomib also resulted in a decrease in structural protein expression. Western blot analysis showed elevated levels of CHIKV nsP4 from early time-points, suggesting the possibility that the CHIKV nsP4 is degraded by the proteasome, similar to the nsP4 of SFV and SINV. In addition, a strong reduction in structural protein levels was also observed. Levels of both positive-sense and negative-sense CHIKV RNA were elevated at later time-points post-infection. This study shows that proteasome inhibitors affect different processes involved in CHIKV replication and may serve as potential antivirals against CHIKV. Further work into their clinical therapeutic use during CHIKV infection is warranted.
