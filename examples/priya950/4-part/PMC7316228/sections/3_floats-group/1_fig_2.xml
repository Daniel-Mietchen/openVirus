  <title>Identification of negative, zero, and positive functional branches.</title>
  <p>(
   <italic>A</italic>) Scatter-plot of site-wise functional selection and expected charge, based on deep mutational scanning (DMS). For a given residue using DMS preference data, ‘functional selection’ is a measure of functional constraints at this site (a transformation of Shannon’s evenness) and ‘expected charge’ is the mean charge from DMS preferences. The colours are to facilitate the identification of the negative (yellow), zero (dark blue), and positive (light blue) branches. (
   <italic>B</italic>) The location of the residues belonging to each of the three branches identified in 
   <italic>A</italic>, on the HA monomer, visualized with PyMOL [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and PDB 1RVX [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 
   <italic>(C)-(E)</italic> The net charge of the positive (
   <italic>C</italic>), negative (
   <italic>D</italic>), and zero (
   <italic>E</italic>) branches over time in 1741 H1N1 sequences from human hosts during 1918 to 2008.
