  <title>Sites shown to influence binding, according to Hensley and coauthors [

  <p>The sites that change binding are denoted with large circles, whereas those other residues that were not so identified are depicted as points. Single mutations are these sites led to mutants denoted as “better binders” or “worse binders” by Hensley [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Table S2. In H3 numbering, the sites affecting binding are 128, 129, 164, 165, 166, 158, 156, 192, 193, 196, 198, 143, 224, 244, 74, 75, 119, 162, 93, 145 [
