<p>These functional branches we identified may be related to other biochemical properties of HA residues. Meyer and Wilke [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used statistical models of H3N2 HA data to show that distances to the RBS and relative solvent accessibilities (RSAs) of residues explained a significant fraction of the variance seen in evolutionary rates. On a coarse scale, our H1N1 HA analyses largely agree with these findings. With respect to distances of each residue’s centroid to the centroid of the RBS, the negative branch has a significantly different distribution than either the positive or the zero branch (
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.28228 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001638, 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.24011 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000219, respectively), but the zero and positive branch are not significantly different (
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.10263 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.3347) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), and these results also hold when only HA1 sites are considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4B and 4F</xref>). For RSAs, the distribution of the zero branch differs significantly from the other two (
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.5672 for negative branch and 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.52792 for positive branch, giving 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup> in both cases), and the distributions of the positive and negative branches are also significantly different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3E and 4F</xref>, 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.18629 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03846). These results are largely the same for analogous comparisons with sites on HA1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, rates of evolution and distances to RBS generally have greater ranges for residues in HA1 than for those in HA2 (
