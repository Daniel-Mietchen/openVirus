<p>The previous results on the different patterns of net charge for the identified branches have relied upon the aggregation, through summing, of the charges of all sites in each branch. While the net charge on these branches have distinct patterns over time, individual charges per site over time may themselves reveal notable features. To explore this, we fit multinomial logistic regression models at each site in the HA protein to obtain predicted probabilities of given charges over time, using collected natural sequences of H1N1 in humans (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However, over time, while certain sites in the negative branch do tend to become more negative as expected due to their functional constraints, others appear to transition away from a negative charge (see arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This results in the increase in net charge seen for the negative branch (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). A similar, but opposite, process appears to occur on the positive branch, where certain residues transition away from a positive charge.
