<p>So far, our results have relied upon the designations of residues belonging to the negative, positive, and zero branches through visual inspection generally supported by RSA values, and this method imposes a hard separation of negative and positive sites near the axis of symmetry. It is important to test if our results are robust to another, more formal, clustering scheme. To further investigate this, we used hierarchical clustering in R [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Using unscaled selection coefficients and expected charge values at each residue, we used Ward’s method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in R [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but with Euclidean distance (between residues on the selection–charge plane) instead of its square as a distance measure. Among all possibilities, we used this clustering method since it accurately discriminates the three branches that are visually striking. Murtagh and Legendre [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] show that this distance metric is distinct from that described by Ward [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but nevertheless it is better at detecting the three branches here, and so we used it to investigate the characteristics on the branches and to show robustness of our results with an alternative to visual grouping. The separation into the three branches is largely consistent with our initial classification. However, the positive branch contains most of the sites that are at the base of the three branches (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s010">S9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s011">S10</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s012">S11</xref> Figs. In essence, we found a similar clustering to our more subjective methods. There are subtle differences, but these do not affect the qualitative results.
