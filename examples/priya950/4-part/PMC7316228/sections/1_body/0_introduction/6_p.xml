 <italic>What is the role of localized electrostatic charge on the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1 HA? Furthermore, can the characteristics of local charge explain the lack of increase in the HA net charge and thus give further evidence for immune escape due to increased HA avidity to cellular receptors?</italic> In this paper, we make use of deep mutational scan data on H1N1 1933/WSN to identify three groups of sites on the HA protein of H1N1: this classification reflects functional constraints (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, purifying selection) in conjunction with the expected charge at each residue. While functional constraints on the H1N1 HA may shift over time, we identify groups of residues based on measures of per-site functional selection and expected charge on an early H1N1 strain, and examine how the charge of these groups has changed over time. We show that in natural sequences from 1918 to 2008, these three groups present different trends of net charge, with the notable finding that the group that is generally closer to the RBS, more accessible to solvent, and evolves the fastest, is increasing in charge. These results possibly implicate a role for the net charge of specific regions on the HA of H1N1 IAVs in evolutionary dynamics, particularly in the context of viral binding to the host cell surface.
