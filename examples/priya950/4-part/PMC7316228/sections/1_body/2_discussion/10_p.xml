<p>It is striking that simple measures of functional selection and expected charge are able to discriminate sites that have higher evolutionary rates, particularly when these measures are independent of antibody interactions and are based solely upon cell entry and viral replication. That these sites then show an increase in net charge over time is even more intriguing. Overall, our results possibly implicate localized charge on the HA protein in evolutionary dynamics, particularly in HA-cell host interactions. We could speculate that certain regions on the HA protein could be under pressure to gain charge in order to facilitate attachment to the cell surface, whereas others would be under pressure to decrease in charge in response to such an increase.</p>
