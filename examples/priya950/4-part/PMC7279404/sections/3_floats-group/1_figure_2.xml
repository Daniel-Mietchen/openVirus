  <p>Summary of the liquid biopsies activating chemoattraction signal pathways for recruiting immune cells in NASH/NAFLD. palmitate and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced hepatic lipotoxicity is triggered by CXCL10 with hepatocyte-derived CYP2E1 vesicles enrichment; Palmitate-stimulated EVs are enriched in ceramide (C16:0)-derived sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) to chemoattract macrophages. Increased numbers of EVs derived from invariant natural killer T cells and CD14+ monocytes are associated with alanine transaminase (ALT) level in serum. Mlk3−/− mice fed a diet that was high in fats and carbohydrates exhibited suppressed cytokine expression and macrophage infiltration compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Lipid-induced TNFRSF10B signaling causes release of inflammatory extracellular vesicles from hepatocytes. High levels of hepatocyte mtDNA in the microparticles (MPs) activated toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway for chemotaxis of neutrophils and M1 macrophages.</p>
