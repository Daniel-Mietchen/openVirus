<p>EVs also allow HCV to evade immunity by protecting the HCV RNA from degradation. The hepatitis A virus evades the human immune response by becoming encapsulated in the membranes of the host immune cells [

Elevated numbers of platelet-derived EVs are also associated with liver fibrosis biomarkers, such as serum hyaluronate and the N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [

Patients with chronic HCV infection experience greater platelet activation and increased levels of circulating platelet-derived EVs compared to those with chronic HBV infection. Immune cell-derived circulating EVs are associated with advanced liver disease and may be identified by microparticle markers of cell type: T cells by CD4+/8+; monocytes by CD14+; neutrophils by CD15+; platelets by CD41+; and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells by Valpha24/Vbeta11 [

The authors of another study found that liver cells exposed to IFN-Î± conferred resistance to HBV replication via cell-to-cell communication through EVs in infected liver cells [
