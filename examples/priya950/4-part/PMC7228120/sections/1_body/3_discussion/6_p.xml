<p>In summary, our study provides a comprehensive description on the spatiotemporally evolutionary dynamic of A/H1N1pdm virus in China during 2009–19 and identifies a series of amino acid mutations to be fixed in HA and NA glycoproteins. We found that elevated dN/dS value and relative genetic diversity of A/H1N1pdm virus occurred during 2018–2019, and inferred that simultaneous activities of A/H1N1pdm virus with A/H3N2 and two lineages of influenza B virus during this period were associated with the severe seasonal influenza pandemics. Furthermore, East China and South China were found to play a crucial seeding role in the spread of A/H1N1pdm virus, which is of major significance for influenza prevention and control in China.</p>
