<p>We inferred the ancestral sequences at each node of the HA ML tree. Fifteen amino-acid substitutions were fixed along the backbone of the HA phylogeny, and the majority of these amino-acid substitutions occurred after 2011 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among these fixed amino-acid mutations, four were also identified as positively selected sites by both the M8 model in PAML4.8 and the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) method in DataMonkey (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In particular, majority of the fixed mutations are located in HA1 subunit, and only a few were located in the stem area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Six sites were located either at antigenic sites or in proximity to the receptor-binding site (RBS), including S91R (Cb antigenic site), S202T (Sb antigenic site), S179N-180Q-181T (Sa antigenic site), and S200P [antigenic epitope (190-helox) adjacent to RBS]. Half of the six fixed sites occurred after 2017 (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For NA gene, there were fifteen amino acid substitutions to be fixed along the backbone of the phylogeny. Two amino acid substitutions (N369K and I314M) were involved in antigenic sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among these fixed amino-acid mutations, three were also identified as positively selected sites by the M8 model in PAML4.8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), and no positively selected sites were identified in antigenic sites of NA gene (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Distinct from the HA gene, most amino acid mutations in NA gene were fixed during 2013â€“2017 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
