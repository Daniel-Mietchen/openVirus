<p>Further comparison with two WHO-recommended vaccine strains showed that the fixed mutations covered almost all the main difference between the circulating A/H1N1pdm lineages and the vaccine strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Compared to the 2009 vaccine strain, majority of the mutations in HA and NA genes of circulating lineages were gradually accumulated during 2011â€“2016. Interestingly, all fixed mutations (S91R, S181T, S200P and I312V in HA and G77R, V81A, I188T, and N449D in NA) causing difference to the 2015 vaccine strain appeared in or after 2017 (
