<p>We inferred the relative genetic diversities of all eight available genomic segments of A/H1N1pdm virus using the GMRF skyride coalescent model. A strong seasonal fluctuation was observed in the relative genetic diversity of A/H1N1pdm virus from 2009 to 2019 with all eight segments showing consistent oscillating patterns (

These results indicate that the A/H1N1pdm virus rapidly adapted to human host and evolved into seasonal influenza under strong bottlenecks between seasons after introduction into human population. Interestingly, higher genetic diversity with greater frequency of oscillation was observed during two periods of 2009–2011, and 2017–2019; in contrast, lower genetic diversity with relatively weak seasonal fluctuation maintained from 2012 to 2016 (
