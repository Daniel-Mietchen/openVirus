<p>We obtained 99 seasonal influenza A virus genome sequences, including 66 A/H1N1 and 33 A/H3N2, from children in Shanghai during 2017â€“2019 using NGS. The deduced sequences have been deposited in GISAID database (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary File S1</xref>). All A/H1N1 strains belong to the A/H1N1pdm, including 36 from 2018, and 30 from 2019. The A/H3N2 strains include 13 and 20 from 2018 and 2019, respectively.
