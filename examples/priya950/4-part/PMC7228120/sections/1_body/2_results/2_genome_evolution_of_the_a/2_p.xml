<p>The reassortment events during the evolution of the A/H1N1pdm virus were assessed by comparing topological congruence between eight genomic segments (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Figures S3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">S9</xref>). The HA tanglegram was rather incongruent with those of other genomic segments, indicating that the intra-subtype reassortments were frequent during the evolution of the A/H1N1pdm virus. There are two periods (2009–2010 and 2018–2019) that the virus experienced very frequent reassortments. During 2009–2010, the reassortments were observed between HA and other seven genomic segments, while during 2018–2019, the reassortments occurred more frequently between HA and internal genomic segments, especially PB2, NP, MP, and NS.
