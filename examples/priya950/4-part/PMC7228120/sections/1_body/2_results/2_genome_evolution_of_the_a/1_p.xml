<p>We constructed MCC trees using eight influenza genomic segments to understand the evolution of the A/H1N1pdm in China. The A/H1N1pdm showed an explosive epidemic during 2009–2010, and then exhibited a ladder-like onward phylogeny since 2011 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The A/H1N1pdm strains detected within the same season generally formed a specific lineage. The existing lineage in one season was often replaced by a newly emerging lineage in the following year except that few lineages appeared to extend to the following year possible due to the same winter-spring epidemic season (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, the strains from 2019 were dispersed within the strains from 2018, and did not form independent clade, which is much like the characteristic of the strains during 2009–2010. The regression analysis of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling time revealed a strong clock-like onward evolution of the A/H1N1pdm virus with a well linear accumulation of nucleotide divergence over time (

 <sup>–3</sup> substitutions per site per year for eight genomic segments, with the highest substitution rate in HA gene (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 3.8–4.9 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>) and the lowest rate in PB1 gene (95% HPD: 2.4–3.1 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup>) (
