<p>To see if the migration pattern from East and/or South China to other parts of China still existed when the sequences from outside of China was added, further Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using 825 A/H1N1pdm HA sequences, including 428 sequences from six geographical regions of the world and 397 sequences from China. The sequences from outside of China were randomly and evenly selected from North America, South America, Europe, South-east Asia, Africa, and Australia. Similarly, the sequences in China were also randomly and evenly selected from seven main regions of China. Except for East and South China, other parts of China also had imported viral strains from outside of China (
