<p>The A/H1N1pdm virus was introduced in China in 2009, and caused 793 deaths by the February 2010 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). In response to the pandemic of A/H1N1pdm, routine monitoring of A/H1N1pdm virus was promptly included into a national surveillance system for influenza in China since 2009. However, phylodynamics of the A/H1N1pdm in China is poorly understood. Furthermore, the majority of previous evolutionary analyses of influenza viruses were conducted before 2015, which leaves a big gap on the ongoing evolution of the A/H1N1pdm virus from 2014 to nowadays.
