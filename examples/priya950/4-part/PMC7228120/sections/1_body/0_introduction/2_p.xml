<p>Although influenza virus vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of seasonal influenza virus, error-prone trait of viral RNA polymerase enables the virus to generate new variants to escape the immunity induced by vaccination or prior infections (

In 2015, a study characterized the early phylodynamics of the A/H1N1pdm virus from 2009 to 2014, and demonstrated that the A/H1N1pdm virus experienced an evolution shift from early adaptions to the new human host to subsequent escape from pre-existing host immunity (
