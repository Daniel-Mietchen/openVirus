  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of E11 VP1 genes. (A) ML tree of VP1 genes was constructed including the sixty-six new E11 VP1 gene sequences identified in this study (marked in orange bars on the left). To provide a background of the diversity of E11 lineages in China, the E11 sequences collected from other regions of China (1994–2016) were highlighted with a green bar. Black circles indicate bootstrap support &gt;0.9 at the root node of selected clade. The Guangdong subclade of E11 including the outbreaks strains and retrospectively detected strains between 2017 and 2019 were enlarged in the box (B) twenty-seven clinical cases from five different hospitals (H1–H4) were highlighted with different color dots according to their administration hospitals. The E11 strains sampled from sewage each month from January 2018 to May 2019 are marked with grey dots. (C) Median-joining haplotype network constructed with clinical sequences from H1 to H4 and the ARI outbreak with the same color scheme in (B).</p>
