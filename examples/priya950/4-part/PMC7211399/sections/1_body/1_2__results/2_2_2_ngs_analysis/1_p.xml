<p>The suspected cluster of cases in H1 was first reported to Guangdong Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (GDCDC) on 25 April. Throat swabs, anal swabs and blood samples from twenty-five cases were sent to Guangdong provincial CDC for molecular diagnosis. Due to the respiratory disease-related symptoms like progressive dyspnea and pneumonia presenting in multiple cases, a multiplex RT-PCR Respiratory Pathogen Panel was performed and nine of fifteen (60%) throat swab samples from H1 were positive for enterovirus. To further genotype the enterovirus and to identify other possible pathogens in fatal cases, metatranscriptomic NGS was performed on oropharyngeal and anal swabs from fatal Cases 1 to 4, and on serial blood samples from fatal Case 5. The workflow of the metatranscriptomic sequencing is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>. In total, around 30 million reads (25–49 million reads) were generated per sample, of which 82 to 94 per cent reads had minimum base quality score Q30 (
 <xref rid="veaa029-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After the depletion of reads mapping to the 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome, 2.4 to 49.2 per cent of the sequence reads remained. Notably, the number of reads drastically reduced in the anal swab and blood datasets (86.9–97.5% of reads filtered) but to a lesser extent for oropharyngeal datasets (50.8–68.2% of reads filtered). After the host genome depletion, CCMetagen was used to rapidly identify known microbial species by screening with the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database. The abundances of transcriptionally active microbes were illustrated by investigating the level of their specific transcriptomes. Specific distributions of microbe transcriptomes were found on different types of clinical samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F1">Fig. 1B–D</xref>). As expected, enterococci and streptococci were found as predominant microbes in anal swabs and oral swabs, respectively. Micrococci were commonly identified in all sample types with growth of abundance in time-series samples of Case 5. For viral pathogens, 
 <italic>Picornavirius</italic> sequences were found in all sample types from the three fatal cases, and they were the most abundant in blood samples collected at the last 3 days of Case 5 (
