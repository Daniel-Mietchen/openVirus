<p>Next, 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was performed. The longest assembled sequences recovered from three cases were E11 viruses which belong to enterovirus B genogroup of the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. The full-genome of E11 could be recovered from the oropharyngeal sample of Case 1 (coverage 99.5%) and Case 4 (coverage 99.4%), when aligning contigs to the closely related E11 reference genome KY981558 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistent with the species abundance in short reads, a growth dynamic of E11 was observed in blood samples of Case 5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Few E11 reads (
 <xref rid="veaa029-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were detected in samples collected on Days 0 and 4 of Case 5. However, a sharp increase of E11 read number was observed since Day 8 (176 reads) and the abundance of blood viral load reach peak at Day 10 (38,211 reads) since the sequenced reads number was similar for these samples. The dynamic of E11 viral load in serial blood samples were also confirmed by RT-PCR method (
