<p>A possible cluster of cases occurred in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of hospital 1 (H1), Guangdong, China with the initial case identified on 1 April 2019. Between 1 and 20 April, a total of 120 neonates were admitted to the NICU of H1 and the cluster was associated with 5 deaths and 27 fever cases. Thirty-seven suspected cases, including the three fatal cases from H1, were transferred to four neighboring hospitals (H2â€“H4) during the outbreak without any notification of their possible infectious status.
