<p>The phylogeny based on VP1 sequences suggest that the E11 strains from Guangdong 2017–19 and some strains from other parts of China 2016 formed an endemic cluster (highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly showed some short contigs were mapped to other Enterovirus B genotypes suggesting possible recombination. To characterize these strains at genome level, we performed whole genome sequencing on thirty-two E11 strains from the 2019 outbreak, sporadic infections and sewage samples. Analyses by using Simplot suggested that two possible recombination events occurred with bootstrap values over 70 per cent. The first was identified between Guangdong E11 strains and Echovirus 14 (KP289441) in the region ‘2A-2B’ and EVB106 and the second was observed between Guangdong E11 strains and EVB106 (KX171337) in ‘3B-3’UTR’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) To further investigate the phylogenetic relationship among E11 and other enterovirus B genotypes, we constructed three datasets including the ‘5’UTR-2A, 2B-3B, and 3C-3’UTR’ part of E11 genome and other closely related enterovirus sequences (see detail in Section 4). The phylogeny of ‘5’UTR-2A’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) containing the structure protein coding sequences were consistent with the phylogeny of VP1 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3</xref>. First, the Echo 11 genome sequences from this study (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>30, dark grey dots), together with E11 genome sequences in public database (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>41, light grey dots) clustered together and distinct from other enterovirus genotypes (other color dots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Second, all Guangdong E11 strains isolated in 2017–19 formed an endemic cluster in C1 clade. In contrast, the 
 <italic>2B-3B</italic> and 
 <italic>3C-3’UTR</italic> sequences of E11 were more diversified according to the phylogeny topology. For 
 <italic>2B-3B</italic>, there were two major clades with confident bootstrap value (&gt;70%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). E11 strains from both Clades A and B of the 
 <italic>5’UTR-2A</italic> phylogeny have 
 <italic>2B-3B</italic> sequences that fell into two different clades according to the 
 <italic>2B-3B</italic> phylogeny. Consistent with the Simplot result, there were E6, E14, and CVA9 strains closely related with Guangdong E11 strains based upon 
 <italic>2B-3B</italic> phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). For 
 <italic>3C-3’UTR</italic> sequences, frequent recombination was observed with confident bootstrap support values among E11 strains and other enterovirus genotypes based upon the phylogeny. In particular, in the E11 Guangdong strains, at least ten different enterovirus B genotypes formed sub-clades with E11 Guangdong strains suggesting potential recombination events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).
