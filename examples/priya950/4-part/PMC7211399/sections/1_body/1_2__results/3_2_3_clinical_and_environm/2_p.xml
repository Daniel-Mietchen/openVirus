<p>Since E11 was rarely reported from clinical cases before in mainland China, the local prevalence of E11 was largely unknown based on the current national HFMD surveillance system. To address this question, we retrospectively screened E11 in ARI (acute respiratory infection), HFMDs, and AFP clinical samples collected from Guangdong provincial surveillance system 2017–18. These samples were previously detected as enterovirus positive but were not genotyped. E11 infection was found in 13 of 792 HFMD cases, three of fifty-nine AFP cases and during an ARI outbreak. The ARI outbreak occurred in a kindergarten in 2018 with ten cases developed a fever and presented respiratory infection symptoms like acute pharyngitis. E11 viruses were detected from six to ten cases in their throat swabs including a young teacher (22 years old) and five children whose age ranging from 2 to 5 years old.</p>
