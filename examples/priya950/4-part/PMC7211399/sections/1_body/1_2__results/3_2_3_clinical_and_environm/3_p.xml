<p>Urban sewage can serve as an indicator of enterovirus prevalence in a given population (

 <xref rid="veaa029-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. 2015</xref>). We analyzed sewage samples collected monthly from the treatment plant of Guangzhou city which was 50 km away from H1. Twenty-seven E11 viruses were isolated and sequenced from sewage samples collected between January 2018 and April 2019 (See detail in Section 4). As previously described, the relative viral abundance was estimated by the number of viral isolates recovered from concentrated sewage (

When compared with the average number of E11 isolates between 2009 and 2012, more than five fold of E11 isolate numbers were observed in the winter peak of 2018 (December) and the summer peak of 2019 (May) suggesting a possible increase of viral prevalence in the local population (
