<p>The molecular phylogeny also provided clues on the transmission chains of viruses. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, two small clusters were formed by sequences from H1 and an ARI infection in a kindergarten. For the outbreaks in H1, the initial case was the fatal Case 1 sampled on 1 April (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Nine other E11 cases were sampled between 9 and 25 April, and have identical VP1 gene sequences or 2 and 3 nt synonymous changes from the sequences of the initial patient. Besides the nosocomial outbreak identified in H1, a cluster infection was also observed in cases from an ARI outbreak in October 2018 with sequences from a teacher and three children phylogenetically clustered and identical. From the phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>), we also noticed there were two cases from H1 having the viral sequencing out of the outbreak cluster suggesting these cases were not likely caused by the nosocomial outbreak strain. In other words, twelve E11 infections in H1 were likely caused by three different E11 strains highlighting the complexity of E11 circulation in Guangdong. During the first outbreak, thirty-seven cases from H1 were transferred to H2–H4 and five additional E11 positive cases were identified from these hospitals. This raised a question on the viral transmissions among hospitals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these five cases were scattered and distinct from the outbreak strains in H1, suggesting the outbreak strains in H1 most likely did not spread to other hospitals following transfer of the E11 positive cases. However, we also noticed a sporadic infection case from H1 that was closely related to a E11 case in H4 indicating a possible transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa029-F3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). The relationship was more clearly determined by constructing a median-joining haplotype network, which was constructed with twenty-one VP1 sequences from the clinical cases. From the topology, most of the other sample nodes could only be connected by unsampled intermediate hypothetical haplotypes except for the two infection clusters and two closely related cases from H1 to H4. These results highlighted the transmission risk of E11 viruses in young children evidenced by the nosocomial outbreak in H1 and the ARI cluster infection in kindergarten.
