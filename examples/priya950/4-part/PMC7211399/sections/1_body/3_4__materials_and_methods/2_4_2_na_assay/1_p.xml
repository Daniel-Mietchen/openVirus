<p>The NA tests were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2013b</xref>). To define the E11 NA, the outbreak strain (Accession No. MN597939) was used. All NA assays were run in 96-well microplates. Serum samples were diluted two fold from 1:8 to 1:1,024. The antibody titer of the sample was defined as the highest dilution that could inhibit CPE development in 50 per cent of the virus-infected wells. A titer ≥ 8 was considered as seropositive.
