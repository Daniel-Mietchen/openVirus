<p>Multiplex RT-PCR (NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Plate, Luminex, Cat. No. I051C0447) was applied on fifteen throat swab samples from H1 with similar respiratory disease symptoms. For enterovirus positive samples metatranscriptomic analysis was performed to determine the enterovirus genotype and to recovering the enterovirus genome from three fatal cases. E11-specific RT-PCR was used to screen other suspicious samples and for the retrospective surveillance. For metatranscriptomics, total RNAs were extracted from different types of samples by using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 52904), followed by DNase treatment and purification with TURBO DNase (Invitrogen, Cat. No. AM2239) and Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Cat. No. A63987). Both the concentration and the quality of all isolated RNA samples were measured and checked with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and Qubit. Libraries were prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Clontech, Cat. No. 634412) according to the manufacturer’s protocol starting with 10 ng total RNA. Briefly, purified RNA was first fragmented and converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. The ribosome CDNA was depleted by using ZapRv2 (mammalian-specific). The resulting cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA and subjected to end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation. The constructed libraries were amplified using nine to sixteen cycles of PCR. Sequencing of metatranscriptome libraries was conducted using Illumina Novaseq 6000 (150 bp paired-end sequencing of ∼250 bp inserts).</p>
