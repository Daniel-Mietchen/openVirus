<p>For VP1 phylogeny, the E11 VP1 sequences generated in this study were combined with all publicly available VP1 genes sequences in GenBank with known sampling dates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In total, 502 VP1 gene sequences were included in the phylogenetic analysis, including the 54 sequences generated in this study. Maximum-likelihood (ML) trees were estimated for VP1 genes in RaxML (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B29" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis 2014</xref>). Median-joining haplotype network of clinical cases was constructed by using Popart (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bandelt, Forster, and Rohl 1999</xref>). Potential intertypic and intratypic recombination was analyzed using the SimPlot 3.5.1 program (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B23" ref-type="bibr">Lole et al. 1999</xref>) with a 500-nt window moving in 40-nt steps and Jukes–Cantor correction. To investigate the recombination relationship among E11 and other enterovirus genotypes, the E11 genome was spliced at the suggested recombination break points. Blast searches were performed by using three different parts of E11 genome sequences (
 <italic>5’UTR-2A</italic>, 
 <italic>2A-2B</italic>, 
 <italic>3B-3’UTR</italic>), separately. The closely related enterovirus genome sequences were selected and three datasets were built for different parts of genome. ML trees were estimated for two datasets separately in RaxML (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B29" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>). Phylogenetic trees were annotated and visualized with ggtree (
