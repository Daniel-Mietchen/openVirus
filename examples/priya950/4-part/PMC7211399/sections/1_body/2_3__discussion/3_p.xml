<p>E11 has rarely been reported from clinics before in mainland China, and its prevalence and genetic distribution in most parts of the world are largely unknown. However, epidemic activity of E11 has been observed in the USA between 1970 and 2005 (Khetsuriani et al. 2006). We found evidence of widespread circulation and increasing prevalence in local sewage was observed in the years 2018–19. Moreover, the seroprevalence of E11 in young children (3–5 years old) is comparable with that of known epidemic enterovirus genotypes EVA71 and CVA16 in the local population (

According to the phylogenetic result, E11 strains from China (1996–2019) display a great genetic diversity. Notably, Clade C viruses were rarely detected in China before 2016 but became the dominant subgenotype of E11 in Guangdong, China 2016–19. Whether the emerging Guangdong E11-like strains are also dominant elsewhere is still elusive due to the lack of E11 sequences from public database after 2016. Frequent recombination evens are observed between E11 Guangdong strains and other enterovirus B genotypes through the

Based on the current public data, it is more likely that these enterovirus genotypes adapt gene fragments from E11 since majority strains in the clade are Guangdong E11 viruses. The recombination result also highlights the prevalence of Guangdong E11 strains.
