<p>In April 2019, a potential nosocomial infection was reported from a neonatal department in Guangdong, China (

The infection cluster was associated with five deaths, which tested positive for enteroviruses by Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the enteroviruses and investigate the other potential pathogen(s) in fatal cases. Echovirus 11 (E11) was identified as the causative viral pathogen. Clinical and environmental surveillances were performed to understand the hidden circulation and genetic diversity of E11 viruses in the local population. Finally, phylogenetic analysis was used to trace the possible source(s) of the virus, to identify transmission chains, and to determine recombination events of the viruses by incorporating sequences from the current outbreaks, from retrospective surveillance, and from public databases.
