<p id="par0040">The sputum specimens were collected and stored in a swab storage solution (COPAN, Italy) and stored at −80 °C. The nucleic acid was extracted using a beads viral DNA/RNA extraction kit (TIANLONG, China) and NP968 nucleic acid extractor (TIANLONG, China). Respiratory viruses were detected using an AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Negativecontrols (DEPC-treated water) were included in each analytical procedure. Fourteen respiratory viruses including influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza viruses 1–3 (PIV1-3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, human metapneumovirus (MPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), bocavirus (BOV), and adenovirus (ADV) were measured. All the above procedures were followed the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
