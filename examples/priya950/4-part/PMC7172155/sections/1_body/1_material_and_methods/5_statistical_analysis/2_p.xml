<p id="par0050">Data were analyzed by SPSS 19.0. Categorical variables were summarized and compared by χ
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test, the comparisons between the two groups were made by using the Bonferroni test level adjustment method. Continuous variables with normal distributions were used mean ± standard deviation(SD) to describe and compare using multiple variance of multiple samples. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to describe non-normal distribution of continuous variables, with comparisons based on the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test for significance of the differences among more than two groups and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for significance of the differences between two groups.
