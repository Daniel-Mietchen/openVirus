<p id="par0025">Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The severity of the disease can be affected by various factors including age, immune status of the host, and the single or mixed infection. The etiology of CAP is essential because most respiratory illnesses lead to similar clinical presentations. Currently, the ambiguous of etiology and lack of a microbiological diagnosis in CAP impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy [

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although approximately 200 million cases of viral CAP occur every year, the incidence of viral pneumonia still has been underestimated. In hospital, bacteria remain the first consideration in pulmonary infections, and antibiotic therapy is still the cornerstone of the majority of CAP.
