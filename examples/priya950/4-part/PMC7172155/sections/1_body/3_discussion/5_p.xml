During an influenza epidemic season, a high percentage of samples from CAP patients contained at least one virus, and dual infections were very common [

The respiratory virus other than influenza accounted for 63.16% viral CAP in our study, revealing that respiratory viruses can be co-circulating even during the highest epidemic peaks of influenza that showed a seasonal distribution. Bacterial or fungal infections secondary to influenza viral infections were common [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], though we could not exclude that the increasing co-infections CAP was due to secondary viral infection. As the clinical signs and symptoms overlapped between influenza and non-influenza viruses, pathogen-directed therapy is difficult if only based on clinical symptoms. Studies have shown that delayed antiviral treatment is associated with high risk of progression to severe disease required ICU admission or prolonged hospital stay, and even causing death [
