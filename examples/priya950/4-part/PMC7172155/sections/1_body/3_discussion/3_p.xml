Even there was a severe influenza outbreak during our study, other respiratory viral infections were more than influenza infection (63.16% vs. 36.84%). In all pathogens that cause CAP, bacteria occupied the majority of pathogens, and the most common bacterium was 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Our results was not in keeping with the previous studies, in which the most frequently identified pathogens were 
 <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (29%), 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (20%), 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (19%) and 
 <italic>H. influenza</italic> (11%), respectively [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is an important pathogen of nosocomial infections, we often isolated it from infectious patients who is first admitted to the hospital, indicating that A. baumannii has a certain popularity in this area. Most community-acquired cases of 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pneumonia are from tropical or subtropical countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In Thailand, severe CAP is caused by 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, and its mortality is 10 times higher than hospital-acquired 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pneumonia [

In another aspect, most of our patients had underlying diseases, we could not exclude the possibility that patients had the bacterial infection in last hospital admission. The pathogen remains in the respiratory tract, causing clinical symptoms when the body's immunity is reduced. The outbreak of 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection is also associated with multidrug resistance, and carbapenems have been considered to be a major factor in resistance to multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, the mortality of carbapenem-resistant 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pneumonia patients is higher than that of carbapenem-sensitive 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pneumonia patients [
