<p id="par0095">Pathogen-directed therapy avoids unnecessary antibiotic or antiviral use, facilitating more timely and hence more effective use of drugs, help prevent secondary spread of infection, all of which shorten hospital stays and have a major impact on patient management and disease prognosis [

 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. Accurate and rapid etiologic diagnosis is crucial to pathogen-directed therapy. To date, the gold standard for CAP diagnosis is still based on the radiographic findings [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The radiological findings of multilobar infiltration or pleural effusion generally indicate greater severity [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although etiological studies have been performed, current microbial diagnostic tests frequently do not allow clinicians to rule out bacterial infection with certainty [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Obtaining an qualified sample may be a challenge as specimens were easily contaminated by the bacteria located in upper airways [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For increasing the detection rate of pathogens, esp. for infection occurred in the lower respiratory tract, alveolar lavage fluid may be better in reflecting infectious status than the sputum. However, alveolar lavage fluids require semi-invasive surgery, which is certainly not routine in non-intubated patients, esp. to children [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under this condition, taking sputum as the sample is more practical. Therefore, the relevant CAP guidelines recommend sputum examinations for patients with moderate to severe CAP. In this study, a high microbial yield can be achieved when real time PCR assays plus the conventional diagnostic methods, such as bacterial cultures [

 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The single-plex real time PCR assay were exploited for detecting 14 respiratory viruses, which could improve diagnostic efficacy, particularly in diagnosing respiratory viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Etiologic diagnosis in the CAP patients reached 63.08%, we still had 36.92% CAP patients without clearly microorganisms diagnose. For patients with comorbidities, the use of antibiotics prior to sampling may obscure a potential bacterial detection [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that etiology remains unknown in approximately one-half of the cases [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], indicating that establishment of a precise pathogen diagnosis for CAP patients is challenging. Better diagnostic methods are warranted to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP, which will clarify if these viral infections cause CAP on their own or merely predispose the patient to bacterial co-infections [
