<p id="par0115">The microbiomeâ€™s characterization and diversity are closely linked to the host status, and the host immune response may play a determining role in the infectious exacerbation of CAP. The intrinsic complexity of the host-microbiome relationship currently limits the clinical indications of microbiome analysis [
