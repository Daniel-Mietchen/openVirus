<p id="p0260">The WHO is encouraged to provide a more balanced view of reassortment, emphasizing that reassortment between RVFV LAVs and wild-type strains have been rarely documented compared to other vaccines, with no indication that reassortant events would result in novel strains with enhanced pathogenicity or transmission potential. Despite use of RVF LAVs in multiple epizootics, clear-cut evidence for reassortment has not been observed by genomic analysis of multiple strains. Moreover, reassortment between an LAV and a wild-type virus is unlikely to result in a virus with virulence characteristics higher than the wild-type virus causing the coinfection.</p>
