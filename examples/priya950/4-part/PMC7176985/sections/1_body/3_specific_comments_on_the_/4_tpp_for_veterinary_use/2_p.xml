 <underline>Safety/Reactogenicity:</underline> We disagree that the target profile for veterinary vaccines should be less restrictive with respect to reassortment than for human vaccines. The risk of co-infection and reassortment in ruminants (the viremic host species that amplify circulation of RVFV) is certainly greater than in humans due to their higher exposure to mosquito vectors, high viremia, inapparent infection in adults favoring vaccination of infected animals, and the cross-contaminating needle practices..
