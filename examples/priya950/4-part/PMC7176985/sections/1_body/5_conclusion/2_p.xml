<p id="p0330">LAVs have significant advantages over other vaccine designs, including inactivated, subunit and single-cycle vectored vaccines, since they induce rapid onset of immunity after a single dose, and durable protection

An important factor limiting reassortment that distinguishes RVF LAVs from other LAVs is that the wild-type field-virus has relatively low genetic diversity, allowing vaccines to contain only a single virus type, whereas other LAVs, exemplified by bluetongue and African horsesickness, must be polyvalent and contain mixtures of multiple viruses and serotypes to provide adequate protection against a much wider antigenic diversity, a feature that promotes the potential for genetic reassortment. The safety of any new RVFV vaccine must be determined in suitably powered trials for licensure and monitored thereafter by post-marketing surveillance. Theoretical safety risks, such as that posed by reassortment, can be addressed through rational vaccine design, redundant attenuating markers, and thoughtful experimental studies. The possibility of recombination is a basic theoretical attribute of any replicating vaccine, and likewise among those with segmented genomes reassortment is a basic attribute of replicating vaccines; however, these theoretical risks should not be

Rather, new vaccines should be evaluated using benefit:risk criteria in the context of the natural disease and balance the needs for rapid-onset and durable protection against theoretical impacts of reassortment or recombination. The benefits of a LAV for prevention and control of RVF outbreaks clearly outweigh the theoretical risk of reassortment, which has not been demonstrated to be a safety problem despite marketing widespread field-use of two RVFV LAVs, and in preclinical studies of several others in development.
