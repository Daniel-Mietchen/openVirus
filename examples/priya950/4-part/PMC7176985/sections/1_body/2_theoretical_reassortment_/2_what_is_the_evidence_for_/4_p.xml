<p id="p0155">One important conclusion of this search for examples of recombination is that they have rarely occurred, and have had limited consequences, considering the long history of use of LAVs (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, genomic recombination of LAVs and wild-type viruses has actually occurred more frequently with single-stranded RNA viruses than with viruses having segmented genomes. LAVs against segmented viruses have been developed or commercialized for veterinary use (RVFV, bluetongue

Unlike RVFV which consists of a single virus, some LAVs, such as African horsesickness and bluetongue are formulated with multiple distinct serotype viruses; reassortment between vaccine strains has been associated with either reversion to virulence or no phenotypic change
