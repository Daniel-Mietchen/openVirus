<p id="p0225">The risk of reassortment of the SNS vaccine with wild-type virus was also reviewed by Grobelaar et al. 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The authors point to the methods used in vaccinating livestock, where automatic syringes are used with intermittent needle changes, affording a means of iatrogenic virus transfer that would enhance the chances of coinfection with vaccine (SNS) and wild-type RVFV. Despite this, sequencing studies of multiple strains from ruminants during outbreaks where the vaccine was widely used has not revealed clear evidence for reassortment
