<p id="p0245">Aside from iatrogenic needle-syringe transmission between ruminants noted above, the settings in which reassortment are limited to: (1) co-infection with a wild-type strain in the vector mosquito, which could acquire blood meals by interrupted feeding on ruminants infected with vaccine and wild-type viruses, or could have been infected with wild-type virus in a previous gonotrophic cycle; (2) co-infection in a vaccinated ruminant or human by a mosquito infected with wild-type virus or by direct contact with infected ruminant blood or tissues; or (3) vaccination of a ruminant or human during acute infection with wild-type virus. If, in these circumstances, reassortment occurred it would be of no consequence (
