 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, reassortments between LAVs and wild-type virus would be unlikely to produce novel viruses with pathogenicity, host range, or transmission potential greater than the wild-type virus responsible for co-infection. LAVs in development (described above) all have documented mechanisms of attenuation, and some have redundant deletions, polygenic mutations, or genetic rearrangements that by design mitigate risks accompanying theoretical reassortment events.
