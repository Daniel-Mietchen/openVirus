<p id="p0240">Each vaccine candidate has a specific set of risks based on its mechanism of attenuation (Condit et al. 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> point #5). For MP-12 and MP-12-NSm-del, which have attenuating mutations on all three genome segments, attenuation would remain after substitution of a wild-type genome segment; conversely acquisition of an MP-12 or MP-12-NSm-del genome segment by wild-type virus would be attenuating, as shown experimentally 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For Clone 13 reassortment with the S segment from a wild-type strain would reconstitute virulence but the single animal in which coinfection occurred would have an outcome no worse than the original wild-type infection. Theoretically the reassorted (now fully wild-type) virus could be transmitted but would have no relevance in an area where wild-type strains were already circulating. Similarly, the DD-Vax and RVFV-4s vaccines have polygenic deletions or genome rearrangements that should reduce any hypothetical risk of reversion to virulence through reassortment with a wild-type virus.
