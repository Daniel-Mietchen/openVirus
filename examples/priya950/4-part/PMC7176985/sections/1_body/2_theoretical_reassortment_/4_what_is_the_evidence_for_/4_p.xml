<p id="p0215">Unlike orbiviruses such as bluetongue and African horsesickness LAVs that have more complex 10-segmented genomes and multiple serotypes, requiring that vaccines consist of mixtures of multiple co-infecting viruses that can reassort in vivo, RVF LAV consists of a single virus that cannot reassort unless simultaneous coinfection occurs with an exogenous virus.</p>
