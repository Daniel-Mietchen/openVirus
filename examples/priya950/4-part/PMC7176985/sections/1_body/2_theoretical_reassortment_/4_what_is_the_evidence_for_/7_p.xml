<p id="p0230">In the setting of an RVF epizootic (and potential spill-over to humans), risks associated with LAV have been deemed acceptable. Such risks would be even more acceptable in the case of LAVs with lower pathogenicity (for both livestock and humans) than the SNS and with molecular constraints limiting viremia and vector infection. We see no empirical evidence to support rigid constraints related to reassortment as posited in the WHO TPP. It is noteworthy that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is currently funding the manufacturing and Phase I/II clinical evaluation of two LAV (DDVax™ and the RVFV-4 s vaccine).</p>
