For veterinary vaccines, needles should be changed between animals or alternate devices used to deliver vaccines. For human immunization, it is general practice to exclude patients who are acutely ill until they are recovered, and this would apply to new vaccines, including LAVs and defective vector vaccines. These factors could be considered in the WHO TPP, without stipulations that exclude use of vaccines during epizootics or epidemics.</p>
