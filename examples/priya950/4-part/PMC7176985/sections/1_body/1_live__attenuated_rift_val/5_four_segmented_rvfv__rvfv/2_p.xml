<p id="p0140">The most recently developed live-attenuated RVF vaccine was created by splitting the M genome segment into two M-type segments 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The resulting vaccine virus depends on the co-packaging of 4, instead of the naturally occurring 3 genome segments and lacks the NSs gene. The split M genome segment and the NSs deletion were shown to independently render the virus non-virulent. The resulting vaccine was shown to be safe for mice, young lambs, pregnant sheep, goats, cattle and marmosets and to provide sterilizing immunity after a single vaccination of mice, sheep, goats and cattle. (manuscript in preparation and 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>). Complete absence of viremia in all evaluated species, even after application of an overdose, underscores that risks of genetic reassortment or transmission of the vaccine via mosquitoes are negligible. The vaccine is being developed by Central Veterinary Institute, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, The Netherlands, with the goal of human testing.
