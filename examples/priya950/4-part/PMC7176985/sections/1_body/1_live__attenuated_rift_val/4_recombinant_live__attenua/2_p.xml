<p id="p0135">Bird et al. used reverse genetics to develop a recombinant RVFV, containing the deletion of the NSs gene alone (ΔNSs rRVFV) or the NSs/NSm genes in combination, ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV (DDVax™), which contains complete gene deletions of the two known virulence factors, the NSs and NSm genes 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. NSs and NSm are not required in cell culture for efficient virus replication, assembly, or maturation. Both candidates were highly attenuated, immunogenic, and efficacious in a rat model and in sheep with no detectable post-vaccination viremia. The vaccine was not teratogenic in pregnant sheep. Both vaccines were immunogenic and protective in non-human primates 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The attenuating deletions in two RNA segments reduces the likelihood of reversion to virulence by reassortment with wild-type virus. The NSm deletion alone renders the vaccine incapable of infecting mosquitoes in experimental studies 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The vaccine was originally constructed by the Centers for Disease Control and is now being developed by Colorado State University and the University of California, Davis with the goal of human testing.
