<p id="p0085">The benefits of a LAV for prevention and control of RVF outbreaks clearly outweigh the theoretical risk of reassortment, which has not been demonstrated to be a safety problem despite marketing of two RVFV LAVs and several others in development. Safety of new vaccines must be determined in suitably powered trials for licensure and thereafter by post-marketing surveillance. Theoretical safety risks, such as that posed by reassortment, can be addressed through vaccine design and experimental studies. However, since the possibility of recombination is a basic attribute of any replicating vaccine virus, and reassortment is a basic attribute of replicating vaccine viruses with segmented genomes, theoretical risks should not be
