<p id="p0080">In support of these criteria, the WHO Background section states that reassortment of the segmented genome of RVF LAVs is possible on theoretical grounds. As evidence of a safety concern, a single example is cited: “Specifically, reassortment in a man who was co-infected with a wild-type strain and a live-attenuated vaccine strain has been reported 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.” An alternative source indicates the patient was female and had a significant illness from which she fully recovered (R. Swanepoel, pers. comm., 2019). However, the sequence of the isolate (SA184/10) from the patient has been re-evaluated by full genomic sequencing and found not to be a reassortant 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>; the patient likely had a wild-type RVFV infection.
