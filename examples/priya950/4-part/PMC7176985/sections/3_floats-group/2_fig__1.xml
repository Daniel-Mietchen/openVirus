  <p>Genetic reassortment of live attenuated vaccine candidates with wild-type RVFV is unlikely to result in a more virulent or transmissible phenotype. 1. Wild-type virus that obtains an LAV segment(s) would be partially attenuated or retain the original phenotype. 2. LAVs that obtain a wild-type segment(s) would not exceed the original virulence profile of the circulating wild-type parental strain.</p>
