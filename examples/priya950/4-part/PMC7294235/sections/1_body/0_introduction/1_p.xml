However, JEV remains a leading cause of neurological infection in endemic countries, and the Joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) surveillance data do not substantiate the improvements cited in the past ten years, with sustained numbers of reported patients over this period, see
