 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr">Preziuso et al., 2018</xref>). This most likely represents the globally increased movement, via transportation, of animals and goods. Increased pig farming in urban areas of Asian countries also impacts on virus amplification. Finally, the live attenuated vaccine in widespread use is based on JEV genotype 3, even though in recent decades, there has been large-scale genotype displacement to genotype 1 (
