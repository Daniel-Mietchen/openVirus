<p id="par0120">Similarly, in a study testing for West Nile virus and JEV, 18 patientsâ€™ data remained equivocal due to high levels of antigenic cross-reactivity between these viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Anukumar et al., 2014b</xref>). The neutralization test may only be strictly applicable as the gold-standard for vaccine efficacy studies when a baseline serum sample is compared with a convalescent sample taken at a fixed interval 1-3 months later. To confirm acute JEV, neutralization is an imperfect gold standard. Severe constraints on being able to arrange for sample testing by neutralization, and the results being interpretable without cross-reactive positivity due to other flaviviruses (which is relatively rare in JEV endemic areas), impede 'neutralization confirmation.' The neutralization titers obtained may be affected by the particular strain of challenge virus utilized (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2008</xref>). A final issue with the neutralization test is the inability to detect non-neutralizing antibodies, thus potentially reducing the analytical sensitivity (
