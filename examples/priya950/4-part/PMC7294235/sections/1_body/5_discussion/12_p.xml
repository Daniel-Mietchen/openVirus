<p id="par0165">In summary, while the diagnosis of JE has been possible for many years, it still requires specialized high-containment laboratories and appropriately trained scientists. Therefore, it cannot be reliably carried out in many resource-limited regions where JEV is endemic/epidemic. A fundamental pre-requisite in the public health strategy for the control of JE is lacking, that of a reliable and simple diagnostic procedure that can be adapted for point-of-care tests, and readily available for use throughout JEV endemic regions of the world. Improved diagnostic capabilities throughout JEV affected areas will not only benefit individual patients (through accurate diagnosis) but lead to higher quality surveillance data and a better understanding of the distribution of JE risk, enabling improved targeting and evaluation of interventions. The lack of diagnostic capabilities for JE is a barrier to understanding the actual disease burden and the impact of public health strategies.</p>
