<p id="par0135">Diagnosis by the detection of the viral genome by DNA amplification generated by RT-PCR is a valuable addition to diagnostic procedures for RNA viruses. The test has high analytical sensitivity, is very specific, and can provide additional information that can be exploited to understand the molecular epidemiology of the detected virus. Nonetheless, JE cases are rarely confirmed (1.7% in this review) using RT-PCR technology, although this will undoubtedly increase in usage as point-of-care and automated methods are developed. Poor reporting of the techniques used in many publications hinders our ability to make comparisons of the efficacy of different methods (see 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Bharucha et al. (2018a</xref>). There does appear to be higher analytical sensitivity in studies that used nested and hemi-nested techniques as compared to those using single RT-PCR; however, these techniques are notoriously prone to contamination, causing false-positive results. It is also recognized that the sensitivity of nucleic acid (and protein) detection will continue to increase as technology improves (

 <xref rid="bib0870" ref-type="bibr">Zang et al., 2019</xref>). Evidence to suggest that this will be the case arises from the high cycle threshold (Ct) of patients that are confirmed, and the fact that blood donor transmission has been seen in WNV patients who were negative by RT-qPCR tests (

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Bharucha et al., 2018b</xref>). There have now been two cases of JE, confirmed by RT-PCR, that were first identified by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) (

 <xref rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr">Mai et al., 2017</xref>); the first detection of JEV RNA in human urine, and JEV detection in serum from an African patient with a co-YFV infection. The latter was not confirmed by an orthogonal method and remains questionable. Nonetheless, unbiased mNGS technology (see below), application, and reporting will continue to improve, and could potentially detect JEV in new locations (
