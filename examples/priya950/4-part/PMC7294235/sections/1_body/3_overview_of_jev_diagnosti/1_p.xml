<p id="par0065">The first isolation of JEV was in 1934 when Hayashi demonstrated that a filterable agent inoculated into monkeys produced encephalitis (
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi, 1933</xref>). The experiment was performed using homogenized brain obtained at post-mortem from a fatally-infected child who presented with encephalitis in Tokyo during the 1924 epidemic. Early studies relied on clinicopathological correlates in infected humans, when compared with those observed following animal inoculation of post-mortem samples. Subsequently, hamster, porcine, and human cell culture systems were developed, which revealed cytopathic effects when inoculated with JEV-infectious specimens (

Nonetheless, assays involving direct virus detection are minimally useful for the diagnosis of JE as the level of viremia is usually low, and the virus is detectable only briefly early in the infection (
