<p id="par0095">IgM ELISA: One hundred and sixty-three (80%) studies reported the results of tests using IgM MAC-ELISA methods. Notably, 115 of these studies tested both CSF and serum samples and presented results for the different body fluids separately. One hundred and twenty-two (74%) reported the method, of which 66 (40%) used in-house methods, and 33 (20%) used commercial kits. The primary in-house methods involved those described by

There was minimal reporting of quality control measures such as control specimens and repeat testing of positives; 46 (28%) reported following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. In total, 7,584 JE patients (38%) were diagnosed by MAC-ELISA in serum and/or CSF, i.e., results for the different body fluids were not reported separately, with 3,668 (18%) positive in CSF alone. Ninety-one (56%) studies using MAC-ELISA also reported testing for dengue virus infection to confirm specificity for JEV, i.e., they were not cross-reactive with dengue viruses.
