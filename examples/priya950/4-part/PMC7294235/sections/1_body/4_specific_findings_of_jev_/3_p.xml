<p id="par0090">Studies followed different algorithms for including neutralization in patient testing, but it was primarily performed to confirm equivocal cases in other serological tests. Acute and/or follow-up serum and/or CSF were tested. For studies that did report individual results, confirmation was rarely achieved as there was either insufficient serum, failure to detect a four-fold rise of antibody titer in the convalescent serum, or cross-reactivity was detected with related viruses included as controls in the tests.</p>
