        <span class="abst" title="The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly with the use of multiplex real-time technique with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. The aim of this study was to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu species between hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital (Iran) between two flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Different respiratory specimens were collected from 540 patients from a period of December 2016 to May 2018 and were sent to the laboratory for molecular diagnosis. RNAs were extracted and subsequently, a multiplex real time PCR identifying flu A, flu B and typing flu A (H1N1) was carried out. The mean age of patients was 47.54±23.96. 216 (40%) and 321 (60%) of subjects were male and female, respectively. 219 out of 540 (40.5%) were positive for influenza infection including flu A (n=97, 44.3%), flu A (H1N1) (n=45, 20.7%) and flu B (n=77, 35%). Flu A was the dominant species on 2016-2017 and flu B was the major species on 2017-2018. Flu A (H1N1) was comparable in both time periods. Flu infections were most frequently diagnosed in age groups 21-40. Flu-positive patients suffered more from body pain and sore throat than flunegative patients with significant statistical difference (P values &lt;0.001). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter for flu-positive patients (P value = 0.016). Application of multiplex real time PCR could facilitate the influenza diagnosis in a short period of time, benefiting patients from exclusion of bacterial infections and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections, suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients.">

Lack of a microbiological diagnosis impairs precision treatment in CAP. METHODS:Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients, viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria. RESULTS:Among the 195 patients, there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections, 20 (10.26%) yeast infections, 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections, 8 (4.10%) viral-yeast co-infections, and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were Acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas the most common virus was influenza A. CONCLUSIONS:Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms frequently co-circulated during the epidemic peaks of influenza, which easily being ignored in CAP therapy. In patients with bacterial and viral co-infections, identifying the etiologic agent is crucial for patient's therapy.">

While all HAs bind sialic acids, human influenza targets terminal α2,6 sialic acids and avian influenza targets α2,3 sialic acids. For interspecies transmission (zoonosis), HA must mutate to adapt to these differences. Here, multivalent gold nanoparticles bearing either α2,6- or α2,3-sialyllactosamine have been developed to interrogate a panel of HAs from pathogenic human, low pathogenic avian, and other species' influenza. This method exploits the benefits of multivalent glycan presentation compared to monovalent presentation to increase affinity and investigate how multivalency affects selectivity. Using a library-orientated approach, parameters including polymer coating and core diameter were optimized for maximal binding and specificity were probed using galactosylated particles and a panel of biophysical techniques [ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and biolayer interferometry]. The optimized particles were then functionalized with sialyllactosamine and their binding analyzed against a panel of HAs derived from pathogenic influenza strains including low pathogenic avian strains. This showed significant specificity crossover, which is not observed in monovalent formats, with binding of avian HAs to human sialic acids and vice versa in agreement with alternate assay formats. These results demonstrate that precise multivalent presentation is essential to dissect the interactions of HAs and may aid the discovery of tools for disease and zoonosis transmission.">

We demonstrate the occurrence of recurrent behavior in the infected number [more than one peak in a season], which is observed in data, in our simulations for populations consisting of cohorts with strong intra- and weak inter-cohort transmissibility. We examine the dependence of the results on epidemiological and population characteristics by investigating their dependence on a range of parameter values.

The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging pathogen of ruminants, as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China. METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes, and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients. RESULTS:In total, 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders, multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.824, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.279-6.414; P &lt;  0.001), admittance to intensive care unit (aOR: 1.630, 95% CI: 1.074-2.473, P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (aOR: 2.427, 95% CI: 1.568-3.756, P &lt;  0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637, 95% CI: 1.134-6.131, P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients. CONCLUSIONS:The severity of illness and clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients are more severe than FluB-p. This highlights the importance of identifying the virus strain during the management of severe influenza.">

We review the current LAVs in use and in development, and conclude that there is no evidence that reassortment between LAVs and wild-type RVFV has occurred during field use, that such a reassortment event if it occurred would have no untoward consequence, and that the TPPs should be revised to provide a more balanced assessment of the benefits versus the theoretical risks of reassortment.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus, those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections, with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. METHODS:To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. RESULTS:The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. CONCLUSIONS:The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zika virus (ZIKV), a vector-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae, continues to spread and remains a significant global public health threat. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antivirals against ZIKV. We investigated the anti-ZIKV ability of three iminosugars with endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase inhibitor (ER-AGI) activity, namely deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), castanospermine, and celgosivir. None of the three iminosugars showed any significant cytotoxicity in Vero or human microglia CHME3 cells when applied for 72 h at concentrations up to 100 μM. Iminosugar treatment of Vero or CHME3 cells prior to ZIKV infection resulted in significant inhibition of ZIKV replication over 48 h. Reduction in ZIKV replication in iminosugar-treated cells was not associated with any significant change in the expression levels of key antiviral genes. Following infection with three different strains of ZIKV, iminosugar-treated Vero or CHME3 cells showed no cell death, whereas vehicle-treated control cells exhibited 50-60% cell death at 72 h post-infection (hpi). While there was no significant difference in apoptosis between iminosugar-treated and control cells, iminosugar-treated cells exhibited a substantial reduction of necrosis at 72 hpi following ZIKV infection. In summary, iminosugars with ER-AGI activity inhibit ZIKV replication and significantly reduce necrosis without altering the antiviral gene expression and apoptosis of infected human cells. The results of this study strongly suggest that iminosugars are promising anti-ZIKV antiviral agents and such warrant further in vivo studies.">

The overall seroprevalence was ≈12% and increased with age, with no statistical difference between male and female participants. In the warm semiarid study sites we detected immunological markers of an outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s in 18% (95% CI 13%-23%) of participants. In tropical savannah sites, we estimated a low rate of endemic transmission, with 2.5% (95% CI 2.0%-3.1%) of population infected by ZIKV annually. These data demonstrate the circulation of ZIKV in Mali and provide evidence of a previously unidentified outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s.">

Here, we review the evidence base on the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal protective measures and environmental hygiene measures in nonhealthcare settings and discuss their potential inclusion in pandemic plans. Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. We similarly found limited evidence on the effectiveness of improved hygiene and environmental cleaning. We identified several major knowledge gaps requiring further research, most fundamentally an improved characterization of the modes of person-to-person transmission.">

In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).">

METHODS:A total of 68 IBVs (61 B/Yamagata/16/88-like [B/Yamagata]-lineage and 7 B/Victoria/2/87-like [B/Victoria]-lineage) were antigenically and genetically characterized by using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and phylogenetic analysis, respectively. The susceptibility of IBVs to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors was assessed by using a fluorescence-based NA inhibition assay. RESULTS:All 61 B/Yamagata-lineage isolates were genetically closely related to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the vaccine strain for these two seasons. Eleven B/Yamagata-lineage isolates tested were antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013 by the HI test. Seven B/Victoria-lineage isolates were genetically closely related to B/Texas/02/2013, the WHO-recommended vaccine strain for the 2017-2018 season; however, they were antigenically distinct from B/Texas/02/2013 with an eightfold or 16-fold difference in HI titer. Of these 7 isolates, 4 possessed a two-amino-acid deletion at positions 162 and 163 in hemagglutinin (HA) and the other 3 had a three-amino-acid deletion at positions 162-164 in HA. Importantly, the variants with the three-amino-acid deletion appeared to be antigenically different from the B/Colorado/06/2017 virus with the two-amino-acid deletion, the vaccine strain for the 2018-2019 season with a fourfold or eightfold difference in HI titer. One B/Yamagata-lineage isolate carrying a G407S mutation in its NA showed a marked reduction in susceptibility to zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir. CONCLUSIONS:These results highlight the need for continued monitoring for the prevalence of the antigenic variant with the three-amino-acid deletion and the variant with reduced NA inhibitor susceptibility.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Sub-Saharan Africa carries the greatest burden of HIV-infection with increasing drug resistance burden, which requires improved patient management and monitoring. Current WHO recommendations suggest transitioning to dolutegravir-based (adults) or raltegravir-based-regimens (neonates) for initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and as a suitable alternative in cases of multi-resistance in resource-limited settings. This review aims at synthesizing the current knowledge on dolutegravir use and integrase resistance-associated mutations found before the wide use of dolutegravir-based regimens. METHODS:This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort, and cross-sectional studies published on dolutegravir use or integrase resistance-associated mutations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Searches will be conducted (from 2007 onwards) in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILAC), Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Hand searching of the reference lists of relevant reviews and trials will be conducted and we will also look for conference abstracts. We will include studies of adults and/or children exposed to integrase inhibitors-based therapies; especially dolutegravir or raltegravir (which is our intervention of interest as compared to other antiretroviral regimens). We will exclude studies of patients with specific co-morbidities such as tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. Primary outcomes will be &quot;the rate of viral suppression&quot; and &quot;the level of drug resistance&quot; on integrase inhibitor-based regimens among patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary outcomes will be &quot;the effect of baseline viremia on viral suppression,&quot; &quot;the effect of treatment duration on viral suppression,&quot; &quot;the proportion of patients with immune recovery,&quot; &quot;the rate of non-adherence,&quot; &quot;rate of adverse events;&quot; &quot;drug resistance according to different integrase inhibitor-based regimens,&quot; and &quot;drug resistance according to viral subtypes/recombinants.&quot; Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess the full texts for eligibility, and extract data. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., age, sex, baseline viremia, CD4 following treatment, treatment duration, and adherence level). DISCUSSION:This review will help to strengthen evidence on the effectiveness of integrase strand transfer inhibitors by contributing to current knowledge on the use of dolutegravir and/or raltegravir (especially for neonates) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results will therefore help in setting-up baseline data for an optimal management of people living with HIV as Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens. Evidence will also support HIV/AIDS programs in identifying gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved long-term care and treatment of people living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.

        <span class="abst" title="Background and Aim:Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an alphavirus that causes encephalitis with a high impact on public health in Latin America. However, only in Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mexico have found antibodies in VEEV in bats, using immunohistochemistry, the sensitivity and specificity are improved; thus, it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts. This study aimed to determine the presence of VEEV in tissues of frugivorous bats. Materials and Methods:A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of Córdoba and Sucre area of the Colombian Caribbean. Two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets, and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified. According to the Ethics Committee of the University of Córdoba, the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at -196°C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV. Results:Of the 286 bats captured, 23 species were identified. In samples of the brain, spleen, and lung of two frugivorous bats (2/286=0.70%) Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium, the presence of VEEV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion:A fragment of the nsP4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified. Two samples were positive (2/286=0.70%) in frugivorous bats; A. planirostris (code GenBank: MG820274) and S. lilium (code GenBank: MG820275). The present study showed the first molecular evidence and cellular evidence (histopathology and immunohistochemistry) of natural VEEV infection in frugivorous bats in Colombia; these bats could be a host of this zoonosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="The genus Flavivirus encompasses several worldwide-distributed arthropod-borne viruses including, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infection with these viruses manifest with symptoms ranging from febrile illness to life- threatening hypotensive shock and encephalitis. Therefore, flaviviruses pose a great risk to public health. Currently, preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any Flavivirus.Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins, used as template for genome replication, it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore, viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles, e.g. exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination.Because RNA molecules are at the center of Flavivirus replication cycle, viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during Flavivirus infection, particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins, however, are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid, NS2A and NS3, during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore, we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ebola epidemics constitute serious public health emergencies. Multiple vaccines are under development to prevent these epidemics and avoid the associated morbidity and mortality. Assessing the potential impact of these vaccines on morbidity and mortality of Ebola is essential for devising prevention strategies. A mean-field compartmental stochastic model was developed for this purpose and validated by simulating the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic. We assessed the impacts of prophylactic vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) both alone and in combination with the vaccination of the general population (entire susceptible population other than HCW). The model simulated 8,706 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 478-21,942) cases and 3,575 (95%CI: 179-9,031) deaths in Sierra Leone, in line with WHO-reported statistics for the 2014 epidemic (8,704 cases and 3,587 deaths). Relative to this base case, the model then estimated that prophylactic vaccination of only 10% of HCW will avert 12% (95% CI: 6%-14%) of overall cases and deaths, while vaccination of 30% of HCW will avert 34% of overall cases (95% CI: 30%-64%) and deaths (95% CI: 30%-65%). Prophylactic vaccination of 1% and 5% of the general population in addition to vaccinating 30% of HCW was estimated to result in reduction in cases by 44% (95% CI: 39%-61%) and 72% (95% CI: 68%-84%) respectively, and deaths by 45% (95% CI: 40%-61%) and 74% (95% CI: 70%-85%) respectively. Prophylactic vaccination of even small proportions of HCW is estimated to significantly reduce incidence of Ebola and associated mortality. The effect is greatly enhanced by the additional vaccination even of small percentages of the general population. These findings could be used to inform the planning of prevention strategies.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus capable of causing neurological abnormalities, is a recognised human pathogen, for which a vaccine is required. As ZIKV antibodies can mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection, a ZIKV vaccine must not only protect against ZIKV but must also not sensitise vaccinees to severe dengue. METHODS:The N-terminal 80% of ZIKV envelope protein (80E) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and its capacity to self-assemble into particulate structures evaluated using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Antigenic integrity of the 80E protein was evaluated using ZIKV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were assessed in BALB/c and C57BL/6 Stat2-/- mice, respectively. Its capacity to enhance DENV and ZIKV infection was assessed in AG129 and C57BL/6 Stat2-/- mice, respectively. FINDINGS:ZIKV-80E protein self-assembled into discrete nanoparticles (NPs), which preserved the antigenic integrity of neutralising epitopes on E domain III (EDIII) and elicited potent ZIKV-neutralising antibodies predominantly against this domain in BALB/c mice. These antibodies conferred statistically significant protection in vivo (p = 0.01, Mantel-Cox test), and did not exacerbate sub-lethal DENV-2 or ZIKV challenges in vivo. INTERPRETATION:Yeast-expressed ZIKV-80E, which forms highly immunogenic EDIII-displaying NPs, elicits ZIKV EDIII-specific antibodies capable of offering significant protection in vivo, without the potential risk of ADE upon subsequent DENV-2 or ZIKV infection. This offers a promising vaccine candidate for further development. FUNDING:This study was supported partly by ICGEB, India, and by NIAID, USA.">

One option that warrants evaluation is that of defective genomes; these can potentially parasitize resources from the wild-type virus and may even be packaged for repeated co-infection cycles. Deletion and copy-back defective genomes have been identified and reported in the literature. As a crude, mixed preparation these were found to have limiting effects on cytopathology. Here we have used synthetic virology to clone and manufacture two deletion defective genomes. These genomes were tested with Ebola virus using in vitro cell culture and shown to inhibit viral replication; however, and against expectations, the defective genomes were not released in biologically significant numbers. We propose that EBOV might have yet unknown mechanisms to prevent parasitisation by defective interfering particles beyond the known mechanism that prevents sequential infection of the same cell. Understanding this mechanism would be necessary in any development of a defective interfering particle-based therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.">

Considerable HCV diversity was identified, with different strains predominating in each region of the country. Overall, the most common strain was genotype 3a (39.0%), with genotypes 1a (26.9%), 1b (3.0%), 1c (0.2%), 3b (20.7%), 3i (2.0%), 4a (0.2%), 4d (1.0%), 6 (1.8%), 6n (4.8%), 6 v (0.2%) and one unclassifiable recombinant specimen (0.2%) also identified. The majority of the HIV specimens were subtype C (96.7%), although subtype A (0.4%), CRF01_AE (0.4%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.5%) were also detected. Notably, the geographical restriction of HIV subtype A and CRF01_AE, and HCV genotypes 4 and 6 to specific sites suggests distinct novel introductions of HIV and HCV into PWID populations, potentially via drug trafficking routes from neighboring countries where these strains are common.">

        <span class="abst" title="Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) control is mainly based on wide vaccine administration. Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third &quot;ghost&quot; deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.">

        <span class="abst" title="Orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) are an increasing threat to human health due to the growing population of OPXV-naive individuals after the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination. Antiviral drugs that are effective as postexposure treatments against variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) or other OPXVs are critical in the event of an OPXV outbreak or exposure. The only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat smallpox, Tecovirimat (ST-246), exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting extracellular virus (EV) formation, thereby preventing cell-cell and long-distance spread. We and others have previously demonstrated that host Golgi-associated retrograde proteins play an important role in monkeypox virus (MPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV) EV formation. Inhibition of the retrograde pathway by small molecules such as Retro-2 has been shown to decrease VACV infection in vitro and to a lesser extent in vivo. To identify more potent inhibitors of the retrograde pathway, we screened a large panel of compounds containing a benzodiazepine scaffold like that of Retro-1, against VACV infection. We found that a subset of these compounds displayed better anti-VACV activity, causing a reduction in EV particle formation and viral spread compared to Retro-1. PA104 emerged as the most potent analog, inhibiting 90% viral spread at 1.3 μM with a high selectivity index. In addition, PA104 strongly inhibited two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses, demonstrating its potential benefit for use in combination therapy with ST-246. These data and further characterizations of the specific protein targets and in vivo efficacy of PA104 may have important implications for the design of effective antivirals against OPXV.">

However, the epidemic patterns and genetic variability of HAdV-7 circulating in mainland China have not been well elucidated. In this study, we used Chinese HAdV sentinel surveillance data obtained from 2012-2015 to investigate the clinical features of 122 HAdV-7-positive cases and performed amplification and sequence determination of three capsid genes (penton base, hexon, and fiber) from 69 isolated viruses covering from seven provinces of China. Additionally, we compared with data from representative sequences of 21 strains covering seven more provinces in China and 32 international HAdV-7 strains obtained from GenBank database to determine the phylogenetic, sequence variations, and molecular evolution of HAdV-7. The results indicated that HAdV-7 infection occurred throughout the year, and a high proportion of severe cases (27 cases, 22.1%) exhibited infantile pneumonia. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAdV-7 strains could be divided into two major evolutionary branches, including subtype 1 and subtype 2, and subtype 3 was also formed according to analysis of the penton base gene. Subtypes 1 and 2 co-circulated in China before 2008, and HAdV-7 strains currently circulating in China belonged to subtype 2, which was also the predominant strain circulating worldwide in recent years. Further sequence variation analysis indicated that three genes of HAdV-7 were relatively stable across time and geographic space, particularly for viruses within subtypes, which shared almost the same variation sites. Owing to continuous outbreaks caused by HAdV-7, resulting in increased illness severity and fatality rates in China, the establishment of a national HAdV surveillance system is urgently needed for the development of effective preventive and infection-control interventions for adenovirus respiratory infections in China.">

However, its active components and mode of action remain mostly unknown. In the present study, erucic acid was isolated from Isatis indigotica Fort., and subsequently its underlying mechanism against influenza A virus (IAV) infection was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that erucic acid exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against IAV resulting from reduction of viral polymerase transcription activity. Erucic acid was found to exert inhibitory effects on IAV or viral (v) RNA-induced pro-inflammatory mediators as well as interferons (IFNs). The molecular mechanism by which erucic acid with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties was attributed to inactivation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling. Furthermore, the NF-κB and p38 MAPK inhibitory effect of erucic acid led to diminishing the transcriptional activity of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3), and thereby reducing IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response amplification in IFN-β-sensitized cells. Additionally, IAV- or vRNA-triggered apoptosis of alveolar epithelial A549 cells was prevented by erucic acid. In vivo, erucic acid administration consistently displayed decreased lung viral load and viral antigens expression. Meanwhile, erucic acid markedly reduced CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recruitment, pro-apoptotic signaling, hyperactivity of multiple signaling pathways, and exacerbated immune inflammation in the lung, which resulted in decreased lung injury and mortality in mice with a mouse-adapted A/FM/1/47-MA(H1N1) strain infection. Our findings provided a mechanistic basis for the action of erucic acid against IAV-mediated inflammation and injury, suggesting that erucic acid may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of influenza.">

        <span class="abst" title="Chikungunya disease (CHIKD) is a viral infection caused by an alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and triggers large outbreaks leading to epidemics. Despite the low mortality rate, it is a major public health concern owing to high morbidity in affected individuals. The complete spectrum of this disease can be divided into four phases based on its clinical presentation and immunopathology. When a susceptible individual is bitten by an infected mosquito, the bite triggers inflammatory responses attracting neutrophils and initiating a cascade of events, resulting in the entry of the virus into permissive cells. This phase is termed the pre-acute or the intrinsic incubation phase. The virus utilizes the cellular components of the innate immune system to enter into circulation and reach primary sites of infection such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Also, at this point, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present the viral antigens to the T cells thereby activating and initiating adaptive immune responses. This phase is marked by the exhibition of clinical symptoms such as fever, rashes, arthralgia, and myalgia and is termed the acute phase of the disease. Viremia reaches its peak during this phase, thereby enhancing the antigen-specific host immune response. Simultaneously, T cell-mediated activation of B cells leads to the formation of CHIKV specific antibodies. Increase in titres of neutralizing IgG/IgM antibodies results in the clearance of virus from the bloodstream and marks the initiation of the post-acute phase. Immune responses mounted during this phase of the infection determine the degree of disease progression or its resolution. Some patients may progress to a chronic arthritic phase of the disease that may last from a few months to several years, owing to a compromised disease resolution. The present review discusses the immunopathology of CHIKD and the factors that dictate disease progression and its resolution.">

        <span class="abst" title="The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus epidemics highlight the explosive nature of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes1,2. Vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) are two key entomological parameters used to assess the public health risk posed by arboviruses3. These are typically measured empirically by offering mosquitoes an infectious blood meal and temporally sampling mosquitoes to determine the infection and transmission status. This approach has been used for the better part of a century; however, it does not accurately capture the biology and behaviour of many mosquito vectors that refeed frequently (every 2-3 d)4. Here, we demonstrate that acquisition of a second non-infectious blood meal significantly shortens the EIP of ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti by enhancing virus dissemination from the mosquito midgut. Similarly, a second blood meal increases the competence of this species for dengue virus and chikungunya virus as well as Aedes albopictus for ZIKV, suggesting that this phenomenon may be common among other virus-vector pairings and that A. albopictus might be a more important vector than once thought. Blood-meal-induced microperforations in the virus-impenetrable basal lamina that surrounds the midgut provide a mechanism for enhanced virus escape. Modelling of these findings reveals that a shortened EIP would result in a significant increase in the basic reproductive number, R0, estimated from experimental data. This helps to explain how A. aegypti can sustain explosive epidemics such as ZIKV despite relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials. Together, these data demonstrate a direct and unrecognized link between mosquito feeding behaviour, EIP and vector competence.">

Treatment options are limited to supportive care and the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin. However, evidence for ribavirin efficacy in patients with LF is poor and pharmacokinetic (PK) data are not available.Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) developed an intravenous ribavirin regimen different to the WHO recommendation. Apart from a lower total daily dose the drug is usually administered once per day which reduces the exposure of personnel to patients with LF. The aim of this study is to characterise the PK of the Irrua ribavirin regimen. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:This prospective, observational clinical study will assess PK properties of the Irrua ribavirin regimen on routinely ribavirin-treated patients with LF at ISTH, a referral hospital serving 19 local governmental areas in a LF endemic zone in Nigeria. Participants will be adults with PCR-confirmed LF. The primary objective is to describe classical PK parameters for ribavirin (maximum plasma drug concentration, time to maximum plasma drug concentration, area under the plasma drug concentration vs time curve, half-life time T1/2, volume of distribution). Blood samples will be collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 24 hours after doses on day 1, day 4 and day 10 of ribavirin treatment. Ribavirin plasma concentrations will be determined using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Nigerian National Code for Health Research Ethics. The protocol has received approval by the Health Research Ethics Committee of ISTH. Results will be made available to LF survivors, their caregivers, the funders, LF research society and other researchers. REGISTRATION DETAILS:ISRCTN11104750.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality among children worldwide, commonly through acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI). To assess the incidence rate of symptomatic RSV illness among young children, we conducted a prospective birth cohort study following children from 0-2 years of age in Managua, Nicaragua. METHODS:Children meeting the testing criteria (fever, history of fever, or severe respiratory symptoms [apnea, stridor, nasal flaring, wheezing, chest indrawing, and/or central cyanosis]) were tested for RSV infections using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. An acute lower respiratory infection was defined as a diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, or bronchial hyperreactivity. The incidence rate was calculated, and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a Poisson distribution. RESULTS:A total of 833 children participated in the cohort: 289 (34.7%) had at least 1 episode of laboratory-confirmed RSV, and 156 (18.7%) of had an episode of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI). The incidence rate of symptomatic RSV was 248.1 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 223.2-275.7). While infants aged 6-11 months had the highest incidence of symptomatic RSV (361.3/1000 person-years, 95% CI 304.4-428.8), infants &lt;3 months had the highest incidence of severe RSV (RSV-associated hospitalizations and/or severe ALRI). RSV was also associated with 25.0-37.5% of deaths from medical causes (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS:A substantial burden of RSV exists among children aged &lt;2 years in Nicaraguan communities. RSV was also a leading cause of infant mortality among study participants. The development and implementation of effective RSV prevention and treatment measures represent an opportunity to substantially reduce severe illness and death among children worldwide.">

Their epidemics typically present periodic patterns, linked to the underlying mosquito population dynamics, which are known to be driven by natural climate fluctuations. Understanding how climate dictates the timing and potential of viral transmission is essential for preparedness of public health systems and design of control strategies. While various alternative approaches have been proposed to estimate local transmission potential of such viruses, few open-source, ready to use and freely available software tools exist.We developed the Mosquito-borne Viral Suitability Estimator (MVSE) software package for the R programming environment. MVSE estimates the index P, a novel suitability index based on a climate-driven mathematical expression for the basic reproductive number of mosquito-borne viruses. By accounting for local humidity and temperature, as well as viral, vector and human priors, the index P can be estimated for specific host and viral species in different regions of the globe.We describe the background theory, empirical support and biological interpretation of the index P. Using real-world examples spanning multiple epidemiological contexts, we further demonstrate MVSE's basic functionality, research and educational potentials.">

However, vaccination rates are much lower than recommended despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease among this vulnerable population. Given timely goals to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake, we explored Singaporean older adults' misperceptions about influenza disease and vaccine. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted among 76 Singaporean adults aged 65 and above with no focus on a specific area in Singapore. Data were analyzed with grounded theory methods to understand participants' attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge. We developed in vivo codes that reflect the verbiage used by participants and exhaustively catalogued themes through a constant comparison coding method. Focusing specifically on older adults' misperceptions, seven main themes about influenza disease or vaccine emerged from our data analysis: familiarity with influenza, misperceptions about influenza, personal susceptibility to influenza, familiarity with the influenza vaccine, misperceptions about the influenza vaccine, misperceptions about influenza vaccine usage, and opinions about and barriers to influenza vaccine uptake. Notably, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and motivation in vaccinating against influenza among older adults in Singapore. Health communication needs to be more tailored toward older adults' message processing systems and engage health professionals' involvement in addressing the influenza disease and vaccine misperceptions identified in this study.">

A complete understanding of the virus pathogenesis and host factors involved in the viral lifecycle is crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It preferentially associates with cholesterol to form distinct domains named lipid rafts. Sphingomyelinases, including acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and consequently transform lipid rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. In this study, we investigated the effect of SM hydrolysis on IAV propagation. Depleting plasma membrane SM by exogenous bacterial SMase (bSMase) impaired virus infection and reduced virus entry, whereas exogenous SM enhanced infection. Moreover, the depletion of virus envelope SM also reduced virus infectivity and impaired its attachment and internalization. Nonetheless, inhibition of ASMase by desipramine did not affect IAV infection. Similarly, virus replication was not impaired in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) cells, which lack functional ASMase. IAV infection in A549 cells was associated with suppression of ASMase activity starting at 6 h post-infection. Our data reveals that intact cellular and viral envelope SM is required for efficient IAV infection. Therefore, SM metabolism can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention against influenza virus infection.">

Here, we report that adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing influenza virus HA or chimeric HA protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. Unexpectedly, immunization even with wild-type HA induced antibodies recognizing the HA-stalk and activating FcγR-dependent responses indicating that AAV-vectored expression balances HA head- and HA stalk-specific humoral responses. Immunization with AAV-HA partially protected also ferrets against a harsh virus challenge.

Arbovirus emergence in the human population typically results from spillover transmission via bridge vectors, which are competent mosquitoes feeding on both humans and wild animals. Another related, but less studied concern, is the risk of 'spillback' transmission from humans into novel sylvatic cycles. We colonized a sylvatic population of Aedes malayensis from a forested area of the Nakai district in Laos to evaluate its potential as an arbovirus bridge vector. We found that this Ae. malayensis population was overall less competent for DENV and YFV than an urban population of Aedes aegypti. Olfactometer experiments showed that our Ae. malayensis colony did not display any detectable attraction to human scent in laboratory conditions. The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV, combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor, indicate a low potential for this sylvatic Ae. malayensis population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However, we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic Ae. malayensis may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles.">

B19V DNA and specific IgG were tested in minimum study samples of donors attending a blood bank at Córdoba, Argentina, in 2014. Anti-B19V IgM and viral loads were determined in B19V-positive plasma samples. Seven of 731 samples (0.96%) resulted positive, corresponding to individuals aged 32-53 years, four of them repeat donnors and three first-time donors. Viral loads were &lt;103 IU/mL. None had IgM and 6/7 had IgG, one of them at a high level (in the range of 100-200 IU/ml, and the remaining 5 at low to medium level, 5-50 IU/ml). Thus one case was classified as acute infection (DNA+/IgM-/IgG-) and six as potentially persistent infections (DNA+/IgM-/IgG+). No coinfections with other pathogens of mandatory control in the pre-transfusion screening were detected. Prevalence of IgG was 77.9% (279/358). This study provides the first data of B19V prevalence in blood donors in Argentina, demonstrating high rates of acute and persistent B19V infections and high prevalence of anti-B19V IgG in a post-epidemic period. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms/factors for B19V persistence as well as follow-up of recipients in the context of haemo-surveillance programs, contributing to the knowledge of B19V and blood transfusion safety.">

The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others.">

We aimed to investigate the pathogen profiles in fatal cases, the circulation and transmission pattern of the viruses by combining metatranscriptomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological analyses. Metatranscriptomic sequencing was used to characterize the enteroviruses. Clinical and environmental surveillance in the local population was performed to understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of the viruses in the local population. The possible source(s), evolution, transmission, and recombination of the viruses were investigated by incorporating genomes from the current outbreak, from local retrospective surveillance, and from public databases. Metatranscriptomic analysis identified Echovirus 11 (E11) in three fatal cases. Seroprevalence of neutralization antibody to E11 was 35 to 44 per cent in 3-15 age groups of general population, and the viruses were associated with various clinical symptoms. From the viral phylogeny, nosocomial transmissions were identified and all E11 2019 outbreak strains were closely related with E11 strains circulating in local population 2017-19. Frequent recombination occurred among the 2019 Guangdong E11 outbreak strains and various genotypes in enterovirus B species. This study provides an example of combining advanced genetic technology and epidemiological surveillance in pathogen diagnosis, source(s), and transmission tracing during an infectious disease outbreak. The result highlights the hidden E11 circulation and the risk of viral transmission and infection in the young age population in China. Frequent recombination between Guangdong-like strains and other enterovirus genotypes also implies the prevalence of these emerging E11 strains.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Humans are the primary hosts of dengue viruses (DENV). However, sylvatic cycles of transmission can occur among non-human primates and human encroachment into forested regions can be a source of emergence of new strains such as the highly divergent and sylvatic strain of DENV2, QML22, recovered from a dengue fever patient returning to Australia from Borneo. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the vector competence of Australian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for this virus. METHODS:Four- to five-day-old mosquitoes from two strains of Ae. aegypti from Queensland, Australia, were fed a meal of sheep blood containing 108 50% cell culture infectious dose per ml (CCID50/ml) of either QML22 or an epidemic strain of DENV serotype 2 (QML16) isolated from a dengue fever patient in Australia in 2015. Mosquitoes were maintained at 28 °C, 75% relative humidity and sampled 7, 10 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Live virions in mosquito bodies (abdomen/thorax), legs and wings and saliva expectorates from individual mosquitoes were quantified using a cell culture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CCELISA) to determine infection, dissemination and transmission rates. RESULTS:The infection and dissemination rates of the sylvatic DENV2 strain, QML22, were significantly lower than that for QML16. While the titres of virus in the bodies of mosquitoes infected with either of these viruses were similar, titres in legs and wings were significantly lower in mosquitoes infected with QML22 at most time points although they reached similar levels by 14 dpi. QML16 was detected in 16% (n = 25) and 28% (n = 25) of saliva expectorates at 10 and 14 dpi, respectively. In contrast, no virus was detected in the saliva expectorates of QML22 infected mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS:Australia urban/peri-urban Ae. aegypti species are susceptible to infection by the sylvatic and highly divergent DENV 2 QML22 but replication of QML22 is attenuated relative to the contemporary strain, QML16. A salivary gland infection or escape barrier may be acting to prevent infection of saliva and would prevent onward transmission of this highly divergent virus in Australia.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Between January 2015 and August 2016, two epidemic waves of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease swept the Northeastern (NE) region of Brazil. As a result, two waves of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) were observed concurrently. The mandatory reporting of ZIKV disease began region-wide in February 2016, and it is believed that ZIKV cases were significantly under-reported before that. The changing reporting rate has made it difficult to estimate the ZIKV infection attack rate, and studies in the literature vary widely from 17% to &gt; 50%. The same applies to other key epidemiological parameters. In contrast, the diagnosis and reporting of GBS cases were reasonably reliable given the severity and easy recognition of the disease symptoms. In this paper, we aim to estimate the real number of ZIKV cases (i.e., the infection attack rate) and their dynamics in time, by scaling up from GBS surveillance data in NE Brazil. METHODOLOGY:A mathematical compartmental model is constructed that makes it possible to infer the true epidemic dynamics of ZIKV cases based on surveillance data of excess GBS cases. The model includes the possibility that asymptomatic ZIKV cases are infectious. The model is fitted to the GBS surveillance data and the key epidemiological parameters are inferred by using a plug-and-play likelihood-based estimation. We make use of regional weather data to determine possible climate-driven impacts on the reproductive number [Formula: see text], and to infer the true ZIKV epidemic dynamics. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS:The GBS surveillance data can be used to study ZIKV epidemics and may be appropriate when ZIKV reporting rates are not well understood. The overall infection attack rate (IAR) of ZIKV is estimated to be 24.1% (95% confidence interval: 17.1%-29.3%) of the population. By examining various asymptomatic scenarios, the IAR is likely to be lower than 33% over the two ZIKV waves. The risk rate from symptomatic ZIKV infection to develop GBS was estimated as ρ = 0.0061% (95% CI: 0.0050%-0.0086%) which is significantly less than current estimates. We found a positive association between local temperature and the basic reproduction number, [Formula: see text]. Our analysis revealed that asymptomatic infections affect the estimation of ZIKV epidemics and need to also be carefully considered in related modelling studies. According to the estimated effective reproduction number and population wide susceptibility, we comment that a ZIKV outbreak would be unlikely in NE Brazil in the near future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic coronavirus that has a tendency to cause significant healthcare outbreaks among patients with serious comorbidities. We analyzed hospital data from the MERS-CoV outbreak in King Abdulaziz Medical Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, June-August 2015 using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) ward transmission model. The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R0), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards. Transmission rates where highest in the ED, and mobile HCWs were responsible for large part of the outbreak.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Between 2016 and 2019, 265 cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection were reported in Vietnam, predominantly in southern Vietnam. In 2016, a case of ZIKV-associated microcephaly was confirmed in the Central Highlands, and several members of the infant's family were confirmed to be infected with ZIKV. The study aims to determine the level of immunity to ZIKV in the general population of the ZIKV epidemic region. METHODS:A total of 879 serum samples were collected from 801 participants between January 2017 and July 2018, during and after the ZIKV epidemic in Vietnam. The samples were tested for anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for ZIKV was performed on all samples, and for DENV on the samples that ZIKV neutralizing antibody positive. RESULTS:A total of 83 (10.3%) participants had anti-ZIKV IgM. Of the 83, 6 were confirmed to be ZIKV antibodies positive using PRNT and anti-ZIKV IgG ELISA. Of the 718 participants who were anti-ZIKV IgM negative, a further 3 cases were confirmed as positive for antibodies against ZIKV. Of the 9 participants with ZIKV infection, 5 lived in the same village as the infant with ZIKV-associated microcephaly and the other 4 lived in 2 neighboring communes. Repeat samples were collected from the 83 ZIKV IgM positive participants 1.5 years after the first collection. No new cases of ZIKV infection were detected. In addition, 2 of 3 participants with anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG demonstrated a 4- to 8-fold increase in ZIKV neutralizing antibody titer. CONCLUSIONS:ZIKV was present in the area around Krong Buk, with the rate of ZIKV-specific antibodies was 1.1% in the community since at least 2016. While the low levels of circulation together with low seroprevalence suggests a limited outbreak in the region, the results also reflect on low levels of protective immunity to Zika within the population. These results provide a better understanding of the current ZIKV epidemic status in the region and demonstrate a need for implementation of more effective ZIKV infection control measures.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:In addition to causing the pandemic influenza outbreaks of 1918 and 2009, subtype H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused seasonal epidemics since 1977. Antigenic property of influenza viruses are determined by both protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation of influenza glycoproteins, especially hemagglutinin (HA). The currently available computational methods are only considered features in protein sequence but not N-linked glycosylation. RESULTS:A multi-task learning sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (MTL-SGL) regression method was developed and applied to derive two types of predominant features including protein sequence and N-linked glycosylation in hemagglutinin (HA) affecting variations in serologic data for human and swine H1N1 IAVs. Results suggested that mutations and changes in N-linked glycosylation sites are associated with the rise of antigenic variants of H1N1 IAVs. Furthermore, the implicated mutations are predominantly located at five reported antibody-binding sites, and within or close to the HA receptor binding site. All of the three N-linked glycosylation sites (i.e. sequons NCSV at HA 54, NHTV at HA 125, and NLSK at HA 160) identified by MTL-SGL to determine antigenic changes were experimentally validated in the H1N1 antigenic variants using mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with conventional sparse learning methods, MTL-SGL achieved a lower prediction error and higher accuracy, indicating that grouped features and MTL in the MTL-SGL method are not only able to handle serologic data generated from multiple reagents, supplies, and protocols, but also perform better in genetic sequence-based antigenic quantification. CONCLUSIONS:In summary, the results of this study suggest that mutations and variations in N-glycosylation in HA caused antigenic variations in H1N1 IAVs and that the sequence-based antigenicity predictive model will be useful in understanding antigenic evolution of IAVs.">

Aedes polynesiensis is the main mosquito vector described in this territory. Other Aedes species have been reported, but recent entomological data are missing to infer the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors and to assess the entomological risk factors for transmission of arboviral diseases. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:An entomological prospective study was conducted on the three main islands of the territory to determine the presence and distribution of Aedes spp. Larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes were collected from 54 sampling points in different environments, with a final sampling of 3747 immature stages and 606 adults. The main identified breeding sites were described. Ae. polynesiensis was found in every sampled site in peridomestic and wild habitats. Ae. aegypti was only found on the island of Wallis in peridomestic environments with a limited distribution. Two other Aedes species endemic to the Pacific were recorded, Aedes oceanicus and Aedes futunae. To evaluate the ability of local Ae. polynesiensis to transmit the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), two field populations were analyzed for vector competence using experimental oral exposure of females to CHIKV and infection, dissemination and transmission assays. Results showed that both populations of Ae. polynesiensis were competent for CHIKV (30% at 7 days post-infection). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:This study showed the ubiquitous distribution and abundance of Ae. polynesiensis on the three islands and demonstrated that local populations were able to transmit CHIKV. Combined with the presence and expansion of Ae. aegypti on the main island of Wallis, these data highlight the risk of transmission of arboviral diseases in the territory of Wallis and Futuna and provide relevant information for entomological surveillance and vector control programs.">

A standardized guideline on isolation technique for exposed HD patients is not available. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different isolation strategies on the prevention of secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among exposed HD patients.During the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, 116 patients in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and underwent different types of isolation, which were as follows: single-room isolation (n = 54, 47%), cohort isolation (n = 46, 40%), and self-imposed quarantine (n = 16, 13%). The primary outcome was rate of secondary viral transmission. The secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical and biochemical markers during the isolation period, difference in clinical and biochemical markers according to the types of isolation practice, and effect of isolation practice on patient survival.During a mean isolation period of 15 days, no further cases of secondary transmission were detected among HD patients. Plasma hemoglobin, serum calcium, and serum albumin levels and single-pool Kt/V decreased during the isolation period but normalized thereafter. Patients who were subjected to self-imposed quarantine had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lower total cholesterol level, and lower Kt/V than those who underwent single-room or cohort isolation. During the 24-month follow-up period, 12 patients died. However, none of the deaths occurred during the isolation period, and no differences were observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies.Although 116 participants in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea, strict patient surveillance and proper isolation practice prevented secondary transmission of the virus. Thus, a renal disaster protocol, which includes proper contact surveillance and isolation practice, must be established in the future to accommodate the needs of HD patients during disasters or outbreaks.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Solomon Islands, a country made up of tropical islands, has suffered cyclic dengue fever (DF) outbreaks in the past three decades. An outbreak of dengue-like illness (DLI) that occurred in April 2016 prompted this study, which aimed to determine the population's immunity status and identify the arboviruses circulating in the country. Methods:A household survey, involving 188 participants in two urban areas (Honiara and Gizo), and a parallel hospital-based clinical survey were conducted in April 2016. The latter was repeated in December after a surge in DLI cases. Arbovirus IgG ELISA were performed on the household blood samples to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in the community, while qPCR testing of the clinical samples was used to identify the circulating arboviruses. Dengue virus (DENV)-positive samples were further characterized by amplifying and sequencing the envelope gene. Results:The overall prevalence rates of DENV, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus were 83.4%, 7.6%, and 0.9%, respectively. The qPCR positivity rates of the clinical samples collected in April 2016 were as follows: DENV 39.6%, Zika virus 16.7%, and chikungunya virus 6.3%, which increased to 74%, 48%, and 20% respectively in December 2016. The displacement of the circulating serotype-3, genotype-1, with DENV serotype 2, genotype cosmopolitan was responsible for the outbreak in 2016. Conclusions:A DENV outbreak in Solomon Islands was caused by the introduction of a single serotype. The high prevalence of DENV provided transient cross-protection, which prevented the introduction of a new serotype from the hyperendemic region for at least 3 years. The severe outcomes seen in the recent outbreak probably resulted from changes in the causative viruses and the effects of population immunity and changes in the outbreak pattern. Solomon Islands needs to step up surveillance to include molecular tools, increase regional communication, and perform timely interventions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of chronic autoinflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although the molecular mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammation are not completely clear, the main factors are presumed to be genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and the intestinal microbiome. Hitherto, most of the studies focusing on the role of the microbiome studied the action and effect of bacteria. However, the intestinal microbiome comprises other members of the microbial community as well, namely, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. We believe that bacteriophages are among the main orchestrators of the effect of microbiota on the gut mucosa. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the knowledge of the role of intestinal phageome in IBD and to discuss the concept of phage therapy and its future applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries and is an important public health problem worldwide. Dengue fever is not endemic in Taiwan; the importation of dengue viruses from neighboring countries via close commercial links and air travel is considered to be the cause of local outbreaks. Therefore, efforts toward disease control have focused on preventing the importation of dengue into Taiwan. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the numbers of imported and indigenous dengue cases to test the validity of this strategy. METHODS:Data on cases of dengue fever that occurred between 2013 and 2018 were obtained from the surveillance systems of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Kaohsiung City Health Department. Standard epidemiological data, including the monthly numbers of indigenous and imported cases of dengue, were calculated. Potential associations between the numbers of indigenous and imported cases were investigated using correlation analyses. RESULTS:We identified a possible relationship between the period of disease concealment and the number of imported dengue cases, which resulted in epidemics of indigenous dengue fever within local communities. Further analysis of confirmed cases during previous epidemics in Kaohsiung City found that the risk of indigenous dengue fever may be related to the likelihood that patients with imported dengue fever will stay within local communities. CONCLUSION:Given the correlations found between imported and indigenous cases of dengue fever, as well as the relationship between the disease concealment period and the risk of indigenous dengue fever, prevention of disease importation and efficient identification of dengue cases within high-risk communities remain the major priorities for disease control.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of dengue virus (DENV) epidemics, the virus remains a public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Most DENV cases in the Americas between January and July 2019 were reported in Brazil. São Paulo State in the southeast of Brazil has reported nearly half of all DENV infections in the country. OBJECTIVES To understand the origin and dynamics of the 2019 DENV outbreak. METHODS Here using portable nanopore sequencing we generated20 new DENV genome sequences from viremic patients with suspected dengue infection residing in two of the most-affected municipalities of São Paulo State, Araraquara and São José do Rio Preto. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with 1,630 global DENV strains to better understand the evolutionary history of the DENV lineages that currently circulate in the region. FINDINGS The new outbreak strains were classified as DENV2 genotype III (American/Asian genotype). Our analysis shows that the 2019 outbreak is the result of a novel DENV lineage that was recently introduced to Brazil from the Caribbean region. Dating phylogeographic analysis suggests that DENV2-III BR-4 was introduced to Brazil in or around early 2014, possibly from the Caribbean region. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our study describes the early detection of a newly introduced and rapidly-expanding DENV2 virus lineage in Brazil.">

        <span class="abst" title="Since its first introduction into China in 2009, influenza A/H1N1pdm virus has undergone a rapid expansion and replaced the classical seasonal A(H1N1) virus. To characterize the ongoing evolution and national transmission dynamics of this virus, we analyzed 335 complete genome, 1259 HA, and 1043 NA sequences of the A/H1N1pdm strains detected in China. We found that the dN/dS value and relative genetic diversity of the A/H1N1pdm virus experienced a decrease from 2009 to 2017, and then a rapid increase during 2018-2019. Importantly, elevated relative genetic diversity was observed in the A/H1N1pdm and the A/H3N2 viruses, as well as two lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) of influenza B virus during 2018-2019, suggesting the simultaneous changes of these viruses in terms of genetic diversity might be associated with the recent large outbreak of seasonal influenza epidemic in China during 2018-2019. Fifteen amino acid mutations were found to be fixed along the main trunks of both HA and NA phylogenetic trees, and some of them are located in the antigen binding site or the receptor binding site. A sequential accumulation of mutations relative to the 2009-vaccine strain was observed in the circulating A/H1N1pdm strains during 2009-2016, while a rapid accumulation of mutations relative to the 2015-vaccine strain appeared in the emerging variants in 2017 shortly after the release of the vaccine. Multiple introductions of the A/H1N1pdm lineages into China were observed during 2009-2019, and East China and South China were found to serve as two major epicenters responsible for the national migration of the virus. In summary, these data provide important insights into the understanding of the evolution, epidemiology and transmission of the A/H1N1pdm virus, and highlight the importance of strengthening influenza surveillance in East China and South China.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990-1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232-478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6-7.2). However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.">

        <span class="abst" title="Severe influenza is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of critically ill influenza patients. In this retrospective study, we enrolled critically ill adult patients with influenza at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We evaluated the demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings and examined whether any of these measurements correlated with mortality. We then created an event-based algorithm as a simple predictive tool using two variables with statistically significant associations with mortality. Between 2015 and 2018, 102 critically ill influenza patients (median age, 62 years) were assessed; among them, 41 (40.1%) patients died. Of the 94 patients who received oseltamivir therapy, 68 (72.3%) began taking oseltamivir 48 hours after the onset of illness. Of the 102 patients, the major influenza-associated complications were respiratory failure (97%), pneumonia (94.1%), acute kidney injury (65.7%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (51%), gastrointestinal bleeding (35.3%), and bacteremia (16.7%). In the multivariate regression model, high lactate levels, ARDS, acute kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding were independent predictors of mortality in critically ill influenza patients. The optimal lactate level cutoff for predicting mortality was 3.7 mmol/L with an area under curve of 0.728. We constructed an event-associated algorithm that included lactate and ARDS. Fifteen (75%) of 20 patients with lactate levels 3.7 mmol/L and ARDS died, compared with only 1 (7.7%) of 13 patients with normal lactate levels and without ARDS. We identified clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality that could aid in the care of critically ill influenza patients. Identification of these prognostic markers could be improved to prioritize key examinations that might be useful in determining patient outcomes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a significant human pathogen that cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Avian waterfowl are the natural reservoir of IAVs, but a wide range of species can serve as hosts. Most IAV strains are adapted to one host species and avian strains of IAV replicate poorly in most mammalian hosts. Importantly, IAV polymerases from avian strains function poorly in mammalian cells but host adaptive mutations can restore activity. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus acquired multiple mutations in the PA gene that activated polymerase activity in mammalian cells, even in the absence of previously identified host adaptive mutations in other polymerase genes. These mutations in PA localize within different regions of the protein suggesting multiple mechanisms exist to activate polymerase activity. Additionally, an immunomodulatory protein, PA-X, is expressed from the PA gene segment. PA-X expression is conserved amongst many IAV strains but activity varies between viruses specific for different hosts, suggesting that PA-X also plays a role in host adaptation. Here, we review the role of PA in the emergence of currently circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses and the most recent studies of host adaptive mutations in the PA gene that modulate polymerase activity and PA-X function.">

A Victoria lineage (clade 1A) IBV was serially passaged 17 times in BALB/c mice, and adaptive amino acid substitutions were found in hemagglutinin (HA) (T214I) and neuraminidase (NA) (D432N). By electron microscopy, spherical and elliptical IBV forms were noted. Light microscopy showed that mouse-adapted IBVs caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. We evaluated the illness pathogenicity, viral load, and histopathological features of mouse-adapted IBVs and estimated anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Assessment of an investigational anti-influenza drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) and an influenza vaccine (Ultrix®, SPBNIIVS, Saint Petersburg, Russia) showed effectiveness against the mouse-adapted influenza B virus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalization worldwide. Besides viruses, bacterial co-infections dramatically exacerbate infection. In general, surfactant protein-A (SP-A) represents a first line of immune defense. In this study, we analyzed whether influenza A virus (IAV) and/or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections affect SP-A expression. To closely reflect the situation in the lung, we used a human alveolus-on-a-chip model and a murine pneumonia model. Our results show that S. aureus can reduce extracellular levels of SP-A, most likely attributed to bacterial proteases. Mono-epithelial cell culture experiments reveal that the expression of SP-A is not directly affected by IAV or S. aureus. Yet, the mRNA expression of SP-A is strongly down-regulated by TNF-α, which is highly produced by professional phagocytes in response to bacterial infection. By using the human alveolus-on-a-chip model, we show that the down-regulation of SP-A is strongly dependent on macrophages. In a murine model of pneumonia, we can confirm that S. aureus decreases SP-A levels in vivo. These findings indicate that (I) complex interactions of epithelial and immune cells induce down-regulation of SP-A expression and (II) bacterial mono- and super-infections reduce SP-A expression in the lung, which might contribute to a severe outcome of bacterial pneumonia.">

However, cellular response to IBV infection in humans and mechanisms of host-mediated restriction of IBV replication are not thoroughly understood. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to perform transcriptome profiling of IBV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post infection (hpi) and characterized the cellular gene expression dynamics. We observed that more than 4000 host genes were differentially regulated during the study period, which included up regulation of genes encoding proteins, having a role in the innate antiviral immune responses, immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as down regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis of RNA-Seq data coupled with RT-qPCR validation collectively showed that double-strand RNA recognition pathways, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), were substantially activated following IBV infection. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the intimate interaction between IBV and lung epithelial cells, which can be further explored towards elucidation of the cellular mechanisms in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.">

Similar to previous years, our meeting gathered scientists mainly working in France, from academic labs and hospitals as well as from industry. We also had the pleasure of welcoming attendees from different European countries and even beyond. The conference was divided into four sessions: Ecology and Evolution, Phage Therapy and Biotechnology, Structure and Assembly and Phage-Host Interaction, each opened by a keynote lecture. The talks, selected from abstracts, gave the opportunity for young scientists (especially students and post-docs) to present their project and results in a friendly atmosphere. Poster sessions also favoured interactions and discussions between young researchers and more senior scientists. Here, we provide a summary of the topics developed during the conference.">

Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, is the principal vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, and has well-established populations across tropical and subtropical urban areas of the Americas, including the southern United States. While intense arboviral epidemics have occurred in Mexico and further south in the Americas, local transmission in the United States has been minimal. Here, we study Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus host feeding patterns and vertebrate host communities in residential environments of South Texas to identify host-utilization relative to availability. Only 31% of Ae. aegypti blood meals were derived from humans, while 50% were from dogs and 19% from other wild and domestic animals. In Cx. quinquefasciatus, 67% of blood meals were derived from chicken, 22% came from dogs, 9% from various wild avian species, and 2% from other mammals including one human, one cat, and one pig. We developed a model for the reproductive number, R0, for Zika virus (ZIKV) in South Texas relative to northern Mexico using human disease data from Tamaulipas, Mexico. We show that ZIKV R0 in South Texas communities could be greater than one if the risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti bites in these communities is at least 60% that of Northern Mexico communities. The high utilization of non-human vertebrates and low risk of human exposure in South Texas diminishes the outbreak potential for human-amplified urban arboviruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.">

Two phylogenetically distinct IBV lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, co-circulate worldwide and they present challenges for vaccine strain selection. Until the present study, there was little information regarding the pattern of the circulating strains of IBV in Uruguay. A subset of positive influenza B samples from influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) inpatients detected in sentinel hospitals in Uruguay during 2012-2019 were selected. The sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed substitutions at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the co-circulation of both lineages in almost all seasonal epidemics in Uruguay, and allows recognizing a lineage-level vaccine mismatch in approximately one-third of the seasons studied. The epidemiological results show that the proportion of IBV found in ILI was significantly higher than the observed in SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7% ILI, 3.2% SARI) and patients between 5-14 years constituted the majority (33%) of all influenza B infection (p &lt; 0.05).

The identification of rabies in African civets raised the question of whether this wildlife carnivore is a potential reservoir host of RABVs of direct and ancestral dog origin (dog-maintained and dog-derived origins) with an independent cycle of transmission. Genetic analyses of African civet nucleoprotein sequences for 23 African civet RABVs and historically published sequences demonstrated that RABVs from African civets have two origins related to dog and mongoose rabies enzootics. The data support observations of the interaction of civets with domestic dogs and wildlife mongooses, mostly in Northern South Africa and North-East Zimbabwe. Within each host species clade, African civet RABVs group exclusively together, implying intra-species virus transfer occurs readily. The canid RABV clade appears to support virus transfer more readily between hosts than mongoose RABVs. Furthermore, these data probably indicate short transmission chains with conspecifics that may be related to transient rabies maintenance in African civets. Hence, it is important to continue monitoring the emergence of lyssaviruses in this host. Observations from this study are supported by ongoing and independent similar cases, in which bat-eared foxes and black-backed jackal species maintain independent rabies cycles of what were once dog-maintained RABVs.">

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate and compare the infestation pattern of these species in a neighbourhood of Recife, Brazil, endemic for arboviruses in 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2). METHODS Infestation, distribution and relative abundance of these sympatric species were recorded by egg collection using a network of 59 sentinel ovitraps (s-ovt) at fixed sampling stations for 12 months in T1 and T2. FINDINGS A permanent occupation pattern was detected which was characterised by the presence of egg-laying females of one or both species with a high ovitrap positivity index (94.3 to 100%) throughout both years analysed. In terms of abundance, the total of eggs collected was lower (p &lt; 0.005) in T2 (146,153) than in T1 (281,103), although ovitraps still displayed a high index of positivity. The spatial distribution showed the presence of both species in 65.1% of the 148 s-ovt assessed, while a smaller number of traps exclusively contained Ae. aegypti (22%) or Ae. albopictus (13.2%) eggs.

        <span class="abst" title="Background There is a significant impact of influenza on individuals, families, and societies both economically and clinically. This significant impact is a result of hospital admissions, medication expenses, side effects, secondary bacterial infections, and more days off from work or other forms of reduced productivity for the patients or their caretakers. Our objective is to present the trends in the rate of hospital discharges per 100,000 population from the years 1993 through 2015, the mean age, and the inpatient mortality rate. Methods This is a retrospective study utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 1993 through 2015. Discharges due to influenza from 1993 to 2015 were identified, and the rate of discharges per 100,000 population, inpatient mortality, and mean age of discharged patients were trended. Linear regression was used to assess if the deviation from horizontal was statistically significant for the trends of the rate of discharges per 100,000 population, mean age, and percentage of the inpatient mortality. Result The mean age and inpatient mortality vary from year to year. The linear regression analysis for the trends was not statistically significant, and for the percentage of the inpatient mortality, the deviation from horizontal was not significant, P-value 0.75 and F-value: 0.09. Similarly, for the mean age, the deviation from horizontal was not significant with a P-value of 0.97 and an F-value of 0.001. However, the linear regression analysis for the rate of discharges per 100,000 population was remarkable for a statistically significant deviation from the horizontal with a P-value of 0.0002 and an F value of 19.5. Conclusion Recent advancements in influenza detection have made the detection feasible, quick, and cost-effective. However, the role of these advanced modalities on the outcome is still controversial. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the rate of discharges due to influenza, but there was no significant change in the parentage of the inpatient mortality over the years between 1993 - 2015. Advanced influenza virus detection tests are now recommended in both outpatient (including emergency department) and inpatient admissions. The recent increase in inpatient admissions could be due to better detection modalities. However, no change in the percentage of inpatient mortality makes the impact of these detection tests on the outcome questionable. A further prospective study is warranted to assess the impact of these tests on the outcome.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK:Influenza virological surveillance is essential for monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses (IVs) as well as for annual updating of the vaccine composition. The aim of this study is to analyse IVs circulation in Emilia-Romagna during the eight epidemic seasons after the 2009 pandemic and to evaluate their match with seasonal vaccine strains. METHODS:A total of 7882 respiratory specimens from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), were collected by regional sentinel practitioners and hospital physicians. Viral investigations were conducted by rRT-PCR assay. Genetic characterization was performed for a spatial-temporal representative number of influenza laboratory-confirmed specimens. RESULTS:Influenza-positive samples per season ranged between 28.9% (2013-2014) and 66.8% (2012-2013). Co-circulation of IVs type A and type B was observed in all seasons, although with a different intensity. In all seasons, the highest number of positive samples was recorded in younger patients aged 5-14 years with relative frequencies ranging from 40% in the 2013-2014 season and 78% in the 2012-2013 season. Since the 2009 pandemic, A/H1N1pdm09 IVs circulating were closely related to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. Antigenic mismatch between vaccine strain and A/H3N2 IVs was observed in the 2011-2012 and 2014-2015 seasons. During 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons a complete or nearly complete mismatch between the predominant influenza B lineage of IVs type B circulating and vaccine B lineage occurred. CONCLUSIONS:This analysis confirms the importance of the virological surveillance and highlights the need of a continuous monitoring of IVs circulation, to improve the most appropriate vaccination strategies.

        <span class="abst" title="O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that caused two large epidemics in 1959 and 1996, affecting millions of people in Africa. More recently, sero-surveillance of healthy blood donors conducted in 2019 revealed high rates of unreported ONNV infection in Uganda. Due to similar clinical symptoms with other endemic mosquito-borne pathogens in the region, including chikungunya virus, dengue virus and malaria, ONNV infections are often un- or misdiagnosed. Elucidating the immunopathogenic factors of this re-emerging arbovirus is critical with the expanding geographic distribution of competent vectors. This study reports the establishment of an immune competent C57BL6/J mouse model to mechanistically characterize ONNV infection and assess potential treatment efficacy. This mouse model successfully recapitulated arthralgia and viremia profiles seen in ONNV patients. Furthermore, longitudinal in-vivo PET imaging with [18F]FB-IL-2 (CD25+CD4+ binding probe) and histopathological assessment in this model demonstrated the pathogenic role of CD4+ T cells in driving joint pathology. Concordantly, in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion, or suppression with fingolimod, an FDA-approved immunomodulating drug, abrogated CD4+ T cell-mediated disease. This study demonstrates the importance of this immune competent ONNV model for future studies on factors influencing disease pathogenesis, which could shape the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies for arthritogenic alphaviruses.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancers, causing 270.000 deaths annually worldwide of which 85% occur in developing countries with an increasing risk associated to HIV infection. This study aimed at comparing HPV's positivity and genotype distribution in women according to their HIV status and determinants. METHODS:A comparative study was carried out in 2012 at the Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre (CIRCB) among 278 women enrolled consecutively at the General Hospital and the Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital of the City of Yaoundé. HPV genotyping was performed by real-time PCR, HIV serological screening by serial algorithm, CD4 T cell phenotyping by flow cytometry and HIV viral load by Abbott m2000RT. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and Graph Pad version 6.0 software; with P &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS:Globally, mean age was 37 ± 3 years; median CD4-count for HIV+ was 414 cells/mm3 [IQR: 264.75-588] and median viremia was 50 RNA copies/mL [IQR: &lt; 40-8288]. Overall HPV rate was 38.49% (107/278); 58.88% for single women vs. others (28.97% married, 2.80% divorced, 9.34% for widows), OR: 2.164; p = 0.0319. Following HIV status, HPV rate was 43.48% (80/184) among HIV+ vs. 28.72% (27/94) among HIV- (OR: 1.937; p &lt; 0.0142); HPV genotypes among HIV+ vs. HIV- were respectively distributed as follows: genotype 16 (3.75% vs. 0.00%, p = 0.57), genotype 18 (3.75% vs. 3.70%, p = 1.00), co-infection 16 and others (8.75% vs. 7.40%, p = 1.00), co-infection 18 and others (8.75% vs. 11.11%, p = 0.71), co-infection 16, 18 and others (2.50% vs. 0.00%, p = 1.00) and other genotypes (72.50% vs. 77.78%, p = 0.80). Among HIV+ participants, HPV rate following CD4 was 62.88% (61/97) for CD4 &lt; 500 vs. 35.71% (20/56) for CD4 ≥ 500 (OR: 3.05; p = 0.0012) while HPV rate following HIV viremia was 42.71% (41/96) with &lt; 1000 RNA copies/ml vs. 66.00% (33/50) with &gt; 1000 RNA copies/ml (OR = 0.384; p = 0.009). CONCLUSION:In Yaoundé, HPV rate appear to be very high, with higher rates of genotypes other than 16 and 18. In the event of HIV infection, the risk of HPV positivity is two times higher, favoured essentially by immunodeficiency. Thus, HIV-infected women should be closely monitored to prevent the emergence of cervical cancer.">

To diagnose HFMD, we developed a method for rapid detection of CVA-16 based on reverse transcription-polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR). We used two pairs of primers that specifically recognize the conserved sequences of VP1 coding region of CVA-16, and template RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified in a single tube under isothermal conditions, total reaction time could be reduced to less than 40 min. The detection limit of this method was between 2.4 × 102 and 2.4 × 101 copies/μl with excellent specificity. To test the clinical applicability of the method, 40 clinical stool samples were analyzed using RT-PSR and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and comparison showed that the coincidence rate was 100%. Compared with other similar detection methods, RT-PSR requires less time, simpler operation, and lower cost. These results prove that our novel, simple, and reliable isothermal nucleic acid testing assay has potential application for clinical detection of CVA-16.">

VEEV encephalitis is similar, clinically, to other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one, enzootic strains (subtype I, serotypes D-F and serotypes II-VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily Sigmodontinae. However, bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV.

Estimating YF burden, as well as vaccine impact, while accounting for the features of urban YF transmission such as indirect benefits of vaccination, is key to informing this strategy. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We developed two model variants to estimate YF burden in sub-Saharan Africa, assuming all infections stem from either the sylvatic or the urban cycle of the disease. Both relied on an ecological niche model fitted to the local presence of any YF reported event in 34 African countries. We calibrated under-reporting using independent estimates of transmission intensity provided by 12 serological surveys performed in 11 countries. We calculated local numbers of YF infections, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost based on estimated transmission intensity while accounting for time-varying vaccination coverage. We estimated vaccine demand and impact of future preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) according to various vaccination scenarios. Vaccination activities conducted in Africa between 2005 and 2017 were estimated to prevent from 3.3 (95% CI 1.2-7.7) to 6.1 (95% CI 2.4-13.2) millions of deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, representing extreme scenarios of none or maximal herd effects, respectively. By prioritizing provinces based on the risk of urban YF transmission in future PMVCs, an average of 37.7 million annual doses for PMVCs over eight years would avert an estimated 9,900,000 (95% CI 7,000,000-13,400,000) infections and 480,000 (180,000-1,140,000) deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, corresponding to 1.7 (0.7-4.1) deaths averted per 1,000 vaccine doses. CONCLUSIONS:By estimating YF burden and vaccine impact over a range of spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for the specificity of urban transmission, our model can be used to inform the current EYE strategy.">

This resurgence may be the consequence of numerous complex parameters, but the major cause remains the mismanagement of insecticide use and the emergence of resistance. Biological control programmes have rendered promising results but several highly effective techniques, such as genetic manipulation, remain insufficiently considered as a control mechanism. Currently, new strategies based on attractive toxic sugar baits and new agents, such as Wolbachia and Asaia, are being intensively studied for potential use as alternatives to chemicals.

        <span class="abst" title="Identifying persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become an urgent public health challenge because of increasing HCV-related morbidity and mortality, low rates of awareness among infected persons, and the advent of curative therapies (1). Since 2012, CDC has recommended testing of all persons born during 1945-1965 (baby boomers) for identification of chronic HCV infection (1); urban emergency departments (EDs) are well positioned venues for detecting HCV infection among these persons. The United States has witnessed an unprecedented opioid overdose epidemic since 2013 that derives primarily from commonly injected illicit opioids (e.g., heroin and fentanyl) (2). This injection drug use behavior has led to an increase in HCV infections among persons who inject drugs and heightened concern about increases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV infection within communities disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis (3,4). However, targeted strategies for identifying HCV infection among persons who inject drugs is challenging (5,6). During 2015-2016, EDs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; Highland Hospital, Oakland, California; Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; and Boston University Medical Center, Massachusetts, adopted opt-out (i.e., patients can implicitly accept or explicitly decline testing), universal hepatitis C screening for all adult patients. ED staff members offered HCV antibody (anti-HCV) screening to patients who were unaware of their status.* During similar observation periods at each site, ED staff members tested 14,252 patients and identified an overall 9.2% prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV among the adult patient population. Among the 1945-1965 birth cohort, prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV (13.9%) was significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) (16.0%) than among non-Hispanic whites (whites) (12.2%) (p&lt;0.001). Among persons born after 1965, overall prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV was 6.7% and was significantly higher among whites (15.3%) than among blacks (3.2%) (p&lt;0.001). These findings highlight age-associated differences in racial/ethnic prevalences and the potential for ED venues and opt-out, universal testing strategies to improve HCV infection awareness and surveillance for hard-to-reach populations. This opt-out, universal testing approach is supported by new recommendations for hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of positive results for HCV infection is &lt;0.1% (7).">

        <span class="abst" title="Infection with (SAg)-producing bacteria may precede or follow infection with or vaccination against influenza A viruses (IAVs). However, how SAgs alter the breadth of IAV-specific CD8+ T cell (TCD8) responses is unknown. Moreover, whether recall responses mediating heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs are manipulated by SAgs remains unexplored. We employed wild-type (WT) and mutant bacterial SAgs, SAg-sufficient/deficient Staphylococcus aureus strains, and WT, mouse-adapted and reassortant IAV strains in multiple in vivo settings to address the above questions. Contrary to the popular view that SAgs delete or anergize T cells, systemic administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen before intraperitoneal IAV immunization enlarged the clonal size of 'select' IAV-specific TCD8 and reshuffled the hierarchical pattern of primary TCD8 responses. This was mechanistically linked to the TCR Vβ makeup of the impacted clones rather than their immunodominance status. Importantly, SAg-expanded TCD8 retained their IFN-γ production and cognate cytolytic capacities. The enhancing effect of SEB on immunodominant TCD8 was also evident in primary responses to vaccination with heat-inactivated and live attenuated IAV strains administered intramuscularly and intranasally, respectively. Interestingly, in prime-boost immunization settings, the outcome of SEB administration depended strictly upon the time point at which this SAg was introduced. Accordingly, SEB injection before priming raised CD127highKLRG1low memory precursor frequencies and augmented the anamnestic responses of SEB-binding TCD8. By comparison, introducing SEB before boosting diminished recall responses to IAV-derived epitopes drastically and indiscriminately. This was accompanied by lower Ki67 and higher Fas, LAG-3 and PD-1 levels consistent with a pro-apoptotic and/or exhausted phenotype. Therefore, SAgs can have contrasting impacts on anti-IAV immunity depending on the naïve/memory status and the TCR composition of exposed TCD8. Finally, local administration of SEB or infection with SEB-producing S. aureus enhanced pulmonary TCD8 responses to IAV. Our findings have clear implications for superinfections and prophylactic vaccination.">

This review synthetizes the knowledge of the diversity and distribution of honey-bee-infecting viruses, including recent data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS). After presenting the diversity of viruses and their corresponding symptoms, we surveyed the scientific literature for the prevalence of these pathogens across the globe. The geographical distribution shows that the most prevalent viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus, black queen cell virus and acute paralysis complex) are also the most widely distributed. We discuss the ecological drivers that influence the distribution of these pathogens in worldwide honey bee populations. Besides the natural transmission routes and the resulting temporal dynamics, global trade contributes to their dissemination. As recent evidence shows that these viruses are often multihost pathogens, their spread is a risk for both the beekeeping industry and the pollination services provided by managed and wild pollinators.">

        <span class="abst" title="West Nile virus (WNV) has consistently been reported to be associated with human cases of illness in the region near Chicago, Illinois. However, the number of reported cases of human illness varies across years, with intermittent outbreaks. Several dynamic factors, including temperature, rainfall, and infection status of vector mosquito populations, are responsible for much of these observed variations. However, local landscape structure and human demographic characteristics also play a key role. The geographic and temporal scales used to analyze such complex data affect the observed associations. Here, we used spatial and statistical modeling approaches to investigate the factors that drive the outcome of WNV human illness on fine temporal and spatial scales. Our approach included multi-level modeling of long-term weekly data from 2005 to 2016, with weekly measures of mosquito infection, human illness and weather combined with more stable landscape and demographic factors on the geographical scale of 1000m hexagons. We found that hot weather conditions, warm winters, and higher MIR in earlier weeks increased the probability of an area of having a WNV human case. Higher population and the proportion of urban light intensity in an area also increased the probability of observing a WNV human case. A higher proportion of open water sources, percentage of grass land, deciduous forests, and housing built post 1990 decreased the probability of having a WNV case. Additionally, we found that cumulative positive mosquito pools up to 31 weeks can strongly predict the total annual human WNV cases in the Chicago region. This study helped us to improve our understanding of the fine-scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability of human WNV cases.">

        <span class="abst" title="In South East Asia, dengue epidemics have increased in size and geographical distribution in recent years. We examined the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological characteristics of reported dengue cases in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo-an area where sylvatic and urban circulation of pathogens are known to intersect. Using a public health data set of routinely notified dengue cases in Sabah between 2010 and 2016, we described demographic and entomological risk factors, both before and after a 2014 change in the clinical case definition for the disease. Annual dengue incidence rates were spatially variable over the 7-year study period from 2010-2016 (state-wide mean annual incidence of 21 cases/100,000 people; range 5-42/100,000), but were highest in rural localities in the western districts of the state (Kuala Penyu, Nabawan, Tenom and Kota Marudu). Eastern districts exhibited lower overall dengue rates, although a high proportion of severe (haemorrhagic) dengue cases (44%) were focused in Sandakan and Tawau. Dengue incidence was highest for those aged between 10 and 29 years (24/100,000), and was slightly higher for males compared to females. Available vector surveillance data indicated that during large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 the mosquito Aedes albopictus was more prevalent in both urban and rural households (House Index of 64%) than Ae. aegypti (15%). Demographic patterns remained unchanged both before and after the dengue case definition was changed; however, in the years following the change, reported case numbers increased substantially. Overall, these findings suggest that dengue outbreaks in Sabah are increasing in both urban and rural settings. Future studies to better understand the drivers of risk in specific age groups, genders and geographic locations, and to test the potential role of Ae. albopictus in transmission, may help target dengue prevention and control efforts.">

Uninfected human patients and ferret URT microbiomes have stable healthy ecostate communities both within and between individuals. In contrast, infected patients and ferrets exhibit large changes in bacterial community composition over time and between individuals. The unhealthy ecostates of infected individuals progress towards the healthy ecostate, coinciding with viral clearance and recovery. Pseudomonadales associate statistically with the disturbed microbiomes of infected individuals.

We aim to determine the etiologies, severity, and outcomes in adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia and to study the impact of empirical antibiotic therapy on patient outcomes. Methods:We performed a prospective observational cohort study involving adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia in Hong Kong. Sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood, and urine were collected for bacterial culture, molecular tests for detection of viruses and atypical pathogens, and antigen tests. Multivariable logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to determine independent factors associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality. Results:From February 2017 to July 2018, 258 patients were enrolled. The median age was 73 (interquartile range, 61-80) years, 66% were male, 57% had underlying chronic illnesses, 13% had CURB-65 score ≥3, and 10% had higher 1-year mortality. Pathogens were identified in 45% of patients; 20% had viral, 15% had bacterial, and 9% had polymicrobial pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), influenza virus (12%), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.2%) were the most common bacterial, viral, and atypical pathogens, respectively. Nonadherence to local empirical antibiotic treatment guidelines (primarily recommending beta-lactam and doxycycline) was observed in 25% and was independently associated with prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days) and higher mortality, after adjustment for age, underlying chronic illness, and disease severity. Conclusions:Adherence to treatment guidelines was associated with shorter hospitalization and improved survival. We provided evidence for the use of doxycycline for coverage of atypical pathogens in nonsevere pneumonia.">

While low herd immunity levels to any one of the four antigenic types of DENV predispose populations to outbreaks, viral genetic determinants that confer greater fitness for epidemic spread is an important but poorly understood contributor of dengue outbreaks. Here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 DENV2 outbreak in Puerto Rico. We found that five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein reduced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a byproduct of host 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity. The resulting increase in sfRNA relative to gRNA levels not only inhibited type I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism, but also enabled sfRNA to compete with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles. We suggest that delivery of sfRNA to new susceptible cells to inhibit type I IFN induction before gRNA replication and without the need for further de novo sfRNA synthesis could form a &quot;preemptive strike&quot; strategy against DENV.">

        <span class="abst" title="The live smallpox vaccine was a historical first and highly effective vaccine. However, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (VACV) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. Therefore, after global eradication of smallpox, VACV vaccination was stopped. For this reason, most of the human population worldwide lacks specific immunity against not only smallpox, but also other zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Outbreaks of diseases caused by these viruses have increasingly occurred in humans on different continents. However, use of the classical live VACV vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV-infected patients). Therefore, highly attenuated VACV variants that preserve their immunogenicity are needed. This review discusses current ideas about the development of a humoral and cellular immune response to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination and describes genetic engineering approaches that could be utilized to generate safe and highly immunogenic live VACV vaccines.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Previous studies have proven that the closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) was an effective intervention to reduce human risk of avian influenza A (H7N9) infection, but evidence is limited on the impact of scale and duration of LPMs closure on the transmission of H7N9. METHOD:Five cities (i.e., Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou) with the largest number of H7N9 cases in mainland China from 2013 to 2017 were selected in this study. Data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 human cases in those five cities were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza Centre. The detailed information of LPMs closure (i.e., area and duration) was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture. We used a generalized linear model with a Poisson link to estimate the effect of LPMs closure, reported as relative risk reduction (RRR). We used classification and regression trees (CARTs) model to select and quantify the dominant factor of H7N9 infection. RESULTS:All five cities implemented the LPMs closure, and the risk of H7N9 infection decreased significantly after LPMs closure with RRR ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. Respectively, a long-term LPMs closure for 10-13 weeks elicited a sustained and highly significant risk reduction of H7N9 infection (RRR = 0.98). Short-time LPMs closure with 2 weeks in every epidemic did not reduce the risk of H7N9 infection (p &gt; 0.05). Partially closed LPMs in some suburbs contributed only 35% for reduction rate (RRR = 0.35). Shenzhen implemented partial closure for first 3 epidemics (p &gt; 0.05) and all closure in the latest 2 epidemic waves (RRR = 0.64). CONCLUSION:Our findings suggest that LPMs all closure in whole city can be a highly effective measure comparing with partial closure (i.e. only urban closure, suburb and rural remain open). Extend the duration of closure and consider permanently closing the LPMs will help improve the control effect. The effect of LPMs closure seems greater than that of meteorology on H7N9 transmission.">

Our study investigated whether hematological parameters such as neutrophil (N), lymphocyte (L), platelet (PLT), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) contributed in diagnosing influenza virus infections and in discriminating other respiratory infections. METHODS:We retrospectively analyzed the laboratory characteristics of 307 patients with respiratory infections caused by influenza/non-influenza virus and bacteria. The diagnostic abilities of hematological indexes were evaluated in the patients compared with 100 healthy people. RESULTS:The hematological parameters in patients with influenza virus infection were dramatically altered compared with those in the controls. Additionally, among the systemic inflammatory markers, the sensitivity of NLR for influenza detection was higher than that of N and L. PLT was significantly lower in influenza virus-positive infection than in influenza virus-negative infection. Moreover, when patients with influenza virus infection were cured, PLT returned to a normal level. The red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels of influenza virus infection were higher than those of bacterial infection. Compared with traditional N and L, NLR and platelet-to-neutrophil (PNR) showed greater significance between influenza virus and bacterial infection (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with high sensitivity is a preferable diagnostic tool to screen influenza virus-infected patients than N and L. PLT accounts in the differential diagnoses of respiratory infections due to influenza virus and other pathogens among patients. In addition, RBC, Hb, NLR, and PNR can significantly differentiate between influenza virus infections and bacterial infections.">

        <span class="abst" title="Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe human disease with mortality rates of up to 30%. The disease is widespread in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The last few years have seen disease emergence in Spain for the first time and disease re-emergence in other regions of the world after periods of inactivity. Factors, such as climate change, movement of infected ticks, animals, and changes in human activity, are likely to broaden endemic foci. There are therefore concerns that CCHF might emerge in currently nonendemic regions. The absence of approved vaccines or therapies heightens these concerns; thus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is listed by the World Health Organization as a priority organism. However, the current sporadic nature of CCHF cases may call for targeted vaccination of risk groups as opposed to mass vaccinations. CCHF vaccine development has accelerated in recent years, partly because of the discovery of CCHF animal models. In this review, we discuss CCHF risk groups who are most likely to benefit from vaccine development, the merits and demerits of available CCHF animal models, and the various approaches which have been explored for CCHF vaccine development. Lastly, we present concluding remarks and research areas which can be further explored to enhance the available CCHFV vaccine data.">

In this study, the prevalence of PDR was evaluated in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in China. METHODS:Blood samples were obtained from 1943 patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2017 from 13 provinces or cities in China. Pol sequences were used to analyze drug resistance and construct transmission networks. Logistic regression model was used to estimate the potential factors associated with PDR. RESULTS:In total, 1711 eligible patients (76.0% male; 87.8% aged ≥ 25 years) were included, of which 117 (6.8%) had PDR. The highest rates of PDR were 12.2% in Liangshan Prefecture of Sichuan and 9.3 and 8.9% in Dehong and Lincang Prefecture of Yunnan. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PDR was significantly higher among intravenous drug users (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.57-4.44) and individuals from Liangshan, Dehong, and Lincang (aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.26-3.30). In total, 754 sequences were used to generate 164 transmission networks. Five transmission networks had two or three sequences containing the same mutations, two networks contained subjects from Liangshan, and one network contained subjects from Dehong. CONCLUSIONS:Overall, the PDR prevalence was moderate, with a particularly high prevalence in areas with severe HIV epidemics. These results indicate the importance of continuous PDR monitoring in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Zika virus (ZIKV, genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. This virus has become an emerging concern of global public health with recent epidemics associated to neurological complications in the pacific and America. ZIKV is the most frequently amplified arbovirus in southeastern Senegal. However, this virus and its adult vectors are undetectable during the dry season. The aim of this study was to investigate how ZIKV and its vectors are maintained locally during the dry season. METHODS:Soil, sand, and detritus contained in 1339 potential breeding sites (tree holes, rock holes, fruit husks, discarded containers, used tires) were collected in forest, savannah, barren and village land covers and flooded for eggs hatching. The emerging larvae were reared to adult, identified, and blood fed for F1 production. The F0 and F1 adults were identified and tested for ZIKV by Reverse Transcriptase-Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS:A total of 1016 specimens, including 13 Aedes species, emerged in samples collected in the land covers and breeding sites investigated. Ae. aegypti was the dominant species representing 56.6% of this fauna with a high plasticity. Ae. furcifer and Ae. luteocephalus were found in forest tree holes, Ae. taylori in forest and village tree holes, Ae. vittatus in rock holes. ZIKV was detected from 4 out of the 82 mosquito pools tested. Positive pools included Ae. bromeliae (2 pools), Ae. unilineatus (1 pool), and Ae. vittatus (1 pool), indicating that the virus is maintained in these Aedes eggs during the dry season. CONCLUSION:Our investigation identified breeding sites types and land cover classes where several ZIKV vectors are maintained, and their maintenance rates during the dry season in southeastern Senegal. The maintenance of the virus in these vectors in nature could explain its early amplification at the start of the rainy season in this area.">

Many host factors have been identified that act as regulators of the inflammatory response and virus replication in influenza A virus (IAV) infected cells including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor (NLR) family proteins. Evidence is emerging that NLRC5, the largest NLR member, is a regulator of host immune responses against invading pathogens including viruses; however, its role in the avian immune system and AIV pathogenesis has not been fully explored. In this study, we found that NLRC5 is activated by a range of low and highly pathogenic AIVs in primary chicken lung cells and a chicken macrophage cell line. Further, siRNA mediated NLRC5 knockdown in chicken macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in AIV replication which was associated with the upregulation of genes associated with activated NFκB signaling pathway. The knockdown of NLRC5 enhanced the expression of genes known to be associated with viral defense and decreased innate cytokine gene expression following AIV infection. Overall, our investigation strongly suggests that NLRC5 is a pro-viral factor during IAV infection in chicken and may contribute to pathogenesis through innate cytokine regulation. Further studies are warranted to investigate the IAV protein(s) that may regulate activation of NLRC5.">

Since the distribution range of both diseases is similar in Africa, it makes sense to use a bivalent vaccine to control them. This may lead to the more consistent and sustainable use of vaccination against Rift Valley fever through a more cost-effective vaccine. In this study, a recombinant lumpy skin disease virus was constructed in which the thymidine kinase gene was used as the insertion site for the Gn and Gc protective glycoprotein genes of Rift Valley fever virus using homologous recombination. Selection markers, the enhanced green fluorescent protein and Escherichia coli guanidine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt), were used for selection of recombinant virus and in a manner enabling a second recombination event to occur upon removal of the gpt selection-pressure allowing the removal of both marker genes in the final product. This recombinant virus, LSD-RVF.mf, was selected to homogeneity, characterized and evaluated in cattle as a vaccine to show protection against both lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever in cattle. The results demonstrate that the LSD-RVF.mf is safe, immunogenic and can protect cattle against both diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Against the background of the international public health emergency related to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in addition to other recent large Ebola epidemics, the issue of transmission due to viral persistence from survivors' body fluids is becoming increasingly urgent. Clinical research in which body fluids play a role is critical and semen testing programs are part of the suggested response to the outbreak. Broad acceptance and understanding of testing programs and research, often in resource poor settings, is essential for the success and sustainability of clinical studies and an accurate epidemic response. Study participants' perceptions on the collection of body fluids are therefore relevant for the programmatic planning and implementation of clinical studies. STUDY AIM AND METHODS:In this qualitative study we aimed to explore the perceptions on bio-sampling in the Sierra Leone Ebola Virus Persistence Study (SLEVP study). We were interested to understand how norms on gender and sexuality related to perceptions and experiences of study participants and staff, specifically, in what way perceptions of the body, on intimacy and on body fluids related to the study process. We purposively sampled former study participants for in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions. We conducted 56 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions with 93 participants. In a participatory approach we included study participants in the analysis of data. RESULTS:Overall the SLEVP study was well perceived by study participants and study staff. Study participants conceived the testing of their body fluids positively and saw it as a useful means to know their status. However, some study participants were ambivalent and sometimes reluctant towards sampling of certain body fluids (especially semen, blood and vaginal fluid) due to religious or cultural reasons. Self-sampling was described by study participants as a highly unusual phenomenon. Several narratives were related to the loss of body fluids (especially semen) that would make men weak and powerless, or women dizzy and sick (especially blood). Some rumors indicated mistrust related to study aims that may have been expressions of broader societal challenges and historical circumstances. These reservations could eventually be overcome by guaranteeing confidentiality and privacy and by comprehensive professional counseling. CONCLUSION:In the course of the sampling exercise, study participants were often obliged to transgress cultural and intimate boundaries. It is therefore important to understand the potential importance some of these perceptions have on the recruitment of study participants and the acceptability of studies, on a symbolic as well as a structural level. In order to capture any reservations it is necessary to provide plenty of possibilities of information sharing and follow-up of continuous consent.">

Ross River virus (RRV) belongs to the arthritogenic group of alphaviruses, which largely cause disease characterized by debilitating polyarthritis, rash, and fever. There is no specific treatment or licensed vaccine available, and the mechanisms of protective humoral immunity in humans are poorly understood. Here, we describe naturally occurring human mAbs specific to RRV, isolated from subjects with a prior natural infection. These mAbs potently neutralize RRV infectivity in cell culture and block infection through multiple mechanisms, including prevention of viral attachment, entry, and fusion. Some of the most potently neutralizing mAbs inhibited binding of RRV to Mxra8, a recently discovered alpahvirus receptor. Epitope mapping studies identified the A and B domains of the RRV E2 protein as the major antigenic sites for the human neutralizing antibody response. In experiments in mice, these mAbs were protective against cinical disease and reduced viral burden in multiple tissues, suggesting a potential therapeutic use for humans.">

Since World War II, the four DENV serotypes have circulated regularly in NC. The epidemiological profile, however, has evolved over the last ten years, with the persistence of DENV-1 circulation and the co-circulation of several DENV serotypes. The current study evaluated the ability of Ae. aegypti from NC to transmit four DENV serotypes (and two DENV-1 genotypes) isolated during recent outbreaks in NC. An Ae. aegypti F1 generation was twice independently orally challenged with each DENV strain (107 FFU/ml). Infection, dissemination and transmission rates and transmission efficiency were measured at day 7 and 14 post-exposure, as well as the quantity of infectious virus particles. Mosquito infection was observed as early as 7 days post-infection. Infection rates between 18 and 58% were measured for all DENV serotypes/genotypes tested. Although dissemination rates ranged from 78 to 100%, transmission efficiencies were low, with values not exceeding 21% at 14 days post-infection for all DENV strains. This study shows that NC Ae. aegypti are moderately competent for DENV in laboratory conditions. In link with epidemiological data, these results suggest implication of other factors in the sustained circulation of DENV-1 in New Caledonia.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recent expansions of vector-borne diseases highlight the need for improved surveillance, especially in resource-poor settings. Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) share the same vectors as well as similar clinical presentations, suggesting that combined surveillance would be useful. We hypothesized that blood spotted on dengue rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could be harnessed for sample collection in remote areas for subsequent detection of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). CHIKV and ZIKV dilutions were spotted on dengue RDTs (SD BIOLINE Dengue DUO, Standard Diagnostics, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea), dried, and extracted. As reference, aliquots of each viral dilution were directly extracted. Using specific RT-qPCR tests, both viruses were successfully detected from RDT extracts. However, the limit of detection was slightly lower in comparison to direct extracts, two logfold for CHIKV and one logfold for ZIKV. For analysis of temperature stability, DENV dilutions were spotted on RDTs and stored for up to 2 months at -80°C, 4°C, or 35°C before testing. Storage of RDTs for 2 months at 35°C did not compromise detection of RNA by RT-qPCR; only minimal degradation was observed. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of using dengue RDTs for DENV/CHIKV/ZIKV combined surveillance in areas without access to laboratory facilities. Further investigations are needed for evaluation of tri-viral surveillance under field conditions using patient samples. Large-scale implementation of surveillance for these viruses is of crucial public health importance for the early detection of epidemics. This method also has important implications for improving understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the three viruses.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection constitute a deadly infectious disease synergy disease and major public health problem throughout the world. The risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 21 times higher than the rest of the world population. The overlap of latent TB infection and HIV infection has resulted in marked increases in TB incidence in countries with dual epidemics. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most significant way to reduce incident TB in PLHIV, besides early ART initiation, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is the key intervention to prevent TB among PLHIV. This prospective cohort and longitudinal study aimed to document; retention, adherence, development of active TB disease, possible adverse drug reactions and completion among patients initiated on IPT in Jan 2019. METHODS:This was both a prospective cohort and longitudinal study nested within a national quality improvement collaborative in which multiple quality improvement teams tested changes in care delivery to improve the delivery of IPT. The prospective cohort were HIV patients without TB disease initiated on a dosage of Isoniazid 300 mg/day for adults and 150 mg/day for children for a period of 6 months. Association statistics were used to describe patient characteristics and outcomes. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.05 were used to determine linear by linear associations between patient characteristics assumed to influence both primary and secondary outcomes. Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were included in the logistical regression model. The final model included those factors that retained statistical significance. The odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) along with its 95% confidence interval were used to determine the power of relationship in determining the outcomes of interest. The model was tested for fitness using goodness-of-fit Hosmer-Lemeshow tests. RESULTS:The completion of IPT was at 89%. A significant proportion of patients adhered to treatment (89%) and kept their appointment schedules-retention (89%). All patients (100%) received IPT at each appointment visit. Only 4% of patients experienced side effects of isoniazid (INH) but none of them developed active TB at the end of the 6 month INH dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of covariates of IPT completion revealed a strong and statistical association between IPT completion and age, gender, retention and side effects of INH. Our multivariate model found that children below 15 years were less likely to complete INH than patients ≥ 15 years (AOR = 0.416, p = 0.230, df = 1). Female patients were 2 times more likely to complete INH dose than male patients (AOR = 1.598, p = 0.018). Patients who kept all their appointment schedules were 10 times more likely to complete IPT than those who missed one or more schedules (AOR = 10.726, p = 0.000, df = 1). We also found that patients who did not report any side effects associated with INH were 2 times more likely to complete INH (AOR = 1.958, p = 0.016, df = 1) than patients who reported one or more side effects. CONCLUSION:Treatment completion is the end-point of the IPT initiation strategy in Uganda. With a completion rate of 89%, our results seem re-assuring and suggest that improvement collaborative is an effective approach to achieving results through combined efforts. The high rates of completion are encouraging indicators of progress in the implementation of collaborative activities in the study setting. However, such collaboratives would require periodic evaluation to prevent possible relapses in progress attained.">

Here we show that the length of time between DENV/ZIKV infections has a qualitative impact on controlling early ZIKV replication. Depletion of DENV2-specific Abs in sera confirmed that those type-specific Abs do not contribute to ZIKV control. We show that the magnitude and durability of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) induced by a secondary ZIKV infection is modest compared to the response induced after a secondary heterologous DENV infection. Our in vivo results are showing a complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses characterized by a high frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) correlating with an increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication which is time dependent. Taken together, our results suggest that early after ZIKV infection other mechanisms such as the innate and cellular immune responses may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. Regardless of the time elapsed between infections there was no evidence of in vivo antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV by DENV immunity. These findings have pivotal implications while interpreting ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations, diagnostic results interpretation and vaccine designs and schedules among others.">

However, some MSM do not disclose their same-sex behavior and could impact the transmission and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Here, we evaluated the role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission in Guangzhou, China. Methods:The HIV-1 pol sequences were obtained from HIV-infected subjects from 2008 to 2015. A transmission network was constructed using HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) at a pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%. The position of nondisclosed MSM in the network was determined by centrality analysis. Results:Nondisclosed MSM were inferred in 9.92% (61 of 615) of slightly older, self-reported non-MSM (P = .006). They were more likely to be married (P = .002) and less educated (P &lt; .001) than the MSM with whom they clustered. Closeness centrality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (P &lt; .001), indicating the central position of nondisclosed MSM in the networks. The average shortest path length was smaller for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (P &lt; .001), whereas radiality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM, suggesting a relatively greater contribution of nondisclosed MSM in transmitting HIV-1 than MSM. Assortativity analysis indicated that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link each other with coefficient of 0.025. Conclusions:Nondisclosed MSM are a specific group, and they play an important role in HIV-1 transmission. They could be bisexual and might increase the risk of HIV-1 infection to their sex partners. Therefore, specific prevention and intervention targeting nondisclosed MSM are urgently needed.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The seasonal influenza epidemic is an important public health issue worldwide. Early predictive identification of patients with potentially worse outcome is important in the emergency department (ED). Similarly as with bacterial infection, influenza can cause sepsis. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score as prognostic predictors for ED patients with influenza. METHODS:This single-center, retrospective cohort study investigated data that was retrieved from a hospital-based research database. Adult ED patients (age ≥ 18 at admission) with laboratory-proven influenza from 2010 to 2016 were included for data analysis. The initial SIRS and qSOFA scores were both collected. The primary outcome was the utility of each score in the prediction of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS:For the study period, 3561 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality was 2.7% (95 patients). When the qSOFA scores were 0, 1, 2, and 3, the percentages of in-hospital mortality were 0.6, 7.2, 15.9, and 25%, respectively. Accordingly, the odds ratios (ORs) were 7.72, 11.92, and 22.46, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 24 and 96.2%, respectively, when the qSOFA score was ≥2. However, the SIRS criteria showed no significant associations with the primary outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.864, which is significantly higher than that with SIRS, where the AUC was 0.786 (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:The qSOFA score potentially is a useful prognostic predictor for influenza and could be applied in the ED as a risk stratification tool. However, qSOFA may not be a good screening tool for triage because of its poor sensitivity. The SIRS criteria showed poor predictive performance in influenza for mortality as an outcome. Further research is needed to determine the role of these predictive tools in influenza and in other viral infections.">

Evidence demonstrating differential roles for antiviral effector and resident memory T-cell subsets in virologic control and immunopathology in the CNS will be discussed. Potential therapeutic targets emanating from a growing understanding of T-cell-initiated neuropathology that impacts learning and memory will also be delineated. RECENT FINDINGS:The critical role for T cells in preventing and clearing CNS infections became incontrovertible during the era of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Recent studies have further defined differential roles of T-cell subsets, including resident memory T cells (Trm), in antiviral immunity and, unexpectedly, in postinfectious cognitive dysfunction. Mechanisms of T-cell-mediated effects include differential innate immune signaling within neural cells that are virus-specific. SUMMARY:T-cell cytokines that are essential for cell-mediated virologic control during neurotropic viral infections have recently been identified as potential targets to prevent post-infection memory disorders. Further identification of T-cell subsets, their antigen specificity, and postinfection localization of Trm will enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies through minimization of immunopathology.">

Fortunately, to date there has been no known autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in New Orleans. No studies of the vector competence of local populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for Zika virus transmission have been conducted. To determine if New Orleans Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are competent for Zika virus, mosquitoes were reared to generation F3 from eggs collected in New Orleans during the 2018 mosquito season. Adults were fed an infectious blood meal and kept for 15 days in an environmental chamber. Transmission assays were conducted at 4, 10, and 15 days post exposure and RT-PCR was run on bodies and saliva to detect the presence of Zika virus RNA. We observed remarkably low susceptibility of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from New Orleans to a Zika strain from Panama after oral challenge. These results suggest a limited risk of Zika virus transmission should it be introduced to the New Orleans area, and may partially explain why no transmission was detected in Louisiana during the 2016 epidemic in the Americas, despite multiple known travel associated introductions to New Orleans. Despite these results these mosquito populations are known to be competent vectors for some other mosquito-borne viruses and control measures should not be relaxed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two divergent arboviruses: dengue virus-2 (DENV-2; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae, Alphavirus). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin-1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for both viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means.">

Dengue virus capsid protein associates to differentcellular compartments but its function in these locations is largely unknown. We evaluated the diffusion of capsid inside the celland determined a higher effective diffusion coefficient in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. Using advanced fluorescencecorrelation methods, including the recently developed two-dimensional pair correlation analysis, we constructed for the first timehigh resolution maps of capsid mobility in an infected cell. We observed that the motion of capsid in the nucleoplasm-nucleolusinterface was highly organized, indicating an obstacle in this interface. Although nucleoli are membraneless structures, theydisplayed liquid-liquid phase separation. Once inside nucleoli, the protein showed isotropic mobility, indicating free diffusion orimmobilized capsid inside these structures.

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Influenza A (H5N1) virus is a global concern with potential as a pandemic threat. High sequence variability of influenza A viruses is a major challenge for effective vaccine design. A continuing goal towards this is a greater understanding of influenza A (H5N1) proteome sequence diversity in the context of the immune system (antigenic diversity), the dynamics of mutation, and effective strategies to overcome the diversity for vaccine design. Methods:Herein, we report a comprehensive study of the dynamics of H5N1 mutations by analysis of the aligned overlapping nonamer positions (1-9, 2-10, etc.) of more than 13,000 protein sequences of avian and human influenza A (H5N1) viruses, reported over at least 50 years. Entropy calculations were performed on 9,408 overlapping nonamer position of the proteome to study the diversity in the context of immune system. The nonamers represent the predominant length of the binding cores for peptides recognized by the cellular immune system. To further dissect the sequence diversity, each overlapping nonamer position was quantitatively analyzed for four patterns of sequence diversity motifs: index, major, minor and unique. Results:Almost all of the aligned overlapping nonamer positions of each viral proteome exhibited variants (major, minor, and unique) to the predominant index sequence. Each variant motif displayed a characteristic pattern of incidence change in relation to increased total variants. The major variant exhibited a restrictive pyramidal incidence pattern, with peak incidence at 50% total variants. Post this peak incidence, the minor variants became the predominant motif for majority of the positions. Unique variants, each sequence observed only once, were present at nearly all of the nonamer positions. The diversity motifs (index and variants) demonstrated complex inter-relationships, with motif switching being a common phenomenon. Additionally, 25 highly conserved sequences were identified to be shared across viruses of both hosts, with half conserved to several other influenza A subtypes. Discussion:The presence of distinct sequences (nonatypes) at nearly all nonamer positions represents a large repertoire of reported viral variants in the proteome, which influence the variability dynamics of the viral population. This work elucidated and provided important insights on the components that make up the viral diversity, delineating inherent patterns in the organization of sequence changes that function in the viral fitness-selection. Additionally, it provides a catalogue of all the mutational changes involved in the dynamics of H5N1 viral diversity for both avian and human host populations. This work provides data relevant for the design of prophylactics and therapeutics that overcome the diversity of the virus, and can aid in the surveillance of existing and future strains of influenza viruses.">

The lack of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and antivirals, is a limiting factor for the containment of any virus outbreak. To develop such antivirals a profound understanding of the viral replication process is essential. The L protein of bunyaviruses is a multi-functional and multi-domain protein performing both virus transcription and genome replication and, therefore, is an ideal drug target. We established expression and purification procedures for the full-length L protein of SFTSV. By combining single-particle electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we obtained 3D models covering ∼70% of the SFTSV L protein in the apo-conformation including the polymerase core region, the endonuclease and the cap-binding domain. We compared this first L structure of the Phenuiviridae family to the structures of La Crosse peribunyavirus L protein and influenza orthomyxovirus polymerase. Together with a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the distinct functions of SFTSV L protein, this work provides a solid framework for future structural and functional studies of L protein-RNA interactions and the development of antiviral strategies against this group of emerging human pathogens.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:An outbreak of respiratory disease associated with adenovirus type 7 occurred in a boot camp in China and was characterized by many cases, severe symptoms, and intrapulmonary infection in many patients. METHODS:We implemented a series of comprehensive preventive and control measures. We analyzed the incubation period and generation time by using the maximum likelihood method, assessed the symptom period and hospitalization duration using the Kaplan-Meier method, and estimated the basic reproductive number and dormitory transmission rate by using established methods. RESULTS:The epidemic lasted for 30 days, and 375 individuals were affected. Overall, 109 patients were hospitalized, and 266 individuals were isolated and treated. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0 to 5.4 days). The median generation time was 7.3 days (95% CI: 7.1 to 7.6 days). The median symptom period was 6 days (95% CI: 6 to 7 days). The median hospitalization duration was 9 days (95% CI: 9 to 11 days). The basic reproductive number was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.6 to 5.6), and the dormitory transmission rate was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18). CONCLUSION:Patients in the early stage of the epidemic were treated as having a regular cold and were not isolated; therefore, the virus continued to be transmitted to other susceptible individuals.">

At these scales, the timing, duration and magnitude of epidemics vary substantially, but the underlying causes of this variation are poorly understood. Here, based on analyses of a 15-year city-level dataset of 18,250 laboratory-confirmed and antigenically-characterised influenza virus infections from Australia, we investigate the effects of previously hypothesised environmental and virological drivers of influenza epidemics. We find that anomalous fluctuations in temperature and humidity do not predict local epidemic onset timings. We also find that virus antigenic change has no consistent effect on epidemic size. In contrast, epidemic onset time and heterosubtypic competition have substantial effects on epidemic size and composition. Our findings suggest that the relationship between influenza population immunity and epidemiology is more complex than previously supposed and that the strong influence of short-term processes may hinder long-term epidemiological forecasts.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The global spread of Aedes albopictus has exposed new geographical areas to the risk of dengue and chikungunya virus transmission. Several autochthonous transmission events have occurred in recent decades in Southern Europe and many indicators suggest that it will become more frequent in this region in the future. Environmental, socioeconomic and climatic factors are generally considered to trigger the emergence of these viruses. Accordingly, a greater knowledge of the determinants of this emergence in a European context is necessary to develop adapted surveillance and control strategies, and public health interventions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Using French surveillance data collected from between 2010 and 2018 in areas of Southern France where Ae. albopictus is already established, we assessed factors associated with the autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya. Cases leading to autochthonous transmission were compared with those without subsequent transmission using binomial regression. We identified a long reporting delay (≥ 21 days) of imported cases to local health authorities as the main driver for autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Southern France. The presence of wooded areas around the cases' place of residence and the accumulation of heat during the season also increased the risk of autochthonous arbovirus transmission. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings could inform policy-makers when developing strategies to the emerging threats of dengue and chikungunya in Southern Europe and can be extrapolated in this area to other viruses such as Zika and yellow fever, which share the same vector. Furthermore, our results allow a more accurate characterization of the environments most at risk, and highlight the importance of implementing surveillance systems which ensure the timely reporting and of imported cases and swift interventions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dengue fever (DF) is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV 1-4). Globally, DF incidence and disease burden have increased in the recent past. Initially implicated in a 1982 outbreak, DENV-2 recently reemerged in Kenya causing outbreaks between 2011 and 2014 and more recently 2017-8. The origin and the evolutionary patterns that may explain the epidemiological expansion and increasing impact of DENV-2 in Kenya remain poorly understood. Using whole-genome sequencing, samples collected during the 2011-4 and 2017-8 dengue outbreaks were analyzed. Additional DENV-2 genomes were downloaded and pooled together with the fourteen genomes generated in this study. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns of DENV-2 causing outbreaks in Kenya. The findings from this study have shown the first evidence of circulation of two different Cosmopolitan genotype lineages of DENV-2; Cosmopolitan-I (C-I) and Cosmopolitan-II (C-II), in Kenya. Our results put the origin location of C-I lineage in India in 2011, and C-II lineage in Burkina Faso between 1979 and 2013. C-I lineage was the most isolated during recent outbreaks, thus showing the contribution of this newly emerged strain to the increased DENV epidemics in the region. Our findings, backed by evidence of recent local epidemics that have been associated with C-I in Kenya and C-II in Burkina Faso, add to the growing evidence of expanding circulation and the impact of multiple strains of DENV in the region as well as globally. Thus, continued surveillance efforts on DENV activity and its evolutionary trends in the region, would contribute toward effective control and the current vaccine development efforts.">

        <span class="abst" title="Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea and/or vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets. Two different genogroups of PEDV, S INDEL [PEDV variant containing multiple deletions and insertions in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein, G1b] and non-S INDEL (G2b) strains were detected during the diarrheal disease outbreak in US swine in 2013-2014. Similar viruses are also circulating globally. Continuous improvement and update of biosecurity and vaccine strains and protocols are still needed to control and prevent PEDV infections worldwide. Although the non-S INDEL PEDV was highly virulent and the S INDEL PEDV caused milder disease, the latter has the capacity to cause illness in a high number of piglets on farms with low biosecurity and herd immunity. The main PEDV transmission route is fecal-oral, but airborne transmission via the fecal-nasal route may play a role in pig-to-pig and farm-to-farm spread. PEDV infection of neonatal pigs causes fecal virus shedding (alongside frequent detection of PEDV RNA in the nasal cavity), acute viremia, severe atrophic enteritis (mainly jejunum and ileum), and increased pro-inflammatory and innate immune responses. PEDV-specific IgA effector and memory B cells in orally primed sows play a critical role in sow lactogenic immunity and passive protection of piglets. This review focuses on the etiology, transmission, pathogenesis, and prevention and control of PEDV infection.">

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to global public health. Although strategies including vaccines and antiviral drugs have achieved great advances in controlling influenza virus infection, the efficacy of these strategies is limited by the highly frequent mutations in the viral genome and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Our previous study indicated that boosting the immunity of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with the phosphoantigen pamidronate could be a therapeutic strategy to treat seasonal and avian influenza virus infections. However, one notable drawback of γδ-T cell-based immunotherapy is the rapid exhaustion of proliferation and effector responses due to repeated treatments with phosphoantigens. Here, we found that the expression of CD137 was inducible in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells following antigenic stimulation. CD137+ Vγ9Vδ2-T cells displayed more potent antiviral activity against influenza virus than their CD137- counterparts in vitro and in Rag2-/- γc-/- mice. We further demonstrated that CD137 costimulation was essential for Vγ9Vδ2-T cell activation, proliferation, survival and effector functions. In humanized mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD137 costimulation with a recombinant human CD137L protein boosted the therapeutic effects of pamidronate against influenza virus. Our study provides a novel strategy of targeting CD137 to improve the efficacy of Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-based immunotherapy.">

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and determinants of T. pallidum infection in the region. METHODS:A community-based cross-sectional study of 2608 participants aged ≥14 years was conducted in a rural area of southwestern China in 2014-15. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic characteristics and other factors associated with T. pallidum infection. The diagnoses of T. pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were determined by commercial test kits. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlates for T. pallidum infection, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS:The prevalence of T. pallidum infection was 1.2% (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7%). Risk factors varied by gender. In the male group, T. pallidum infection was significantly associated with ever injection drug use (aOR = 9.42, 95% CI 2.47 to 35.87) and HCV infection (aOR = 13.28, 95% CI 3.20 to 51.70). In the female group, correlates for T. pallidum infection included spouse having syphilis (aOR = 126.66, 95% CI 7.58 to 2122.94), ever having blood transfusion (aOR = 10.51, 95% CI 1.58 to 41.21) and HBV infection (aOR = 4.19, 95% CI 1.35 to 10.93). CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of T. pallidum infection was high in the rural area of southwestern China. Correlates for T. pallidum infection varied with sex specific. Intervention should be developed for the prevention and control of T. pallidum infection.">

To investigate if IFITM3 or IFITM3 rs12252-C could affect the antibody response after influenza vaccination, we detected the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) of 171 healthy young adult volunteers (IFITM3 rs12252-C/C, C/T, T/T carriers) and in an IFITM3-deletion mouse model (Ifitm3-/-) after trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) immunization. Seroconversion rates for H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses in IFITM3 rs12252-C/C genotype carriers was lower compared with C/T and T/T donors. Significantly lower levels of specific antibodies to H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses and total IgG were observed in Ifitm3-/- mice. Correspondingly, the numbers of splenic germinal centre (GC) B cells, plasma cells, TIV-specific IgG+ antibody secreting cells and T follicular helper cells in Ifitm3-/- mice were lower compared with wild type mice. However, the number of memory B cells was higher in Ifitm3-/- mice at day 7 after booster. The HI level of Ifitm3-/- mice remained lower than WT mice after third vaccination. Moreover, the transcriptional network regulating GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation was abnormal in Ifitm3-/- mice. Our results indicate that IFITM3 deletion attenuated the antibody response.

        <span class="abst" title="Increasing emergence and spread of Nipah, ZIKV and Ebola case and potential outbreaks threats have been reported in several regions around the globe. Yet, emerging Nipah, Ebola and Zika viral diseases outbreaks have been indirectly linked to substantially globalization of trade and travel, climate change and intense urbanization impact, healthcare and socioeconomic inequities as well in affected community settings. Although no case has been documented in Saudi Arabia, there is a great risk of sudden emergence of any of these viruses and others via introducing among pilgrims coming from endemic regions during ritual ceremonies of mass gatherings. Consequently, promoting and investing on new and sensitive proven effective and innovative surveillance and monitoring approaches, including enhanced risk communication, improved integrated vectors surveillance in addition to improved sustainable highly pathogens surveillance control programs to human motility and environmental sanitation strategies all represent 'One Health' approach implementation strategic core. Initiation, development and implementation leaded by Saudi government and international stakeholders' of new partnership, coordinated response leadership and resource mobilization for multidisciplinary and intersectorial advocacy on emerging viral disease outbreaks, accompanied with R&amp;D roadmap and taskforce is crucial. More efforts in epidemiological and laboratory early screening and surveillance of highly pathogenic germs/microbes, and confirmation of asymptomatic and syndromic cases amongst suspected Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, local vulnerable populations and expatriate workers is vital in generating reliable data and data sharing platform for timely risk communication and tourist information update, appropriate immunization campaigns or safe and efficacious care delivery implementation. Moreover, increase Hajj/Umrah mass gathering emergency outbreak preparedness, pilgrims health education and engagement outreach, pre-, during and post programs coverage and effectiveness is needed through One Health approach integration in attaining pilgrims and local population health safety and security, in advancing Saudi sustainable health development goals.">

Several observational evidences support a potential role of influenza vaccine in cardiovascular prevention. It is estimated that the efficacy of influenza vaccine in preventing myocardial infarction could range between 15% and 45%. Notwithstanding the clear recommendation of numerous guidelines concerning patients with cardiovascular diseases, vaccination rates are still low in the high-risk groups. Influenza vaccine as preventive measure of cardiovascular disease still awaits support from randomized clinical trials.

This information is critical to ensure the treatment necessary to decrease the progression of liver disease and the transmission of both HIV and hepatitis. We assess the prevalence of HIV, HBV and HCV co-infections as well as associated risk factors among PWID. METHODS:The first Bio-Behavioral Surveillance Survey was conducted in 2013-2014 among persons who self-reported to have ever injected drugs. Using respondent-driven sampling, PWID aged 18 years and older were recruited in two cross-sectional samples in Maputo and Nampula/Nacala, two large urban centers of Mozambique. Rapid screening of HIV, HBV (HBsAg) and HCV was performed on site. Data from participants in both cities were pooled to conduct RDS-weighted bivariate analyses with HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections as separate outcomes. Unweighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess correlates of co-infection. RESULTS:Among 492 eligible PWID, 93.3% were male and median age was 32 years [IQR: 27-36]. HIV, HBV and HCV prevalence were respectively 44.9% (95% CI:37.6-52.3), 32.8% (95% CI:26.3-39.5) and 38.3 (95% CI:30.6-45.9). Co-infections of HIV/HBV, HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV were identified in 13.1% (95% CI:7.2-18.9), 29.5% (95% CI:22.2-36.8) and 9.2% (95% CI:3.7-14.7) of PWID, respectively. Older age, history of needle/syringe sharing and history of injection with used needle/syringe was associated with HIV/HBV co-infection. Living in Maputo city, have older age, history of needle/syringe sharing and history of injection with used needle/syringe was associated with HIV/HCV co-infection. CONCLUSION:There is a high burden of HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID in Mozambique. Our results highlight the need for targeted harm reduction interventions that include needle exchange programs and integrated services for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV, HBV and HCV to address these epidemics among PWID. Efforts should be made to strengthen ART coverage in the population as an important treatment strategy for both viruses.">

        <span class="abst" title="The trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was the only approved and available vaccine during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. It did not include the B/Yamagata strain. In this study, we report an acute respiratory disease outbreak associated with influenza B/Yamagata infections in Guangzhou, Southern China (January through March, 2018). Among the 9914 patients, 2241 (22.6%) were positive for the influenza B virus, with only 312 (3.1%) positive for the influenza A virus. The influenza B/Yamagata lineage dominated during this period in Southern China. The highest incidence of influenza A virus infection occurred in the children aged 5-14 years. In contrast, populations across all age groups were susceptible to the influenza B virus. Phylogenetic, mutations, and 3D structure analyses of hemagglutinin (HA) genes were performed to assess the vaccine-virus relatedness. The recommended A/H1N1 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015) during both 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 was antigen-specific for these circulating isolates (clade 6B.1) in Spring 2018. An outbreak of influenza B/Yamagata (clade 3) infections in 2018 occurred during the absence of the corresponding vaccine during 2016-2018. The recommended influenza B/Yamagata vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013) for the following season (2018-2019) was antigen-specific. Although there were only a few influenza B/Victoria infections in Spring 2018, five amino acid mutations were identified in the HA antigenic sites of the 19 B/Victoria isolates (clade 1A), when compared with the 2016-2018 B/Victoria vaccine strain. The number was larger than expected and suggested that the influenza B HA gene may be more variable than previously thought. One of the mutations (K180N) was noted to likely alter the epitope and to potentially affect the viral antigenicity. Seven mutations were also identified in the HA antigenic sites of 2018-2020 B/Victoria vaccine strain, of which some or all may reduce immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of the vaccine, perhaps leading to more outbreaks in subsequent seasons. The combined epidemiological, phylogenetic, mutations, and 3D structural analyses of the HA genes of influenza strains reported here contribute to the understanding and evaluation of how HA mutations affect vaccine efficacy, as well as to providing important data for screening and selecting more specific, appropriate, and effective influenza vaccine candidate strains.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cross-subtype neutralizing single domain antibodies against influenza present new opportunities for immunoprophylaxis and pandemic preparedness. Their simple modular structure and single open reading frame format are highly amenable to gene therapy-mediated delivery. We have previously described R1a-B6, an alpaca-derived single domain antibody (nanobody), that is capable of potent cross-subtype neutralization in vitro of H1N1, H5N1, H2N2, and H9N2 influenza viruses, through binding to a highly conserved epitope in the influenza hemagglutinin stem region. To evaluate the potential of R1a-B6 for immunoprophylaxis, we have reformatted it as an Fc fusion for adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector delivery. Our findings demonstrate that a single intramuscular injection in mice of AAV encoding R1a-B6 fused to Fc fragments of different isotypes equipped either, with or without antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, was able to drive sustained high-level expression (0.5-1.1 mg/mL) in sera with no evidence of reduction for up to 6 months. R1a-B6-Fc fusions of both isotypes gave complete protection against lethal challenge with both pandemic A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and avian influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). This data suggests that R1a-B6 is capable of cross-subtype protection and ADCC was not essential for R1a-B6 efficacy. Our findings demonstrate AAV delivery of cross-subtype neutralizing nanobodies may be an effective strategy to prevent influenza infection and provide long-term protection independent of a host induced immune response.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Chikungunya fever is caused by the chikungunya virus. Numerous factors affect the risk of chikungunya transmission. This study explored the epidemiological characteristics, differences, and trends in domestic and imported cases of chikungunya fever in Taiwan in terms of patient sex, age, month of confirmation, and area of residence from 2007 to 2019. Methods: Public annual chikungunya data from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were analyzed. In total, 21 confirmed domestic and 198 imported cases of chikungunya were reported. Of the domestic cases, one was sporadic and reported in July 2019, and 20 were attributed to a cluster event during August and September 2019. Results: In a comparison between domestic and imported cases reported from July to October 2019, differences in sex were nonsignificant (p = 0.555), whereas significant differences were observed for age (p &lt; 0.001), month of confirmation (p = 0.005), and place of residence (p = 0.001). An age of 69-69 years (odds ratio (OR) = 6.66, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 2.15-20.65), month of confirmation of September (OR = 5.25, 95%CI = 1.89-14.61) and place of residence of New Taipei City (OR = 48.70, 95%CI = 6.17-384.44) were identified as potential risk factors. Additionally, domestic cases in August and September 2019 increased in proportion to the increase in imported cases during July and August 2019. Increased domestic patients may have been caused by the domestic mosquitoes that transmitted the virus by biting the imported patients to Taiwan. This is the first report comparing domestic and imported cases of chikungunya from surveillance data from the Taiwan CDC from 2007 to 2019. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of longitudinal and geographically extended studies to understand the implications of zoonotic disease transmission on Taiwan's population. Critical data were identified to inform future surveillance and research efforts in Taiwan.">

The paper describes all changes and updates, which will impact the Italian current National regulation. A total of 58 animal diseases have been included in the Annex II (&quot;Listing&quot;) and Annex IV (&quot;Categorization&quot;) of the new Delegated Act (DA 2018/1629). Five diseases comprising the great viral epizooties were automatically included on the list because of their primary importance. These diseases include foot and mouth disease (FMD), African swine fever (ASF), classical swine fever (CSF), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and African horse sickness (AHS). Another 53 diseases have been identified by the ad hoc assessment on listing and categorization of animal diseases developed by the European Food Safety Association. Seventeen communicable diseases of the Order Artiodactlya (sheep, goats, deer, etc.) have been listed including foot and mouth disease, sheep and goat pox, and pestes de petits ruminants. In addition, other endemic diseases affecting more than one species include blue tongue, tuberculosis, brucellosis, and anthrax. There are five categories (A-E) based on the degree of action to be undertaken throughout the EU for each disease. These vary from complete eradication for diseases not normally found in the EU like FMD (category A) for establishing surveillance for diseases like West Nile that present high risk but lack control tools (category E).">

        <span class="abst" title="Acute viral hepatitis refers to hepatic infection by the hepatotropic viruses hepatitis A–E. The acute infections look similar with regard to histologic features, with spotty necrosis throughout the lobules, hepatocyte unrest, swelling and apoptosis, and portal tract and intrasinusoidal inflammation, chiefly lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis histologically includes drug-induced liver injury. Structural differences and epidemiology define the major differences in the course of each of these viral infections. Hepatitis A and E are similar in causing only acute hepatitis, while some cases of hepatitis B and many of hepatitis C become chronic. The prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has seen a reduction worldwide due to hepatitis B vaccination programs. Nonetheless, major cities with continued intravenous drug use remain reservoirs with a rate of approximately 8% in Europe. The availability of direct-acting viral agents is spearheading efforts by WHO to eliminate new and chronic HCV infections by 2019. Histologic cholestasis may be a particular feature of acute hepatitis E. It should be noted that hepatitis E virus has four major genotypes of which 1 and 2 infect humans (resulting in travel/endemic-related hepatitis with cholestasis and high mortality in pregnant women) and 3 and 4 are zoonotic and infect pigs, boar and several other animal and avian species (and may cause hepatitis associated with poorly or uncooked meat).">

        <span class="abst" title="Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is emerging as the primary cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans. The virus is commonly transmitted by the fecal-oral route via contaminated water in endemic regions or through the consumption of inadequately cooked swine products or game meats in industrialized regions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly associated with waterborne transmission in developing countries, whereas HEV3 and HEV4 are mainly zoonotically transmitted in industrialized countries. Seroprevalence in populations determined by detecting anti-HEV antibodies and serum HEV RNA is commonly used to analyze the presence of HEV. Although HEV RNA-based detection is now standardized, there is a lack of agreement between the assaying methods used for gathering seroprevalence data. Since 2004, HEV has been considered as a transmissible infectious agent through blood transfusion. Recent seroprevalence studies in European countries indicate an underestimated risk for blood transfusion and hence warrant testing the blood supply. HEV infection is usually self-limiting and spontaneously cleared. However, in about 60% of recipients of solid organ transplants, HEV progresses to chronic hepatitis. Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus are a major cause of chronic hepatitis and reducing its dosage results in viral clearance in about 30% of patients. In hemodialysis patients, the parenteral route is implicated as an important mechanism of transmission. In this review, we explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of various HEV genotypes in blood donors, hemodialysis patients, and transplant recipients.">

The causes of hepatocyte injuries include viral hepatitis infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Hep-EVs) released from stressed/damaged hepatocytes are partly responsible for liver disease progression and liver damage because they activate non-parenchymal cells and infiltrate inflammatory cells within the liver, which are in turn are an important source of EVs. This cell-to-cell signaling is prevalent during inflammation in many liver diseases. Accordingly, special emphasis should be placed on liquid biopsy methods for the long-term monitoring of chronic liver diseases. In the present review, we have highlighted various aspects of current liquid biopsy research into chronic liver diseases. We have also reviewed recent progress on liquid biopsies that focus on cell-free DNA (cfDNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and the proteins in EVs as potential diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets in patients with viral hepatitis, fatty liver steatosis, and alcoholic liver diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVES:Hepatitis A incidence in Korea has dramatically increased in recent years. Individuals in their twenties and thirties, who account for majority of the workforce in Korea, are particularly susceptible to infection owing to a low seroprevalence of anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin G (IgG). This study aimed to identify behavioural and occupational factors related to anti-HAV IgG seropositivity. DESIGN:Cross-sectional study. SETTING:A large university hospital in Seoul, Korea. PARTICIPANTS:Workers in formal employment having an annual routine health screening. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE:Anti-HAV IgG seropositivity. RESULTS:Of 131 711 individuals who had an annual health screening at the study hospital in 2018, 68 612 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Study participants were predominantly men (64.3%) and in their thirties (55.3%). The overall seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 36.2%. In multivariate analyses, anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was independently associated with working in a workplace with ≥2 health managers (vs no health manager, adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43); age 40-49 years (vs 20-29 years, OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.36 to 2.68); female sex (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.59); experience of any general disease (vs no general disease history, OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.25), obesity (vs normal weight, OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97); and hepatitis B antibody seropositivity (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.49). CONCLUSIONS:The low prevalence of anti-HAV IgG seropositivity points to a need for implementation of workplace-based hepatitis A vaccine programmes. To promote workers' health and prevent hepatitis A outbreaks, occupational health managers, healthcare providers and policy-makers should focus on individuals who are susceptible to HAV, such as young men.">

However, they have attracted renewed attention following reports that their entry in host cells is mediated by the trans-species conserved MHC-II proteins, suggesting that they hold zoonotic potential. Despite the recent studies, the viruses' epidemiology and public health significance remain incompletely understood.

        <span class="abst" title="In the last century, life expectancy has increased considerably, thanks to the introduction of antibiotics, hygiene and vaccines that have contributed to the cure and prevention of many infectious diseases. The era of antimicrobial therapy started in the nineteenth century with the identification of chemical compounds with antimicrobial properties. However, immediately after the introduction of these novel drugs, microorganisms started to become resistant through different strategies. Although resistance mechanisms were already present before antibiotic introduction, their large-scale use and mis-use have increased the number of resistant microorganisms. Rapid spreading of mobile elements by horizontal gene transfer such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements (ICE) carrying multiple resistance genes has dramatically increased the worldwide prevalence of relevant multi drug-resistant human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Today, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the major global concerns to be addressed and only global efforts could help in finding a solution. In terms of magnitude the economic impact of AMR is estimated to be comparable to that of climate global change in 2030. Although antibiotics continue to be essential to treat such infections, non-antibiotic therapies will play an important role in limiting the increase of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Among non-antibiotic strategies, vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) play a strategic role. In this review, we will summarize the evolution and the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and the impact of AMR on life expectancy and economics.">

OBJECTIVES:This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during the past 20 years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. METHODS:The papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and Google scholar with combining keywords: &quot;ancient,&quot; &quot;dental pulp,&quot; &quot;teeth,&quot; &quot;anatomy,&quot; &quot;structure,&quot; &quot;collection,&quot; &quot;preservation,&quot; &quot;selection,&quot; &quot;photography,&quot; &quot;radiography,&quot; &quot;contamination,&quot; &quot;decontamination,&quot; &quot;DNA,&quot; &quot;protein,&quot; &quot;extraction,&quot; &quot;bone,&quot; &quot;paleomicrobiology,&quot; &quot;bacteria,&quot; &quot;virus,&quot; &quot;pathogen,&quot; &quot;molecular biology,&quot; &quot;proteomics,&quot; &quot;PCR,&quot; &quot;MALDI-TOF,&quot; &quot;LC/MS,&quot; &quot;ELISA,&quot; &quot;immunology,&quot; &quot;immunochromatography,&quot; &quot;genome,&quot; &quot;microbiome,&quot; &quot;metagenomics.&quot; RESULTS:The analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp help to distinguish species. CONCLUSIONS:Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics.">

Ongoing events, such as climate change, changes in agricultural practices, globalization of markets or changes in plant virus vector populations, are affecting plant virus life cycles. Because farmer's fields are part of the larger environment, the role of wild plant species in plant virus life cycles can provide information about underlying processes during virus transmission and spread. This review focuses on the Solanaceae family, which contains thousands of species growing all around the world, including crop species, wild flora and model plants for genetic research. In a first part, we analyze various viruses infecting Solanaceae plants across the agro-ecological interface, emphasizing the important role of virus interactions between the cultivated and wild zones as global changes affect these environments on both local and global scales. To cope with these changes, it is necessary to adjust prophylactic protection measures and diagnostic methods. As illustrated in the second part, a complex virus research at the landscape level is necessary to obtain relevant data, which could be overwhelming. Based on evidence from previous studies we conclude that Solanaceae plant communities can be targeted to address complete life cycles of viruses with different life strategies within the agro-ecological interface. Data obtained from such research could then be used to improve plant protection methods by taking into consideration environmental factors that are impacting the life cycles of plant viruses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza viruses arise from animal reservoirs, and have the potential to cause pandemics. In 2013, low pathogenic novel avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in China, resulting from the reassortment of avian-origin viruses. Following evolutionary changes, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in late 2016. Changes in pathogenicity and virulence of H7N9 viruses have been linked to potential mutations in the viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2). Recognizing that effective viral transmission of the influenza A virus (IAV) between humans requires efficient attachment to the upper respiratory tract and replication through the viral polymerase complex, experimental evidence demonstrates the potential H7N9 has for increased binding affinity and replication, following specific amino acid substitutions in HA and PB2. Additionally, the deletion of extended amino acid sequences in the NA stalk length was shown to produce a significant increase in pathogenicity in mice. Research shows that significant changes in transmissibility, pathogenicity and virulence are possible after one or a few amino acid substitutions. This review aims to summarise key findings from that research. To date, all strains of H7N9 viruses remain restricted to avian reservoirs, with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, although mutations in specific viral proteins reveal the efficacy with which these viruses could evolve into a highly virulent and infectious, human-to-human transmitted virus.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Hepatitis E virus (HEV) generally causes self-limiting viral hepatitis. However, in pregnant women, HEV infection can be severe and has been associated with up to 30% mortality in the third trimester. Additionally, HEV infection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of preterm labor and vertical transmission. MAIN BODY:HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries. HEV can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, zoonotic route, and blood transfusion route. An altered immune status, hormonal levels, and viral factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Currently, no established treatment is available for HEV in pregnant women. A Chinese vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective against HEV in the general population and seems to be safe in pregnancy; however, its safety and efficacy in a large population of pregnant women remain to be determined. CONCLUSION:This review summarizes the current knowledge about HEV infection during pregnancy and focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, mechanisms underlying severe liver injury, and management and prevention of HEV infection during pregnancy. Considering that HEV infection during pregnancy may result in poor outcomes, screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should be taken into account. In addition, a better understanding of the pathogenesis will help to develop potential treatment strategies targeting HEV infection in pregnancy.">

Despite having re-emerged as a significant public health threat, there are no approved therapeutics or prophylactics for CHIKV infection. In this study, we explored the anti-CHIKV effects of proteasome inhibitors and their potential mechanism of antiviral action. A panel of proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups reduced CHIKV infectious titers in a dose-dependent manner. Bortezomib, which has been FDA-approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, was further investigated in downstream studies. The inhibitory activities of bortezomib were confirmed using different cellular models and CHIKV strains. Time-of-addition and time-of-removal studies suggested that bortezomib inhibited CHIKV at an early, post-entry stage of replication. In western blot analysis, bortezomib treatment resulted in a prominent decrease in structural protein levels as early as 6 hpi. Contrastingly, nsP4 levels showed strong elevations across all time-points. NsP2 and nsP3 levels showed a fluctuating trend, with some elevations between 12 to 20 hpi. Finally, qRT-PCR data revealed increased levels of both positive- and negative-sense CHIKV RNA at late stages of infection. It is likely that the reductions in structural protein levels is a major factor in the observed reductions in virus titer, with the alterations in non-structural protein ratios potentially being a contributing factor. Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib likely disrupt CHIKV replication through a variety of complex mechanisms and may display a potential for use as therapeutics against CHIKV infection. They also represent valuable tools for studies of CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.">

The first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), based on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015. The field of oncolytic virotherapy is still in its beginnings, since many promising viruses remain only superficially explored. Influenza A virus causes a highly immunogenic acute infection but never leads to a chronic disease. While oncolytic influenza A viruses are in preclinical development, they have not made the transition into clinical practice yet. Recent insights into different types of cell death caused by influenza A virus infection illuminate novel possibilities of enhancing its therapeutic effect. Genetic engineering and experience in influenza A virus vaccine development allow safe application of the virus in patients. In this review we give a summary of efforts undertaken to develop oncolytic influenza A viruses. We discuss strategies for targeting viral replication to cancerous lesions and arming them with immunogenic transgenes. We furthermore describe which modes of cell death are induced by influenza A virus infection and how these insights may be utilized to optimize influenza A virus-based oncolytic virus design.">

        <span class="abst" title="KEY RESULTS:Both outbreaks started in small towns, but cases were also detected in nearby larger cities where transmission was limited to small clusters. The time spans between the first and the last symptom onsets were similar between the 2 outbreaks, and the delay from the symptom onset of the index case and the first case notified was considerable. Comparable infection and transmission rates were observed in laboratory. The basic reproductive number (R0) was estimated in the range of 1.8-6 (2007) and 1.5-2.6 (2017). Clinical characteristics were similar between outbreaks, and no acute complications were reported, though a higher frequency of ocular symptoms, myalgia, and rash was observed in 2017. Very little is known about the immune mediator profile of CHIKV-infected patients during the 2 outbreaks. Regarding public health responses, after the 2007 outbreak, the Italian Ministry of Health developed national guidelines to implement surveillance and good practices to prevent and control autochthonous transmission. However, only a few regional authorities implemented it, and the perception of outbreak risk and knowledge of clinical symptoms and transmission dynamics by general practitioners remained low. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS:Efforts should be devoted to developing suitable procedures for early detection of virus circulation in the population, possibly through the analysis of medical records in near real time. Increasing the awareness of CHIKV of general practitioners and public health officials through tailored education may be effective, especially in small coastal towns where the outbreak risk may be higher. A key element is also the shift of citizen awareness from considering Aedes mosquitoes not only as a nuisance problem but also as a public health one. We advocate the need of strengthening the surveillance and of promoting the active participation of the communities to prevent and contain future outbreaks.">

This study is aimed to explore the relationships between larval indices and the Ae. albopictus density captured by BG-mosquito trap (BG-trap) method, with considering the meteorological factors. METHODS:Data on larval density, adult mosquito density and meteorology factors were collected in an entomological survey carried out in Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province of China in 2018. The Spearman's rank correlation and Pearson correlation were used for the analysis on the correlation of density indices. Generalized additive models were established to analyze the influencing factors of mosquito density. RESULTS:Breteau index (BI), House index (HI) and Container index (CI) were highly correlated with each other (r&gt;0.7, p&lt;0.05). The Ae. albopictus density was significantly correlated with CI (rs = 0.260, p&lt;0.05), CI pre one week (rs = 0.259, p&lt;0.05), and CI pre three weeks (rs = 0.329, p&lt;0.05). BI was correlated with female Ae. albopictus density pre 4 weeks (r = -0.299, p&lt;0.05). Female Ae. albopictus density was correlated with CI pre 3 weeks (rs = 0.303, p&lt;0.05). The influencing factors of BI were average wind speed pre 1 week, average temperature and female Ae. albopictus density pre 4 weeks. The influencing factors of CI were average humidity pre 3 weeks and average temperature. The influencing factors of HI were average temperature and precipitation pre 4 weeks. The influencing factor of Ae. albopictus density and female Ae. albopictus density was temperature. CONCLUSIONS:The adult Ae. albopictus density had low correlation with certain larval indices. Some of the meteorology factors played significant roles in the density of adult Ae. albopictus and larva with or without a time lag.">

The pathogen is transmitted mainly through ingesting contaminated water or food, coming into contact with affected people, and blood transfusions. Very few reports including old reports are available on the prevalence of HEV in Saudi Arabia in humans and no reports exist on HEV prevalence in camels. Dromedary camel trade and farming are increasing in Saudi Arabia with importation occurring unidirectionally from Africa to Saudi Arabia. DcHEV transmission to humans has been reported in one case from the United Arab Emeritus (UAE). This instigated us to perform this investigation of the seroprevalence of HEV in imported and domestic camels in Saudi Arabia. Serum samples were collected from imported and domestic camels. DcHEV-Abs were detected in collected sera using ELISA. The prevalence of DcHEV in the collected samples was 23.1% with slightly lower prevalence in imported camels than domestic camels (22.4% vs. 25.4%, p value = 0.3). Gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of HEV in the collected camels (p value = 0.015) where males (31.6%) were more infected than females (13.4%). This study is the first study to investigate the prevalence of HEV in dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia. The high seroprevalence of DcHEV in dromedaries might indicate their role as a zoonotic reservoir for viral infection to humans. Future HEV seroprevalence studies in humans are needed to investigate the role of DcHEV in the Saudi human population.">

Despite the clinical availability of vaccines and antivirals, the antigenic diversity and drug resistance of this virus makes it a persistent threat to public health, underlying the need for the development of novel antivirals. In a cell culture-based high-throughput screen, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, nylidrin, was identified as an antiviral compound against influenza A virus. The molecule was effective against multiple isolates of subtype H1N1, but had limited activity against subtype H3N2, depending on the strain. By examining the antiviral activity of its chemical analogues, we found that ifenprodil and clenbuterol also had reliable inhibitory effects against A/H1N1 strains. Field-based pharmacophore modeling with comparisons of active and inactive compounds revealed the importance of positive and negative electrostatic patterns of phenyl aminoethanol derivatives. Time-of-addition experiments and visualization of the intracellular localization of nucleoprotein NP demonstrated that an early step of the virus life cycle was suppressed by nylidrin. Ultimately, we discovered that nylidrin targets hemagglutinin 2 (HA2)-mediated membrane fusion by blocking conformational change of HA at acidic pH. In a mouse model, preincubation of a mouse-adapted influenza A virus (H1N1) with nylidrin completely blocked intranasal viral infection. The present study suggests that nylidrin could provide a core chemical skeleton for the development of a direct-acting inhibitor of influenza A virus entry.">

Natural products from plants contain compounds with diverse structures that have the potential to interact with multiple host and virus factors. In this study, we identified the ethanol extract of Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (EEC) as an inhibitor against the replication of a panel of influenza A and B viruses both on human pulmonary epithelial A549 and human monocytic U937 cells. The animal study revealed that EEC administration reduces the weight loss and improves the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus. Also, EEC treatment attenuated lung injury and reduced virus titer significantly. In conclusion, we showed that EEC has antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the plant C. decapetala has the potential to be further developed as a resource of new anti-influenza drugs.">

A total of 2650 mosquitoes belonging to 37 species and eight genera were collected. Mosquito species richness was significantly influenced by the specific combination of the habitat type and the season. The highest species richness was found in the peri-urban area (S = 30, Chao1 = 121 ± 50.63, ACE = 51.97 ± 3.88) during the dry season (S = 28, Chao1 = 64 ± 25.7, ACE = 38.33 ± 3.1). Aedes (Ae.) africanus and Culex (Cx.) moucheti were only found in the rural and peri-urban areas, while Cx. pipiens s.l. and Ae. aegypti were only found in the urban area. Cx. (Culiciomyia) spp., Cx. duttoni and Ae. albopictus were caught in the three habitat types. Importantly, approximately 52% of the mosquito species collected in this study have been implicated in the transmission of diverse arboviruses. This entomological survey provides a catalogue of the different mosquito species that may be involved in the transmission of arboviruses. Further investigations are needed to study the vectorial capacity of each mosquito species in arbovirus transmission.">

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that an adenoviral vector-based RSV F vaccine candidate (Ad26.RSV.FA2) induces Th1-biased protective immune responses, without signs of ERD upon subsequent RSV challenge. We here developed an Ad26 vector encoding the RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). In adult mice, Ad26.RSV.preF induced superior, Th1-biased IgG2a-dominated humoral responses as compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2, while maintaining the strong Th1-biased cellular responses. Similar to adult mice, Ad26.RSV.preF induced robust and durable humoral immunity in neonatal mice, again characterized by IgG2a-dominated RSV F-binding antibodies, and high and stable virus-neutralizing titers. In addition, vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses were durable and characterized by IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a profound Th1 bias. In contrast, immunization of neonatal mice with FI-RSV resulted in IgG1 RSV F-binding antibodies associated with a Th2 phenotype, no detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, and a Th2-biased cellular response. These results are supportive for the clinical development of Ad26.RSV.preF for use in infants.">

This study is aimed at identifying the subtypes of avian influenza viruses collected from healthy chickens and ducks at two live bird markets in a border province of Vietnam and the Lao People Democratic Republic. Cloacal and tracheal swab samples from 100 chickens and 101 ducks were collected in May 2017. All samples were screened to detect avian influenza virus by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Samples that are avian influenza virus-positive were isolated in embryonated chicken eggs, and the subtypes were identified by RT-PCR with the specific primers. The samples positive for influenza virus H5 were sequenced to identify HA and NA genes. The prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV) among chicken and duck samples was 27.5% (55/200) and 24.8% (50/202), respectively. AIV subtypes identified among 17 samples positive with the hemagglutination test include H3N6, H6N6, and H9N2. Of these 17 samples, 7 duck samples were found to be H6N6, 4 duck samples were infected with both subtypes of H3N6 and H6N6, and two chicken samples were recorded as H9N2. A positive chicken sample with A/H5 contains 99% similarity nucleotide with H5N6 reference strain. Results suggested that while the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus is predominant, potential risks of the appearance of high pathogen avian influenza virus in the east-west boundary in Vietnam should be concerned and studied further. Furthermore, prevention activities are needed to reduce such biosecurity threats in Vietnam and other Asian countries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Indirect transmission of pathogens can pose major risks to wildlife, yet the presence and persistence of wildlife pathogens in the environment has been little studied. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is of global conservation concern: it can infect all members of the Psittaciformes, one of the most threatened bird orders, with infection often being lethal. Indirect transmission of BFDV through contaminated nest hollows has been proposed as a major infection source. However, data on whether and for how long nest sites in the wild remain contaminated have been absent. We determined the BFDV status of birds (parents and nestlings) for 82 nests of Crimson Rosellas, Platycercus elegans and Eastern Rosellas, Platycercus eximius. In 11 of these nests (13.4%, 95% confidence interval 6.9-22.7), we found an infected parent or nestling. Using nest swabs, we then compared BFDV presence at three points in time (before, during and after breeding) in three groups of nest boxes. These were nest boxes occupied by infected birds, and two control groups (nest boxes occupied by uninfected birds, and unoccupied nest boxes). Detection of BFDV on nest swabs was strongly associated with the infection status of parents in each nest box and with the timing of breeding. During breeding, boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds were significantly more likely to have BFDV-positive nest swabs than boxes occupied by BFDV-negative birds; nest swabs tested BFDV-positive in 80% (28.4-99.5) of nests with parental antigen excretion, 66.7% (9.4-99.2) of nests occupied by parents with BFDV-positive cloacal swabs and 66.7% (22.3-95.7) of nests occupied by parents with BFDV-positive blood. 0% (0-52.2) of nests with BFDV-positive nestlings had BFDV-positive nest swabs. Across all boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds (parents or nestlings), no nest swabs were BFDV-positive before breeding, 36.4% (95% CI 10.9-69.2) were positive during breeding and 9.1% (0.2-41.3) remained positive after breeding. BFDV was present on nest swabs for up to 3.7 months. Our study provides novel insights into the potential role of nest cavities and other fomites in indirect transmission of BFDV, and possibly other pathogens, and offers a non-invasive method for surveillance of pathogens in wild bird populations.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:Japanese encephalitis virus infection (JE) remains a leading cause of neurological disease in Asia, mainly involving individuals living in remote areas with limited access to treatment centers and diagnostic facilities. Laboratory confirmation is fundamental for the justification and implementation of vaccination programs. We reviewed the literature on historical developments and current diagnostic capability worldwide, to identify knowledge gaps and instill urgency to address them. METHODS:Searches were performed in Web of Science and PubMed using the term 'Japanese encephalitis' up to 13th October 2019. Studies reporting laboratory-confirmed symptomatic JE cases in humans were included, and data on details of diagnostic tests were extracted. A JE case was classified according to confirmatory levels (Fischer et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2011; Pearce et al., 2018; Heffelfinger et al., 2017), where level 1 represented the highest level of confidence. FINDINGS:20,212 published JE cases were identified from 205 studies. 15,167 (75%) of these positive cases were confirmed with the lowest-confidence diagnostic tests (level 3 or 4, or level 4). Only 109 (53%) of the studies reported contemporaneous testing for dengue-specific antibodies. CONCLUSION:A fundamental pre-requisite for the control of JEV is lacking - that of a simple and specific diagnostic procedure that can be adapted for point-of-care tests and readily used throughout JE-endemic regions of the world.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family. After decades of circulation in Asia, ZIKV was introduced to Brazil in 2014-2015, associated with a rise in congenital malformations. Unlike the genetically related dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV constitutes only one serotype. Although assumed that ZIKV infection may engender lifelong immunity, the long-term kinetics of ZIKV antibody responses are unclear. We assessed long-term kinetics of ZIKV NS1-IgG response in 144 individuals from 3 different subpopulations: HIV patients, tuberculosis patients and healthy individuals first tested in 2016 and retested 1.5-2 years after the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, using a widely distributed NS1-based commercial ELISA. The seropositivity in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144, 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7-66.7%), and decreased to 38.6% (56/144, CI 31.3-47.0%) 1.5-2 years later. In addition, the median ZIKV NS1-ELISA reactivity for individuals that remained positive in both timepoints significantly decreased from a ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 3.8-5.0) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.6-1.9) over the 2-year interval (Z: - 6.1; p &lt; 0.001) irrespective of the subpopulation analyzed. Initial 2016 DENV antibody response was non-significant between groups, suggesting comparable DENV background. The high 20.6% seroreversion suggest that widely used serologic tests may fail to account a considerable proportion of past ZIKV infections in flavivirus endemic countries. In addition, ZIKV immunity might be shorter-lived than previously thought, which may contribute to local ZIKV resurgence once individual immune responses wane sufficiently to reduce community protective immunity in addition to birth and migration.">

Appropriate surveillance capable of early detection of the disease in both domestic and wild animals, and the implementation of consolidated contingency plans, are currently considered the best means of controlling this disease. The purpose of this study was to understand the lessons to be learned through the global disease eradication history. To establish which strategies were successful for prevention, control, and eradication of ASF, and which errors should not be repeated, we conducted a systematic review. A query was defined to search for surveillance and control strategies applied by countries worldwide for ASF eradication in the past. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Decisions on study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers and the differences were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. From 1,980 papers, 23 were selected and included in the qualitative analysis. Reports from Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, France, mainland Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain were included. Despite the economic resources allocated and the efforts made, eradication was possible in only eight countries, between the 50s and 90s in the twentieth century, in different epidemiological and cultural contexts, in some instances within &lt;1 year, and in others in about 40 years. Classical surveillance strategies, such as active and passive surveillance, both at farm and slaughterhouse levels, targeted surveillance, together with conventional biosafety and sanitary measures, led to eradication even in countries in which the tick's epidemiological role was demonstrated. Historical surveillance data analysis indicated that eradication was possible even when technological tools either were not available or were used less than they are currently. This emphasizes that data on surveillance and on animal population are crucial for planning effective surveillance, and targeting proper control and intervention strategies. This paper demonstrates that some strategies applied in the past were effective; these could be implemented and improved to confront the current epidemiological wave. This offers encouragement for the efforts made particularly in Europe during the recent epidemics.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus are often evaluated by vector competence (the proportion of infectious vectors given exposure) and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP, the time it takes for a vector to become infectious), but vector age is another critical driver of transmission dynamics. Vectorial capacity (VC) is a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system, but how these three components, EIP, vector competence and vector age, affect VC in concert still needs study. METHODS:The interaction of vector competence, EIP, and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Ageacquisition) was experimentally measured in an Aedes aegypti-ZIKV model system, as well as the age-dependence of probability of survival and the willingness to bite. An age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VCage) was then developed using both EIPMin and EIPMax, defined as the time to first observed minimum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes and the time to observed maximum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes. RESULTS:The within-mosquito dynamics of vector competence/EIP were not significant among treatments where mosquitoes were exposed at different ages. However, VCage revealed: (i) age-dependence in vector-virus interactions is important for transmission success; (ii) lower vector competence but at shorter EIPs was sufficient for transmission perpetuation; and (iii) R0 may be overestimated by using non-age-structured VC. CONCLUSIONS:The results indicate that ultimately the temporal component of the virus-vector dynamics is most critical, especially when exposure occurred at advanced mosquito age. While our study is limited to a single virus-vector system, and a multitude of other factors affect both vector competence and mosquito mortality, our methods can be extrapolated to these other scenarios. Results indicate that how 'highly' or 'negligibly' competent vectors are categorized may need adjustment.">

        <span class="abst" title="The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.75, respectively (all have p &lt; 0.05), in simulations with no circadian effect and R0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Echovirus 30 (E-30) has been investigated and reported worldwide and is closely associated with several infectious diseases, including encephalitis; myocarditis; and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Although many E-30 outbreaks associated with encephalitis have been reported around the world, it was not reported in northwest China until 2015. Methods:The clinical samples, including the feces, serum, throat swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid, were collected for this study and were analyzed for diagnosis. E-30 was isolated and processed according to the standard procedures. The epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis were performed to indicate the characteristics of E-30 outbreaks and phylodynamics of E-30 in China. Results:The E-30 outbreaks affected nine towns of Gansu Province in 2015, starting at a school of Nancha town and spreading to other towns within 1 month. The epidemiological features showed that children aged 6-15 years were more susceptible to E-30 infection. The genotypes B and C cocirculated in the world, whereas the latter dominated the circulation of E-30 in China. The genome sequences of this outbreak present 99.3-100% similarity among these strains, indicating a genetic-linked aggregate outbreak of E-30 in this study. Two larger genetic diversity expansions and three small fluctuations of E-30 were observed from 1987 to 2016 in China, which revealed the oscillating patterns of E-30 in China. In addition, the coastal provinces of China, such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong, were initially infected, followed by other parts of the country. The E-30 strains isolated from mainland of China may have originated from Taiwan of China in the last century. Conclusion:The highly similar E-30 genomes in this outbreak showed an aggregate outbreak of E-30, with nine towns affected. Our results suggested that, although the genetic diversity of E-30 oscillates, the dominant lineages of E-30 in China has complex genetic transmission. The coastal provinces played an important role in E-30 spread, which implied further development of effective countermeasures. This study provides a further insight into the E-30 outbreak and transmission and illustrates the importance of valuable surveillance in the future.">

Typhimurium) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and bacteraemia worldwide, and a model organism for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Two S. Typhimurium strains (SL1344 and ATCC14028) are widely used to study host-pathogen interactions, yet genotypic variation results in strains with diverse host range, pathogenicity and risk to food safety. The population structure of diverse strains of S. Typhimurium revealed a major phylogroup of predominantly sequence type 19 (ST19) and a minor phylogroup of ST36. The major phylogroup had a population structure with two high order clades (α and β) and multiple subclades on extended internal branches, that exhibited distinct signatures of host adaptation and anthropogenic selection. Clade α contained a number of subclades composed of strains from well characterized epidemics in domesticated animals, while clade β contained multiple subclades associated with wild avian species. The contrasting epidemiology of strains in clade α and β was reflected by the distinct distribution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, accumulation of hypothetically disrupted coding sequences (HDCS), and signatures of functional diversification. These observations were consistent with elevated anthropogenic selection of clade α lineages from adaptation to circulation in populations of domesticated livestock, and the predisposition of clade β lineages to undergo adaptation to an invasive lifestyle by a process of convergent evolution with of host adapted Salmonella serotypes. Gene flux was predominantly driven by acquisition and recombination of prophage and associated cargo genes, with only occasional loss of these elements. The acquisition of large chromosomally-encoded genetic islands was limited, but notably, a feature of two recent pandemic clones (DT104 and monophasic S. Typhimurium ST34) of clade α (SGI-1 and SGI-4).">

PB1-F2 protein is a critical virulence factor that suppresses early type I interferon response, but the mechanism of its action in relation to high pathogenicity is not well understood. Here we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is a particularly potent suppressor of antiviral signaling through formation of protein aggregates on mitochondria and inhibition of TRIM31-MAVS interaction, leading to prevention of K63-polyubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS. Unaggregated MAVS accumulated on fragmented mitochondria is prone to degradation by both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. These properties are proprietary to PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus but not shared by its counterpart in WSN virus. A recombinant virus deficient of PB1-F2 of H7N9 induces more interferon β in infected cells. Our findings reveal a subtype-specific mechanism for destabilization of MAVS and suppression of interferon response by PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Introduction: The major burden of diseases in childhood has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic health conditions in recent decades. Although the rates of infectious diseases have decreased, the incidence of chronic diseases stemming from infectious agents continues to grow. Enterovirus is a major infectious disease of childhood and has been linked to numerous chronic diseases. We analyzed population-based data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the correlations between enterovirus infection and major chronic health conditions in children. Method: Children diagnosed with enterovirus (EV) infection during 1999-2003 were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), a subdataset of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). A total of 14,168 patients were selected after excluding patients with existing chronic diseases and missing data. Another 14,168 children matched by age and sex were selected as the control group. Five primary outcomes, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, were recorded. Results: The risks of ADHD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and epilepsy were significantly increased in the EV group compared with the control group. The risk of atopic dermatitis was significantly increased in the crude model. However, there were no significant differences in the adjusted model. The risks of ADHD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and epilepsy were also significantly increased in patients with severe EV infection compared with patients with non-severe EV infection. Conclusion: Chronic diseases, such as ADHD, epilepsy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were shown to be associated with enterovirus infection during childhood. EV infection during early childhood might have long-term public health implications and thus prevention strategies should be implemented.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are increasingly important public health problems. Burning vegetation, leaves, and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents for their vector, Aedes spp., but there has been scant research on whether firewood cooking smoke in households influences mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. About 2.9 billion people worldwide use biomass fuel for household cooking and heating, resulting in an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually from household air pollution (HAP)-related diseases. Global health agencies now encourage households to transition from biomass to clean fuels, but it is unclear whether such interventions may actually increase risk for mosquito-borne diseases. This retrospective case-control study evaluated associations between arboviral infections and cooking with firewood in Santa Rosa, Guatemala. METHOD:Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria (VICo) was a prospective public health surveillance system for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of diarrheal, neurological, respiratory, and febrile illnesses in hospitals and clinics in the department of Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Enrolled VICo in-patients and out-patients during 2011-2018 were interviewed using standardized questionnaires on demographics and household characteristics. Blood and stool specimens were collected and tested to identify the etiologies presenting symptoms. Cases were defined as laboratory-positive for dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections. Controls were laboratory-positive for bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, or astrovirus). Cooking with firewood, kitchen location, stove type, and firewood cooking frequency were the independent exposure variables. Logistic regression models were used to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between arboviral infections and exposures of interest. RESULT:There were 311 arboviral cases and 1,239 diarrheal controls. Arboviral infections were inversely associated with cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.57), cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33-0.78), and cooking with firewood ≥5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81), adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status index, number of people per household, community population density, community elevation, recruitment location, season, and admission year. CONCLUSION:Several primary determinants of HAP exposure were inversely associated with arboviral infections. Additional studies are needed to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risk for mosquito-borne infectious diseases, which would warrant improved education and mosquito control efforts in conjunction with fuel interventions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is part of a group of emergent diseases, including arbovirus, constituting an increasing public health problem in tropical areas worldwide. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months, the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies, understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients' symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%), headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%), which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore, 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly, 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic &quot;extreme&quot; phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex &quot;extreme&quot; phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse, there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection, especially in the female population. This suggests that, comparatively to men, women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results have shown prediction models achieving up to 92% accuracy overall, with substantial sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster.">

HuNoV structural proteins, especially VP1, have been studied extensively. In contrast, the functions of the non-structural proteins of the virus have been undescribed in depth. Studies on HuNoV non-structural proteins have mostly been made by expressing them individually in in vitro cultures, providing insights of their functions and the role that they play in HuNoV replication and pathogenesis. This review examines exhaustively the functions of both HuNoV structural and non-structural proteins and their possible role within the viral replicative cycle and the pathogenesis of the virus. It also highlights recent findings regarding the host's innate and adaptive immune responses against HuNoV, which are of great relevance for diagnostics and vaccine development so as to prevent infections caused by these fastidious viruses.">

Streptococcus pyogenes, the group A streptococcus (GAS), is not the most common bacteria associated with influenza A virus (IAV) superinfections but did cause significant mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic even though all isolates are susceptible to penicillin. One approach to improve the outcome of these infections is to use passive immunization targeting GAS. To test this idea, we assessed the efficacy of passive immunotherapy using antisera against either the streptococcal M protein or streptolysin O (SLO) in a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection. Prophylactic treatment of mice with antiserum to either SLO or the M protein decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera; however, neither significantly decreased mortality. Therapeutic use of antisera to SLO decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera but neither antisera significantly reduced mortality. Overall, the results suggest that further development of antibodies targeting the M protein or SLO may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of invasive GAS diseases, including IAV-GAS superinfections, which may be particularly important during influenza pandemics.">

In addition to microcephaly and other malformations, some specific lesions in the central nervous system have been reported. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the risk of developing microcephaly in infants whose mothers were infected with Zika virus in pregnancy. Epidemiological studies and case reports were incorporated in our review, finally including 15 articles from an initial pool of 355 related papers. Most studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to the development of neonatal microcephaly. The period considered most dangerous is the first trimester and the beginning or the whole of the second trimester. In order to understand the relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly in infants, a cohort study will be able to estimate the time from the onset of Zika infection and the full spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes.">

Dynamics of different genetic backgrounds and admixture events may have impacted competence for CHIKV in adventive populations. Using microsatellites, we infer the genetic structure of populations across the expansion areas that we then associate with their competence for different CHIKV genotypes. Here we show that the demographic history of Ae. albopictus populations is a consequence of rapid complex patterns of historical lineage diversification and divergence that influenced their competence for CHIKV. The history of adventive populations is associated with CHIKV genotypes in a genotype-by-genotype interaction that impacts their vector competence. Thus, knowledge of the demographic history and vector competence of invasive mosquitoes is pivotal for assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in newly colonized areas.">

        <span class="abst" title="Seasonal influenza A viruses of humans evolve rapidly due to strong selection pressures from host immune responses, principally on the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein. Based on mouse transmission experiments, a proposed mechanism for immune evasion consists of increased avidity to host cellular receptors, mediated by electrostatic charge interactions with negatively charged cell surfaces. In support of this, the HA charge of the globally circulating H3N2 has increased over time since its pandemic. However, the same trend was not seen in H1N1 HA sequences. This is counter-intuitive, since immune escape due to increased avidity (due itself to an increase in charge) was determined experimentally. Here, we explore whether patterns of local charge of H1N1 HA can explain this discrepancy and thus further associate electrostatic charge with immune escape and viral evolutionary dynamics. Measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge computed from deep mutational scan data on an early H1N1 HA yield a striking division of residues into three groups, separated by charge. We then explored evolutionary dynamics of these groups from 1918 to 2008. In particular, one group increases in net charge over time and consists of sites that are evolving the fastest, that are closest to the receptor binding site (RBS), and that are exposed to solvent (i.e., on the surface). By contrast, another group decreases in net charge and consists of sites that are further away from the RBS and evolving slower, but also exposed to solvent. The last group consists of those sites in the HA core, with no change in net charge and that evolve very slowly. Thus, there is a group of residues that follows the same trend as seen for the entire H3N2 HA. It is possible that the H1N1 HA is under other biophysical constraints that result in compensatory decreases in charge elsewhere on the protein. Our results implicate localized charge in HA interactions with host cells, and highlight how deep mutational scan data can inform evolutionary hypotheses.">

In the winter of 2017-2018, a large-scale outbreak of rotavirus in both children and adults was reported in Thailand. The current study focused on the prevalence, genotyping, and molecular characterization of rotavirus infections in Thai adults from July 2016 to December 2019. In 2,598 stool samples collected from adult residents of Bangkok (aged #x2265; 15 years) with acute gastroenteritis, rotavirus was detected via real-time RT-PCR analysis of the VP6 gene. G, P and I genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes, respectively. Our results showed 8.7% (226/2,598) of stool samples were positive for rotavirus. The incidence of rotavirus was high during the winter season of 2017-2018 (17.7%) compared to another studied periods (4.5% between July 2016- October 2017 and 2.8% between March 2018- December 2019). Nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 revealed G3P[8] as the predominant strain (33.2%,75/226), followed by G9P[8] (17.3%,39/226), and G2P[4] (15.0%,34/226). Uncommon G and P combinations were additionally detected at low frequencies. VP6 sequencing was conducted to discriminate I genotype between the Wa and DS-1 genogroup. The unusual DS-1-like G3P[8] strain was most prevalent amomg rotavirus strains detected in this study (29.6%, 67/226), and the corresponding VP7 sequences showed high nucleotide identity with unusual DS-1-like globally circulating strains. Our study demonstrates that rotavirus outbreaks in adults are attributable not only to high prevalence of RV infection but also the unusual DS-like genogroup. The collective findings reinforce the importance of investigating rotavirus diagnosis in adults suffering from acute gastroenteritis and taking appropriate preventive measures.">

        <span class="abst" title="The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak revealed the fragility of the Guinean public health infrastructure. As a result, the Guinean Ministry of Health is collaborating with international partners to improve compliance with the International Health Regulations and work toward the Global Health Security Agenda goals, including enhanced case- and community-based disease surveillance. We assessed the case-based disease surveillance system during October 1, 2015-March 31, 2016, in the Boffa prefecture of Guinea. We conducted onsite interviews with public health staff at the peripheral (health center), middle (prefectural), and central (Ministry of Health) levels of the public health system to document leadership structure; methods for maintaining case registers and submitting weekly case reports; disease surveillance feedback; data analysis; and baseline surveillance information on four epidemic-prone diseases (cholera, meningococcal meningitis, measles, and yellow fever). The surveillance system was simple and paper-based at health centers and computer spreadsheet-based at the prefectural and central levels. Surveillance feedback to stakeholders at all levels was infrequent. Data analysis activities were minimal at the peripheral levels and progressively more robust at the prefectural and central levels. Reviewing the surveillance reports from Boffa during the study period, we observed zero reported cases of the four epidemic-prone diseases in the weekly reporting from the peripheral to the central level. Similarly, the national District Health Information System 2 had no reported cases of the four diseases in Boffa but did indicate reported cases among all four neighboring prefectures. Based on the assessment findings, which suggest low sensitivity of the case-based disease surveillance system in Boffa, we recommend additional training and support to improve surveillance data quality and enhance Guinean public health workforce capacity to use these data.">

Prior work showed that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) populations evolved at constant 37°C improved in cellular infection at both 29°C and 37°C; in contrast, those evolved under random changing temperatures between 29°C and 37°C failed to improve. Here, we tested whether prior evolution affected the rate of adaptation at the thermal-niche edge: 40°C. After 40 virus generations in the new environment, we observed that populations historically evolved at random temperatures showed greater adaptability. Deep sequencing revealed that most of the newly evolved mutations were de novo. Also, two novel evolved mutations in the VSV glycoprotein and replicase genes tended to co-occur in the populations previously evolved at constant 37°C, whereas this parallelism was not seen in populations with prior random temperature evolution. These results suggest that prior adaptation under constant versus random temperatures constrained the mutation landscape that could improve fitness in the novel 40°C environment, perhaps owing to differing epistatic effects of new mutations entering genetic architectures that earlier diverged. We concluded that RNA viruses maladapted to their previous environment could &quot;leapfrog&quot; over counterparts of higher fitness, to achieve faster adaptability in a novel environment.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause intermittent community and nosocomial outbreaks. Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS:Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed. RESULTS:Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 of MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded &gt;75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%. CONCLUSIONS:Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV 'carrier phenomenon', occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation. The specific role of apparently healthy HCWs in causing nosocomial outbreaks requires further definition.">

From November 2016 through February 2017, we collected sociodemographic and clinical data by interview and tested serum samples for CHIKV IgG. CHIKV seroprevalence was 11.8% (95% CI 9.8%-13.7%), and 15.3% of seropositive persons reported an episode of fever and arthralgia. Infections were independently and positively associated with residences served by unpaved streets, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of chikungunya, and recall of an episode of fever with arthralgia in 2015-2016. Our findings indicate that the chikungunya outbreak in Salvador may not have conferred sufficient herd immunity to preclude epidemics in the near future. The unusually low frequency of symptomatic disease points to a need for further longitudinal studies to better investigate these findings.">

        <span class="abst" title="BackgroundChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted in tropical areas by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. It has been responsible for small-to-large outbreaks in temperate areas including southern Europe and North America. Past outbreaks in 2006 on the islands of Maldives, as well as on other islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia, demonstrated for the first time the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate through travel and transcontinental commerce, and revealed the major socio-economic impact of CHIKV epidemics. Recently, CHIKV has been circulating in highly touristic areas including the Maldives, where 1,736 cases were notified by the Health Protection Agency during 2019.Case seriesAmong EuroTravNet/GeoSentinel patient records, eight CHIKV-confirmed cases imported the Maldives to France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Spain were identified between February 2019 and February 2020; exceeding the total number of CHIKV infections travel-acquired in Maldives reported to this surveillance network during the previous 10 years.ConclusionsThe prevention and control of CHIKV introduction into naïve areas colonised by competent vectors is crucial. CHIKV outbreaks must be detected and reported in a timely manner. This must lead to adapted health information for international travellers and to prompt management of suspected imported cases. Conversely, travellers make for excellent sentinels and increased reports of imported cases might reflect a change in the level of endemicity or even herald an outbreak. Feedback to the local health authorities and matching this with local epidemiological surveillance data may lead to health benefits for the local population.">

Here, we report a rare case co-presenting with varicella and herpes zoster in a Chinese adult. CASE PRESENTATION:A 44-year-old Chinese man suffered papules and vesicles with pain on the left ear. Five days after onset, he was admitted to the Department of Dermatology of The Third Hospital of Xiamen. Physical examination revealed that small vesicles surrounded by erythema had developed on his trunk, back and neck, and unilateral papules and vesicles in ribbons had also developed on the left ear. This patient was excluded from human immunodeficiency virus and Treponema pallidum infections by ELISA antibody tests. Laboratory tests revealed that the ratio of eosinophils (0.1%) and eosinophil count (0.0 × 109/L) were significantly downregulated. Treatment with valacyclovir, ebastine, mecobalamine, pregabalin and calamine lotion for 5 days was effective therapy for varicella and herpes zoster. Polymerase chain reaction for vesicular fluids from varicella and herpes zoster was positive for VZV, and further phylogenetic analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism variations confirmed that the VZV genotype was type J (clade 2). CONCLUSIONS:This rare case highlights awareness of varicella and herpes zoster caused by VZV infection in adults. Our report provides novel insight into the rare clinical presentation of VZV genotype J.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Uganda has experienced seven Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks and four Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) outbreaks between 2000 and 2019. We investigated the seroprevalence and risk factors for Marburg virus and ebolaviruses in gold mining communities around Kitaka gold mine in Western Uganda and compared them to non-mining communities in Central Uganda. METHODS:A questionnaire was administered and human blood samples were collected from three exposure groups in Western Uganda (gold miners, household members of miners, non-miners living within 50 km of Kitaka mine). The unexposed controls group sampled was community members in Central Uganda far away from any gold mining activity which we considered as low-risk for filovirus infection. ELISA serology was used to analyse samples, detecting IgG antibodies against Marburg virus and ebolaviruses (filoviruses). Data were analysed in STATA software using risk ratios and odds ratios. RESULTS:Miners in western Uganda were 5.4 times more likely to be filovirus seropositive compared to the control group in central Uganda (RR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.5-19.7) whereas people living in high-risk areas in Ibanda and Kamwenge districts were 3.6 more likely to be seropositive compared to control group in Luweeero district (RR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-12.2). Among all participants, filovirus seropositivity was 2.6% (19/724) of which 2.3% (17/724) were reactive to Sudan virus only and 0.1% (1/724) to Marburg virus. One individual seropositive for Sudan virus also had IgG antibodies reactive to Bundibugyo virus. The risk factors for filovirus seropositivity identified included mining (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-8.5), male sex (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.01-9.5), going inside mines (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.2-8.2), cleaning corpses (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.04-9.1) and contact with suspect filovirus cases (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.04-14.5). CONCLUSIONS:These findings indicate that filovirus outbreaks may go undetected in Uganda and people involved in artisan gold mining are more likely to be exposed to infection with either Marburg virus or ebolaviruses, likely due to increased risk of exposure to bats. This calls for active surveillance in known high-risk areas for early detection and response to prevent filovirus epidemics.">

        <span class="abst" title="BackgroundSince 2011, the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) has used active surveillance to prospectively collect epidemiological and virological data on patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Here, we describe influenza virus strain circulation in the GIHSN participant countries during 2017–2018 season and examine factors associated with complicated hospitalization among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness.MethodsThe study enrolled patients who were hospitalized in a GIHSN hospital in the previous 48 h with acute respiratory symptoms and who had symptoms consistent with influenza within the 7 days before admission. Enrolled patients were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to confirm influenza virus infection. “Complicated hospitalization” was defined as a need for mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or in-hospital death. In each of four age strata (&lt; 15, 15–&lt; 50, 50–&lt; 65, and ≥ 65 years), factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients were identified by mixed effects logistic regression and those associated with length of hospital stay using a linear mixed-effects regression model.ResultsThe study included 12,803 hospitalized patients at 14 coordinating sites in 13 countries, of which 4306 (34%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza viruses B/Yamagata, A/H3N2, and A/H1N1pdm09 strains dominated and cocirculated, although the dominant strains varied between sites. Complicated hospitalization occurred in 10.6% of influenza-positive patients. Factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15–&lt; 50 years and ≥ 65 years), diabetes (15–&lt; 50 years), male sex (50–&lt; 65 years), hospitalization during the last 12 months (50–&lt; 65 years), and current smoking (≥65 years). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (50–&lt; 65 years), other chronic conditions (15–&lt; 50 years), influenza A (50–&lt; 65 years), and hospitalization during the last 12 months (&lt; 15 years) were associated with a longer hospital stay. The proportion of patients with complicated influenza did not differ between influenza A and B.ConclusionsComplicated hospitalizations occurred in over 10% of patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Factors commonly associated with complicated or longer hospitalization differed by age group but commonly included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hospitalization during the last 12 months.">

        <span class="abst" title="BackgroundThree different genotypes of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been classified: East/Central/South African (ECSA), West African (WA), and Asian. Previously, a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test detecting CHIKV E1-antigen showed high sensitivity for certain ECSA-genotype viruses, but this test showed poor performance against the Asian-genotype virus that is spreading in the American continents. We found that the reactivity of one monoclonal antibody (MAb) used in the IC rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is affected by a single amino acid substitution in E1. Therefore, we developed new MAbs that exhibited specific recognition of all three genotypes of CHIKV.MethodsUsing a combination of the newly generated MAbs, we developed a novel version of the IC RDT with improved sensitivity to Asian-genotype CHIKV. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the new version of the IC RDT, we first used CHIKV isolates and E1-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We then used clinical specimens obtained in Aruba in 2015 and in Bangladesh in 2017 for further evaluation of RDT sensitivity and specificity. Another alphavirus, sindbis virus (SINV), was used to test RDT cross-reactivity.ResultsThe new version of the RDT detected Asian-genotype CHIKV at titers as low as 10^4 plaque-forming units per mL, a concentration that was below the limit of detection of the old version. The new RDT had sensitivity to the ECSA genotype that was comparable with that of the old version, yielding 92% (92 out of 100) sensitivity (95% confidence interval 85.0–95.9) and 100% (100 out of 100) specificity against a panel of 100 CHIKV-positive and 100 CHIKV-negative patient sera obtained in the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh.ConclusionsOur newly developed CHIKV antigen-detecting RDT demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and lacked cross-reactivity against SINV. These results suggested that our new version of the CHIKV E1-antigen RDT is promising for use in areas in which the Asian and ECSA genotypes of CHIKV circulate. Further validation with large numbers of CHIKV-positive and -negative clinical samples is warranted. (323 words).">
