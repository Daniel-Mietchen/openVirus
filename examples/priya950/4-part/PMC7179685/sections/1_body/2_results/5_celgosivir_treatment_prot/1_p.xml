<p>Having demonstrated that the inhibition of PRVABC59 ZIKV by iminosugar celgosivir was not due to altered cellular antiviral gene expression, all three iminosugars were further evaluated for antiviral activity. Castanospermine (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E,F</xref>), were similar in their ability to reduce ZIKV-induced cell death induced by PRVABC59 ZIKV in both Vero and CHME3 cells. Across all concentrations, 1 or 10 μM of each compound was the most effective in reducing ZIKV-induced cell death. Vero cells infected with PRVABC59 alone resulted in 50–55% cell death 72 h post-infection as reflected by a decrease in absorbance. Uninfected cells showed an absorbance close to 2.0 Au at 490 nm, whereas the absorbance of PRVABC59 infected cells was 1.0 Au. However, PRVABC59-infected cells treated with iminosugars ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM were able to rescue the extent of cell death by 30–40% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,C,E</xref>). In CHME3 cells infected with PRVABC59 ZIKV, similar trends were seen. Generally, PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected CHME3 cells alone underwent 21–45% cell death. Iminosugars were able to rescue the number of viable cells by ∼40% in comparison to PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected CHME3 cells alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B,D,F</xref>). Overall, the ability to rescue cell death was comparable between all iminosugars tested.
