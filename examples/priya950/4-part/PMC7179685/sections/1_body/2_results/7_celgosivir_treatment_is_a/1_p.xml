<p>Zika virus has been shown to cause necrosis in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, especially at 48, 72, and 96 hpi (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>). Histopathological changes such as necrosis have been observed in the brains of newborn babies who are congenitally infected with ZIKV (

The effect of iminosugars on cytopathogenicity was further characterized by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay to determine if iminosugar use could reduce ZIKV-induced necrosis. CHME3 infection with PRVABC59 ZIKV alone substantially increased LDH levels at 48 and 72 hpi (
