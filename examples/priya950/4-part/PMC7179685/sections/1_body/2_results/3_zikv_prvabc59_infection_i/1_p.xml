<p>The antiviral gene response to ZIKV in human microglial cells is not fully characterized. To understand the antiviral response in the CHME3 human microglial cell line, we next investigated the expression levels of antiviral genes MDA5, RIG-I, MX1, IRF7, IFNβ, and ISG15 following infection with PRVABC59 ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). All genes were slightly downregulated at 24 hpi. MDA5, RIG-I, MX1, IFNβ were significantly upregulated in PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells at 48 and 72 hpi. IRF7 and ISG15 levels were also higher in infected cells at these timepoints, but the increase expression level was not statistically significant. The difference in antiviral gene expression levels between PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected and mock-infected cells was most evident with IFNβ (
