<p>Iminosugars are known to reduce virus replication by inhibiting viral glycoprotein maturation and not by altering the cellular antiviral response. Therefore, antiviral gene expression analysis was also conducted on PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected CHME3 cells with or without treatment with 1 μM celgosivir. Celgosivir treatment alone did not significantly affect expression of investigated genes at most timepoints, and expression levels of MDA5, RIG-I, MX1, IRF7, and ISG15 were not significantly different between celgosivir-treated and vehicle-treated PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected cells at any timepoint (

At 48 hpi, a slight decrease (22%) of IFNβ gene expression was observed between celgosivir-treated and untreated mock-infected CHME3 cells, which was statistically significant. However, the level of IFNβ expression was again similar at 72 hpi. Similarly, IFNβ expression levels were decreased by 27% (
