<p>To evaluate the ability of iminosugars to inhibit ZIKV replication, we compared viral RNA and infectious virus in culture supernatants of ZIKV-infected Vero and CHME3 cells at 48 hpi with and without iminosugar treatment. Because the Asian lineage of ZIKV is responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas with increased morbidity compared with ZIKV of the African lineage, we first investigated infection with the Asian-lineage strain PRVABC59, isolated in 2015 from a human patient in Puerto Rico. Significant reductions (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0318) of PRVABC59 ZIKV RNA compared with vehicle control were observed in supernatants of Vero cells treated with 1 μM of castanospermine (

 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0253) of viral RNA was also observed in iminosugar-treated CHME3 cells infected at MOI 0.5 (
