<p>A total of three iminosugars, namely castanospermine, celgosivir, andDNJ, were tested for cytotoxicity in Vero and CHME3 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM. The cytotoxicity screen was used to determine the range of concentrations which did not significantly reduce metabolically active cells and to define the appropriate conditions to use in further efficacy studies. No reduction in metabolic activity compared to vehicle control was found when castanospermine (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>) were applied to either cell type at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 μM. However, a decrease in metabolic activity, indicating cytotoxicity, was observed in both cell types when treated with 1000 μM of castanospermine, celgosivir, or DNJ. The concentration of 1 μM was selected for targeted investigation of iminosugar effects on ZIKV infection.
