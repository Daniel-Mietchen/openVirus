<p>A cell viability assay was used to evaluate both the cytotoxicity and antiviral abilities of the iminosugars with appropriate controls as previously described (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>) using the CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Promega, Madison, WI, United States) following the manufacturer’s instructions. At 60–70% confluence, Vero cells and CHME3 cells were pretreated with iminosugars for 2 h and then infected with ZIKV according to the plate layout shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Four biological replicates were used to assess cytotoxicity, and six replicates were used to assess the antiviral ability of each iminosugar with concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM or vehicle (sterile nuclease-free water). Cells treated with iminosugars or vehicle control were infected with ZIKV strain PRVABC59, IBH30656 or MEX 2-81 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in infection medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. The CHME3 infection medium was additionally supplemented with 0.1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA). At 72 h post-infection (hpi), MTS solution was added to the wells, and after 2 h, the optical density was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (ELx800; BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States). Previous studies have shown that ER α-glucosidase inhibitor, Celgosivir prevents DENV secretion in primary human macrophages with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5 μM and has CC
 <sub>50</sub> greater than 1000 μM in MBDK cells (
