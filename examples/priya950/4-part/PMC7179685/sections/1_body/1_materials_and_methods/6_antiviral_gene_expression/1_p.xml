<p>CHME3 cells grown in 6-well plates and at 70% confluency were infected with PRVABC59 at MOI 1. After pre-incubation with the virus for 2 h, medium from cells was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh infection medium containing 1 μM celgosivir was added. Negative control wells were added with infection medium without celgosivir. Three wells were used for each treatment. At 24, 48, and 72 h, total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Plus Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using 4 μl of qScript cDNA SuperMix (5x) (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA, United States). qRT-PCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using PowerSybr Green PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIGI), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), interferon β (IFNβ), interferon-induced GTP-binding protein (MX1) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) were quantified, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) was used as a house-keeping gene for data normalization. All primers used were previously published and were supplied by IDT (
