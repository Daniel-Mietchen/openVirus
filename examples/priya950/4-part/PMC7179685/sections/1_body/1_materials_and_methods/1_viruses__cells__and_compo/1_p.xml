<p>Two human ZIKV strains, namely PRVABCB59 (Human/2015/Puerto Rico), IBH30656 (Human/1968/Nigeria) and one mosquito ZIKV strain MEX 2-81 (Mosquito/2016/Mexico) obtained from BEI Resources were used in this study. All viruses were propagated in Vero cells, and virus titration was carried out by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> in Vero and calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Reed and Muench, 1938</xref>). African green monkey kidney Vero (CCL-81) cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Corning, NY, United States) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Corning) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Corning) at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Human immortalized microglial cell lines (CHME3) cells (courtesy Dr. Pamela Hankey Giblin, Penn State University) were used in this study. CHME3 cell line was established through SV40-dependent immortalization of a human fetal brain-derived primary microglia culture. Human microglial cell line CHME3 was cultured in medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Corning), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Corning), and 0.1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA, GE Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, United States) at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. ER α-glucosidase inhibitors castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride (DNJ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States), and celgosivir was purchased from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ, United States). All compounds were dissolved in sterile nuclease-free water.
