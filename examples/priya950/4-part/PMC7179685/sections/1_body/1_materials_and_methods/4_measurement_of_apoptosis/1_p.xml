<p>Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by measuring the levels of active caspase 3 and 7 in cells using the Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> 3/7 Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. CHME3 cells in 96-well white-walled cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) were pre-treated with celgosivir for 2 h and then infected with PRVABC59 at MOI 1 in the presence of celgosivir at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM or vehicle. Controls for media color, cells, and virus were included. At 48 and 72 hpi, Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> Reagent was added, and after 30 min the luminescence of each sample was read five times using a Spark multimode microplate reader (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland) at an interval of 2 min for 15 s. The average of the five readings was used as the measurement for each biological replicate.
