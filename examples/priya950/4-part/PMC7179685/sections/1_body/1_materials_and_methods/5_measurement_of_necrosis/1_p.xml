<p>Cell necrosis was evaluated by measuring the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cells using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. LDH is a soluble stable cytosolic enzyme present in many cell types which is rapidly released into the cell culture medium following disruption of the plasma membrane. LDH is a widely used marker to measure cellular cytotoxicity and necrosis. CHME3 cells in 96-well cell culture plates were pre-treated with celgosivir for 2 h and then infected with PRVABC59 at MOI 1 in the presence of celgosivir at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM or vehicle. Controls for media color, cells, and virus were included. At 48 and 72 hpi, 50 μl of supernatant from each well was transferred into a new 96-well plate, and 50 μl of CytoTox 96
 <sup>®</sup> Reagent was added to each well. After incubating at room temperature in the dark, 50 μl of Stop Solution was added to each well, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader (BioTek).
