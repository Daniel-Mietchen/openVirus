<p>Although the iminosugars we tested demonstrated effectiveness against ZIKV starting at very low concentrations, castanospermine, DNJ and celgosivir were well-tolerated in Vero and CHME3 cells even at concentrations of 100 Î¼M or more. This low cytotoxicity profile of iminosugars has also been observed in many other cell types including HEK293 cells with IHVR-19029 (
