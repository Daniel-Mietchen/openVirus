<p>A key pathogenicity factor in viral infection is necrosis of virus-infected cells, which leads to pro-inflammatory response due to the leakage of cellular contents. It is clear that ZIKV can induce high levels of cell death (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Olmo et al., 2017</xref>) and that cell death ultimately drives ZIKV-related developmental abnormalities of the brain. As macrophages, microglia are the main immune cell of the brain and begin this role early in brain development (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015</xref>). Our data showed that ZIKV infection of CHME3 microglial cells results in substantial necrosis as evidenced by significantly elevated LDH levels. Further, we found that celgosivir was able to decrease necrosis induced by ZIKV at 72 hpi, which could limit inflammatory responses

That treatment of ZIKV-infected CHME3 microglial cells with iminosugars reversed the decrease in metabolic activity and reduced percentage of viability due to ZIKV infection. If similar responses occurred with microglial cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, more cells in the developing brain may remain alive, the remaining microglia could help sustain an effective response fostering eradication of ZIKV from brain. Finally, since there is only one subtype of ZIKV, we hypothesized that iminosugars would cause similar antiviral effects against different ZIKV isolates. The results of this study were in strong support of our hypothesis as a decrease in cytopathogenicity was seen upon the addition of castanospermine, celgosivir, and DNJ, regardless of the ZIKV strain used. These isolates represent strains isolated from 1968 to 2016 from different geographic locations, time periods, hosts and lineages, and results show that iminosugars similarly inhibit cell death induced by different isolates.
