<p>We found that following ZIKV infection in both Vero and CHME3 cells infected at MOI 1, as little as 0.01 μM of either celgosivir or DNJ improved cell viability to over 90%. Castanospermine treatment was slightly less effective, requiring 10 μM to achieve 90% cell viability in CHME3 cells. A recent study reported the first use of iminosugar therapy against ZIKV wherein the iminosugar IHVR-19029 decreased ZIKV RNA production following HEK293 embryonic kidney cells infected at MOI 0.1 when used at 0.1 μM, the lowest concentration tested (

For example, Rathore et al. showed that celgosivir and castanospermine could inhibit dengue virus (DENV) in BHK-21 cells infected at MOI 0.3, but celgosivir was 100 times more effective than castanospermine (
