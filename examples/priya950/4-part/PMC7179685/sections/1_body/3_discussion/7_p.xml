<p>Of all compounds studied, celgosivir is the most promising as evidenced by its ability to reduce viral RNA and infectious virus titers in both Vero and CHME3 cells with no effect on cellular apoptosis and antiviral responses. Celgosivir (or 6-
 <italic>O</italic>-butanoyl castanospermine) is alkylated on its ring nitrogen and has been shown to be more effective as a chemical target than its parent compound or compounds that have no modification on their ring nitrogen (

Its highly protective ability against dengue virus in very vulnerable mice with disrupted type I and type II interferon response is reason to believe that an optimized dosing regimen will allow celgosivir to succeed in clinical trials against dengue virus (

In light of celgosivirâ€™s action against ZIKV, future studies may also evaluate the dose- and schedule-dependent effectiveness of celgosivir against this related flavivirus.
