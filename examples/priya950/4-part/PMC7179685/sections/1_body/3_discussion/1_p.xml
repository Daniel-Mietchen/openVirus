<p>Zika virus continues to spread throughout the world and remains a significant public health threat. While multiple intervention therapies are under development, currently there are no approved vaccines or antivirals to prevent damaging neurological syndromes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly, which are multifactorial diseases that still need to be studied in depth. Hence, there is an urgent need to investigate and evaluate antiviral therapies for ZIKV infection. In this study, we evaluated the ability of three iminosugars with ER α-glucosidase inhibitor (ER-AGI) activity with different chemical structures to inhibit ZIKV replication both in a cell line commonly used to propagate ZIKV (Vero cells) and in a clinically relevant human microglial cell line (CHME3 cells). This study provides evidence of effectiveness of iminosugars to inhibit ZIKV in cells from the brain, rescuing cells from ZIKV-induced cell death while maintaining cellular antiviral response.</p>
