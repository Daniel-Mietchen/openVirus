<p>Zika virus, like other flaviviruses, has three N-glycosylated proteins, precursor of the membrane (prM), envelope (E), and non-structural protein NS1, that are substrates for the ER Î±-glucosidase enzymes during ZIKV replication (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). ZIKV replication and viral RNA synthesis occurs on an extended network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The ZIKV capsid protein binds to viral RNA during the process of nucleocapsid assembly, forming the core of mature virus particles, which is aided by NS1 protein (
