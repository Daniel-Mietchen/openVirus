<p>By phylogenetic analysis, ZIKV isolates cluster into two lineages, namely African and Asian (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Haddow et al., 2012</xref>). Epidemic ZIKV strains from French Polynesia and the Americas cluster are included in the Asian lineage of ZIKV (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 2016</xref>). African strains have been shown to induce a more cytopathic effect

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bhatnagar et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Sheridan et al., 2018</xref>). It is speculated that Asian strains induce less cytopathic effect and maintain cell viability to allow a longer period of viral persistence and replication (
