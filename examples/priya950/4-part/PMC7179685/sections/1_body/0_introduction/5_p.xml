<p>A promising avenue for effective anti-flaviviral therapeutics is a class of host-directed antivirals, namely iminosugars, with ER α-glucosidase inhibitor (ER-AGI) activity that are known to inhibit a range of enveloped RNA and DNA viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by interrupting proper folding of viral proteins (

They mimic endogenous sugars and compete with endogenous substrates for binding to ER α-glucosidases. ER α-glucosidases I and II are responsible for trimming terminal glucose moieties on N-linked glycans attached to nascent glycoproteins. α-glucosidase I removes the outermost α-1,2-linked glucose residue while α-glucosidase II removes the inner two α-1,3-linked glucose residues. These steps are essential for subsequent calnexin/calreticulin chaperone interaction (

Incompletely folded proteins are re-glycosylated by UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and undergo the process again until they are properly folded. While properly folded glycoproteins move to the Golgi apparatus for maturation, improperly folded glycoproteins accumulate in the ER and will ultimately undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (

In studies, patients deficient in α-glucosidases I or II showed no clinical evidence of recurrent viral infections, and cells derived from these patients were unable to support infection by multiple viruses such as HIV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, poliovirus and vaccinia virus (
