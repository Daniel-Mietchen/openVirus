<p>Zika virus is an icosahedral, enveloped RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and flavivirus genus. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito species are the two main insect vectors that transmit ZIKV (

Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently garnered global attention following its re-emergence in the past decade throughout the Pacific Islands and the Americas. In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency due to the increased association of ZIKV infections with fetal abnormalities, autoimmune disease, and neurological disorders. ZIKV has been relatively uninvestigated since its initial discovery in Uganda in 1947 (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Oehler et al., 2014</xref>). Until this point, symptoms of ZIKV infection were mild, including fever, rash, and malaise. Since its emergence in the Pacific islands and the Americas, ZIKV has been associated with increased infection rates, neurological pathologies such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis in adults, and microcephaly in infants (
