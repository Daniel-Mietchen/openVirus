  <p>Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) significantly inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) replication in Vero and CHME3 cells without cytotoxicity. Vero cells 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and CHME3 cells 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were treated with DNJ in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μM, and cytotoxicity was quantified by MTS assay at 72 h post treatment. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Cell culture supernatant from Vero cells 
   <bold>(C,E)</bold> and CHME3 cells 
   <bold>(D,F)</bold> infected with ZIKV PRVABC59 at MOI of 0.5 or 5 with and without 1 μM DNJ treatment were harvested at 48 hpi. ZIKV RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR assay 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. Infectious ZIKV titration was determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold>. Data represent mean values of four biological replicates. Infectious ZIKV titration was determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold>. Error bars represent standard deviation.
