 <italic>Reporting</italic>. During October 1, 2015â€“March 31, 2016, the Boffa health centers did not report any cases or outbreaks of the four epidemic-prone diseases included in this study (cholera, meningococcal meningitis, measles, and yellow fever). Therefore, immediate reporting of epidemic-prone diseases to the next levels could not be assessed. However, the interviewee outlined the prefectural health department protocol for managing immediate reports as follows: (1) prefectural health department prepared a case investigation form and a laboratory test request form; (2) the laboratory sample and the investigation form were transported by a health department vehicle, although the transport vehicle frequently had no fuel because of a shortage of funds; and (3) the Medical Director of Disease Surveillance alerted the Ministry of Health by telephone, although these telephone calls were not typically documented.
