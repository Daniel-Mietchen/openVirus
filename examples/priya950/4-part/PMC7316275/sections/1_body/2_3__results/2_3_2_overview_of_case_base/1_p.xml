<p>Per Guineaâ€™s national disease surveillance strategy and as of September 2016, case-based disease surveillance in Boffa for priority diseases, including epidemic-prone diseases, began with case identification, typically at the health centers and prefecture hospital (

These cases were reported by the health centers and prefecture hospital staff to the Boffa Prefectural Health Department, which subsequently reported cases to the Division for the Prevention and Control of Disease in Conakry. The regional health department was not part of this reporting structure. Ministry of Health protocol required two reporting mechanisms for case-based disease surveillance of epidemic-prone diseases: immediate and routine weekly reporting. Immediate reporting occurred when a health center or prefecture hospital care provider suspected or identified a case of an epidemic-prone disease and immediately notified the prefectural health department by telephone. The prefectural health department staff would then immediately notify the Ministry of Health by telephone. Routine weekly reporting occurred when each reporting level (community and prefectural) provided weekly aggregate case counts of the priority diseases, including epidemic-prone diseases, for the proceeding 7 days to the next level.
