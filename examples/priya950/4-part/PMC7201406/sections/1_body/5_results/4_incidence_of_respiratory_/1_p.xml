The incidence rates of RSV-ALRI followed a similar trend across age groups as that of symptomatic RSV illness, with incidences increasing with age until peaking among participants aged 6–11, with 181.8 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 143.1–231.0). While children aged &lt;3 months had the lowest overall RSV illness rates, they had the highest rate of RSV-severe ALRI (
