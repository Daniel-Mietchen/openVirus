<p>Using data from a community-based, prospective birth cohort study, we found a high incidence of symptomatic RSV illness in Nicaragua in children aged &lt;2 years. Infants aged &lt;3 months had the highest rates of severe RSV infection outcomes, including severe ALRI and hospitalization. In our birth cohort, laboratory-confirmed RSV illness was associated with one-third of deaths. In this population, many common contributors to infant mortality in LMICs are missing, as &gt;98% children received World Health Organizationâ€“recommended immunizations [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus is low [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and malaria is absent, suggesting RSV is a significant contributor to infant mortality. This finding has important implications for a number of countries that have full coverage under the Expanded Program on Immunization but still struggle to lower infant mortality.
