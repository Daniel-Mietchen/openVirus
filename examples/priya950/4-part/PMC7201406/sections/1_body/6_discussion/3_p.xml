<p>There are limited published data about the incidences of RSV in community settings in LMICs, especially in Central America [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Shi et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] compiled data from 329 studies, of which only 14 (4%) were community-based with active case-ascertainment. Of these 14, only 1 was from Central America (Guatemala) [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Guatemalan study reported an incidence of RSV pneumonia among children aged ≤18 months of 143.6 per 1000 person years (95% CI 116.2–177.3) [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While the Guatemala estimate was higher than the estimate in our study (70.6 cases per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 58.0–85.8; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 5</xref>), this is likely because, in the Guatemalan study, RSV-ALRI cases were identified only from children with physician-diagnosed pneumonia, not the overall study population.
