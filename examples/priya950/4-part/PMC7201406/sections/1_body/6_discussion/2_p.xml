<p>Our findings are consistent with published estimates from other parts of the world [

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a review of the 2015 global burden of RSV-ALRI, Shi et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported incidence rates ranging from 26.6–343.8 per 1000 person-years among children aged 0–5 months, 18.0–338.1 among those aged 6–11 months, and 21.8–304.3 among those aged 12–23 months. A study conducted in the Peruvian highlands was responsible for the highest estimates in all age groups, reporting rates approximately double those of the next highest estimates (

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our RSV-associated ALRI estimates were similar to the majority of studies referenced by Shi et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (ie, 67, 160, and 93 per 1000 person-years among children aged 0–5, 6–11, and 12–23 months, respectively). We did observe rates of symptomatic RSV and ALRI that peaked later (among infants 6–11 months) than other studies. It is possible that our age-specific estimates of symptomatic RSV are biased from the inclusion of reported/measured fever, as the proportion of RSV illnesses presenting with fever increases with age. However, a study in Guatemala [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed a similar pattern, suggesting that regional variations might impact the age distribution of RSV incidences.
