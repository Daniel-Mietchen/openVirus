<p>Identifying and quantifying RSV-associated mortality is challenging, and the most appropriate time period to use in classifying deaths associated with RSV remains a subject of debate [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. RSV-associated mortality might peak weeks after the original RSV infection and, perhaps, be associated with secondary bacterial infectiosn [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33â€“35</xref>]. A recent examination of RSV mortality in Minnesota included deaths that occurred within an 8-week period of laboratory confirmation [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, the quantification of RSV-associated mortality in community-based studies is limited by the fact that only a relatively small number of deaths are expected. However, in our study, out of 8 deaths from medical causes, 2 deaths seemed clearly associated with RSV, because they occurred within 2 weeks of the onset of laboratory-confirmed RSV illness; we could argue that a third death (approximately 6 weeks following RSV laboratory confirmation) was also associated with RSV illness. Thus, 25% or 37.5% of deaths from medical causes were associated with RSV.
