<p>Multiple hospital-based studies have demonstrated that the inclusion of fever (measured [≥38°C] or reported) in case definitions results in an underestimate of RSV cases, particularly among children aged &lt;1 year [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>]. Studies using data from cohorts initially designed to study influenza (like this study) are susceptible to such underestimates, as case definitions like influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness reflect influenza’s more frequent presentation with fever. While we were unable to make direct comparisons across a variety of case definitions—as Saha et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Nyawanda et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and Rha et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] did—we did conduct sensitivity analyses examining the effect of including nurse-/physician-measured fevers (≥38°C) on RSV rates. Had a measured fever been included as a required criteria for sampling and/or testing, our estimated incidence rates would have been 30–70% lower, depending on participants’ ages. Such findings suggest the value of developing RSV-specific case definitions, like those pursued through the World Health Organization’s Global RSV Surveillance Pilot [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While our testing definition likely missed some cases of symptomatic RSV infection—particularly among those aged &lt;1 year—the majority of any missed cases were most likely among those with less severe illnesses. The inclusion of any severe respiratory symptoms (regardless of fever/history of fever) in this study’s testing criteria suggests that our assessments of more severe manifestations of RSV are good approximations of the true severe RSV burden in our study community. Future studies in this population are underway to examine the specific risks and prognostic factors contributing to this burden.
