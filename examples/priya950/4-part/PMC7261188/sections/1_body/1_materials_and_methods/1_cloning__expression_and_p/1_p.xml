<p>The L gene of SFTSV strain AH12 (GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="HQ116417" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">HQ116417</ext-link>) with a C-terminal StrepII-tag was chemically synthesized (Centic Biotech, Germany) and the plasmid-integrated gene was amplified via PCR. In the same step, primers were used for the introduction of mutations to the gene in the case of the catalytically inactive L proteins (D112A and D1126A). Amplified genes were cloned into an altered pFastBacHT B vector using the In-Fusion HD EcoDry Cloning Kit (Clontech). After transformation of DH10EMBacY 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells (kindly provided by Imre Berger), which contain a bacmid as well as a plasmid coding for a topoisomerase, with the pFastBac-plasmids, recombinant bacmids were isolated and transfected into Sf21 insect cells for recombinant baculovirus production. Hi5 insect cells were used for the expression of the StrepII-tagged L proteins. The harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 10% (w/w) glycerol and 2 mM dithiothreitol), supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween20 and protease inhibitors (Roche, cOmplete mini), lysed by sonication and centrifuged two times at 20 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Soluble protein was loaded on Strep-TactinXT beads (IBA) and eluted with 50 mM Biotin (Applichem) in buffer B (50 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (w/w) glycerol and 2 mM dithiothreitol). L protein-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0) before loading onto a heparin column (HiTrap Heparin HP, GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted with buffer A and concentrated using centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultra, 30 kDa MWCO). The proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in buffer B and either used for biochemical assays or SAXS experiments. Purified L proteins were concentrated as described above, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
