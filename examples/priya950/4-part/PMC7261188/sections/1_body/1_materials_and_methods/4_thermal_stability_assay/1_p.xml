<p>Thermal stability of SFTSV CBD was measured by thermofluor assay (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The assay contained a final concentration of 8 μM of CBD protein, 20 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, SYPRO-Orange (final dilution 1:1000) and either no additive or between 1 and 10 mM of m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP, m
 <sup>7</sup>GpppG, GTP or ATP. Thermal stability of influenza A virus PB2 CBD and RVFV CBD was assessed at a final protein concentration of 10 and 8 μM, respectively, in the same setup as described for SFTSV CBD.
