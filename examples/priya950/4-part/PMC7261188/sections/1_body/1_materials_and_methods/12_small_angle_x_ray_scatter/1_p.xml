<p>Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of SFTSV L protein was performed with an in-line size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7, 500 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Data was collected at the SAXS beamline P12 of PETRA III storage ring of the DESY, Hamburg, Germany (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) using a PILATUS 2M pixel detector at 3.0 m sample distance and 10 keV energy (λ = 1.24 Å), a momentum transfer range of 0.01 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> &lt; s &lt; 0.45 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> was covered (
 <italic>s</italic> = 4π sin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). Data were analyzed using the ATSAS 2.8 package (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The SEC-SAXS data were analyzed with CHROMIXS and the forward scattering 
 <italic>I</italic>(0) and the radius of gyration

 <sub>g</sub> were extracted from the Guinier approximation calculated with the AutoRG function within PRIMUS (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). GNOM (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) provided the pair distribution function 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>r</italic>) of the particle, the maximum size

 <sub>max</sub> and the Porod volume. 
 <italic>Ab initio</italic> reconstructions were generated with DAMMIF (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Forty independent DAMMIF runs were compared and clustered into five main classes using DAMCLUST (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Models within each class were superimposed by SUPCOMB (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and averaged using DAMAVER (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The structures were visualized using UCSF Chimera (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).
