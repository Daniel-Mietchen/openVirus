<p>Aliquots of 3 μl of SFTSV L protein diluted to 0.6 μM in buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil R 2/1 Au G200F4 grids, immediately blotted for 2 s using an FEI Vitrobot Mk IV (4°C, 100% humidity, blotting force –10) and plunge frozen in liquid ethane/propane cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The grids were loaded into a 300-keV Titan Krios transmission electron cryo-microscope (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a K3 direct electron detector and a GIF BioQuantum energy filter (Gatan). A total of 2626 movie frames were collected using the EPU software (Thermo Scientific) at a nominal magnification of ×105 000 with a pixel size of 0.87 Å and a defocus range of –1 to –3 μm. Each movie fractionated into 60 frames, was collected for a total exposure time of 3 s with a flux of 15 electrons per physical pixel per second and a total exposure of 59.45 e/Å
 <sup>2</sup> with a 20-eV slit for the GIF (
