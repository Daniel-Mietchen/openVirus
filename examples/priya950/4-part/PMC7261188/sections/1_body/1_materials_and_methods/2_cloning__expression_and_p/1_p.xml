<p>The L gene region corresponding to amino acid residues 1695–1810 of SFTSV strain AH12 (GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="HQ116417" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">HQ116417</ext-link>) was cloned into a pOPINF vector (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (New England BioLabs). The protein, which based on sequence alignments corresponds to the CBD of RVFV (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and therefore referred to as SFTSV CBD, was expressed as a wild-type version or mutated version (with single amino acid exchanges F1705A, Q1707A or Y1719A) in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 Gold (DE3) (Novagen) at 17°C overnight using TB medium and 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside for induction. After pelleting, the cells were resuspended in 50 mM Na-phosphate pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, Complete protease inhibitor EDTA-free (Roche), 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.025% (w/v) lysozyme and subsequently disrupted by sonication. The protein was purified from the soluble fraction after centrifugation by Ni affinity chromatography. Washing buffers contained 50 mM imidazole and 1 M NaCl or 50 mM imidazole and 100 mM NaCl. Elution buffer contained 500 mM imidazole and the eluted protein was immediately diluted with 20 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5 followed by passing through an anion exchange chromatography column (HiTrap Q FF, GE Healthcare) and subsequent cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP FF, GE Healthcare, loading buffer: 50 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, elution with salt gradient up to 1 M NaCl). The next step was the removal of the N-terminal His-tag by a GST-tagged 3C protease at 4°C overnight. After addition of up to 3 mM m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP, the protein was concentrated for a final size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol). Purified proteins were concentrated using centrifugal devices with addition of up to 4 mM m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP (final concentration), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. For thermal shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry, the purification procedure was done as described above but without any addition of m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP.
