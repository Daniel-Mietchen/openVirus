<p>The affinity of SFTSV CBD to m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP and GTP was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern Panalytical). Proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 50 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol. The ligand m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP was dissolved and GTP was diluted in the exact same dialysis buffer. Titrations were done with 150 μM CBD in the cell and 5.0–6.5 mM m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP or GTP in the syringe at 25°C with 19 injections of 2 μl (first injection 0.5 μl). Spacing between injections was constant with 150 s for all measurements. Data were analyzed and fitted with the respective PEAQ ITC evaluation software (Malvern) applying a single side binding model and fixing the stoichiometry value to 1.
