<p>The 5′ hook RNA binding site in LACV is formed by the PA-C like and the fingers domains. We identified potential 5′ RNA-binding residues in SFTSV that closely match in location and number with the residues detected for 5′ hook binding in LACV (Figure

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). Similar to LACV we observe clustering of positively charged residues in this pocket that, in terms of size, allows to accommodate the 5′ RNA of LACV (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S7B and S8B</xref>). However, the exact residues interacting with the 5′ RNA cannot be predicted, as the 3D structure of the SFTSV hook remains unclear. In an attempt to characterize the possible conformations of the SFTSV 5′ RNA, we used the RNA secondary structure prediction program Mfold (

Moreover, whereas in influenza virus and LACV the 5′ hook structure forms within the first 10 nucleotides, this seems rather unlikely for SFTSV 5′ termini judging from the predictions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). It may be that the RNA hook structure is stabilized by base-specific protein–RNA interactions rather than base-pairing. However, the sequences reported for SFTSV genome segment termini vary significantly between the L and M segments on the one hand and the S segment on the other hand (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Therefore, additional structural information is necessary to make reliable conclusions about the putative 5′ hook structure and how it binds to the L protein. In summary, we observe potential 5′ and 3′ RNA binding sites in the SFTSV apo-L protein analogous to RNA binding sites reported for LACV L and also influenza virus polymerase.
