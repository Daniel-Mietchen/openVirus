<p>Although the cap-binding ability of the isolated domain seems to be clearly present we were unable to establish cap-dependent transcription assays for the full-length SFTSV L protein. In the presence of a 16 nt primer, capped or uncapped, designed to hybridize with the three nucleotides at the 3′ end of the template strand, the L protein synthesized a product which was about ∼12–16 nt larger than the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> product (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15A</xref>). This result indicates that the primer was incorporated into the final product, but independent of the need for a 5′ cap.
