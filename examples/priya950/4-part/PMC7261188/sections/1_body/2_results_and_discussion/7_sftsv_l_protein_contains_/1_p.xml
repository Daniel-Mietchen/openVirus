<p>In analogy to influenza virus polymerase, the C-terminal region of the bunyavirus L protein has been suggested to contain the CBD that is needed for the cap-snatching mechanism employed by sNSV for transcription priming (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Recently, the CBD of closely related RVFV has been determined and the residues interacting with a co-crystallized cap-analogue m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP have been proven to be essential for virus transcription in a cell-based minireplicon system (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As the C-terminal domain of SFTSV apo-L could not be resolved from the cryo-EM data, we expressed only the putative CBD (residues 1695–1810) in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The purified protein crystallized as a monomer in complex with an m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP cap-analogue and the crystals diffracted to 1.35 Å resolution (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The SFTSV CBD is structurally very similar to RVFV CBD with a 7-stranded mixed β-sheet, a β-hairpin at the periphery of the domain and a long α-helix packed against the β-sheet (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The key residues responsible for the interaction with the m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP are functionally conserved among phenuiviruses (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). The m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP is stacked between the two aromatic side chains of F1703 and Y1719 extending from the first β-strand and the β-hairpin, respectively. Further interactions are observed between Q1707 from the hinge between the first β-strand and the β-hairpin, L1772 from the end of the long α-helix and the carbonyl group of D1771 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). We characterized the interaction of m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP and the protein by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thermal stability assays (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). ITC data demonstrate specific interaction of SFTSV CBD with m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP cap-analogue in contrast to extremely weak interaction with unmethylated GTP (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Analysis of ITC data provided a dissociation constant of

 <sub>D</sub> ∼138 μM for m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP binding to SFTSV CBD which is 5-fold lower than the

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58–60</xref>). Thermal stability assays revealed a larger shift in the melting temperature (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>) for SFTSV CBD upon addition of m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP compared to GTP or ATP (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Consistent with the higher affinity of SFTSV CBD for m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP determined by ITC, the shift in 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> was also higher compared to RVFV CBD (compare Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14A</xref>): +8°C for SFTSV versus +4.5°C for RVFV in the presence of 10 mM m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP. We observe this difference between SFTSV and RVFV in both assays even though the number of interactions between the protein and the m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP ligand is only slightly higher in SFTSV compared to RVFV (compare 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref> with data from Gogrefe 
 <italic>et al.</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To provide additional evidence for the essential role of residues interacting with m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP, we expressed and purified individual F1703A, Y1719A and Q1707A mutants of the CBD and tested them in the thermal stability assay (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14B</xref>). As expected, the mutated CBDs were not significantly thermally stabilized in the presence of m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP and the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> of the mutated proteins was ∼3–4°C lower than the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> of the wild-type CBD indicating overall lower stability of the domain upon single mutation.
