<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the endonuclease activity of the full-length SFTSV L protein is dependent on divalent manganese or magnesium cations. As in our polymerase and proteinâ€“RNA interaction assays we also observed some degradation of the polymerase products and promoter RNA, we conclude that the endonuclease cleaves both viral and non-viral RNA. This suggests that the endonuclease activity is not sequence-specific and underlines the need for activity regulation on the one hand and the need for protection of viral RNA by binding to the L protein or viral nucleoprotein on the other hand.</p>
