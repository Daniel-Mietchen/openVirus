<p>We used a full-length construct of SFTSV L gene (strain AH12, GenBank accession 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="HQ116417" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">HQ116417</ext-link>) for baculovirus-driven protein expression in insect cells. The L protein was either expressed as wild-type protein or as single-site mutants D112A (endonuclease inactive) or D1126A (RdRp inactive). The protein was purified to homogeneity, with a final yield of up to 11 mg pure SFTSV L protein per litre of cell culture, and used for cryo-EM experiments. Based on map A, derived from the single particle 3D reconstruction and with a resolution of 3.8 Å (

 <italic>de novo</italic> model building indicating mobility of this domain in the apo-conformation of the L protein. The apo-L structure determined by cryo-EM also lacks the C-terminal 500 residues. This domain seems to be very flexible, similar to the case of apo-LACV L, where the C-terminal 500 residues could also not be resolved using cryo-EM (

However, the overall resolution was not high enough to confidently build additional parts of the protein compared to map A. In summary, we present a model for a substantial part of the SFTSV L protein in the apo-configuration and the cryo-EM map indicates the location and size of the C-terminal region.
