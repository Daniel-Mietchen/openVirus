<p>Based mainly on sequencing data from a number of sNSV, a prime-and-realign mechanism has been proposed for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> initiation of genome replication (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>) and possibly transcription (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55–57</xref>). There is substantial evidence that the LASV L protein uses a prime-and-realign mechanism during replication initiation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). LASV L protein initiates genome replication at position +2 of the template strand, produces a dinucleotide primer and realigns the 5′ end of this primer to positions -1 and +1 of the template resulting in a single nucleotide overhang of the product relative to the complementary 3′ template (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To characterize the mechanism of genome replication initiation of the SFTSV L protein, we performed primer extension polymerase assays in the presence of different radioactively labelled RNA primers and compared the product size with the size of the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> product (from polymerase reaction with radiolabeled [α]
 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, we provide an overview of all possible products for each of the primers used. In all reactions, we observe only one single product band, indicating that the SFTSV L protein employs only one replication initiation site on the template (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We observe the same product size as the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> product when using ACA or AC primers in the reaction. If CA and CAC primers are provided, the resulting products are ∼1 nt smaller than the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> product (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). Therefore, there are three possible scenarios for genome replication initiation: (i) replication is initiated terminally at position +1 of the template strand, (ii) replication is initiated internally at position +3 and the nascent ACA primer is subsequently re-aligned to position –2/–1/+1 of the template strand or (iii) replication is initiated internally at position +3 and the nascent AC or ACA primer is re-aligned to the terminal position +1/+2/+3 of the template (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). For further clarification, we used a longer primer (ACACAAA) for the reaction, which is complementary to the first seven nucleotides of the template strand and should only support terminal initiation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This primer was incorporated in a product resulting in exactly the same size as the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> product (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>) showing that we can exclude realignment of the primer to position –2/–1/+1. Although it is not possible to reliably discriminate between terminal initiation or priming and subsequent realigning of the primer to the terminal position of the template (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), terminal initiation seems more likely as there is only one defined product band detected. In case of priming internally and realigning to the terminal position one would expect to also see a minor product band, two nucleotides shorter than the main product, resulting from missing realignment. At least, this has been observed for LASV L protein, which applies a prime-and-realign mechanism for genome replication initiation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We conclude that SFTSV initiates genome replication on a vRNA template either terminally and without applying a prime-and-realign mechanism similar to influenza virus cRNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) or by priming at position +3 and subsequent realignment to the terminal position +1 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In any case, SFTSV L protein does not seem to produce a single or di-nucleotide overhang of the 5′ promoter end compared to the 3′ end. A scenario proposed for hantavirus genome replication is that after internal priming and subsequent realignment, a single-nucleotide overhang is removed by the endonuclease resulting in a monophosphorylated 5′ terminus (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, this mechanism is rather unlikely to occur during SFTSV replication initiation as we used an endonuclease inactive mutant of the L protein in our assays. Even though this mutant showed residual endonuclease activity, full cleavage would be necessary to produce the single product band we observed.
