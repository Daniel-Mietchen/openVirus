<p>SFTSV apo-L is structurally related to LACV L and the heterotrimeric influenza virus polymerase complex, although the similarity to LACV is higher (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). This is consistent with the phylogenetic relation between these viruses, which all belong to the sNSV group, and the previously described structural similarity between influenza virus polymerase and LACV L protein (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although the cryo-EM maps of SFTSV apo-L did not contain density sufficiently resolved to build the endonuclease domain 
 <italic>de novo</italic>, it was possible to unambiguously place the SFTSV endonuclease structure recently obtained by X-ray crystallography (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) (residues 1–214 of PDB 6NTV) into the map by rigid body fitting (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The endonuclease domain (residues 1–214) is connected to an influenza virus PA-C like domain via an extended linker (residues 215–286) which wraps around the fingers and palm domains (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). This linker is slightly shorter (∼15 residues) than in LACV L and has a more extended conformation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S5</xref>). Similar to LACV, the PA-C like domain (residues 287–758, with residues 342–358 and 371–445 missing interpretable density) is divided into two lobes, an α-helical ‘core lobe’ buttressing the palm and thumb domains of the L protein as well as an equivalent to the LACV vRNA binding lobe (vRBL) with a central β-sheet and at least two α-helices packing against both sides of the sheet (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). A substantial part of this vRBL domain, which constitutes a 3′ vRNA binding site in LACV L protein, is missing from the SFTSV structure as it lacks defined density in the map. According to LACV L protein and influenza virus polymerase complex, we expect these unresolved regions to represent the ‘clamp’, involved in 3′ vRNA binding, and the ‘arch’, making contacts to the 5′ vRNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). The arch is also disordered in the LACV L structure. The fingers, palm and thumb domains which contain most of the conserved RdRp active site motifs, are downstream of the PA-C like domain (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). The fingers domain (residues 759–948 and 995–1083) is again highly similar to the LACV counterpart (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>). However, the ribbon insertion (residues 853–870) extending from the fingers domain, is structurally different compared to the LACV α-ribbon and the influenza virus β-ribbon. In SFTSV L, the ribbon insertion is ∼40 residues shorter than in LACV L and structurally disordered (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S5</xref>). The corresponding β-ribbon of influenza virus, which is involved in binding of the RNA duplex region of the promoter and contains the nuclear localization sequence, is ∼16 residues longer compared to SFTSV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). The next specific feature of SFTSV L is the fingertips insertion (residues 913–920), a loop which is mostly conserved among bunyaviruses (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and contains parts of the RdRp active site motif F (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). This loop has a different conformation in SFTSV compared to LACV, which is probably related to a conformational change induced by the 5′ RNA binding that binds as a stem-loop structure (the so-called ‘hook’) to the LACV L protein (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). A second insertion into the fingers domain is the so-called fingernode (residues 1030–1057), which is composed of two α-helices and involved in 5′ vRNA binding in the LACV and influenza virus structures. A small part of what is presumably the connecting loop between the α-helices is absent in the SFTSV apo-L structure (residues 1039–1045). The fingernode is structurally very similar to the LACV fingernode but different from its counterpart in influenza virus which has a β-hairpin insertion (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). The fingers domain is followed by the palm domain of the RdRp (residues 949–994 and 1084–1194), which is structurally highly similar to LACV and influenza virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). The palm domain contains the RdRp active site motifs A and C that are involved in the coordination of the divalent metal ions and the catalysis. Additionally, the active site motifs D and E are part of the palm domain (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In contrast to the LACV palm domain, SFTSV L does not possess the so-called California insertion, whose function is unknown (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S5</xref>). The thumb domain of the RdRp (residues 1195–1308) is composed of a helical bundle and in contact with the previously mentioned PA-C like domain and the vRBL (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Residues 1309–1402, which by analogy to the LACV and influenza virus structures presumably compose the priming loop and the bridge domain, are not visible in the SFTSV model (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>). We cannot conclude on the length of the priming loop as the sequence identity to LACV is very low for this region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>) and connected parts of the bridge are missing as well (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The so-called thumb ring is also only partly visible in the apo-L structure of SFTSV (visible parts include residues 1403–1416, 1452–1502, 1579–1587 and 1596–1612). Further regions missing from the cryo-EM structure are the lid and C-terminal domain including the CBD (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2–S4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>). Overall, the SFTSV L protein has a very similar architecture as LACV and influenza virus polymerase proteins with some particular differences whose functional relevance will be interesting to determine. Regions missing from the SFTSV L and partly also from the LACV L structure indicate a high degree of flexibility of the C-terminal regions, especially the thumb ring, bridge, and C-terminal domain. Flexibility in the vRBL domain is most likely due to the absence of viral RNA to stabilize the structure but further structural data are needed to clarify this.
