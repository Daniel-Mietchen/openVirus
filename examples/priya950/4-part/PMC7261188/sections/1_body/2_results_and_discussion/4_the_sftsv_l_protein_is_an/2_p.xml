<p>Notably, for the sequences of the conserved genome segment termini, particularly the S segment, different sequences have been published. For the S segment these sequences differ in the insertion/deletion of an A at position 9, counted from the 5′ terminus, or a U in the case of the 3′ terminus (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49–51</xref>). The S segment RNA including the A at position 9 (denoted as 9A) resulted in much stronger polymerase activity of the L protein compared to the S-segment promoter lacking the 9A, even though the affinity to the L protein seems to be comparable between the two S segment promoters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6 and S11</xref>). The reduced polymerase activity with the S segment terminus lacking the 9A is consistent with results from Brennan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (2015) reporting that it was only possible to establish a reverse genetics system based on SFTSV S segment if the A at position 9 of the 5′ end as well as a corresponding U at the complementary 3′ end were present (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Even though, we cannot conclude on the role of this 9A residue from our apo-L structure, this should be noted for future studies.
