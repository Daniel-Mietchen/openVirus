<p>To characterize the enzymatic properties of SFTSV L protein, we performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA synthesis based on the assay conditions established for LASV (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) using a highly purified SFTSV L protein (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To avoid RNA degradation during the enzymatic reactions we used an endonuclease active site mutant (D112A) of the L protein. SFTSV L protein produces a ∼35 nt RNA product independent of any primers, which was visualized by autoradiography based on incorporated radiolabelled [α]
 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP after denaturing PAGE (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). An L protein carrying a mutation in the RdRp active site motif C (D1126A), which served as a negative control to demonstrate the specificity of the assay, was inactive. The SFTSV L protein RdRp was only active when both the 3′ template vRNA and the 5′ vRNA were present in the reaction (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The activating role of the 5′ end is well known for influenza polymerase, and has also been described for arenaviruses, although the proposed fold of the arenavirus 5′ hook has yet to be confirmed by a structure (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>).
