<p>Focussing on the C-terminal region of the L protein, in both the cryo-EM map as well as the SAXS envelopes, we observe low-resolution density volume into which it was not possible to build a structural model 
 <italic>de novo</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, indicated empty volume). This volume likely contains the C-terminal region especially missing parts of the thumb ring, bridge and lid. Notably, in the crystal structure of the arenavirus L protein C terminus, the long linker connection of the CBD to the L protein probably enables high mobility of this domain (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The second protrusion of the SAXS envelope, which is less pronounced and not visible in all structures, might correspond to the CBD. However, this remains purely speculative based on the data we have and we therefore did not include the CBD in the model.
