<p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is prevalent in East Asia and closely related to the Heartland virus that has been isolated in the US (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Very recently an SFTSV-like virus has also been detected in bats from Germany (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). SFTSV belongs to the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order, established in 2018 to accommodate formerly separated bunya- and arenaviruses (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Bunyaviruses are a diverse group of viruses with a segmented single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity. They are distributed worldwide causing zoonoses with several outbreaks annually, mainly occurring in Low-to-Middle-Income countries and primarily affecting poor populations with restricted access to health care. Therefore, several bunyaviruses are listed on the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), a global strategy to enhance preparedness to future epidemics urging for the development of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and antivirals, which are largely lacking. To develop antiviral strategies against emerging viruses, including SFTSV and other bunyaviruses a profound understanding of the viral life cycle is essential, especially of the similarities and differences within this virus group. The key player in bunyavirus transcription and genome replication is the large (L) protein with a size between 250 and 450 kDa, which contains multiple domains and functions including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). For influenza virus, another segmented negative-sense RNA virus (sNSV), small molecules targeting different functions of the polymerase complex have been clinically approved (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, in contrast to influenza viruses, whose polymerase has been extensively investigated, structural and functional information about bunyavirus L proteins are scarce.
