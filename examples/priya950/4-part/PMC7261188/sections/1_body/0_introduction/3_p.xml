<p>In order to deepen our understanding of bunyavirus genome replication and transcription, we aimed to structurally and functionally characterize the full-length L protein of a virus of the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family. For this virus family, no high-resolution structural data on the L protein core polymerase domain is currently available. We established expression and purification of the full-length SFTSV L protein in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system with a yield of up to 11 mg/l of expression culture. We present structural data on the RdRp core and adjacent L protein domains of SFTSV bunyavirus (
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family) obtained by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. Although we were unable to build the N-terminal endonuclease domain 
 <italic>de novo</italic>, we could fit the recently published SFTSV endonuclease crystal structure (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) into the cryo-EM density. This allowed us to propose an integrated model for the L protein, which was verified using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. Although the C-terminal region of the L protein was not resolved in the cryo-EM map, we solved the structure of the SFTSV CBD in complex with a cap-analogue by X-ray crystallography with a resolution of 1.35 Ã… and characterized how it interacts with cap-structures using biochemical and biophysical assays. We further used biochemical assays to characterize the different L protein activities, such as promoter binding, endonuclease and polymerase activities. In summary, we provide novel structural and functional information on SFTSV L protein that can serve as a basis for an improved understanding of bunyavirus transcription and genome replication processes and aid drug development.
