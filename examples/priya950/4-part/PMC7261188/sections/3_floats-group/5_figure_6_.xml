  <p>Integrative modelling of SFTSV apo-L protein. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A superposition of the SAXS envelope of cluster 1 (blue mesh), a 5Å low-pass filtered cryo-EM mapA (grey surface) and the structure model (ribbon diagram, colored according to Figure 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is presented in three different orientations. The endonuclease domain, which is sticking out of the SAXS envelope, is marked by a dashed circle. An empty volume is also indicated. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Close-up of the endonuclease domain in the superposition of SAXS envelope and structure model. Potential movement of the endonuclease domain is indicated by an arrow and an alternative conformation depicted as grey ribbon diagram. An asterisk indicates the β-sheet (colored in red), for which a role in protein-protein interactions has been proposed.
