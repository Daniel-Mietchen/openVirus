  <p>Interaction of the SFTSV L protein with its promoter RNAs. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Binding of SFTSV L protein to the 5′ and 3′ promoter ends (20 nt) of the M segment (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Increasing amounts of L protein (0–1.4 μM) were incubated with 0.2 μM of the indicated RNA (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The protein–RNA complex was separated from the free RNA by native PAGE and visualized by phosphor screen autoradiography using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Conserved 3′ (red) and 5′ (blue) terminal sequences of the L, M and S segments. Watson-Crick base pairing is indicated by black lines. Bases which differ between but are conserved within the segments are shown in black. Additional bases at position 9, found in some sequences (5′ S
   <sub>9A</sub>, 3′ S
   <sub>9U</sub>), are marked with a frame. Potential 3′ (
   <bold>C</bold>) and 5′ (
   <bold>D</bold>) promoter RNA binding sites are shown as cartoon representation (left). Domains are colored according to Figure 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Residues potentially involved in protein-RNA interaction are shown as green (C) or orange (D) sticks. See also 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Alignment File</xref>. Right panels display surface electrostatics of the potential 3′ and 5′ RNA binding sites generated by APBS within PyMol. LACV 5′ vRNA is shown as a cartoon within the SFTSV potential 5′ vRNA binding site. For comparison, analogous figures for LACV vRNA binding sites are presented in
