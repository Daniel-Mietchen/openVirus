  <p>In vitro enzymatic activities of the SFTSV L protein. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Size exclusion chromatography and Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified SFTSV L (D112A) protein display the high purity and monodispersity of the L protein. Elution volumes of standard proteins (with sizes of 440 and 158 kDa) for column calibration are indicated. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The SFTSV L protein mediates RNA synthesis in an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerase assay. SFTSV L (D112A) or an RdRp catalytically inactive mutant (D1126A) were incubated with the conserved 5′ or/and 3′ terminal 20 nt of the M segment (5′ M: HO-ACACAGAGACGGCCAACAAU-OH, 3′ M: HO-UGUGUUUCUGGCCGGUUGUG-OH, 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) in the presence of NTPs supplemented with [α]
   <sup>32</sup>P- GTP for 60 min at 30°C. RNA products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The RdRp activity of 500 nM SFTSV L (D112A) protein was analyzed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of MgCl
   <sub>2</sub> or MnCl
   <sub>2</sub>. (
   <bold>D</bold>) 250 nM of wild-type L was incubated with ∼0.3 μM of radioactively labeled PolyA40 RNA substrate (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) in the presence of 5, 10, 25 and 50 μM of the indicated Me(II) at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions without L protein, EDTA or the known endonuclease-specific inhibitor DPBA were used as negative controls. Reaction products were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.
