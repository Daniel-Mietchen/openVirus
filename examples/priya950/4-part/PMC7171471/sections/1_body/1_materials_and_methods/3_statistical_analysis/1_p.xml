<p>Statistical analysis was performed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 21, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Data were expressed as percentages for categorical variables and means ± standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables. The intergroup differences of numerical values were performed by using the Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, and differences between groups were judged for significance using the chi-squared test. For all comparisons, P-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>
