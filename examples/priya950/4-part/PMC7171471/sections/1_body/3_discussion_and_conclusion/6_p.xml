 </sup> However, the frequency of positive results decreased from nasopharyngeal (65%) to throat swab (30%) to sputum (5%) samples. This finding suggests that the molecular influenza tests show different sensitivity depending on the specimen types, being the difference in favor of nasopharyngeal swabs.
