<p>Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and may result in complications, which can lead to substantial morbidity and in some cases to death.

 </sup> Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for clinical patient management and infection control purposes. Due to the presence of effective antivirals against different types of influenza viruses, rapid laboratory diagnosis may result in less antibiotic prescription and more frequent use of those antivirals. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly with the use of multiplex real-time techniques with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. Currently, this new method has been successfully applied to the routine diagnosis and epidemiological detection of respiratory infections including influenza in many centers with reasonable specificity and sensitivity.

 </sup> On the other hand, current diagnostic methods for respiratory illnesses have some deficiencies in Iran. Due to inexpensive and low,cost of antibiotic values across the country, physicians are unwilling about application of new diagnostics tools including molecularbased techniques. This may result in a prolonged stay of patients in hospital as well as in increased morbidity, possibly associated with inappropriate therapy. The aims of this study were to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu types among hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital.
