<p>A stronger female immune response towards CHIKV infection may be associated with a complex symptomatology (fever, dizziness, adynamia, difficulty grasping, retroauricular and submandibular ganglia, general discomfort, nausea, cough, headache, pruritus, myalgias, skin sensitivity, feverish chill, lack of appetite, and diverse sorts of pain) for women compared to men in our study. Epidemiological studies have shown that males are more vulnerable to viral infections as their mortality rate is higher compared to women,[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Although a stronger immune response is clearly an advantage for certain viral infections, with CHIKV infection a potential dissemination of viral particles to lymph nodes, joints and other tissues may lead to aberrant antigenic response that could worsen the symptomatology in women as compared to men.[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] investigated the CHIKV route of infection starting at epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, further disseminating to lymph nodes, joints and other tissues.[
