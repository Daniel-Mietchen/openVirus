<p>Despite our new findings, some limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First, our maximally expanded sample was comprised of 1161 individuals diagnosed with CHIKV infection based on clinical symptomatology. Of note, individuals were recruited during the acute phase of the CHIKV infection. This diagnosis was performed following a clinical protocol developed by the Colombian National Institute of Health based on a similar protocol previously applied to diagnosis of Dengue virus infection (

The chikungunya outbreak occurred in the Colombian Caribbean back in 2014/15, which also impacted the Central/Andean region of the country. This protocol was strictly followed by the epidemiological team of the Health Secretary of Barranquilla to survey all suspected CHIKV cases referred to the surveillance program by health practitioners from the city of Barranquilla. To confirm the feasibility of the clinical protocol, and to detect the presence of CHIKV, we randomly selected 300 (25.9%) of our CHIKV cases and conducted laboratory testing using RT-PCR. Interestingly, we found concordance between the clinical-symptomatology-based CHIKV infection diagnosis and that provided by the laboratory test. All in all, this suggests that, despite not having laboratory tested all individuals in our sample, the clinical diagnosis, when applied responsibly, is a reliable and easy-to-use method of providing accurate diagnosis of CHIKV infection in developing and Latin American countries, where budget and time constraints are increasing, or during outbreak episodes such as the 2014 CHIKV outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region.
