<p>Sex dimorphic immune response towards viral infection is commonly described in the literature.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] For example, it is well known that women respond with production of higher levels of Interferon alpha (INFα) in response to viral pathogens.[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Furthermore, sex dimorphic immune response to viral infections has shown higher intensity (i.e. viral load within an individual) and prevalence (i.e. number of infected individuals within a population) in males, while females can have a more favorable disease outcome.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Females have a stronger immune response relative to males, which can result in faster viral clearance. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that cells from females can exhibit a 10‐fold greater level of expression than cells from males.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] However, this may also contribute to the development of autoimmunological disorders in females, such as, systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.[
