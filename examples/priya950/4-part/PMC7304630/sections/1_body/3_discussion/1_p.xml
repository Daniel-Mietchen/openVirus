<p>The overarching hypothesis tested by this study (i.e., the existence of significantly different latent classes of symptoms, clustering individuals infected by CHIKV during the highest outbreak in Barranquilla) was not rejected. Indeed, we found seven different symptom profiles clustering groups of individuals with distinguishable phenotypic response. Thus, this could potentially be used for defining extreme and intermediate phenotypes of CHIKV infection. Furthermore, the fact that

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008281.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), highlights the importance of gender-specific and phenotypic-response-specific treatments focused on the at-risk female CHIKV population, and subpopulations with a more extreme phenotypic spectrum (i.e., clusters 1 and 7; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008281.g003">Fig 3</xref>), instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] A more refined characterization of CHIKV patient sub-populations (LCCA-derived clusters) may be advantageous for the implementation of specific diagnosis protocols and treatments, which could allow health providers to implement more personalized and cost-effective care for CHIKV patients, depending on their phenotypic response to the infection.
