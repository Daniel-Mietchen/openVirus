<p>In this study, we comprehensively analyzed clinical data from 1160 individuals from the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, Colombia, located on the northern Caribbean coast. Patients were diagnosed with CHIKV infection to evaluate the presence of group of individuals clustering similar and unique phenotypes (latent classes), predictors of infection susceptibility, and differential phenotypic response, i.e., a set of specific symptoms that an individual generates in response to CHIKV infection. We found strong evidence for the existence of different mutually exclusive profiles of phenotypic response in this population, and that females infected with CHIKV exhibited significant and heterogeneous differential symptomatology patterns when compared to men. For the first time, these results offer information about the characteristics of at-risk populations affected by CHIKV infection and the presence of different subpopulations of phenotypic response. Although future studies are needed to better understand the contribution of demographic, immunological and genetic factors to this differential phenotypic response, especially in this understudied population, our findings could be used as a starting point for the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations, in order to provide more accurate and differential diagnosis and treatment.</p>
