Of the 1061 patients, 282 (24.3%) were assigned to Cluster 1, 256 (22.1%) to Cluster 2, 205 (17.7%) to Cluster 3, 128 (11%) to Cluster 4, 118 (10.2%) to Cluster 5, 97 (8.4%) to Cluster 6 and 74 (6.4%) to Cluster 7. Analysis showed that the number of symptoms is statistically significantly different across clusters (
