<p>Based on the clinical symptoms, we derived clinical profiles using Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] as implemented in Latent GOLD 4.0 (Statistical Innovations, Belmont, MA, USA). Symptoms were registered using a binary-based system assessing the presence or absence of 26 clinical symptoms in all patients of our cohort (0: absence; 1: presence), which were further used as indicators in all LCCA models tested. Models considering 1 to 10 clusters of individuals were explored including demographic information, such as sex and age, as covariates. In order to assess the certainty of our clusters,

 <sup>2</sup> statistics, by using a parametric bootstrap (500 replicates) rather than relying on asymptotic

To avoid local solutions, which result from the use of maximum likelihood methods where a maximum is found that is not the true maximum of the entire sample space, a procedure automatically implemented in Latent GOLD was used.
