<p>Measures of central tendency and dispersion were estimated for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. Continuous variables among groups (gender) were compared using a two-sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test when the normality assumption was met and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney non-parametric test otherwise. The normality assumption was contrasted using the Shapiro-Wilks test. Frequencies and frequency distributions of categorical variables (i.e., gender and age group) among groups (i.e., gender) were compared using a Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> test with continuity correction when the expected frequency of cells in the 2x2 contingency table was less than five. Logistic regression was used to correct for age when comparing these frequency distributions. Unless otherwise stated, statistical analyses and plotting were performed in R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
