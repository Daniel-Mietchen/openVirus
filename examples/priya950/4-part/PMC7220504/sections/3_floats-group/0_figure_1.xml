  <p>Isolation practice during MERS-CoV outbreak in HD units. From 126 HD patients who were exposed, 10 were excluded from the analysis due to following reasons: transfer to another hospital (n = 9) and change of dialysis modality (n = 1). Therefore, a total of 116 patients were included in the analysis: n = 54, single room isolation; n = 46, cohort isolation; and n = 16, self-imposed quarantine. HD = hemodialysis, MERS-CoV = middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus.</p>
