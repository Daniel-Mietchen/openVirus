<p>To evaluate the effect of isolation on clinical and biochemical parameters, we collected data from 3 months prior to isolation to 6 months after the isolation period. Data were compared using the average values of each parameter during the pre-isolation (3 months before isolation), isolation (3 months from isolation), and post-isolation (3–6 months after isolation) periods. GEE showed changes in plasma Hb, serum calcium, and serum albumin levels and single-pool Kt/V over time, and the results were not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). All these markers increased after the isolation period (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). After comparing the trend of the clinical and biochemical markers among patients who were subjected to different isolation strategies, the patients under self-imposed quarantine were found to have higher systolic and diastolic BP, lower total cholesterol level, and lower Kt/V than those under single-room and cohort isolation.
