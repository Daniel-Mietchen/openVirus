 <italic>U</italic> test and Kruskal–Wallis test were used for nonparametric analysis. Chi-square test was used for the analysis of categorical data. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to analyze time-dependent change in clinical and biochemical data from the pre- to post-isolation period. Patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. A
