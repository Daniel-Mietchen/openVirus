<p>Each hospital had different isolation strategies for exposed patients, which include single room isolation, cohort isolation, or self-imposed quarantine (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Single room isolation involves isolating each patient in a single, negative pressure room while on HD treatment using separate portable reverse osmosis. Cohort isolation is a method involving hospital quarantine while on HD treatment in a shared HD room. Conversely, a self-imposed quarantine is a method for asymptomatic contacts who stay at home with active surveillance of possible symptoms while receiving HD treatment in a shared HD room on the day of treatment (Fig.
