<p>In Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, 83 HD patients were suspected to be exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. As 1 patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection was on maintenance HD treatment, the hospital decided to hospitalize all 83 HD patients until the possibility of additional MERS-CoV infection was ruled out. The 47 close contacts who received HD treatment on the same day as the patient with confirmed infection underwent single-room isolation, whereas the other 26 casual contacts who received HD treatment at a different time were subjected to cohort isolation. In Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, 9 HD patients were exposed to the MERS-CoV index case at the radiologic department outside the HD unit. The hospital chose to perform self-imposed quarantine for 6 asymptomatic contacts, and 3 febrile patients were subjected to single-room isolation. In Gangneung Medical Center, 34 patients on maintenance HD treatment were suspected to be directly or indirectly exposed to the head nurse of the HD unit with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Among them, 4 symptomatic contacts underwent single room isolation, and 20 asymptomatic close contacts had cohort isolation. The other 10 asymptomatic casual contacts were subjected to self-imposed quarantine and were monitored for possible symptoms.</p>
