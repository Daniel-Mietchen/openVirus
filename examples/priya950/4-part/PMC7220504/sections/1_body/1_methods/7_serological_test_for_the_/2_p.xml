<p>Approximately 3–5 mL of whole blood was drawn from each patient at 16 weeks after exposure to evaluate secondary transmission based on reactivity against the MERS-CoV S1 antigen using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was supported by reactivity with recombinant S-protein immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay (ppNT).

 </sup> Briefly, whole blood was centrifuged at 1500 g at room temperature for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. The plasma samples were stored at −80°C and were used for ELISA, IFA, and ppNT after 12–16 months.
