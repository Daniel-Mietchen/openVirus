<p>This prospective, multicenter study first evaluated the efficacy of isolation practice on clinical outcomes and patient survival. The isolation practice was effective in preventing further transmission of disease among HD patients. Although the isolation methods were adopted based on the risk of exposure and available resources, the specific isolation methods (single room isolation vs cohort isolation vs self-imposed quarantine) did not affect the MERS-CoV transmission rate. All techniques were similar in terms of efficacy in preventing secondary transmission of respiratory disease. In addition, no difference was observed in patient survival rate according to the different types of isolation.</p>
