<p>Twelve patients died during the 24-month follow-up period, but no difference was observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies. Thus, we cannot assure that mortality was not correlated to isolation practice itself. However, it was more likely to be associated with underlying comorbidities, old age, and long average duration of dialysis rather than isolation practice itself. The patient survival rate did not significantly differ according to specific isolation methods.</p>
