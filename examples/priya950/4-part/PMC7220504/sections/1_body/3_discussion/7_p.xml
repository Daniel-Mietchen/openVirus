<p>The patients had stable BP and single-pool Kt/V during the isolation period. However, these parameters increased thereafter. The level of biochemical markers, including plasma Hb, serum calcium, and serum albumin, were maintained during isolation and improved after the isolation period. The efficiency of dialysis measured using Kt/V improved after the isolation period. The biochemical or clinical marker levels did not decrease during the isolation period. Meanwhile, the single-room isolation and cohort isolation methods were superior to self-imposed quarantine in terms of maintaining normal BP, good nutrition, and dialysis efficiency. This result may be partly explained by the compliance factor in which patients on self-imposed quarantine might not had followed the advice of doctors to have low-salt diet and restricted calorie intake.</p>
