<p>To confirm MERS-CoV infection, we performed several serological assays, including ELISA, IFA, and ppNT. Four suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified using ELISA against the MERS S1 particle. However, based on the combined results of IFA and ppNT, 3 suspected cases were found to have false-positive results. Our findings were similar to those of a previous study conducted by Park et al.

 </sup> The study compared the serological assays in human MERS-CoV infection, including plaque reduction neutralization tests, micro-neutralization, ppNT, and ELISA, and found a significant correlation between the PRNT and ppNT titers. MERS-CoV S1 ELISA was less strongly correlated to different neutralization assays.

 </sup> Therefore, the ppNT assay can provide reliable results for the diagnosis of MERs-CoV infection and seroepidemiology in the future.
