<p>Given the importance of CHIKV as emerging disease threat, efforts should be devoted to developing suitable procedures for early detection of virus circulation in the population, possibly through analysis of medical records in near real time. The most frequent symptoms of CHIKV fever and joint pain are often associated with other common diseases and go unnoticed. Increasing the awareness of CHIKV of GPs and public health officials through tailored education may be effective, especially in small coastal towns where the outbreak risk is higher. A key element is also the shift of citizen awareness from considering

Finally, the reasons why diseases such as CHIKV and dengue are causing sporadic but repeated epidemic events in temperate climate areas should be further investigated.
