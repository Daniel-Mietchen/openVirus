<p>Despite the public health relevance of such outbreaks, only a few mathematical models have been applied to characterize CHIKV transmission dynamics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For the 2007 outbreak, the available estimates of the basic reproductive number (R

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The differences in R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates are primarily due to different modeling methodologies and parameters (e.g., vector susceptibility and/or longevity). Only one study estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> for the 2017 outbreak, resulting in the range 1.5–2.6 with mean value 2 [
