<p>The 2007 outbreak was caused by a newly emerged Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) variant characterized by an amino acid (aa) shift (A→V) at the 226 position of the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1. This E1–A226V mutation was appeared independently multiple times, including the 2005–2006 Indian Ocean CHIKV outbreak and improved replication and transmission efficiency of CHIKV in the
