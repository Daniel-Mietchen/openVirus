<p>Little is known about the immune mediator profile of CHIKV-infected patients during the Italian 2007 and 2017 outbreaks and whether the immunological signature has changed according to the IOL variant with or without the E1–A226V mutation. The potential contribution of cytokines to disease has been reported in both the 2007 and 2017 outbreaks. Specifically, in the 2007 outbreak, the severity of CHIKV disease was associated with increased levels of Chemokines ligand 9 ((CXCL9/ Monokine induced by gamma interferon MIG), CXCL10/IP-10, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) [

At the same time, a remarkable abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines—interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, and interleukin (IL)-6—was found in a unique lethal CHIKV case during the 2017 outbreak, which involved an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease [

All these findings underline the key role played by cytokines in controlling viral replication and pathogenesis during the early stages of CHIKV infection, suggesting that well-balanced immune responses are crucial for early containment of CHIKV infections. However, beside the multiple host factors involved in the activation of immune response to viral infection, CHIKV has developed mechanisms to evade early cellular immunity by, e.g., circumventing the antiviral activity of type I IFNs [

Interestingly, the CHIKV IOL strain with the A226V mutation obtained from patients during the epidemic of 2007 in Italy were more sensitive to type I IFNs compared to the viral strains without A226V, suggesting that level of resistance of the CHIKV to the antiviral action of IFN could actually be virus-strain dependent [
