 <italic>Ovitrap management</italic> - A modified model of a previously described ovitrap
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> was used for sampling 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs. These s-ovt were designed to remain safe and functional in the field for collecting eggs for a 30-day period.

 </xref> Ovitraps were set outdoor, one meter above the soil, in places protected from sun exposure and rainfall. They consist of a black plastic cups filled with water (1.5 L) and two wooden paddles (5 x 15 cm), used as oviposition substrates, vertically fixed to the inner wall of the cup. All s-ovts used to monitoring eggs density were treated with a commercial Bti-based larvicide (VectoBac
 <sup>®</sup> WG, 6 drops/trap or ~4.8 mg/L), to prevent larvae development, and protect the ovitraps to become a breeding site, since they were set for a 30-day period. The s-ovt were set in January 2013 and kept continuously for 12 months. Monthly, the s-ovt were inspected to replace water, add Bti and news paddles, as performed in T1.

 </xref> Labelled paddles collected every month from the s-ovt were transferred to the laboratory and air-dried at room temperature (26ºC). The egg number was recorded under stereoscopic microscope based on all eggs from the paddle, including hatched and non-hatched ones.
