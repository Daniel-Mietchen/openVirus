<p>The total number of eggs collected per year in each sampling station, when comparing T1 and T2, showed that a decrease in T2, which occurred in most houses monitored (79.7%). In a few stations, no quantitative change occurred, while in 20% of s-ovts, higher egg counts relative to T1 were recorded [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). KDE maps based on eggs laid on s-ovt showed a heterogeneous spatial distribution over the urban space in T1 as well as in T2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) but a similar distribution of some hotspots was found whose densities were higher in T1. A comparison of the results across time using KDE maps produced with the same scale for all cycles enables a prompt visual identification of critical periods and areas from month to month, and this can be a valuable tool to establish priority levels for implementing vector control actions. This analysis reveals hotspots with a higher density in T1 throughout the year compared with T2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A), in particular, between the 5th (May) and 8th (August) cycles, as previously shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. When these KDE maps are presented in self-scale, which is based on the absolute egg counting from each cycle, areas with a higher egg density are enhanced, in particular in those cycles whose egg density is low (
