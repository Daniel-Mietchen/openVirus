 <italic>Infestation by Aedes spp</italic> - In order to evaluate the density and spread of 
 <italic>Aede</italic>s in the study area, a network of 59 s-ovt installed in the same sampling stations during two 12-month cycles corresponding to the years 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2) was set. The goal of this network of s-ovt was to record egg density for surveillance purpose only, and the same set of 59 s-ovt were used to obtain data from both years analysed. This study did not perform control interventions, and only PNCD actions were carried out by the Health Services in that area, as preconised for all Brazilian municipalities.

 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). The total egg number collected by all 59 s-ovt per month in T1 varied from 8282 to 44,170, while in T2 this ranged from 6792 to 18,174 (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). The high infestation pattern found during both periods was characterised by the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> egg-laying females in all of the sampling stations throughout the year, since the monthly ovitrap positivity index (OPI) varied from 94.3% to 100% (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). In terms of eggs abundance, each s-ovt collected from 349 to 20,164 eggs in T1, and during T2 each s-ovt recorded between 178 and 5572 eggs, which also corroborate the sustained infestation over the area [
