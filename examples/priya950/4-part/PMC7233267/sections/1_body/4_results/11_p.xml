<p>The distribution of species considering all egg samples collected in the s-ovt assessed during T1 and T2, shows the simultaneous presence of both species in 65,1% of the traps and the exclusive presence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in 22% and 13,2%, respectively, indicating that these mosquitoes frequently cohabitate the environment in this area and can use the same oviposition sites [

 <bold>(Table II)]</bold>. The spread of the two species in SÃ­tio dos Pintos in T2 showed that some s-ovt detected a relative higher abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> that were found in houses near areas covered with vegetation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), although fews s-ovt found in such areas showed a higher abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The results also showed that the mean number of eggs in those stations where 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was predominant is much higher than in those where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was found to be the major species [

 <bold>(Table II)</bold>]. The spatial distribution of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species found in T2 was not compared to those found in T1, as the number of s-ovt used for this purpose in T1 was more limited 15 s-ovt versus 59 s-ovt in T2 and could not provide a comparable dataset.
