<p>Another important aspect to raise is that the permanent and high level of infestation of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> in such territories, as Sítio dos Pintos, was detected over almost a decade of systematic municipal control programme actions in the scope of the PNCD. This program preconises six cycles of larvicide application per year, in addition to mechanical actions to eliminate breeding sites in the households.

 </xref> Although the total number of eggs recorded in Sítio dos Pintos in T2 was lower compared to T1, it is not possible to conclude if this was only a consequence of the PNCD actions and/or from other factors as, for instance, natural fluctuations of population density that could occur throughout the years. Longitudinal entomological studies could clarify the amplitude of such variations throughout the years, however, those are not available for this study area.
