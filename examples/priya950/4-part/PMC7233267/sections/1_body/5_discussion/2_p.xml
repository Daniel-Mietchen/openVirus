 </xref> Sítio dos Pintos, in particular, showed a geographical infestation pattern that showed only discrete alterations in both assessments conducted in T1 and T2, as seem by the data collected by the same ovitrap network used to investigate those periods. Longitudinal studies using this ovitrap network, named “Sistema de Monitoramento e Controle Populacional de 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>” (SMCP-
 <italic>Aedes</italic>), in other municipalities from Brazil also showed a pattern of permanence of spatial occupation by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations. This pattern was found at urban sites with mosquito populations of contrasting densities such as in Fernando de Noronha Island a low density site
