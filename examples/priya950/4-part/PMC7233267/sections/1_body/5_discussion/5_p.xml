<p>In this study the monitoring system based in the s-ovt network characterised the occupation pattern of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> due to its sensibility to detect active females in the areas and to provide a quantitative dataset of eggs sampling, and corroborates previous studies carried in endemic areas from Brazil.

 </xref> Dataset from our study demonstrated that the House index (HI), the indicator used by the PNCD, did not reflect the infestation of SÃ­tio dos Pintos by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> in 2005 or in 2013, as the HI was &lt; 1 (http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br. Retrieved 07-05-2019), while the OPI shown by our study was close to 100%. This monitoring method based on the visual identification of larvae/pupae has been used for three decades in Brazil, although its lack of efficacy has been shown by studies carried out in other cities.

 </xref> In addition, these previous studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of a modified ovitrap network for controlling 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population density in urban areas, targeting the mass egg removal by ovitraps, as described for the control program established in SCC city.

 </xref> Our study showed that the network of s-ovt associated to the KDE maps, for instance, are strategic and simple methods to identify hot spots of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> density that can be used to follow the spatial-temporal patterns of density in areas, and establish priorities for control actions. It is important that the output of data analysis should be readily readable and understood by health staff at all levels, as suggested by previous studies.
