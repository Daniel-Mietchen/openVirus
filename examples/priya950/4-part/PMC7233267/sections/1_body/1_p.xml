<p>Dengue was reintroduced in Brazil in 1981-1982 and was associated to serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-4.

 </xref> A wide-ranging National Program for Dengue Control (PNCD) was established in 1996 and currently operates in more than 5,000 Brazilian municipalities.

 </xref> The PNCD actions for monitoring and controlling the vector are based on the estimated number of infested houses using a visual search for larvae-pupae in household breeding grounds, bimonthly applications of larvicides throughout the year in water containers, campaigns to eliminate larval breeding sources and sporadic focal adulticide spraying in cases of active viral transmission.

 </xref> Within the last decades, the country experienced four major epidemics, associated with the predominant viral serotype DENV-1, DENV-3, DENV-2, and DENV-4 in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2010, respectively.

 </xref> In the past years, dengue epidemics have been caused by the circulation of more than one serotype. In 2015, states from the northeast of Brazil reported the first outbreaks of ZIKV and CHIKV infections.

 </xref> One of the major challenges for the surveillance and control of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species in the scope of PNCD is the limitation of the index employed to perform the surveillance of this species in urban areas.

 </xref> Those are based on the percentage of houses infested with larvae and/or pupae (House index) and the number of containers/reservoirs found positive for them per a set of 100 houses inspected (Breteau index).
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>10</sup>
 </xref> However, these metrics have shown low levels of infestation or even negative results in areas where 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is present in 60% to 90% of the surveyed houses.
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref> A more sensitive method for the large-scale sampling of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species must be adopted to evaluate the abundance and impact of vector control strategies.
