 <italic>Misperceptions about when to get influenza vaccine</italic>. Many participants reported that the vaccine was not intended for regular or periodic use. Some believe that the vaccine is only of value for use before or during epidemic-level events: 
 <italic>“The SARS or H1N1</italic>, 
 <italic>once they come</italic>, 
 <italic>cannot stop because Singapore is a tourist [hub]</italic>. 
 <italic>It’s a good prevention”</italic> (Male, interview 38). Another woman echoed this sentiment saying, “
 <italic>I don’t want any [vaccines]… unless there is an urgent need</italic>. 
 <italic>Maybe it’s a major influenza crisis</italic>” (Female, interview 34). Others noted that the vaccine is only intended for use as a treatment once an individual has influenza symptoms: “
 <italic>The vaccine prevents the influenza from getting worse</italic>, 
 <italic>and for the flu to relapse</italic>” (Male, interview 12). Participants also confused the purpose of vaccines with antiviral drugs that are used for treating influenza infections rather than as a preventive measure: “
 <italic>Vaccines kill the virus</italic>” (Male, interview 13). Antiviral drugs serve to lessen disease severity and reduce the probability of complications when taken in the first two days of infection; therefore, antiviral drugs do not have the same function and cannot be substitutes for vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [
