 <italic>Misperceptions about influenza vaccine characteristics</italic>. The function of the influenza vaccine was largely unfamiliar among participants. The influenza vaccine was commonly misperceived as a travel vaccine only intended for people leaving the country for places with lower hygiene standards: 
 <italic>“For me I only go [overseas] for holidays</italic>. 
 <italic>Most of the time</italic>, 
 <italic>like third-world countries then I go for jab</italic>. 
 <italic>Other than that</italic>, 
 <italic>I don’t go for jab”</italic> (Male, interview 1). Hygienic standards, sexually transmitted diseases, and even homosexuality were referenced as reasons to be vaccinated against influenza, with one participant noting that “
 <italic>Because other countries have many gays [travelers should get the vaccine]</italic>” (Male, interview 65) to protect themselves from potential infection. This stigmatizing sentiment was also coupled with perceptions that such cases do not occur in Singapore as “
 <italic>Singapore not so much</italic>” (Male, interview 65). Another participant reported that the influenza vaccine “
 <italic>protects against everything</italic>” (Male, interview 23). This implies confusion about the function of the influenza vaccine and perhaps vaccines in general—that vaccines are a universal preventive measure rather than targeted at specific diseases.
