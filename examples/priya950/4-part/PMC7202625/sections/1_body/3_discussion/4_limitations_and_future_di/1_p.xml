<p>This study has three limitations that must be acknowledged. First, even though the use of novice interviewers and executive summaries may have been an outcome of limited study resources, our data analysis relied on interviewers’ extensive training, executive summaries and audio playbacks rather than full interview transcripts. This approach introduced the issue of subjective data selection and filtering through interviewers and hence the interpretation of incomplete or reduced qualitative data. Second, the use of nonprobability sampling techniques in recruiting participants limits the generalizability of our qualitative findings. Future replications using stratified sampling techniques are warranted to validate the findings from this present study. Last, language differences are inherent in this study that is conducted in polylingual Singapore where most older adults speak more often in their native language than in English. Despite our interviewers’ language proficiency, interpreting and translating any Mandarin Chinese into English nonetheless pose challenges to the validity of our study findings.</p>
