<p>We assessed seasonal characteristics of the temporal distribution of cases using a seasonal trend decomposition procedure in SPSS software. The procedure is based on the Census Method I, otherwise known as the ratio-to-moving-average method where time series data are separated into a seasonal component, a combined trend and cycle component, and an "error" or irregular component [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The seasonal component is then isolated from the overall and irregular trends through a multiplicative model. Seasonal decomposition analysis was applied to monthly dengue case numbers across the 7-year period to examine the seasonal trends of case notifications across Sabah.
