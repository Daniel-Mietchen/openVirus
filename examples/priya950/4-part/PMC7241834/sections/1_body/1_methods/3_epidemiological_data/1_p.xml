<p>State-wide data from monthly notified cases of dengue between the years 2010 and 2016 were obtained from the Sabah State Department of Health (Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri, Sabah), Malaysian Ministry of Health. The data were collected as part of routine public health monitoring of dengue case reports from health facilities in Sabah. Prior to 2010, these data were not available in disaggregated and electronic format. Within the data set made available for this study, epidemiological variables included the age and gender of each case, the district and locality (urban or rural) of each case residence, disease severity and outcome (survival or death), and diagnostic tests performed (IgG, IgM and/or NS1). In our dataset, locality status was available for the 6-year period from 2011–2016. Locality of case residence represented the smallest residential geographical unit used by the Malaysian Department of Statistics, and was allocated based on home address. Designation of locality status (urban or rural) was according to the Malaysian Department of Statistics definition
 <strike>s</strike> of urban and rural, where urban localities are gazetted census areas with 10,000 people or more, and ≥60% of the working population (≥15 years) engaged in non-agricultural activities [

Population and demographic data for Sabah districts were obtained from the Malaysian Department of Statistics for the year 2010. Estimated population numbers for each age, gender and district were then calculated for each subsequent year using published annual population growth rates [
