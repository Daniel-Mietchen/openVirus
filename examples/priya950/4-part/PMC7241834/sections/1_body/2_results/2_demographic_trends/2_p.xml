<p>For both genders, nearly half of the case burden (47%) was borne by those aged between 10 and 29 years (mean annual incidence of 24 cases/100,000), followed by 30–49 years (26% of total cases, and 13 cases/100,000). The median age of all notifications was 25. After standardising for age and gender, incidence rates were found to be significantly different between age groups (Kruskal-Wallis H = 9.046, p = 0.029), with pairwise comparisons identifying a significant difference between the 0–9 and 10–29 groups only (Mann-Whitney U = 5.0, p = 0.011). The lowest proportion of notifications occurred below 10 years of age (mean annual rate of 6 cases/100,000), followed by those ≥50 years of age (8 cases/100,000). The incidence trends for gender and age groups remained consistent both before and after the 2014 case definition change.</p>
