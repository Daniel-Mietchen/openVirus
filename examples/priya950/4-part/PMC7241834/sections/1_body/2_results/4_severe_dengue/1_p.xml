<p>Of all dengue cases reported over the 7 years, 1.1% were severe (haemorrhagic) dengue cases. Severe cases were reported across all years, with an average of 18 severe cases/year across the state. The greatest proportion of severe cases were concentrated in Sandakan (24%) and Tawau (20%) districts on the eastern side of the state, and this was consistent across all years. The highest severe dengue incidence occurred in Kunak, Sandakan and Tongod, while the lowest was observed in the western districts, several of which recorded zero severe cases despite recording high overall dengue incidence (Figs

Severe dengue occurred in expected proportions relative to population size of both genders and age groups, with the highest burden (35%) reported in the 10â€“19 years age group. There were 9 severe dengue deaths during the study period, 4 of which were in Tawau district.
