<p>Dengue is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease in the world, and the most prevalent arboviral disease of humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Now endemic in more than 100 countries, the disease causes an enormous burden on communities and health care systems in tropical and sub-tropical regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The causative agent of dengue is dengue virus (DENV), transmitted between humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes across a range of domestic and sylvatic environments. Urban expansion, human migration, travel and trade have facilitated an increasing number of infections, primarily in Asia, Africa and North and South America [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Americas and Asia have been identified as high risk zones due to the presence of dense populations of humans and vectors and climate suitability, with Asia in particular having a disproportionate burden (up to 70%) of global infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The number, severity and geographic distribution of dengue epidemics has increased in South East Asia since the 1950s, when the first cases of the severe (haemorrhagic) form of dengue were identified during epidemics in Thailand and the Philippines [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Outbreaks continued throughout South East Asia during the 1960s, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, with Malaysiaâ€™s first severe dengue outbreak recorded in Penang in 1962 (61 cases and 5 deaths reported) [
