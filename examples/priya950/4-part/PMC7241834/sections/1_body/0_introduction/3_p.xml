<p>As with many South East Asian countries, the drivers of dengue disease in Malaysia are multi-faceted, and encompass characteristics of, and interactions between, virus, vectors, hosts and their environments. These include viral virulence and human biological factors; climate factors, including high temperature, relative humidity and increased rainfall; human movement and behaviour; and economic and infrastructure development [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These may alter human susceptibility to infection, promote mosquito breeding and/or increase interactions of viruses, vectors and hosts. The Malaysian Ministry of Health has reported inappropriate waste disposal to be a major dengue prevention challenge, with polystyrene food containers, plastic bottles and tyres contributing the highest percentage of artificial mosquito breeding sites [
