<p>The use of house index (HI, percentage of houses positive for mosquito larvae) for entomological surveillance is not a good correlate of dengue infection risk, but it remains one of the most widely used entomological indices of operational programs. Larval surveys are, however, appropriate to survey for the presence/absence of potential vectors. In this study, the HIs for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Sabah indicate that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is extremely common around dengue case houses, often in the apparent absence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. It remains possible that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was simply more cryptic than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and that, despite its apparent absence, it was the key vector. Nonetheless, the relative roles of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as vectors in Sabah are important to define through further vector incrimination studies.
