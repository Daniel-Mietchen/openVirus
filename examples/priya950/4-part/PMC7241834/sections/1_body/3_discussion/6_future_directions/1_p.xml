<p>Our study describes spatial, temporal, demographic and vector-related characteristics of dengue disease patterns in Sabah state. To further explain some of the trends observed, finer-scale collection of demographic data, and additional field investigations are necessary. In particular, surveys of socioeconomic variables associated with dengue, including human movement in urban and rural landscapes, would aid identification of high-risk groups. Further investigations and monitoring of the spatial and temporal movement of virus serotypes and vectors could also inform prevention strategies. Ultimately, linking both vector and serological surveillance to the dengue case notification system would enhance existing public health efforts. Considering the ongoing expansion of dengue endemicity and burden in the region, proactive strategies to increase understanding of the complex and evolving epidemiological factors underlying dengue risk across varied environments are critical.</p>
