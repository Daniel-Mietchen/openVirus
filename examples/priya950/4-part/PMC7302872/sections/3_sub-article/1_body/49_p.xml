<p>Reviewer #1: The study is largely based on over-expression experiments in 293T cells and a clear correlation between the protein amount of the three PB1-F2s and the respective phenotype investigated is obvious (e.g. Fig 6C and g, 7A/B). Interestingly, somewhat similar expression was achieved in Fig. 8C.</p>
