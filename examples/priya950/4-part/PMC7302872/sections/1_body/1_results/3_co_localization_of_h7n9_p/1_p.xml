<p>PB1-F2 is known to localize to mitochondria where it dissipates ΔΨm. However, PB1-F2 of A/PR8/1934/H1N1 (PR8) strain with 87 amino acid residues was extensively used for this type of studies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Some analysis was also performed with PB1-F2 proteins from other strains including H5N1 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To clarify whether this property of PB1-F2 has subtype or strain specificity, confocal staining was performed to test for mitochondrial localization and ΔΨm-dissipating activity of PB1-F2 proteins of PR8, WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. A cation dye specific for mitochondria named Mitotracker Red CMXRos was used for costaining. Notably, the fluorescent intensity of this dye is proportional to ΔΨm [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A significant reduction of MitoTracker staining was only observed when PR8 PB1-F2 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Mitotracker staining remained unchanged in cells expressing PB1-F2 of any of the other three strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To confirm this result, JC-1 dye, which can distinguish polarized mitochondria by a high red-to-green emission ratio [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], was used to measure ΔΨm of PB1-F2-expressing cells. We found that the red-to-green ratio of JC-1 was reduced only when cells were treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, or when PR8 PB1-F2 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, bars 2 and 3 vs 1). Expression of PB1-F2 from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 did not affect JC-1 dye staining. In addition, we observed that H7N9 PB1-F2 was concentrated to mitochondrial clusters as indicated by arrows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These clusters are likely derived from mitochondrial fission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Co-localization of H7N9 PB1-F2 and mitochondrial clusters were further confirmed by Z-stack imaging at various focal planes through Z-axis spaced by 0.7 μm (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The mitochondrial clustering pattern was less prominent upon expression of H5N1 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). On the contrary, the staining of PR8 PB1-F2 and WSN PB1-F2 was diffusive or punctate in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Quantitatively, mitochondrial clusters colocalized with PB1-F2 were seen in about 40% of H7N9 PB1-F2-expressing cells and 5% for H5N1 PB1-F2-expressing cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). They were observed in only 0.9% of PR8 PB1-F2-expressing cells and were absent in cells expressing WSN PB1-F2 or receiving vector control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Another mitochondrial marker cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) was also found to co-localize with H7N9 PB1-F2 showing mitochondrial clustering pattern in about 30% of expressing cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, H7N9 PB1-F2, and H5N1 PB1-F2 to a lesser extent, did not decrease ΔΨm but colocalized with mitochondrial clusters.
