<p>Confocal microscopy was next performed as previously described to visualize PB1-F2 and MAVS aggregation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Aggregated MAVS presented as intense fluorescent foci or structures was seen to colocalize with fused mitochondria in HEK293T cells overexpressing MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, panels 1–5). Consistent with results from co-immunoprecipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), non-aggregating WSN PB1-F2 was found to colocalize with MAVS aggregates and fused mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, panels 6–10). However, minimal co-localization between aggregation-competent H7N9 PB1-F2 and MAVS was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, panels 11–15). Indeed, H7N9 PB1-F2 still localized to mitochondrial clusters as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, but much less MAVS aggregates were seen and MAVS was found to distribute more evenly on fissioned or fragmented mitochondria, which were rarely observed in the vector control and the WSN PB1-F2 groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, panels 11–15 vs 1–5 and 6–10). Notably, H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregates were seen in the vicinity of MAVS staining, which substantially overlapped with that of Mitotracker (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, panels 11–15). Quantitatively, by counting cells co-expressing MAVS and PB1-F2, about 60% of cells in the vector control and WSN PB1-F2 groups were found to harbor aggregated MAVS. This percentage dropped to around 25% in H7N9 PB1-F2-expressing cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, right chart). That is to say, expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 effectively suppressed MAVS aggregation.
