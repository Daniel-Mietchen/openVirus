<p>Protein aggregation has an inhibitory effect on proteasomal degradation [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, MAVS localized to fissioned mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) might also be prone to mitophagic or lysosomal degradation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of MAVS is strictly controlled by polyubiquitination. Extensive K48- and K27-polyubiquitination of MAVS facilitates its proteasomal [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and lysosomal [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] degradation, respectively. K63-polyubiquitination, however, is important for MAVS aggregation and consequent activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. To determine how H7N9 PB1-F2 triggers MAVS degradation, ubiquitination assay was performed. General ubiquitination of MAVS was only reduced slightly when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, lane 4 vs 2). By using ubiquitin K48, K63 and K27 mutants, it was found that K48- and K27-polyubiquitination of MAVS was largely unaffected by H7N9 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, lanes 3 vs 2, and lane 9 vs 8). However, K63-polyubiqutination of MAVS was severely impaired in the presence of H7N9 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, lane 6 vs 5). Unlike H7N9 PB1-F2, WSN PB1-F2, which minimally affected MAVS aggregation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7</xref>), did not mitigate K48-, K63- or K27 polyubiquitination of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, lane 3 vs 2, lane 7 vs 6, and lane 11 vs 10). Thus, H7N9 PB1-F2 prevented K63-polyubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS, but directed it for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation.
