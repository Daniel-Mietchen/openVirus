<p>To monitor if PB1-F2 has an impact on type I IFN response during influenza A virus infection, recombinant viruses H7-2 wild type (WT) and H7-2 ΔF were made. These reassortant viruses contain all segments of H7N9 except that the segments expressing HA and NA are from WSN. They can therefore be handled in the regular Biosafety Level 2 facility. Whereas PB1- and PB1-F2-coding regions were intact in H7-2 WT, PB1-F2-coding sequence in H7-2 ΔF was completely disrupted by mutating start codon and inserting two premature stop codons without changing PB1-coding sequence (

IFNβ mRNA expression was less robust in THP-1 cells infected with H7-2 WT than in cells infected with H7-2ΔF at 12 and 24 hours-post-infection (hpi; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Levels of viral transcripts (represented by those of segments 4 and 6) and proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs (represented by that of TNFα) were not significantly different between cells infected with H7-2 WT and H7-2 ΔF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that H7N9 PB1-F2 specifically suppressed the production of type I IFNs but not proinflammatory cytokines. The replication of H7-2 WT in A549 cells was more robust than that of H7-2ΔF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This was generally consistent with previous reports that PB1-F2 proteins of H9N2, H5N1 and H7N9 promote viral replication in human lung epithelial cells (i.e. A549) by preventing HAX-1 from inhibiting viral polymerase subunit PA [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, although enhanced replication of H7-2 WT virus resulted in stronger induction of TNFα mRNA at 6, 12 and 24 hpi, production of IFNβ mRNA was not enhanced at 12 hpi and even suppressed at 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This was compatible with the suppression of IFNβ expression by H7N9 PB1-F2 in infected A549 and THP-1 cells.
