<p>Stronger anti-parallel cross-β-sheet pairing in PB1-F2 from H5N1 and H7N9 might stabilize their prefibrillar oligomers leading to higher aggregation propensity. To check for this possibility, SDD-AGE and protein solubility assays were performed to compare the aggregation propensity of PB1-F2 proteins from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9. SDD-AGE is a non-denaturing method to identify high-molecular-mass protein complex such as prion or amyloid aggregates [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. MG132 was used to restore the expression of WSN PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2. Generally consistent with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, WSN PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 were much stabilized by MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 2 and 6). In contrast, the stabilizing effect of MG132 on H7N9 PB1-F2 was modest at best (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). WSN PB1-F2 remained to be low-molecular-mass species with and without MG132 treatment on the SDD-AGE blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Notably, high-molecular-mass species of H7N9 PB1-F2 appeared on the SDD-AGE blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8). Although H5N1 PB1-F2 was less abundant than H7N9 PB1-F2, high-molecular-mass species of H5N1 PB1-F2 were also seen upon MG132 treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lane 6). In contrast, high-molecular-mass species of H7N9 PB1-F2 were visible in the absence of MG132 and the potentiating effect of MG132 on them was less evident (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). These results were consistent with the prediction that PB1-F2 of H5N1 and H7N9 had higher aggregation propensity than the counterpart in WSN. To verify this, protein solubility assay was performed in RIPA lysis buffer with 0.1% SDS to assess the aggregation propensity of PB1-F2 proteins. Whereas WSN PB1-F2 was highly soluble in RIPA lysis buffer no matter cells were treated with MG132 or not (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), H7N9 PB1-F2 was sufficiently insoluble (lanes 5 and 6). H5N1 PB1-F2 was found in both soluble and insoluble fractions, but it became more insoluble when its expression was restored by MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). In short, PB1-F2 proteins of H7N9 and H5N1 might have higher propensity to form antiparallel cross-β sheet pairing and high-molecular-mass aggregates than WSN PB1-F2.
