<p>We demonstrated the aggregation-prone property of H7N9 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Since aggregated proteins are known to be less susceptible to proteolysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the higher aggregation potential of H7N9 PB1-F2 is generally consistent with its higher resistance to proteolysis and increased protein stability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We also showed that H7N9 PB1-F2 primarily affects aggregation of MAVS, which was consistently supported by several lines of evidence. First, MAVS aggregation was severely compromised when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Second, MAVS aggregates on mitochondria seen in confocal images disappeared when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Third, unaggregated MAVS in the presence of H7N9 PB1-F2 is more prone to proteasomal and lysosomal degradation in transfected and infected cells (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g006">6A</xref>). This is also generally consistent with the notion that aggregated proteins are less susceptible to proteolysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Fourth, H7N9 PB1-F2 had little suppressive effect on aggregation-defective mutants of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Fifth, MAVS retained its ability to interact with TRAF3 but lost its ability to interact with TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKε in the presence of H7N9 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Whereas the interaction with TRAF3 requires multimerization but not aggregation of MAVS, MAVS aggregation is a prerequisite for the interaction with TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKε [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Finally, H7N9 PB1-F2 suppressed TRIM31 recruitment to MAVS and K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9</xref>), both of which are required for aggregation and activation of MAVS. Whether and how the aggregation of H7N9 PB1-F2 might control its suppression of MAVS aggregation and activation merit further investigations.
