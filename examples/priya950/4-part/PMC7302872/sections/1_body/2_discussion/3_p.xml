<p>MAVS was originally proposed to undergo spontaneous prion-like aggregation upon activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, it is now known that TRIM31-mediated K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS is essential for aggregation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The TRIM31-MAVS axis is stringently regulated by multiple host factors such as aggregation-prone mitochondrial adaptor protein FAF1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], K63-deubiquitinase YOD1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], RNF34 that promotes K63-K27 chain transfer [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], O-GlcNAc transferase that catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], SIRT5 that catalyzes lysine desuccinylation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], Rac-1 that affects protein geranylgeranylation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and SNX8 that controls cholesterol levels [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition, MAVS aggregation can be suppressed by lactate [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and TRIM31 is known to bind with phosphotidyethanolamine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Here we showed that viral protein PB1-F2 of avian influenza virus H7N9 formed protein aggregates on mitochondria, perturbed TRIM31-MAVS interaction and directed unaggregated MAVS for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. H7N9 PB1-F2 shares some functional similarities with cellular protein FAF1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Both localize primarily to mitochondria and are aggregation-prone. However, FAF1 does not enhance MAVS degradation. Since FAF1 interacts tightly with MAVS, they likely co-aggregate to form a stable FAF1-MAVS complex. In contrast, no interaction between H7N9 PB1-F2 and MAVS was detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Instead, H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregated and localized to distinct sub-compartment of clustered mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), adjacent to the sub-compartment harboring unaggregated MAVS on fissioned or fragmented mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), where MAVS was prone to degradation.
