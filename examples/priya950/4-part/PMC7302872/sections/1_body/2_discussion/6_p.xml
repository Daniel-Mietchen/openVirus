<p>PB1-F2 amyloid formation occurs as early as at 8 hpi as demonstrated with WSN virus at an MOI of 0.1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As it had higher aggregation propensity than WSN PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>), H7N9 PB1-F2 might aggregate more rapidly. In our setting, H7-2 WT infection at an MOI of 1 strikingly reduced MAVS protein level as early as at 6 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), leading to an inhibition of type I IFN production at 12 and 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). H7N9 PB1-F2 was abundantly expressed at 6 hpi but started to decline from 12 to 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 likely plateaued at around 6 hpi, before which H7N9 PB1-F2 was already aggregating on mitochondria to dampen MAVS aggregation, thereby blocking propagation of antiviral signal. Electrochemical study as described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] can be performed to investigate further as to how H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregates in infected cells.
