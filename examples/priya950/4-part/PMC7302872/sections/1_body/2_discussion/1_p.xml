<p>In this study, we defined a novel and virus subtype-specific mechanism by which PB1-F2 protein of the 2013 H7N9 virus prevents aggregation and activation of MAVS leading to suppression of innate immune response. H7N9 PB1-F2 had unique properties including higher aggregation potential (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and tendency to accumulate on clustered mitochondria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2</xref>). H7N9 PB1-F2 potently inhibited K63-polyubiquitination (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7</xref>) as well as TRIM31-binding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9</xref>), TRAF6-engaging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8</xref>) and IFN-inducing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3</xref>) activities of MAVS. It also targeted MAVS to proteasomal and lysosomal degradation (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g006">6</xref>). Importantly, MAVS was stabilized and IFNÎ² was induced more robustly by H7N9 PB1-F2-defective recombinant virus (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">5</xref>). Our findings highlight the importance of PB1-F2 in pathogenicity of avian influenza A viruses H7N9 and H5N1.
