<p>Upon harvest, cells were trypsinized, washed once with PBS and resuspended in DMEM to reach 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Cells were stained with 5 μg/ml JC-1 dye for 20 min. For CCCP control, cells were co-treated with JC-1 dye and 50 μM CCCP for 20 min. The cell suspensions were then washed with PBS and analyzed through fluorescence plate reader. Excitation at 550 nm and emission at 600 nm showed red signal representing JC-1 aggregate on healthy mitochondria. Excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm showed green signal representing JC-1 monomer on depolarized mitochondria.
