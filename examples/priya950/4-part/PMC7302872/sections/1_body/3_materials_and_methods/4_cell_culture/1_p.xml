<p>Cell lines HEK293T, A549, THP-1, DF-1 and MDCK cell lines were from ATCC. HEK293T, A549 and DF-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1× non-essential amino acid. All cells were kept at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Plasmid transfection was performed using GeneJuice (Novagen, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. For poly (I:C) transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used as per manufacturer’s protocol.
