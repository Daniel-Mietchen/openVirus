  <title>Protein expression levels of PB1-F2s and the other proteins of interest in the luciferase assay.</title>
  <p>Samples of the same conditioned HEK293T cells as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3</xref> were subjected to total protein sample extraction followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Protein samples of HEK293T cells transfected with PB1-F2-Flag plasmids and infected with Sendai virus as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3A</xref> were tested for expression level of PB1-F2-Flag normalized to GAPDH level. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Protein samples of HEK293T cells transfected with PB1-F2-Flag plasmid and poly (I:C) as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3B</xref> were tested as above. (
   <bold>C</bold>) HEK293T cells were transfected with PB1-F2-Flag and GST-RIG-IN plasmids as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3C</xref>. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Cells were transfected with MyD88-His plasmid as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Flag-MAVS was expressed as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E, 3H and 3I</xref>. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Flag-TBK1 was expressed as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3F</xref>. (
   <bold>G</bold>) IRF3-5D-V5 was expressed as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3G</xref>. (
   <bold>H</bold>) Cells were treated with IFNÎ² or transfected with Flag-MAVS plasmid as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3J</xref>. (
   <bold>I</bold>) H7N9 PB1-F2 66N-Flag or H7N9 PB1-F2-66S-Flag was expressed. Cells were infected with Sendai virus as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3K</xref>. (
   <bold>J</bold>) Flag-MAVS was expressed as in
