  <title>H7N9 PB1-F2-induced destabilization of MAVS protein aggregate for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Treatment with proteasome and lysosome inhibitors. HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 1 μg PB1-F2-Flag expression construct and 1 μg pEF-Bos-Flag-MAVS. After 24 hours, 20 μM MG132, 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (BaA1) or their combination was added for 6 or 16 hours before cells were harvested for total protein extraction and SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis against anti-Flag. Relative band intensity of MAVS over GAPDH was plotted in the right panel. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Analysis of aggregation-defective mutants of MAVS. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg PB1-F2 expression construct and 0.5 μg pEF-Bos-Flag-MAVS WT, E26A, W56R or R64, 65A. After 48 hours, total protein was extracted from the cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Flag for detection of MAVS at 70 kDa and PB1-F2 at 15-20kDa. Relative band intensity of MAVS over GAPDH was plotted in the lower panel. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results.
