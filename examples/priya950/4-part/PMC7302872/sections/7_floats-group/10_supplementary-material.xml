  <title>Z-stack analysis for H7N9 PB1-F2 on mitochondrial aggregate.</title>
  <p>HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of H7N9 PB1-F2-Flag expression construct for 48 hours followed by Mitotracker Red CMXRos staining, fixation and immunostaining with anti-Flag and DAPI as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. The stained cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy for Z-stack imaging. Images 1 to 9 represented nine images captured through Z-axis perpendicular to the image plane spaced by 0.7 μm. Arrows indicated distinct mitochondrial clusters co-localized with H7N9 PB1-F2.
