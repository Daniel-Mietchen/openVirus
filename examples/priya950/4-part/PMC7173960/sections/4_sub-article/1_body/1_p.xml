<p>We acknowledge the point of the reviewer that besides interfering with receptor binding by steric hindrance other mechanisms could also explain why efficient neutralization is predominantly observed following multimerization of VHHs. One potential mechanism could involve a more efficient interference with glycoprotein conformational changes by VHH complexes compared to mixtures of VHHs. Bivalent/bispecific VHHs can potentially cross-link the glycoprotein shell at the virion surface, preventing pH-mediated glycoprotein conformational changes required for fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Additionally, at least in the in vivo situation, neutralization might be the indirect result of phagocytosis of opsonized virions either with or without a role for complement. In the revised version of the paper we elaborated on the potential mechanisms of neutralization in the Discussion section.</p>
