<p>A very wide range of approaches are currently used to isolate natural antibodies and to design synthetic constructs. Most of these efforts are based on neutralizing antibodies or antibody fragments of murine or human origin. In general, these molecules consist of heavy and light polypeptide chains linked by disulphide bonds. Interestingly, in only a few species such as camelids and nurse sharks, heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) are found, of which the antigen binding domain can be expressed as a single-domain antibody (sdAb) (

VHHs are intrinsically highly soluble molecules and due to their distinctive structure with extended antigen-binding CDR3 region and overall small size, some are able to target unique (cryptic) antigenic sites not accessible to conventional antibodies (
