<p>Recently, the discovery of 'bacterial superglues' has enabled the creation of unique protein architectures. The superglues are comprised of a bacterially-derived peptide and a small protein able to form unbreakable isopeptide bonds (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Veggiani et al., 2014</xref>). The first bacterial superglue was developed by splitting the immunoglobulin-like collagen adhesion domain (CnaB2) of the fibronectin binding protein (FbaB) of 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>) into a peptide and a protein fragment referred to as SpyTag and SpyCatcher. When the two peptides meet, an amide bond is formed which is highly specific and irreversible. Covalent bond formation occurs within minutes upon mixing and is highly robust under various conditions (
