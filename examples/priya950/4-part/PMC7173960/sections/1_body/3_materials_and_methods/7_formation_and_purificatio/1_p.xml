<p>Bivalent, bispecific and trispecific complexes were formed upon mixing of SpyTagged, SnoopTagged and/or SdyTagged VHHs with ELP scaffolds with C-terminally, N-terminally and/or internal Spy-, Snoop- or SdyCatchers. Briefly, scaffold and VHH solutions were diluted in PBS to concentrations between 5–32 µM. Subsequently, solutions were mixed at a 1:3-1:4 molar ratio (scaffold:VHH) under agitation (300 rpm) in a thermoblock (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 3 hr at 20°C. Of note, for the trispecific complex the SdyTagged VHHs were incubated 3 hr at 20°C before the Spy- and SnoopTagged VHHs were added. When required, complexes were separated from uncoupled VHHs by Strep-Tactin based affinity chromatography according the manufacturer’s instructions (IBA).</p>
