<p>Strep-Tactin microplates (Cat. No. 2-1501-001, IBA) were coated with 100 µl/well of RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> or SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> at 1 µg/mL in ELISA binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) overnight at 4°C and then washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST
 <sub>20</sub>) using an ELISA washer (6 pulses). Plates were blocked with 300 µl/well of ELISA blocking buffer (2% w/v skimmed milk in PBST
 <sub>20</sub>) for 1 hr at RT. Plates were subsequently incubated with 100 µl/well of five-fold dilution series in blocking buffer of unconjugated (indirect ELISA) VHHs, VHH complexes or VHH-hIgG
 <sub>1</sub> fusions (starting at 10 µg/ml) for 1 hr at RT and then washed with the ELISA washer. HRP-conjugated goat anti-llama IgG-H+L (A160-100P, Bethyl, Montgomery, Texas) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer (100 µl/well) was used as a secondary antibody (1 hr at RT). For the competition ELISA, plates were loaded with 90 µl/well of the competing VHHs at 11.11 µg/ml in blocking buffer, followed by incubation for 1 hr at RT. Subsequently, 10 µl/well of the analyte HRP-conjugated VHHs (concentration differs per VHH and should reach E
 <sub>450 </sub>0.5–0.8 in indirect ELISA) in blocking buffer were added, followed by incubation for 1 hr at RT. In all three ELISAs, TMB One Component HRP Microwell Substrate (TMBW-1000–01, SurModics, Minnesota) was added as a substrate. For the species-specific albumin ELISA of the ABD containing ELP scaffold, human (A9511 Sigma), mouse (A3139 Sigma) or bovine albumin (A7906 Sigma) was coated at a 10 µg/ml concentration. Plates were blocked with 300 µl/well of casein blocking buffer (2% casein in PBST
 <sub>20</sub>) for 1 hr at RT. Plates were subsequently incubated with 100 µl/well ABD containing ELP scaffold in a dilution series. Strep-Tactin-HRP conjugate (2-1502-001, IBA) diluted 1:5000 in casein blocking buffer (100 µl/well) was used as a secondary antibody (1 hr at RT).
