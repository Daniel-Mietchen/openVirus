<p>The coding regions of the RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> (and smaller subdomains) and the SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> domain (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were gene synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, New Jersey), and cloned into the pBAC3 baculo transfer plasmid (Merck) resulting in the following open reading frame (ORF) organization: signal sequence GP 64 – SpyCatcher – 10 GlySer linker – 
 <italic>domain of interest</italic> – enterokinase - Twin Strep-tag. After rescue of the recombinant baculoviruses using the FlashBAC ULTRA system (Oxford Expression Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom) in Sf9-ET cells (ATCC CRL-3357) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, protein productions were initiated in High Five cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Landsmeer, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins of interest were subsequently purified from the culture supernatant using gravity flow Strep-tactin sepharose columns (IBA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, proteins were buffer exchanged to TBS with 200 mM NaCl using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts).
