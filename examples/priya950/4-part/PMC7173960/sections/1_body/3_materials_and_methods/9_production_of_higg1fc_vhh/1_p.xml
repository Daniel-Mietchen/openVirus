<p>For medium scale production, the hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc-VHH chimeric antibodies were expressed in a CHO transient expression system as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Daramola et al., 2014</xref>). The sequences for the hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc-VHH chimeric antibodies were synthesized by GeneArt, ThermoFisher and cloned into OriP-containing expression vectors (
