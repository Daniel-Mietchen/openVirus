<p>Mice were inoculated once with the complexes, followed by a lethal challenge dose of either RVFV or SBV. RVFV-specific complexes were evaluated in a BALB/c mouse model and SBV-specific complexes in IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <sub>ABD</sub>-RV107 and RV104-ELP2
 <sub>ABD</sub>-RV150 resulted in a marked delay in mortality, of which the delay was most pronounced for RV104-ELP2
 <sub>ABD</sub>-RV107 (

 <sub>ABD</sub>-RV107 complex protected the mice most efficiently, thereby suggesting that targeting of up to three antigenic sites simultaneously is very effective.
