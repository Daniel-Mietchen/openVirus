<p>The virus neutralizing activity of selected VHHs, representative for each antigenic site, was evaluated with RVFV and SBV-specific virus neutralization tests (VNTs). At nM range concentrations, no neutralization was observed for any of the monovalent VHHs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; left panel of the figure and diagonal set of bars). Since synergistic effects have been reported for combinations of monoclonal antibodies in bunyavirus neutralization (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Besselaar and Blackburn, 1992</xref>), we subsequently tested mixtures of VHHs. Combining two VHHs in the VNT assays resulted in moderate neutralization for some SBV VHH combinations (ND
 <sub>50</sub> around 200 nM) whereas still no neutralization was observed for RVFV VHH mixtures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; left part of the figure with double colored bars). We therefore assessed whether multimerization supports efficient neutralization. In order to facilitate the screening of a large set of bivalent and bispecific complexes including various linker lengths and without the need to construct a lot of expression plasmids, we used the advantageous properties of bacterial superglue. VHHs were expressed with Spy- and SnoopTags and flexible scaffolds consisting of one, two or three elastin-like protein (ELP) domains were expressed with Spy- and SnoopCatcher domains. By simply mixing the tagged VHH versions with the Catcher containing ELP scaffolds, bivalent and bispecific complexes were constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The VNT assays subsequently revealed that several multimeric complexes very efficiently neutralized with ND
 <sub>50</sub>Â &lt;10 nM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; middle and right panels). For RVFV, targeting of two distinct antigenic sites seemed a prerequisite to enable efficient neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas for SBV both bivalent and bispecific complexes were capable of neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the length of the scaffolds did not have a major effect on neutralization efficiency of the RVFV VHH complexes, whereas the length did influence efficacy of the SBV complexes. Complexes based on the ELP3 scaffold (the longest tested) showed markedly higher neutralization efficiencies.
