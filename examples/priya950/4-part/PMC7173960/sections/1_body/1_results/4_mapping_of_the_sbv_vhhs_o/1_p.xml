<p>The SBV-Gc head domain is the most exposed feature on the virus envelope, and based on homology with other orthobunyaviruses, it is believed to reversibly form homotrimers among neighboring Gc molecules (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>). Crystal structures of the head domain in complex with two neutralizing murine mAbs, referred to as 1C11 and 4B6, have recently shown that 1C11 binds to the apical end of the head domain, near the N686 glycosylation site, and that 4B6 binds to the opposite, basal end of the head domain, near its connection to the stalk (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>). Binding of either antibody is sterically incompatible with head domain trimerization, suggesting that neutralization may at least be partially mediated by destabilization of the spike’s quaternary structure (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>). Competition ELISAs with 1C11 and 4B6 and our SBV VHH panel suggests that SB11 and SB14 target the same antigenic site as 1C11 at the apical end of the domain, whereas no competition was observed with 4B6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For SB10, of which the antigenic site is independent from the others, we generated an escape mutant carrying the single point mutation Y541C located directly at the head domain’s contact area with the stalk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>). This site likely acts as a hinge allowing the head domain to adopt different orientations relative to the virion surface (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>), and antibody binding is thus expected to restrain the local mobility of the spike.
