<p>To gain insight into the mechanisms of RVFV neutralization, the VHHs were mapped on the Gn glycoprotein. This showed that all selected RVFV VHHs bind to the head domain of the Gn glycoprotein. In the virion context, Gn forms heterodimers with Gc and assembles into capsomers that are organized into an icosahedral lattice with a T = 12 quasisymmetry (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Halldorsson et al., 2018</xref>). Binding of VHHs that target the β-ribbon domain (blue panel) could potentially interfere with heterodimer dissociation for fusion or with fusion loop insertion. The VHHs targeting domain B (yellow panel) most likely interfere with receptor binding although specific functions have yet to be identified for this domain. Since the red VHH panel was unable to bind to any of the subdomains we expect these to bind at a domain interface.
