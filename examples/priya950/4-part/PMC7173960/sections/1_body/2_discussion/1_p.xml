<p>Bunyaviruses pose a clear and present danger to both animal and human health. The WHO recognized the threat for human health by including three bunyaviruses; RVFV, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause future epidemics and for which no countermeasures are currently available (

Although for some bunyaviruses veterinary vaccines are available or in development, for humans neither registered vaccines nor effective therapies exist.
