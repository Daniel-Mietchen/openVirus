<p>Following the proof of principle experiments with the ELP-based complexes, selected VHHs were reformatted to bispecific hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc-VHH fusion proteins (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laventie et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to the ELP-based VHH complexes, the hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc bispecific format is potentially capable of eliciting effector function and expected to have a prolonged half-life in plasma due to FcRn binding. Orthologous mouse and human FcγRs share ~60–70% identity, suggesting some incompatibility. However, a recent study shows that hIgG
 <sub>1</sub> binds all mouse FcγRs with affinities that are similar to binding affinities of mouse IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> to the mouse receptors (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, FcγR-mediated effector functions of the hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc based bispecifics are expected to be maintained in mice. Production of the two hIgG1Fc-VHH fusion proteins with the CHO cell based transient expression platform (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Daramola et al., 2014</xref>) was efficient and preliminary data suggest that the expression and purification profiles are similar to what is usually seen with conventional bispecific antibodies. Nevertheless, a more comprehensive characterization of the molecules is still required to fully assess the manufacturability of this new bispecific format.
