<p>The competition observed between the SBV-specific VHHs revealed that the majority (except for SB10) bind to one of three overlapping antigenic sites. X-ray crystallography studies previously showed that mAb 1C11 binds to the apical end of the Gc head domain (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>). Since SB11 and SB14 partially block antigen recognition by mAb 1C11, although not reciprocally, it appears that the antigenic sites recognized by the majority of our VHHs partially overlap with the antigenic site of mAb 1C11. The apical end of the Gc head domain thus appears to be highly immunogenic in llamas. A fourth, independent antigenic site is defined by SB10, for which an escape mutation at the hinge that connects the head domain to the stalk domain was identified. Intriguingly, the same point mutation was also found in an SBV field sample from a malformed goatling in 2012 (BH 233/12–1, GenBank: KC108871, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>). The virus in this goatling possibly replicated in the face of sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies that selected for this mutation. The mutation could affect the binding of the antibodies directly or the mutation could alter the conformation of Gc, leading to less efficient neutralization by SB10 or similar antibodies. We postulate that antibodies similar to SB10 are produced by more than just one natural target species, and that these antibodies pose a significant fitness cost for viral growth. As the biological role of the SBV Gc head domain is not yet fully understood, mechanisms for antibody protection remain speculative at this point. It becomes however apparent that binding of different antibodies to the SBV Gc head domain may alter the tertiary or quaternary structure of the spike and influence its structural dynamics: whereas at least two antigenic sites have been mapped to the putative trimerization interface of the head domain, SB10 binding likely restrains the head domain’s mobility at its connection to the stalk. Together with inhibition of host cell attachment, these mechanisms may well contribute to virus neutralization.
