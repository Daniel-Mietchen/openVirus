<p>While none of the individual technical components in this strategy, e.g. llama VHH phage display and library screening, SpyCatcher/SpyTag for antibody coupling, and generation of bispecific antibodies using VHH and human Fc, is novel, their combination provides an elegant working strategy for developing VHH-based antibody therapeutics for an important viral pathogen. However, incorporation of these technical components into a working pipeline may justify some level of novelty.</p>
