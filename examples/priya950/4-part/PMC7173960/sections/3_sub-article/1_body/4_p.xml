<p>In this manuscript, the authors presented a strategy based on Llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs) for the development of effective bunyavirus therapeutics. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) were used as test cases. First, the authors isolated VHHs from a phage display library constructed from B cells of llamas immunized with RVFV vaccine and SBV VLP. While all animals showed virus-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers, panning-derived VHHs showed low and moderate neutralization activities when tested individually and in a mixed form, respectively. Then, the authors utilized the SpyCatcher/SpyTag technology to create multimeric VHHs to test the synergistic effect in neutralization. Indeed, several multimeric VHHs showed greater potency than individual VHHs. Next, the authors created human IgG1Fc-VHH constructs for the best performers in the synergy test using these tethered or "glued" VHHs. CHO-expressed bispecific VHHs showed protection in a mouse challenge model of bunyavirus infection. Thus, this study presents</p>
