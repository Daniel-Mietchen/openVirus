<p>2) The SpyCatcher/tag and SnoopCatcher/Tag systems (bacterial SuperGlue) present powerful tools for protein engineering that are well-described here. There has been concern that these bacterial proteins would elicit a strong antibody response in humans. Here, the bacterial superglue to combine VHHs in an intermediate step before testing them in a bispecific form with a human Fc. It would be helpful to the community if you could discuss the design of this step, as opposed to the direct testing of VHH pairs in the hIgG1Fc form.</p>
