  <title>RVFV and SBV-specific neutralization by monovalent VHHs and bacterial superglue-assembled VHH complexes.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) RVFV- and (
   <bold>B</bold>) SBV-specific monovalent VHHs, VHH combinations and bivalent and bispecific ELP-based VHH complexes were tested in a RVFV or SBV-specific VNT assay. Complexes were formed by mixing the tagged versions of the VHHs with the indicated Catcher-containing ELP scaffolds of different lengths (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Mixtures were subsequently pre-incubated with virus before adding them to susceptible cells. The ND
   <sub>50</sub> values refer to total VHH per reaction as neutralization might be the result of cooperative action of VHH complexes and free VHHs. Averages of two biological replicate experiments are presented. Individual VHHs are color-coded based on the antigenic site they recognize as determined by competition ELISA (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Generally, most efficient neutralization was observed with multimerization of VHHs that each target a different antigenic site.
