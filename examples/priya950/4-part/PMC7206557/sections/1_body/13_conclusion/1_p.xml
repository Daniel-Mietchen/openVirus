<p>This study illustrated the emotive impact that particular cultural representations of Ebola have in newspaper reports. The consensus among the press reports was that South Africa was not at risk, but the discourses have implications. First, reflected in this study through the threat to humanity discourse, Africa’s deviation from Western norms was implied to be the cause of Ebola, and this upholds colonial hegemony. Second, the discourse of a 
 <italic>human</italic> criminal who stalks victims seems more distinctive of South African news reportage compared to discourses in other studies’ findings that relied instead on images of a predatory 
 <italic>microorganism</italic>. Crime headlines in South Africa are not uncommon, and the Ebola reportage deployed similar crime rhetoric. The more common image in other studies about diseases (e.g., AIDS, the plague, tuberculosis) was the waging of a war against an intruder. Ebola, in our research findings, was represented not as a mere intruder but as a human predator. This shift could be considered within the context of individualisation of health risks rather than nationalistic protection because globalisation has removed borders; and readers, rather than nations that can wage war, are allocated responsibility for their health risks. The news reader is incited to be on the lookout for the lurking predator. In the 21st century and in a country at peace, crime against an individual elicits personalised fear, in contrast to the older image of a war that threatens national security. The fear that media incites only occurs because of flaws in health-risk communication, as well as in ‘our fundamentally flawed human psychology . . . The real tragedy of this failure is in the consequences of that fear reaction, both intended and unintended’ (

 <xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001b)</xref>, is dangerous globally because it reveals an unsophisticated understanding about humans’ biological relationship with the world through their environmental and scientific intrusions. Poor disease control and medical malpractice spread the disease rather than an anthropomorphised entity (
