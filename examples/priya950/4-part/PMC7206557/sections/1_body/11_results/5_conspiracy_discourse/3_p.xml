<p>The discourse of conspiracy, through the view that Ebola is fabricated, detracts from a community’s responsibility to address the seriousness of the disease. The discourse, for those who believe in its veracity, allows ‘primitive’ Africans to believe they are safe and keep their integrity intact, given the history of colonialism and high-income countries’ hegemony over cure of disease. This discourse thus serves as a barrier to medical management. As a psychological defence towards colonial oppression, conspiracy beliefs lead to an increase in political tension, both within international relations and the affected countries.</p>
