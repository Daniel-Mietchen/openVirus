This study investigated representations of the Ebola virus/disease in South African news reports (March 2014&#x02013;June 2015). Four discourses were found to operate within the globalised social context: threat to humanity, predation, invasion, and conspiracy. The South African reportage framed Ebola as a predator and criminal rather than using stock warfare imagery. Representations indicated alignment with phobic high-income countries and colonial hegemony.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Discourse analysis</kwd><kwd>Ebola</kwd><kwd>news reports</kwd><kwd>South Africa</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>West Africa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The fear elicited in press coverage of the 2014 Ebola outbreak led to public reactions being dubbed &#x02018;Fearbola&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr17-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">James, 2014</xref>). Sensationalist discourse emerged, particularly through dire news headlines and photographs, both in high-income countries and the affected countries (<xref rid="bibr15-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Halsey, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="bibr15-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Halsey (2016)</xref> states that the affected regions&#x02019; local press often contained faulty information that contributed to social constructions framed by fear. The focus of the current study is on how the 2014 Ebola outbreak was represented in South Africa, specifically on how the virus or disease, rather than its management, was represented in news reports.</p><p>Emotive engagement with Ebola in the media illustrates how medical discourse became political and ideological, as was shown in <xref rid="bibr20-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Kamalu&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> critical discourse analysis of comments posted on blogs, discussion forums, twitter, and Facebook (July&#x02013;October 2014). Focussing on these online posts, which represented public meanings in Nigeria, <xref rid="bibr20-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Kamalu (2016)</xref> found that posts actively evaluated government reaction and policy, circulated ethnic and racist discourse, and reinforced notions of Ebola both as a form of terrorism and othering. Online media thus played a role in public circulation of fear and hysteria, and also contributed to (improper) psychosocial management of affected persons. To demonstrate this, <xref rid="bibr25-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Mondragon, de Montes and Valencia (2017)</xref> showed that laypersons&#x02019; social representations depicted Ebola as being definitively African (particularly in being linked to poverty), along with portrayals of dread about entering the affected countries and &#x02018;backward&#x02019; Africa lacking competence to manage the disease. Localised social support for and stigma towards survivors added to the global fears originating in high-income countries, detracting from public education, as well as from the political and economic challenges in the affected regions (<xref rid="bibr11-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Foster &#x00026; Dashwood, 2014</xref>). The fear, which implicated stigma, showed that implementing just a clinical response to patients was insufficient (as the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] crisis warned society previously) because psychosocial care was needed to help both stigmatised patients and their caregivers (<xref rid="bibr8-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Davtyan, Brown, &#x00026; Folayan, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">van Bortel et al., 2016</xref>). Survivors were stigmatised through a contagion discourse because they were denied jobs by potential employers and refused treatment by health workers (<xref rid="bibr24-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Mayhew, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The social problem that results from fear is one of positioning particular people as dangerous others, a common response in the history of epidemics. Othering is fuelled by fear, and the dehumanising effect, which may ease the process of othering, leads to the blaming of infected persons and governments who fail to control the spread of the disease. Such representations, with reference to Ebola, depicted the African as the &#x02018;Other&#x02019; and therefore, inferior, further progressing to a discourse of hope for containing the infection through the superlative promises of biomedicine being delivered from the industrialised world (<xref rid="bibr41-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Washer, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Othering representations, however, have shifted from downward othering of marginalised groups towards upward othering of governments and organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) (Joffe, 2011). For the Ebola crisis, such othering led to social representations of conspiracy. According to social psychology explanations, the ingroup (the affected group in this case) attributes the calamity to an act of government or to an outgroup because their sacred values are threatened (<xref rid="bibr13-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Franks, Bangerter, &#x00026; Bauer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, othering is appropriated within other discourses. In the discourse of hope (<xref rid="bibr41-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Washer, 2004</xref>), the risk of infection remains relegated to &#x02018;primitive&#x02019; peoples, making this the West&#x02019;s way of talking so that it does not consider itself to be at risk as long as its borders are not transgressed. As conceptualised by <xref rid="bibr1-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Aaltola (2012)</xref>, Western lay people usually watch a scenario unfolding elsewhere and judge performers on a foreign disease stage. This reinforces the &#x02018;us&#x02019; and &#x02018;other&#x02019; distinction. The affected regions get viewed in Western newspaper reports through colonialist images of Africa as a jungle where people eat monkeys and fruit bats, and have cultural practices that promote disease transmission (<xref rid="bibr2-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="bibr27-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Olivier (2007)</xref> considers that any uncontrolled constituent of nature such as a virus (particularly when associated with an African jungle) represents a threat to humanity and civilisation, and is relegated to an &#x02018;abject&#x02019; position. This threatens Western capitalistic society&#x02019;s notion of taming nature and, in so doing, shows up the precariousness of a technological society whose survival is based on the idea that nature is controllable.</p><p>Historically, images have been used to construct particular versions of diseases, as Sontag&#x02019;s classical theorising has shown. Predominant explanations have used war metaphors. These have included notions of battle, combating of infection, counterattack, invasion, and fight (<xref rid="bibr34-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Sontag, 2003</xref>). Metaphors function as a conduit to disseminate scientific knowledge to nonexperts, but they have discursive and sociopolitical consequences (<xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson, Nerlich, &#x00026; Wallis, 2005</xref>), contributing to particular media framings of disease, such as those of war or a plague in the case of Ebola (<xref rid="bibr40-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Vellek, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="bibr40-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Vellek&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> deductive content analysis shows that such images in reports in wide-reaching newspapers in the US, UK and Singapore located Ebola within a mutation-contagion frame. However, using war metaphors is a choice made by journalists. As <xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al. (2005)</xref> have shown, UK newspapers <italic>avoided</italic> war metaphors in reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease (EID), just like Ebola.</p><p>Even though war images add newsworthiness (<xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2005</xref>), the militarisation of illness creates stigma for those infected. <xref rid="bibr34-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Sontag (2003)</xref> asserted that discourse of war and battle should be avoided because it promotes dread and stigma. Popular culture and media have also extended the war metaphor to other-worldly battles of science fiction. Diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were likened to alien invaders and envisioned as the alien &#x02018;other&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr34-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Sontag, 2003</xref>). The imagery of outer space further reinforces the otherness through visuals of hazmat suits that get likened to space suits and thus to science fiction (<xref rid="bibr19-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Joffe &#x00026; Haarhoff, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Common images about social, psychological, and national threats have been used in Ebola discourse. Predominantly, the Ebola virus, based on the outbreaks occurring until 2001, was subjected to a rhetorical construction of predation (<xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>). Weldon argued that, in comparison to other deadly viruses, Ebola does not kill millions of people and representations of the epidemic were based on misperceptions and, specifically, on predation images derived from a 1994 text, <italic>The Hot Zone</italic> (Preston as cited in <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>, <xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">2001b</xref>). <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon&#x02019;s (2001a)</xref> analysis of the predatory discourse showed that &#x02018;the issue with Ebola involves a rhetorical construction, in addition to a social construction&#x02019; (p. 8). The discursive construction of Ebola functioned to detract responsibility from the problem of compromised medical practice for managing Ebola. This shift, through personifying the virus that led to fear being elicited by this construction, removed focus away from the poor health systems and practices of the affected areas. Movies and books, which capitalised on this image at that time, further shifted agency away from humans responsible for the spread (<xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>). Images of war, fire, and mythical potency contributed to this predatory discourse. <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001a)</xref> argued that these were exaggerations because of the epidemiological fact that needle sharing at clinics in Zaire and Sudan led to fatalities in the earlier epidemics. In other words, governmental systems and human agency threatened the broader-accepted belief system that Western medicine was infallible. As one epidemiologist and microbiologist also pointed out, the clinical picture presented in Preston&#x02019;s book is inaccurate (<xref rid="bibr33-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">T. C. Smith, 2014</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001a)</xref> further speaks of Ebola&#x02019;s representation within conspiracy discourses because of the global threat of bioweapons. Besides state or US conspiracy, human blood was positioned as a coagent or as being in conspiracy with the virus. Through this discourse, the sentient virus instructs the blood what to do, transforming Ebola into a mythical entity that displaces the human medical practitioner as true agent of transmission in the epidemics that occurred until 2001. Whereas an &#x02018;objective&#x02019; account would point out human mistakes and the health-practitioner carelessness, <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001a)</xref> attributes the dominating predatory discourse to Preston&#x02019;s classic, purportedly nonfiction text.</p><p>Research into analyses of representations of the 2014 outbreak, even if it recognised the sensationalism effect (<xref rid="bibr17-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">James, 2014</xref>) or used systematic empirical methods (e.g., <xref rid="bibr30-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Paul, Mahajan, &#x00026; Sahoo, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">S. Smith &#x00026; Smith, 2016</xref>), did not include in-depth analyses of the ideological and discursive portrayal of the disease, a gap addressed in this article. <xref rid="bibr32-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">S.

(2016)</xref>, despite confirming the globalisation of fear, presented frequency counts as opposed to showing how the fear was discursively constructed in their quantitative content analysis of three newspaper publications in India. In this article, we therefore aim to illustrate how fear was the effect of particular representations that emanate from cultural and metaphorical content in news reports in the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Put differently, we aimed to identify discourses that created a sociocultural reality about Ebola.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-0081246319868656"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2-0081246319868656"><title>Sample</title><p>This final or refined sample consisted of 113 news reports.

The date range was restricted from March 2014, the date when the WHO officially announced the Ebola outbreak, to June 2015. June was chosen as the end-date because that was when data analysis commenced, despite the ongoing occurrence of Ebola beyond this date. Even so, news coverage of Ebola became saturated and tailed off in November 2014.</p><p>The keyword search identified 145 articles in full text (pdf) format. After reading all articles, a manual search excluded those that did not relate directly to the Ebola virus. We removed 34 articles because they did not discuss the Ebola virus itself.

Keywords and phrases in the reports were subjected to a process of free association. In other words, shared social meanings were listed by free associating to words and phrases, but which were relevant to the research question. This led to describing how the Ebola virus/disease was understood in the texts, making way for identifying discourses or the ways in which the disease/virus was constructed. Both researchers critically reflected on the meanings arising from associations to ascertain if they contained unduly idiosyncratic or overpersonalised projections, and they validated each others&#x02019; inputs throughout analysis. Simply, they discussed associations and reached consensus by focusing on the relevance of meanings to the research question. Because the meanings arose from the social worlds and culturally consensual realities of the researchers as South Africans who wished to interrogate the representations of diseases, but who were also often sympathetic to African disasters and human loss, they acknowledge that, in line with discursive practice, their shared subjectivities are instrumental in making interpretations following a poststructuralist approach as opposed to aiming for an objectivist and realist encounter with the texts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section6-0081246319868656"><title>Results</title><p>Four discourses have been selected for this article. These focus on social discourse, even though the expected medical discourse was also often represented in the texts.

The apocalyptic references in our findings were also invoked in nurses&#x02019; utterances about Ebola (<xref rid="bibr3-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Broom &#x00026; Broom, 2017</xref>). Such discourse, however, is not limited to Ebola: In an analysis of how British newspapers portrayed a particular agricultural threat, <xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al. (2005)</xref> found apocalyptic and providential references, with these metaphors complementing warlike responses to disease. However, the threat to humanity discourse can have an enabling outcome to motivate addressing the pandemic. <xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001b)</xref> maintained that globalisation rhetoric was deployed to get the virus recognised, leading to renewed medical research. To get help to those most affected because of their less sophisticated health care systems, representation work must resort to personalisation of the threat, even though the discourse remains problematic.</p><p>Key to the threat to humanity discourse is the stock image of spread that is characteristic of pandemic risk. Pandemics imply &#x02018;movement, directionality and contagious spread&#x02019;; boundaries become porous, leading to zones cordoned off for containment (<xref rid="bibr1-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Aaltola, 2012</xref>, p. 668). This discourse was also found in <xref rid="bibr40-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Vellek&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> content analysis of newspaper reports of Ebola as a global threat, one made possible by easier travel options in the modern world. However, this discourse, when used in the earlier outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, had the effect of protecting individual governments because it sidestepped the real factors that led to fatalities, that is, the economic and systemic constraints reflected in staff not being trained or enough supplies not being provided (Garrettas cited in <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>). <xref rid="bibr21-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Kamradt-Scott (2016)</xref>, therefore, in explaining the WHO&#x02019;s reform of global health security &#x02013; although late for West Africa &#x02013; comments that the affected countries&#x02019; governments should have been more proactive by asking for help because of the global risks. Thus, the effect of the threat to humanity discourse is to detract from national governments&#x02019; responsibilities and failures, allocating passivity and even invisibility to their actions and roles while uncontrolled agency is granted to the virus. The uncontrolled agency is also figured into the discourse of invasion which reveals the process that unfolds with graphic descriptions of territorial uncontainment. In other words, the threat to humanity discourse, which rests on the universal globalised fear, is the outer layer of the sinister (unseen) process of invasion.</p><p>The discourse of invasion was similarly found in the theme of border control in <xref rid="bibr2-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> research of newspaper articles of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in three countries. Newspaper narratives of three Western nations (Australia, US, UK) focussed on Ebola as a problem for the West and on how political governance could manage the Ebola invasion. <xref rid="bibr2-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Abeysinghe&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> study of news reports showed that Ebola became written about not as an African problem or global problem, but as a problem for once safe and enclosed countries &#x02013; a discourse also taken up by South African texts in our sample. The discourse of invasion by a force of nature feeds into political and psychological fears. Consequently, Australian health professionals experienced anxiety and were faced with moral challenges because they had to decide &#x02018;<italic>how</italic> benevolent they were, <italic>how</italic> much they would sacrifice, and the extent of their care&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr3-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Broom &#x00026; Broom, 2017</xref>, p. 213, italics in the original). Furthermore, invasion discourse is key to militaristic metaphoricity. As <xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson and colleagues (2005)</xref> &#x02013; referring to invasive species &#x02013; explain, news reports, when allocating agency to an entity, are able to justify militaristic and nationalistic responses.</p><p>The discourses of threat to humanity and invasion are also given an organic face and figuration, either human or animal, via the discourse of predation. The predation discourse is in line with positioning the virus as abject, through which the menacing potential of nature threatens the technophiliac illusion that a virus can be controlled by the achievements of Western civilisation (<xref rid="bibr27-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Olivier, 2007</xref>). Predatory images provoke fear about dangers of the natural world that need taming and control (<xref rid="bibr27-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Olivier, 2007</xref>). The social impact implied in the image of a killer, for example, and particularly when linked to a particular geographical location, is for othering to be increased (<xref rid="bibr22-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2005</xref>). <xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon&#x02019;s (2001b)</xref> analytic work about the representations of Ebola as an invisible predatorial virus in nonfiction accounts, such as in Preston&#x02019;s <italic>The Hot Zone</italic>, shows that this imagery transforms the Ebola hemorrhagic fever into a legend. When these images move from books to the news media, blurring occurs between the line of purportedly objective news representations and those descriptions aiming for literary and emotive value.</p><p>Similarly, <xref rid="bibr37-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Ungar (1998)</xref> identifies the use of words such as &#x02018;assailant&#x02019; and &#x02018;killer&#x02019; in newspaper articles describing Ebola, but within military discourse. The most widely used frame discovered in <xref rid="bibr40-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Vellek&#x02019;s (2016)</xref> study even subsumes notions of a &#x02018;killer&#x02019; alongside war and plague metaphors, rather than considering the killer from within a predatory model. The current study found greater reliance on the predatory model compared to militaristic images of the disease. This could be attributed to sampling because we selected news reports about the virus itself, rather than about how the disease is being managed.</p><p>Nevertheless, predatory images have rhetorical effects. <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon (2001a)</xref> found that anthropomorphising of the virus through a predatory model downplays &#x02018;the extent of human involvement in the transmission of disease in favor of a much more titillating story of a predatorial virus&#x02019; (p. 18). Such a discursive representation is dangerous because it adds to &#x02018;ignorance regarding our biological relationship with our world, especially as it is mediated by environmental explorations, coupled with scientific and medical interventions&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001b</xref>, p. 293). The global public, as audience of this myth, is distracted from their role in taking responsibility for the spread and prevention of the disease (<xref rid="bibr44-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001b</xref>).</p><p>Another way of detracting from political and national responsibilities for managing disease outbreaks, whether as an intrapsychic coping strategy or a delineation of ingroup&#x02013;outgroup distinctions and politics, was illustrated by the finding of the discourse of conspiracy. Stigmatised groups redefine how they are represented (e.g., as unsanitary) through the use of conspiracy theories (<xref rid="bibr18-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Joffe, 2011</xref>). <xref rid="bibr42-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Washer (2011)</xref> asserts that the aim of conspiracy theories is to direct blame back at the West, thereby challenging dominant medical discourses. Our findings showed two types of conspiracy theories, based on whether agency was directed either to phobic high-income countries or within the affected countries. Conspiracy notions led to an uncoordinated and slow response because, close to civil war zones, people in the outbreak area distrusted the government. Infected people did not access treatment facilities (representing the untrustworthy government), and they died at home: This added to understaffed facilities not managing contagious dead bodies, resorting to sending the bodies back to their homes (<xref rid="bibr4-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Brown, Arkell, &#x00026; Rokadiya, 2015</xref>). The conspiracy theme, represented in movies, mobilises global action (<xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>). Thus, journalists&#x02019; quoting of people&#x02019;s conspiracy ideas accentuates global attention. Conspiracy theories also allow people to cope with collective trauma &#x02013; particularly when attributing causes to outgroups and in doing so, they also problematise the dominant discourses (<xref rid="bibr13-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Franks et al., 2013</xref>) which, in South African press reports, related either to medical understandings or predatory images.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that, because Sabinet relies on manual processing, it is possible that articles may have been mistagged and therefore did not appear in the search results. In addition, there may have been newspapers that were absent from the database. That the outbreak occurred 3 years ago does not imply the current study is delayed or irrelevant. The 2013&#x02013;2016 Ebola outbreak was the largest, with approximately 28,639 cases (<xref rid="bibr6-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016</xref>). In comparison, approximately 2,427 cases were reported in all outbreaks before 2013 (<xref rid="bibr6-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2016</xref>). Fatalities from the 2013 outbreak, as well as the media representations, point to lessons. The fear discourse spread worldwide, unlike the current 2018&#x02013;2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has approximately 1,082 cases since August 2018 (<xref rid="bibr45-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019</xref>) and no similar global hysteria. The DRC outbreak has been difficult to manage partly because of violence stemming from the community&#x02019;s mistrust of Western medicine and medical staff (<xref rid="bibr45-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019</xref>). Our study highlights discourses similarly contained in the social construction of disease, enhancing understandings about how epidemics are represented in the public sphere, and the findings suggest that media use alternative discourses that could bring social cohesion, social action, and organised medical management, rather than disease management being disabled by fear and conspiracy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-0081246319868656"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study illustrated the emotive impact that particular cultural representations of Ebola have in newspaper reports. The consensus among the press reports was that South Africa was not at risk, but the discourses have implications. First, reflected in this study through the threat to humanity discourse, Africa&#x02019;s deviation from Western norms was implied to be the cause of Ebola, and this upholds colonial hegemony. Second, the discourse of a <italic>human</italic> criminal who stalks victims seems more distinctive of South African news reportage compared to discourses in other studies&#x02019; findings that relied instead on images of a predatory <italic>microorganism</italic>. Crime headlines in South Africa are not uncommon, and the Ebola reportage deployed similar crime rhetoric. The more common image in other studies about diseases (e.g., AIDS, the plague, tuberculosis) was the waging of a war against an intruder. Ebola, in our research findings, was represented not as a mere intruder but as a human predator. This shift could be considered within the context of individualisation of health risks rather than nationalistic protection because globalisation has removed borders; and readers, rather than nations that can wage war, are allocated responsibility for their health risks. The news reader is incited to be on the lookout for the lurking predator. In the 21st century and in a country at peace, crime against an individual elicits personalised fear, in contrast to the older image of a war that threatens national security. The fear that media incites only occurs because of flaws in health-risk communication, as well as in &#x02018;our fundamentally flawed human psychology . . . The real tragedy of this failure is in the consequences of that fear reaction, both intended and unintended&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr17-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">James, 2014</xref>, p. 465).
