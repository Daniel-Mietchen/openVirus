<p>The circulation of IVs in Emilia-Romagna was similar to that of the other regions (
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Type B IVs co-circulated with type A IVs in all seasons. With the exception of 2011-2012 season during which only A/H3N2 subtype IVs circulated, in the others, both subtypes co-circulated, although with different intensity.
