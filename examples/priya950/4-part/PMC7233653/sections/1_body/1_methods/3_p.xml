<p>Viral nucleic acid was extracted from respiratory specimens and from viral cell culture supernatant, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A one-step Real Time retro-transcription PCR assay (rRT-PCR) was performed with Quantifast Pathogen+IC Kit, (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany
 <bold>)</bold> with specific primer/probe sets targeting the matrix region of A type IV and the nucleoprotein region of B type IV. For A type IV, samples were further subtyped using specific primer/probe sets for the HA gene to discriminate between A/H1N1pdm09 IVs and A/H3N2 IVs. The genetic lineage of confirmed B type IVs was determined by rRT-PCR. All assays were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines (
