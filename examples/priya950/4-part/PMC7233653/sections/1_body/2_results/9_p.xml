<p>In Emilia-Romagna, type B IVs co-circulated with type A IVs in all seasons and predominated over type A during 2012-2013, 2015-2016, 2017-2018 seasons. With the exception of two seasons (2011-2012, 2013-2014), the co-circulation of both B lineages (B/Victoria/2/87 and B/Yamagata/16/88) was always observed, although with different intensity every year. The analysis of the HA gene sequence on a selection of type B IVs circulating in 2010-2011 season, showed that most of them belonged to B/Victoria lineage (B/Vic), antigenically similar to the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Vic) and few to B/Yamagata lineage (B/Yam).</p>
