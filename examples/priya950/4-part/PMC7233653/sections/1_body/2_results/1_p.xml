<p>During the study period, the reference Laboratory for influenza virological surveillance of Emilia-Romagna, analysed 7882 nasal or throat swabs, performed by regional sentinel practitioners and doctors working in hospital care Units of Parma, Piacenza and Reggio Emilia. The distribution of samples by season, provenience, age group, vaccination status, virological data, is reported in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, the percentage of the samples range between 6.2% in 2013-2014 season and 18.6% in 2017-2018 season; 50.3% were outpatients and 49.7% were inpatients. In the first six seasons, the highest numbers of samples were collected in children ≤4 years of age and in school-aged children (5-14 years); in the two latest years, in young-adults (15-64 years) and in elderly ≥65 years of age. The percentage of influenza-positive samples per season ranged between 28.9% (2013-2014) and 66.8% (2012-2013). In the first three seasons after the 2009 pandemic, epidemics were particularly intense due to the highest number of specimens and influenza-positive samples, while in the following five seasons, the proportion of positive samples was lower (less than 50%) compared to the high number of samples (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the surveyed area, epidemiological trends observed in the first six influenza seasons were quite similar and analogous to that of the period prior to the 2009 pandemic. Concerning the official virological surveillance period, all six seasons after the 2009 pandemic started at the beginning of December (weeks 50-51) and peaked in February (weeks 5-6). The first IVs were detected between the end of the year and the beginning of the new one. All six seasons were characterized by temporally long epidemics, that declined on March and April. During 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons, a clear shift was observed in epidemiological trend: influenza activity started about four weeks in advance, with a rapid increase of ILI and influenza-positive samples, and peaked between late December and early January (weeks 51-52).
