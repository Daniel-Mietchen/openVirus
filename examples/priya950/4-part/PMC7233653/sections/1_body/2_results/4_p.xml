<p>In Emilia-Romagna most of IVs detected in the 2010-2011, and 2017-2018 seasons were A/H1N1pdm09 IVs. Since 2010-2011 season, A/H1N1pdm09 IVs were closely related to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. In particular, A/H1N1pdm09 IVs isolated in Emilia-Romagna during 2015-2016 season fell into genetic groups 6 and 8 (A/St.PetersburG/27/2011-like, A/Norway/2552/2010-like and A/South Africa/3626/2013-like). During 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, A/H1N1pdm09 IVs fell into genetic subgroup 6B.1, characterized by the amino acid substitutions S84N, S162N, I216T in HA1, antigenetically correlate to vaccine strains A/California/7/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 that was recommended vaccine strain for the 2018-2019 season (
