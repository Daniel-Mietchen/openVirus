<p>During 2014-2015 season A/H3N2 IVs presented with a mixed circulation of viral variants antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain. The HA sequences of these viruses fell into two genetic subgroups: 3C.2, with amino acid substitutions N145S in HA1 and D160N in HA2 (reference virus A/Hong Kong/146/2013) and clade 3C.3a, with amino acid substitutions A138S, F159S, N225D in HA1, similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, reference strain for 2015-2016 vaccine. The heterogeneous circulation of different A/H3N2 IVs strains was highlighted during the following seasons, with the emergence of variants grouped into genetic subgroup 3C.2, clade 3C.2a, with further amino acid substitutions (N144S, F159Y, K160T, N225D, Q311H). The reference strain A/Hong Kong /4801/2014, was the new vaccine strain. Also in the last two seasons, A/H3N2 IVs fell into genetic subgroup 3C.2a. However, in the last phase of 2017-2018 epidemic, viruses fell into sub-clade 3C.2a1, and shared similary with A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016, the reference strain for the vaccine of 2018/2019 season.</p>
