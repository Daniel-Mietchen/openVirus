<p>A/H3N2 IVs circulating in 2010-2011 season were closely related to the vaccine strain A/Perth/16/2009, reconfirmed in the following season. In the first period of 2012-2013 season, A/H3N2 IVs were correlated to the vaccine strain, while from January they were antigenically similar to variants of recent isolation (A/Alabama/5/2010-like, A/Hong Kong/3969/2011-like and A/Stockholm/18/2011-like). Genetic characterization showed different amino acid substitutions (K62E, K144N, T212A9) and molecular homology with a new variant, A/Victoria/361/2011, that replaced the vaccine strain of previous seasons. During 2012-2013 season, A/H3N2 IVs were antigenically correlated to the A/Texas/50/2012 strain, antigenically indistinguishable from the vaccine strain A/Victoria/361/2011, but more genetically stable for propagation and, for these reasons, recommended vaccine strain in the following season.</p>
