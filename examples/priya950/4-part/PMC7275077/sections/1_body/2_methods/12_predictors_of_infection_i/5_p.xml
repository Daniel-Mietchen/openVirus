<p id="Par54">Regional differences in exposures were included as a multiplicative factor in the FOI but we assumed no spatial difference in the timing of epidemics. The CHIKV outbreak started in the region of Kourou and then spread to the rest of the territory, but this is a pattern that cannot be reconstructed from the serological survey. To detect spatial variation of 
 <italic>T</italic>, significant differences in the seroprevalence of infants between the different regions would be required. However, only 15 of them are 2 years old and 9 are 3 years old over the whole territory. Among the children under 5 years old, only 12% (5/43) were found to having been infected by CHIKV. Therefore, we lacked of statistical power to identify the spatial spread of CHIKV.
