<p id="Par67">The single cutoff classification relies on comparing the RFI with a threshold value, independently of the RFI for the other virus. We plotted the histograms of MAYV (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>) and CHIKV RFIs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>), together with the value of the chosen single threshold cutoff. This value was chosen so as to maximize the sum of the sensitivity and specificity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, d</xref>), which were obtained by considering the seroneutralization as the reference diagnostic.
