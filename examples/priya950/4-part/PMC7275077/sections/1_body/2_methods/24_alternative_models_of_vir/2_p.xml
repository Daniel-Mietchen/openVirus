<p id="Par84">Given model adequacy (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), we also considered a model where MAYV circulation in high Oyapock was characterized by both constant circulation and an epidemic (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This model improved the fit for MAYV RFIs but gave worse results for CHIKV RFIs. No overall improvement in terms of DIC was observed (Supplementary Table
