<p id="Par25">We applied a post-stratification adjustment to each of these weights to arrive at the final statistical weight for each subject. This adjustment helped us to weight the age-sex groups within each municipality to match the distribution in the French Guiana total population. Ten age groups ([2–5 years] [5–10], [10–15], [15–20], [20–25], [25–35], [35–45], [45–55], [55–65], and ≥65 years) were defined within male and female groups, and for each age-sex subgroup, we applied an adjustment factor
