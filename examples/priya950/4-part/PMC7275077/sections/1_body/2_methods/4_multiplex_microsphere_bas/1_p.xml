<p id="Par28">Collected sera were tested using an in-house microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (MIA) based on recombinant antigens. The recombinant ectodomain of the CHIKV and MAYV envelope E2 glycoproteins were used for the capture of specific IgG antibodies, whereas a recombinant human protein (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) was used as control antigen in the assay. Distinct MagPlex microsphere sets (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) were, respectively, bound to viral and control proteins using the amine coupling kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to manufacturers’ instructions. The MIA procedure was performed as described previously with minor modifications

 </sup>. Briefly, microsphere mixtures were sequentially incubated in the dark under constant shaking with a 1:400 dilution of serum samples and 4 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> anti-human IgG phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). After the final incubation, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each microsphere set was quantified using a MagPix instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For each sample, the CHIKV and MAYV Relative Fluorescence Intensities (RFI) were calculated by dividing the MFI signal measured for the CHIKV or MAYV microsphere sets by the MFI signal obtained for the control microsphere set.
