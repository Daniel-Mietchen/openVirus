<p id="Par29">To validate the model-based classification, 100 sera were selected for further testing with anti-MAYV and anti-CHIKV microneutralization tests (MNTs). Briefly MNTs were conducted in serial 2-fold dilutions of heat inactivated sera starting at 1:10 mixed in equal volume with 100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50) of MAYV or CHIKV (French Guiana strains). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, mixtures were transferred onto 96 well tissue culture plates containing subconfluent Vero cells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 days for MAYV and 5 days for CHIKV before lecture of cytopathic effects. The neutralization titer is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which infection is blocked. A serum is considered positive for titer above 10. The individuals were selected as follows: 50 individuals from Cayenne (low MAYV seroprevalence) and 50 individuals from Maroni and Oyapock (high MAYV seroprevalence).</p>
