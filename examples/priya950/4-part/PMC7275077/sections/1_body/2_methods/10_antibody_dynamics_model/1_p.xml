<p id="Par35">We model the serological response of an individual as the result of infections by MAYV and/or CHIKV. Several mechanisms contribute to the assay outcome: infection leads to a boost of the RFI for the infecting virus; cross-reactivity may also translate into a rise of the RFI when an individual is infected with another virus. We derive the four probabilities of measured RFIs given the infection status:</p>
