 <italic>P</italic>
 <sup>M</sup> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sup>C</sup> in the determination of the infection profile, we plotted the boundaries for various values of the infection probability (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We show that values of 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sup>M</sup> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sup>C</sup> have little impact on the likely infection profile which is therefore mostly determined by the RFI values.
