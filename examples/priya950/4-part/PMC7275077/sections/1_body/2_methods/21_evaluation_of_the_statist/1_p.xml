<p id="Par74">We also performed a simulation study to evaluate the performance of our statistical framework. One survey was simulated with parameters equal to the posterior mean we estimated in our analysis. We ran our MCMC algorithm on these simulated data. Parameters of antibody model dynamics (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and model-based classification of infections for the number of infected by MAYV and/or CHIKV in the simulation (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) were well estimated.
