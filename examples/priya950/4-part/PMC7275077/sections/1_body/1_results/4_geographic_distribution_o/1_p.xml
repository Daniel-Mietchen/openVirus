<p id="Par11">From the analysis of transmission dynamics in the seven regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), we identified three larger regions (Maroni, Coast, high Oyapock/Interior) that allowed us to divide the country into areas with distinct epidemiological characteristics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The model-based classification was applied to data from each of these regions with survey weights to derive representative estimates of seroprevalence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). We estimate that 20.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.5–22.1%) of the population was infected by CHIKV, predominantly in the urban areas of the Coast and along the Maroni river (Surinamese border) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). This geographical distribution of CHIKV appears similar to that previously found for Zika virus (ZIKV)

 </sup>. For both ZIKV and CHIKV, risk may be driven by the repartition of Aedes aegypti, which may have reached almost all inhabited areas but not the most remote villages. To date no study has reported the presence of

 </sup> where CHIKV seroprevalence rates varied from 0% to 1.42%. Furthermore, we estimate that 2.8% (95% CI: 2.2–3.4%) of the population was infected by MAYV (number of seropositive individuals: 7263; 95% CI: 5764–8868 in a population of 258,000). Highest seroprevalences were observed in sparsely populated high Oyapock/Interior region (&lt;1% of French Guiana population), in agreement with previous studies which found high MAYV seroprevalence in this region

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. A majority of infections inferred by the model (68%) came from the Maroni region (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) where 10.0% (95% CI: 7.6–12.6%) of the 49,169 inhabitants have been infected, and the annual probability of infection is 0.45% (95% CrI: 0.35–0.56) – or 223 (95% CrI: 175–271) new infections per year (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). These results show that MAYV transmission is higher in remote forested areas of French Guiana and are consistent with a sylvatic transmission of MAYV. We also found individuals with historical infections of MAYV in the urban regions characterized by low MAYV transmission. However, from our serological data, it is not possible to determine whether these infections occurred in these regions or during travel to other areas.
