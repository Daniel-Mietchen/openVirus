<p id="Par12">Had we inferred infections with a simple optimized cut-off, cross-reactivity with CHIKV would have led to overestimating the number of historical MAYV infections by almost 100% (estimated number of infections: 13,838 compared to 7263 with our model-based classification) and would have wrongly indicated a recent, urban outbreak (Methods section Analysis with a single cutoff). For MAYV, our best fitting model had a constant risk of infection over time, with the individual risk of infection increasing with age. As cross-sectional serological surveys do not allow us to distinguish between variations in age and in time, this result could be equally explained by larger rates of infection in the past and no difference in exposure between children and adults. However, there is evidence of ongoing MAYV transmission in French Guiana
