<p id="Par6">We find that almost all participants with a MAYV RFI signal also exhibit a signal for CHIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In the absence of a good understanding of the antibody response following exposure and of cross-reactivity, we cannot reliably estimate the proportion of participants historically infected by MAYV from such laboratory results alone. If an increase in MAYV RFI was solely due to cross-reactivity with CHIKV, MAYV RFI should be roughly proportional to CHIKV RFI in each region of French Guiana. However, we observe important differences between regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). For example, while the average MAYV RFI is much lower than the average CHIKV RFI in Cayenne, it is higher in High Oyapock among participants aged &gt;20 years old (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We hypothesize that the true level of circulation of each virus and the level of cross-reactivity can be identified if we integrate in our analysis the fact that individuals with shared characteristics—age, region, sex, housing, and income—tend to have correlated risks of historic infection. Our approach jointly estimates the location-specific annual force of infection (FOI, per capita rate at which a susceptible individual gets infected) for MAYV and CHIKV modulated by pathogen-specific socio-demographic factors, and how RFIs change to both the infecting and non-infecting virus following infection (see Methods). In a simulation study, we find that our approach is able to reliably estimate model parameters and reconstruct viral circulation histories (See Supplementary Tables
