<p id="Par7">Using this integrative analytical framework, we estimate that MAYV RFI increases on the log scale by 2.2 (95% credible interval (CrI): 2.1 –2.3) for an individual historically infected with MAYV and by 0.22 (95% CrI: 0.20–0.23) after a CHIKV infection while CHIKV RFI increases by 1.05 (95% CrI: 1.01–1.1) after a MAYV infection and by 3.64 (95% CrI: 3.60–3.67) after a CHIKV infection (Tab S4).</p>
