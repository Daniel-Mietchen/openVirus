<p id="Par8">In addition to cross-reactivity, our model assesses the history of circulation and infection risk factors for each virus. For MAYV, our best fitting model (see Methods section Alternative models of virus circulation and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) assumes that the force of infection for MAYV has remained stable over time, with important regional variations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). At any point in time, we find that males are 1.9 (95% CrI: 1.3–2.7) times as likely to be infected by MAYV than females, and adults are 5.1 (95% CrI: 2.2–10.5) times as likely to be infected than children (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Living in a carbet (typical Native American cabin without walls) is a risk factor for MAYV infection (OR: 1.4, 95% CrI: 0.8–2.3). These estimates support the scenario of a sylvatic transmission cycle for MAYV where most infections occur near the natural reservoir in rural areas and where individuals more likely to go to the forest (i.e., adult males) are also at higher risk of infection.
