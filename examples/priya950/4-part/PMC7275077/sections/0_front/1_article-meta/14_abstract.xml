 <p id="Par2">Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus, but cross-reactivity with other alphaviruses makes analysis of its epidemiology difficult. Here, the authors develop an analytical framework to assess MAYV epidemiology and find evidence for an important sylvatic cycle and seroprevalences of up to 18% in some areas of French Guiana.</p>
