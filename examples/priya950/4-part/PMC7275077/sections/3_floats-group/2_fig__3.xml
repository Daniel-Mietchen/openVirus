  <title>Classification of MAYV and CHIKV infections.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Graphical representation of the model-based classification that determines the infection status for MAYV and CHIKV from the measured MAYV and CHIKV RFIs. For a classification with a simple cut-off, MAYV positive samples would lie on the right of the dashed purple curve, and CHIKV positive samples above the orange curve. The boundaries were plotted considering a probability of MAYV infection of 5% and CHIKV infection of 20% (see Supplementary Fig.Â 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> for a sensitivity analysis where the infection probabilities are changed). 
   <bold>b</bold> Contingency tables comparing the simple cutoff and the model-based classifications using the seroneutralization assay (performed on 100 individuals) as a reference.
