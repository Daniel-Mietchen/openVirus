  <title>Model estimates of the determinants of infection.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Best model fit of the yearly probability of infection by MAYV (purple) and CHIKV (orange) of an adult male in the different regions of French Guiana. Solid lines indicate the mean probability of infection and envelopes the 95% credible intervals. 
   <bold>b</bold> Relative risk of MAYV (purple) and CHIKV (orange) infection of individuals above 20 years old (relative to younger individuals), low income (relative to high income), males (relative to females), living in a rural area (relative to an urban area), and living in a carbet (jungle housing) relative to other types of habitations. Data are presented as the mean posterior with error bars denoting 95% credible intervals and the dashed line represents a relative risk of 1.
