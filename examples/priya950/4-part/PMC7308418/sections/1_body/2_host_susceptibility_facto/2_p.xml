<p>There are susceptibility studies that indicate that several individuals are resistant to HuNoV infection (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). The HBGA generation is mediated by the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), which is encoded by the 
 <italic>fut2</italic> gene. Individuals who present this functional gene are called secretors and are susceptible to HuNoV infection. In contrast, those who do not have this functional gene are called non-secretors and are resistant to HuNoV infection (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). HBGA, as a pivotal factor in the susceptibility of individuals to virus infection, has also been reported in other enteric viruses such as rotavirus. Indeed it has been shown that secretor-positive (FUT2+) individuals are 26.6 times more likely to be infected by rotavirus than non-secretor individuals (
