<p>The first link between HBGA variability and HuNoV infection was suggested from clinical studies of volunteers infected with NV (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>), in which it was shown that the virus recognizes a determined group of HBGAs (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). There are at least four specific binding patterns of HuNoV strains based on the ABO, secretor, and Lewis blood types of saliva donors (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Moreover, the HuNoV-specific binding patterns to HBGAs can be classified into two important groups according to their interactions with human HBGA (A/B, H, and Lewis) (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>): (i) HuNoVs that have HBGA type A/B binding patterns recognize the A and/or B and H antigens, but not the Lewis antigens; and (ii) HuNoVs that have Lewis binding patterns bind only to Lewis antigens and/or the H antigen (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). It is important to note that HuNoVs that exhibit identical, related, or closely binding patterns tend to cluster together (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, it has been shown that HBGA binding patterns play an important role in the evolution of HuNoV.
