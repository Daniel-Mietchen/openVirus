<p>The recognition and binding of HuNoVs to HBGAs has been described as the primordial step that precedes the entry of a viral particle into the cell (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). HBGAs are polymorphic glucans found on the cell surface of red blood cells or the epithelial cells of some tissues (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). In HuNoV, the HBGA binding sites are specifically located in the P2 subdomain of the P domain of VP1, which is highly variable (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The variability of this binding site is found across the different norovirus genogroups. This is due to the fact that each HuNoV genogroup/genotype binds to different HBGAs (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Additionally, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown that the interaction of HuNoV with HBGA is of low affinity and does not induce a significant structural rearrangement in VP1 (
