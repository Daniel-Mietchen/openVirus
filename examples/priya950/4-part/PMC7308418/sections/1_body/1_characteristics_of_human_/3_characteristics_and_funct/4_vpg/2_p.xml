<p>It has been described that the HuNoV GII.4 ProPol form can nucleotidylate the VPg protein at tyrosine residue number 27 in the presence of Mn
 <sup>+2</sup>, resulting in the binding of VPg to the viral RNA, thus facilitating the HuNoV genome replication by acting as a primer in viral RNA synthesis, which is mediated by the RdRp (
