<p>p22, also called p20 (NS4), when excised from the polyprotein by the viral protease, results in a mature NS protein of 20–22 kDa, depending on the genogroup (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The evolutionary rate of the genomic region that encodes the p22 protein of the strain GII.P4 Den Haag 2006b of HuNoV is ~8.21 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, which is higher than the evolutionary rate determined for the complete genome, being one of the most variable genomic regions of this strain (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).
