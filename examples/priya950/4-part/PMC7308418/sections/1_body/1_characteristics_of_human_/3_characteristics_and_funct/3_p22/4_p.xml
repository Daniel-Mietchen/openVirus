<p>Remarkably, HuNoV p22 is very similar to picornavirus 3A and MNV p22 proteins, sharing with them some characteristics (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). HuNoV p22, like its picornavirus 3A and MNV counterparts, participates in the induction of trans-Golgi network dismantling, although the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Also, it has been reported that p22 has the following activities: (1) it acts as an antagonist in Golgi-dependent protein secretion (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, the HuNoV p22 protein could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and the replication of these viruses by disrupting the normal functions of the host cell and the activation of the immune response. Besides that, it promotes the replicative viral complex assembly.
