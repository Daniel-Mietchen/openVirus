<p>The NTPase protein, also denoted as NS3, is cleaved by the viral protease at the 331 and 696 aa of the polyprotein, resulting in a mature protein with a length of 366 aa and a molecular weight of 40 kDa (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). It has been estimated that the evolutionary rate of the NS3 protein from a collection of HuNoV GII.4 genomic sequences is ~5.41 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The NTPase activity of this protein was described in a study where the protein was expressed and purified from the Southampton virus (SHV) belonging to genogroup 1 (GI) of the 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic> genus, determining that this protein can bind to nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) and hydrolyze them (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Also, a comparative analysis of the sequence of the NTPase protein of SHV with the NV NTPase protein and the Enterovirus 2C protein determined regions with high homology, suggesting a functional relationship between the HuNoV NTPase protein and the 2C protein of Enterovirus (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, NV NTPase possesses fundamental enzymatic activities that play a significant role in viral replication, such as (a) NTP-dependent helicase activity for unrolling of RNA helices, (b) NTP-independent chaperone activity for remodeling of the RNA structure and facilitating the annealing of the RNA chains, and (c) collaboration in RNA synthesis carried out by NS7 (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Significantly, the subcellular localization of the GII.4 NTPase protein was determined through a confocal immunofluorescence analysis in human melanoma A7 cells, determining that this protein can form vesicular and non-vesicular structures in the cell cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Besides that, the non-vesicular form of NTPase can be located in the ER or the membrane of the cellular mitochondria. The amino acid 179 of the N-terminal region is necessary for the formation and the localization of vesicles in the ER (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). On the other hand, for mitochondrial localization, the NTPase C-terminal region of GII plays a significant role, even when the N-terminal NTPase region is completely removed (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). However, this activity is not observed in the GI viruses (NV); thus, the NTPase mitochondrial location differs between HuNoV genogroups (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that HuNoV GII.4 NTPase locates in different cell membrane compartments in the cellular secretory pathway and that it is associated with the storage of intracellular lipids (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Notably, the NTPase function can be improved by other NS proteins such as p48 and p22. Indeed the co-expression of these proteins with NTPase enhances the apoptotic activity induced by the HuNoV NTPase (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Thus, the HuNoV NTPase protein could play a significant role in the replication and the pathogenesis of the virus.
