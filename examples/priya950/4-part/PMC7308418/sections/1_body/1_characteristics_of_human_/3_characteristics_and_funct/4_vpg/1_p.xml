<p>The HuNoV VPg (NS5) genome-linked protein is the NS protein that is covalently linked to the 5′ end of the viral RNA genome. VPg is cleaved by the HuNoV protease at residues 876 and 1,008 of the polyprotein, resulting in a mature 132-aa protein with a molecular weight of 15.8 kDa (MD145-12 GII. 4) (
