<p>The subdomain P1 is constituted by residues 226–278 and 406–520 of the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In contrast, the P2 subdomain is constituted by residues 278–406 of the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain, with a length of 127 amino acids (aa), which is inserted in the P1 domain (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The most variable region of the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain is the subdomain P2, which is extended from the 
 <italic>S</italic> domain to the outside of the capsid and is located in the middle part of the structural protein VP1 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In a study of HuNoV VP1, the sequence diversity in the P2 region was determined by sequence analysis techniques and homology models using the amino acid sequences of the GII.4 VP1 protein. The results of this study indicated that two sites within the P2 region appear to be involved in the generation of variants associated with epidemics due to the presence of amino acid substitutions. Moreover, these sites are exposed on the surface of the viral capsid, suggesting that the P2 region could exhibit specific epitopes of each GII.4 variant (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). VP1 is the target protein for antibodies directed to the 
 <italic>S</italic> and the 
 <italic>P</italic> domains (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), the P2 subdomain being the region with the highest exposure of the viral particle, which allows its interaction with the HBGAs and with possible neutralizers (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).
