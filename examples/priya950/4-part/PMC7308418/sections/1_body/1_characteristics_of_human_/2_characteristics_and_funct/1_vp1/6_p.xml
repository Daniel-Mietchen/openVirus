<p>The amino acid sequence of the VP1 protein is used to genetically group HuNoVs as follows: those with differences &lt;14.3% are classified in the same strain, those with differences between 14.3 and 43.8% are classified in the same genotype, and those with differences between 45 and 61.4% are classified in the same genogroup (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The GII.4 genotype is the most prevalent HuNoV in the world and the one with the greatest variability, with emerging new variants of it every 2â€“5 years, due to changes in its antigenicity and alterations in ligand binding patterns (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Indeed the escape of herd immunity is promoted when these changes in viral antigenicity are generated, resulting in new HuNoV outbreaks in the population (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Various mechanisms to explain the variability of HuNoVs have been proposed, among which stands out the changes in antigenicity, specifically in the subdomain P2 of the VP1, due to the strong selective pressure that this subdomain undergoes when presenting antigenic epitopes and receptor-binding regions of the host (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and the homologous recombination in the ORF1/ORF2 overlap region, generating intergenotype, and intragenotype recombinants (
