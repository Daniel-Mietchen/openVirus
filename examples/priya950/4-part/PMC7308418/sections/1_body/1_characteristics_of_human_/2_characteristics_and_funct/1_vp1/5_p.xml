<p>Interestingly, NV VP1 can self-assemble, forming VLPs of similar size and appearance with the native structure of the virus capsid by expressing it in insect cells, using the baculovirus system (

However, only 1.4–6.8% of the VLPs were internalized in the tested cells. Besides that, the monoclonal antibody NV8812 exhibited the ability to block the binding of NV VLPs to those cells. This antibody specifically binds to the C-terminal region at residues 300–384 of NV VP1, suggesting that this region could be involved in VLP–cell binding (
