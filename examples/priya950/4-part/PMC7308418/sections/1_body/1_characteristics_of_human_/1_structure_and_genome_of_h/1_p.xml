<p>The first sequenced genome of HuNoV was the one of the Norwalk Virus (NV), belonging to genogroup I (GI), in the early 1990's. The HuNoV genome is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+), with 7.5–7.7 kb covalently bound to a non-structural (NS) protein, called viral protein genome-linked (VPg), at the 5′ end and polyadenylated at the 3′ end (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The HuNoV genome contains three open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein with a molecular weight of 200 kDa (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which is composed of six NS proteins. Starting from the 5′ end, these NS proteins are p48, nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPase), p22, VPg, protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Likewise, ORF2 encodes the major structural protein of the viral capsid VP1, and ORF3 encodes the minor structural protein of the capsid VP2 (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The structural and the genomic characteristics of HuNoV are displayed in
