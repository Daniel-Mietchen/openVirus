<p>Two main cell pathways of the innate immune system are raised against RNA viruses such as HuNoV, the type I and III interferon (IFN) systems controlling viral replication (

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Particularly, RNA viruses are mainly detected by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include the TLR and the RIG-I like receptor (RLR) family members. TLR3 is localized in the intracellular compartment in macrophages, B lymphocytes, and cDCs and it has been characterized as one of the principal sensors of RNA viruses (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). RIG-I and MDA5, which belong to the RLR family, are likewise cytoplasmic sensors that detect intracellular RNA viruses. Current understanding indicates that TLR3 recognizes any dsRNA in the endosome compartments, while MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA and RIG-I senses triphosphate containing dsRNA in the cytoplasm (
