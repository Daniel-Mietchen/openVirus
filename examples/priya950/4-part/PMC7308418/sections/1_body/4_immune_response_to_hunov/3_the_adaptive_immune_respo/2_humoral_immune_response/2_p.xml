<p>In general, it is not clearly defined whether serum antibody levels against HuNoV are correlated with protection against future infections by these viruses. Several studies in the literature indicate that high levels of serum antibodies against NV in adults correlate with protection against future infections by this virus (GI.1 genotype) (

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Likewise, the results of other studies, conducted in adult volunteers, revealed that the presence of high serum or fecal titers of specific antibodies for NV before infection decreased the probability of becoming infected by this virus, compared to the case of volunteers with low titers of pre-existing antibodies (

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). Additionally, in children, high serum antibody levels appear to be correlated with protection, possibly due to a short-term immunity and recent exposures to these viruses (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). However, in a challenge study carried out with early re-exposure to NV, 50% of the volunteers infected with this HuNoV had repeated infections after 3 years compared to the other 50% who remained without infection during and after repeated challenges (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). The problem of this study was that it could not be demonstrated whether these volunteers were exempt from disease due to acquired immunity or their genetic resistance traits to the virus. Nevertheless, these evidences suggest that frequent exposure to HuNoV can stimulate resistance to HuNoV-induced diseases (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). One possible mechanism behind these observations is that multiple exposures to HuNoV may also induce IgA antibody production, which is known to play a role in short-term immune protection against viruses (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). In support of this notion, it has also been shown that mucosal IgA is produced in the small intestine tissues of NV-infected volunteers (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanism behind the short-term immunity to HuNoV.
