<p>In summary, the immune response induced by HuNoVs, which are rapidly evolving RNA viruses, has been difficult to achieve. Indeed the ability of these viruses to mutate, in key residues of immunodominant epitopes over time, suggests an evolution of the viral capsid, allowing HuNoVs not only to escape from the immune response of the host's adaptive immune response but also to adapt their binding to any of the HBGAs. A full understanding of the humoral and the cellular immune responses to HuNoV still remains to be elucidated.</p>
