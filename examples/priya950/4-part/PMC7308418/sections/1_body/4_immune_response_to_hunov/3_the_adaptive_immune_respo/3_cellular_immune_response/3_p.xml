<p>Moreover, significant increases of IFN-γ (Th1 cytokine) have also been reported in serum samples from volunteers challenged with the Snow Mountain Virus (SMV) and the GII reference strain (GII.2-1976) or in fecal samples from travelers with HuNoV gastroenteritis (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Particularly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers challenged with the SMV had a significant rise of IFN-γ production after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the same HuNoV VLP (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). A smaller, but significant, increase above the pre-challenge titer was also detected for IL-2 (Th1 cytokine) and IL-5 (Th2 cytokine). In contrast, significant changes between pre-challenge and post-challenge PBMC secretion of TNF-α, IL-10, or IL-4 were not detected, suggesting a predominant, but not exclusive, Th1 cellular immune response to GII HuNoV challenge (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Also, these investigators aimed to identify the cellular source of the Th1 cytokines produced in response to the SMV challenge and found that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells were the primary source of IFN-γ secretion in PBMCs stimulated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with SMV VLPs. Similarly, the cellular immune response to GI HuNoV was also studied (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Specifically, PBMCs from six out of 10 NV (GI.1-1968 strain)-infected volunteers, after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> VLP stimulation with different homologous or heterologous GI strains (GI.1-1968, GI.1-2001, GI.2-1999, GI.3-1999, and GI.4-2000), had a significant increase of IFN-γ secretion to at least one GI VLP stimulation. Interestingly, the cellular immune response was found to be preferentially targeting an alternative GI VLP rather than the infecting strain (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). These data suggest that a Th1 response is mounted against homologous and heterologous GI HuNoV strains.
