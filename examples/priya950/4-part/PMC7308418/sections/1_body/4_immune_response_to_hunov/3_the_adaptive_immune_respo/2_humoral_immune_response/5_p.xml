<p>In summary, humoral protection after HuNoV infection has very complex patterns of heterotypic immune responses. To date, no study has demonstrated that the presence of high cross-reactivity and cross-blockade activities in the serum of HuNoV-infected individuals guarantees long-term protection against future infections by these viruses, most likely due to the rapid molecular evolution of the HuNoV capsid gene.</p>
