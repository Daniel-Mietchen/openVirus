<p>There are no commercial vaccines or specific antivirals available to prevent HuNoV infections. The fact that there is no availability of small animal models that emulate the human disease so as to perform pre-clinical studies makes even more difficult the development of vaccines or preventive therapies against these viruses. Recently, there had been 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture models developed for the replication of different HuNoV strains, specifically GII.4-Sydney HuNoV replicates in human B cells (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, GII.3 and different GII.4 variants replicate in human intestinal enteroid monolayer cultures (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Most recently, an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication model for GI and GII HuNoV genogroups in zebrafish larvae has also been developed (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Nevertheless, limited information regarding the viral replication cycle and the immune response against HuNoV is available. Knowledge in these areas will allow a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and the design of efficient strategies to develop a safe vaccine against these fastidious enteric viruses (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In this review, we examine recent information on the functions of the HuNoV structural and non-structural proteins and their role in the viral replicative cycle and pathogenesis, as well as insights of the host immune response against these viruses.
