<p>The structural protein VP1 is one of the most relevant HuNoV proteins because the P domain, specifically the P2 subdomain, is very variable and has a higher selective pressure, constantly inducing mutations to avoid the host's immune response. Due to these variations, this protein is used for the classification of HuNoV genogroups and genotypes. Also, in the P2 subdomain, there are sites for cell-binding receptors and co-receptors, such as the HBGA and bile acids. In contrast, protein VP2 acts as a stabilizer of the viral capsid and, during viral replication, it enhances the expression of VP1 protein and modulates the activity of RdRp along with VP1 and p48 proteins.</p>
