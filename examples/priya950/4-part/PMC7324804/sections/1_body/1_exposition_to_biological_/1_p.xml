<p id="Par4">It is consensual that biological agents are microorganisms, including genetically modified, human cell cultures and endoparasites that may cause infection, allergies or toxicity. Although the term biological agent is very comprehensive universally, when addressing the theme “biological risk” attention focuses on the following elements: bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. These pathogens can be transmitted from a variety of sources: human, animals and environmental sources and can be acquired through inhalation, ingestion, skin and mucous membranes and the placenta. Humans have a variety of bacterial, fungal and viral infections that are transmitted from person to person through body fluids (hepatitis through a needle stick, as an example), secretions (tuberculosis through sneezing or coughing) and cross-contamination on surfaces (influenza virus, through touch on the nose and subsequent contamination of surfaces). From animal sources, occur severe infections of fungal, bacterial and viral origin, which are transmitted through contact with animals (animal-to-person) (e.g. rabies and leptospirosis) named zoonosis. From environmental sources (e.g. water, soil, air) and related to exposure to biological agents’ diseases such as Legionnaire’s, dust mites’ allergies, etc. can be transmitted. The transmission and infection pathways are identified and the basic mechanism of infection is through the direct passage from the reservoir to the host, the prevention involves cutting the chain of transmission.</p>
