<p id="Par15">The state of knowledge about biological risks in work environments is still relatively immature. Publication 
 <italic>bias</italic>, a large number of confounding factors and the lack of harmonization of methodologies to research and count biological agents is notorious. This brings another problem to the occupational health professionals in addition to the nonexistence of exposure limit values for biological agents. Since the presence of gram-negative bacteria is the most health-relevant concern due to the presence of endotoxins, the detected bacteria should also be categorized according to gram stain and their antimicrobial resistance evaluated when appropriate. In conclusion there is a need to develop uniform and concise guidance on risk assessment of biological risks (e.g. sampling, harmonization of methodologies for analysis of biological agents). The list of classifications of biological agents should be reevaluated and the information on the dose-effect would also help to establish occupational exposure limits at least for the most common microorganisms.
