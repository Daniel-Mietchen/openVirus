<p>In the present study, we established a simple event-associated algorithm including blood lactate level and ARDS for timely detection of critically ill influenza patients who are at greater risk of mortality. Notably, critically ill influenza patients without ARDS but with a blood lactate concentration of 3.7 mmol/L had an in-hospital mortality of 47.1%, and more importantly, the mortality rate increased to 75% for those with high blood lactate (â‰¥3.7 mmol/L) and those that developed ARDS. In contrast, only 7.7% of critically ill influenza patients without ARDS and with normal blood lactate levels died. Considering the high mortality rate among critically ill influenza patients, this event-based algorithm could aid in the timely decision-making process and provision of prompt intensive care for patients with potentially fatal outcomes, particularly in resource-limited areas; some key laboratory tests such as blood lactate might be of greater value than others when allocating limited healthcare resources.</p>
