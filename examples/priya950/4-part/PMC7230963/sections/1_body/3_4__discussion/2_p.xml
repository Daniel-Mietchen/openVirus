<p>High blood lactate levels indicate tissue hypoxia due to increased lactate generation via anaerobic glycolysis [

 <xref rid="B24-jcm-09-01073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, high blood lactate levels were found to be significantly and independently associated with fatal outcomes in critically ill influenza patients. In addition, nonsurvivors had a significantly higher prevalence of acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding and received ECMO treatment in our series. Importantly, acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding have been shown to be independent risk factors of mortality. We believe that these complications are caused by cliniciansâ€™ lack of awareness of early detection of organ hypoperfusion. As patients in early phases of hypoperfusion do not always show obvious clinical signs, blood lactate level may be an important marker for this disorder. Thus, timely recognition of organ hypoperfusion and initiation of effective volume replacement to reverse tissue hypoxia are critical steps in preventing mortality and morbidity. Notably, the median time interval from patient arrival to measurement of highest blood lactate was four days in nonsurvivors in our series. Further, the median time from illness onset to fatality was 18.5 days. This finding indicates that blood lactate levels can be a useful early marker assisting clinicians in predicting the outcomes in critically ill influenza patients.
