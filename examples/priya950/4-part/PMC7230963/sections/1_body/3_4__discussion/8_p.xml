 <xref rid="B35-jcm-09-01073" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was confirmed in two deceased influenza patients with high galactomannan index in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This finding emphasizes that clinicians should be aware of the risk of invasive aspergillosis in critically ill influenza patients, particularly immunocompromised patients or those receiving corticosteroids. Further studies are needed to understand the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in influenza patients.
