<p>In our study, bacteremia was detected in 17 critically ill adult patients. Importantly, five of them acquired bacteremia within 48 h after hospitalization, and in three cases, the infection was caused by

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was the most frequently isolated bacterium, which contributed to the death rate in the current pandemic [
