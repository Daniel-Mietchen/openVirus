<p>ARDS is a lethal complication of influenza infection [

The present study results are consistent with previous findings wherein 97% of critically ill influenza patients developed acute respiratory failure with a median time of four days between illness onset and respiratory failure, and 51% of them subsequently developed ARDS during their clinical course. In addition, approximately one-third of the patients with influenza-associated ARDS required ECMO for profound hypoxemic respiratory failure. Our study highlights that severe oxygenation failure occurred rapidly after hospital admission and that clinicians should not delay delivering appropriate rescue therapies as well as deploying ICU resources to meet this treatment requirement, particularly during the influenza epidemic.
