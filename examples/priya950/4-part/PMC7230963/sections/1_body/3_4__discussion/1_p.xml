<p>In a study involving 444 adult patients with influenza in hospitals in the United States, the mortality rate was 20.9% [

However, which variables can predict poor patient outcomes after influenza virus infection remain to be elucidated. In the present study, our dataset included clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory results at presentation and the entire course of hospitalization as well as complications during the clinical course. We determined which demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were associated with death that could help clinicians deliver timely and sufficient treatment to critically ill influenza patients. Our results underscore that high blood lactate levels during hospitalization, ARDS, acute kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding were independent risk factors of mortality in critically ill influenza patients.
