<p>Previous studies have shown that early administration of an antiviral agent is associated with a shorter duration and reduced severity of illness [

In our study, the median time from illness onset to hospital presentation was three days and more than two-thirds of the patients received delayed (48 h after illness onset) antiviral treatment. Although the provision of antiviral therapy between survivors and nonsurvivors did not differ significantly in our series, the importance of early treatment with antivirals in critically ill influenza patients cannot be overemphasized.
