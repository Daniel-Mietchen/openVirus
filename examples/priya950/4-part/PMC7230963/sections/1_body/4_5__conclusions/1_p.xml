<p>We identified clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality that could aid in the prediction of the poor outcomes in hospitalized critically ill influenza patients, as timely intensive supportive care might be lifesaving. Medical services and ICUs can be overwhelmed during the peak of influenza epidemics, particularly in point-of-care resource-limited areas. Our findings could substantially assist with allocation of resources in the selection of the main key clinical data in primary care at the initial clinical evaluation of critically ill influenza patients.</p>
