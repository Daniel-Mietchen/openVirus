<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated for the treatment of refractory hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both, which occurred despite invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen (median age 58 years; range, 24–65) patients with severe influenza-associated ARDS were treated with ECMO, of whom 15 (88.2%) patients had influenza A virus and 2 (11.7%) had influenza B virus infection. The median duration of ECMO support was nine (range, 9–25) days. Of the 17 patients with influenza-associated ARDS who received ECMO treatment, 12 (70.5%) died. In the 12 patients who died, acute kidney injury (

 <italic>n</italic> = 4), pneumothorax (
