<p>Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay. Upon hospital admission, elevation of myoglobin and creatine kinase–MB isoenzyme levels was significantly associated with mortality. Moreover, a significantly higher white blood cell count and high creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, C–reactive protein, myoglobin, creatine kinase–MB isoenzyme, and lactate concentrations, in addition to lower platelet count during the course of hospitalization, were reported in nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors received ECMO treatment and had a significantly higher incidence of acute kidney injury, pneumothorax, ARDS, and gastrointestinal bleeding than survivors. Multivariate analysis showed that high lactate level during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.041; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.019–1.064;
