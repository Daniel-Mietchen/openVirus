<p>The median highest lactate values (reference value &lt;2.1 mmol/L) and median time from presentation to the highest lactate level among survivors and nonsurvivors were 2.7 mmol/L and 4.3 mmol/L and three days and four days, respectively. We selected the lactate variable in multivariate analyses and plotted the ROC curve to identify the optimal cutoff value for predicting mortality. The optimal cutoff of lactate level for predicting mortality was 3.7 mmol/L with an area under curve of 0.728, and the sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff were estimated at 63.9% and 74.1%, respectively (
