<p>To analyze the predictors of mortality among critically ill influenza patients, we initially compared demographic, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings as well as complications of survivors and nonsurvivors using Fisherâ€™s exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test for numerical variables. The differences were considered significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Significant variables in the univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of mortality in critically ill influenza patients. We used receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) to select cutoff points for independent numerical predictors according to visual assessment of the highest sensitivity and specificity. We then created an event-based algorithm as a simple predictive tool using 2 variables with statistically significant associations with mortality (
 <italic>p</italic> value less than or equal to 0.001) in the multivariate model. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences statistical software (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
