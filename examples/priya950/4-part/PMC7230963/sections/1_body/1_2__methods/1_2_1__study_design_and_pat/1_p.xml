<p>We retrospectively studied all critically ill adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection admitted between 2015 and 2018, at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a 2700-bed primary care and tertiary referral medical center that included 5 adult medical and 4 surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan. Included critically ill influenza patients were those admitted to an ICU, or those with complications of lower respiratory tract infection and/or multiorgan failure, or those requiring mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Individuals were excluded from the study if they are &lt;18 years of age; if they are treated as outpatients; or if they had mild flu-like symptoms. Confirmation of influenza virus infection required a positive finding in the respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal swab and/or pharyngeal swab) by one or more of the following methods: rapid influenza diagnostic test (Formosa One Sure Flu A/B Rapid Test Kit), isolation of the virus in tissue-cell culture (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line), or reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (QiAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit; TAIGEN Bioscience Corporation, Taiwan). The choice of diagnostic test (rapid influenza diagnostic test, virus isolation or RT-PCR) for confirming influenza was based on the individual physicians’ judgment.</p>
