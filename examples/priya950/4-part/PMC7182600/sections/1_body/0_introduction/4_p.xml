<p>During the 2017‐2018 influenza season, influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic (A/H1N1pdm), A/H3N2, and B viruses co‐circulated in Japan.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Notably, in Japan, the influenza B epidemic of this season was larger than that of the previous nine seasons. Here, we examined the genetic and antigenic properties of the influenza B viruses isolated in Japan during the winter season. In addition, we characterized the influenza B viruses isolated in Japan during the 2018‐2019 season, even though influenza B viruses circulated at a lower level in this season compared with the previous season.
