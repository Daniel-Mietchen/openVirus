<p>Oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and laninamivir were kindly provided by Daiichi Sankyo Inc, Tokyo, Japan. Zanamivir was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK. In vitro NA activity of viruses was determined as described previously.

 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Briefly, 2′‐(4‐methylumbelliferyl)‐α‐D‐N‐acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma, St Louis, Mo) at a final concentration of 0.1 mmol/L was used as a fluorescent substrate. Dilutions of viruses containing NA activity equivalent to 800‐1200 fluorescence units were used in this study. Ten microliters of the diluted viruses and 10 µL of the neuraminidase inhibitor (0.01 nmol/L to 10 µmol/L) in calcium‐MES buffer (33 mmol/L 2‐[N‐morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid, 4 mmol/L CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 6.0) were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of 30 µL of the substrate. The mixtures were further incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, and the reaction was stopped by adding 150 µL of 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide in 80% ethanol (pH 10.0). The fluorescence of the solution was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. The relationship between the concentration of inhibitor and the percentage of fluorescence inhibition was determined, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values were obtained by extrapolating those findings. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated according to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> analysis protocol provided by the Health Protection Agency, London, UK.
