<p>Six‐ to seven‐month‐old female ferrets (Wuxi Sangosho Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) were used in this study. Ferrets were anesthetized intramuscularly with ketamine and xylazine (5‐30 mg and 0.2‐6 mg/kg of body weight, respectively) and inoculated intranasally with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU (0.5 mL) of B/Yokohama/5/2004, B/Brisbane/60/2008, B/Wisconsin/01/2010, B/Massachusetts/02/2012, B/Phuket/3073/2013, B/Texas/02/2013, or B/Colorado/06/2017. These ferrets did not receive a booster immunization. Serum samples were collected and subjected to the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. All experiments with ferrets were performed in accordance with the University of Tokyo's Regulations for Animal Care and Use and were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo.
