<p>NA inhibitor‐sensitive and NA inhibitor‐resistant control viruses were generated by using a plasmid‐based reverse genetics system as previously described.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> In brief, plasmids encoding the complementary DNAs for the eight viral RNA segments under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the mouse RNA polymerase I terminator (referred to as PolI plasmids), and plasmids for the expression of the viral PB2, PB1, PA, and nucleoprotein proteins derived from influenza B virus strain B/Yamagata/1/73, under the control of the chicken β‐actin promoter,

At 48‐hours post‐transfection, culture supernatants were collected and inoculated to MDCK cells for virus propagation. All virus stocks were sequenced to confirm the absence of unwanted mutations.
