<p>Ferret sera were treated with receptor‐destroying enzyme (RDE II; Denka Seiken Co., Ltd) at 37°C for 20 hours, followed by RDE inactivation at 56°C for 30‐60 minutes. The treated sera were serially diluted twofold with PBS in 96‐well U‐bottom microtiter plates and mixed with the amount of virus equivalent to four hemagglutination units, followed by incubation at room temperature (25°C) for 60 minutes. After addition of 50 µL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells, the mixtures were gently mixed and incubated at 4°C for a further 45 minutes. HI titers are expressed as the inverse of the highest antibody dilution that inhibited hemagglutination.</p>
