<p>Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell culture supernatant by using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse‐transcribed to cDNA by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Uni9/FluB1 primer.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> PCR was performed with primers specific for the HA or NA genes of influenza B virus. The PCR products were purified and directly sequenced by using BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and were then analyzed on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A list of the primers and probes used is provided in Table
