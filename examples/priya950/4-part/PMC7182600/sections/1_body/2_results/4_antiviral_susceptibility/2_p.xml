<p>To monitor the susceptibility of influenza B viruses to NA inhibitors in Japan during the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 seasons, the nucleotide sequences of the NA segments of the 68 isolates were determined by means of Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed no mutations known to confer resistance to NA inhibitors in the influenza B isolates, except for one B/Yamagata‐lineage isolate (B/Tokyo/UT‐AC032/2018) that possessed a G407S mutation in its NA.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> A fluorescence NA inhibition assay with the MUNANA substrate was used to characterize the susceptibility of B/Tokyo/UT‐AC032/2018 virus to oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The isolate showed a marked reduction in susceptibility to peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir (64‐, 167‐, and 204‐fold increases in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, respectively, compared with a drug‐susceptible control virus, a recombinant virus possessing the HA and NA genes from B/Phuket/3073/2013). This isolate also exhibited moderately reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate (eightfold).
