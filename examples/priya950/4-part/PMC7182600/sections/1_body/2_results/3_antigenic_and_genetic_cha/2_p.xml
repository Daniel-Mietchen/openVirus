<p>Recent B/Yamagata‐lineage viruses have been classified into two distinct genetic clades based on the phylogenetic characterization of the HA gene: clade 2 and clade 3, represented by the vaccine reference strains B/Massachusetts/2/2012 and B/Wisconsin/01/2010, respectively.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> In contrast, recent B/Victoria‐lineage viruses belong to clade 1A, which is represented by the vaccine reference strain B/Brisbane/60/2008. To determine the HA gene clade of the 68 influenza B viruses isolated in Japan during the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 seasons, we performed phylogenetic analysis of their HA genes together with those of other viruses from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database. Since the 2015‐2016 season, only quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing two influenza A virus strains (A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2) and two influenza B virus strains (B/Yamagata‐lineage and B/Victoria‐lineage viruses) have been used in Japan (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). This analysis showed that all 61 B/Yamagata‐lineage virus isolates fell into clade 3 along with the vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013, which was used in Japan for the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 seasons (Figure

 <xref rid="irv12713-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). The seven B/Victoria‐lineage isolates possessed HA genes that belonged to clade 1A along with the vaccine strains B/Texas/02/2013 (B/Brisbane/60/2008‐like virus) and B/Maryland/15/2016 (B/Colorado/06/2017‐like virus), which were used in Japan for the 2017‐2018 and the 2018‐2019 seasons, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12713-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). B/Colorado/06/2017 contains a two‐amino‐acid deletion at positions 162 and 163 in its HA. Two isolates of the 2017‐2018 season and two isolates of the 2018‐2019 season had this two‐amino‐acid deletion. The remaining three isolates of the 2018‐2019 season harbored a three‐amino‐acid deletion at positions 162‐164 of HA. B/Victoria‐lineage viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion fell into two distinct subgroups (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12713-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B): one subgroup shared an amino acid substitution at position K136E, and the other subgroup had two common amino acid substitutions at I180T and K209N. All three viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion that were isolated during the 2018‐2019 season in Japan belonged to the former subgroup.
