<p>To elucidate whether influenza B viruses isolated in Japan during the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 influenza seasons were antigenically related to the vaccine strains used for these two seasons in Japan, we performed an HI assay using post‐infection ferret antisera raised against cell culture‐propagated vaccine or vaccine‐related strains. For the B/Yamagata‐lineage viruses, all 11 isolates tested, which had amino acid substitutions in the globular head domain of their HA compared with the B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus, were readily recognized by the ferret antisera raised against the cell culture‐propagated vaccine viruses B/Wisconsin/01/2010 and B/Phuket/3073/2013 at titers within twofold of the homologous titer of these antisera and were less well recognized by the ferret antisera raised against the cell culture‐propagated vaccine virus B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (titers within twofold or fourfold of the homologous titer) (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, like the clade 3 reference viruses B/Wisconsin/01/2010 and B/Phuket/3073/2013, these 11 isolates were poorly recognized by the ferret antisera raised against cell culture‐propagated B/Yokohama/5/2004, which is genetically closely related to the vaccine virus B/Florida/4/2006, with titers 16‐ or 32‐fold lower than the homologous titer. These results indicate that all tested B/Yamagata‐lineage isolates were antigenically and genetically closely related to the vaccine strains B/Wisconsin/01/2010 and B/Phuket/3073/2013.
