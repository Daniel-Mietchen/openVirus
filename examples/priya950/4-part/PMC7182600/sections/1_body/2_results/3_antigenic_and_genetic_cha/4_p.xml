<p>For B/Victoria‐lineage viruses, all 7 isolates were subjected to an HI assay. All 7 of the tested isolates were poorly recognized by the ferret antiserum raised against the cell culture‐propagated vaccine strain B/Texas/02/2013, with titers eightfold or 16‐fold lower than the homologous titer of this antiserum (Tables 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). An antiserum raised against the cell culture‐propagated vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008 recognized the 7 isolates but at fourfold, eightfold, or 16‐fold reduced levels compared with the titers of the antiserum for the homologous virus. In contrast, antisera raised against cell culture‐propagated B/Colorado/06/2017 efficiently inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the four test viruses lacking two amino acids in their HAs, with titers similar to that of the homologous virus

These results indicate that the four test viruses with the two‐amino‐acid deletion are antigenically and genetically closely related to the vaccine virus B/Colorado/06/2017, but the remaining three test viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion may be antigenically different from the vaccine strain.
