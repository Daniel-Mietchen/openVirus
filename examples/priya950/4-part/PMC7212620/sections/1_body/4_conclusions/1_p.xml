 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Townsville and Innisfail in northern Australia are highly susceptible to infection with and able to transmit a contemporary epidemic strain of DENV2 but are much less susceptible to infection with a highly divergent and sylvatic DENV2, QML22, and, potentially, are unable to transmit it. Our findings support a conclusion that sylvatic DENV is unlikely to enter urban human-mosquito-human transmission cycles in Australia [
