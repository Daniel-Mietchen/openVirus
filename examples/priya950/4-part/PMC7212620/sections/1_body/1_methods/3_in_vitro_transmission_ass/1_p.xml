<p id="Par22">At 7, 10 and 14 days post-infection (dpi), female mosquitoes were anesthetized using CO
 <sub>2</sub> and placed in Petri dishes on ice. Legs and wings were removed, and their virus content used to determine the dissemination rate as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> transmission assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For each mosquito, the proboscis was placed in a capillary tube containing 20 µl of a 1:1 solution of 50% sucrose and FCS. After 30 min, the contents were expelled into 0.25 ml MD (MD, 2% v/v FCS in RPMI 1640, 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 µg/ml gentamycin, 2.5 µg/ml Amphotericin B, 10 mM HEPES) (Life Technologies). Mosquitoes were observed for abdominal contractions during the 30-min salivation period to confirm they had salivated. Those that did not appear to have salivated were discarded.
