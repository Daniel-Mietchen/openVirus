<p id="Par24">Virus stocks and virus in mosquito samples were titrated using a modification of the CCELISA procedure of Broom et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, virus stocks and samples were 10-fold serially diluted and inoculated onto monolayers of C6/36 cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and maintained at 30 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 7 days of incubation, cells were fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) for 1 h at 4 °C. Plates were air-dried and antigen was detected using a cocktail of anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatants (4G2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], at a ratio of 1:1:1), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP-) conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) (1:2000 in PBS-Tween). Antibodies bound to the cell monolayers were detected by the addition of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate System for Membranes (Sigma-Aldrich). The CCID
