<p id="Par26">Histological analysis of DENV infection within mosquitoes employed indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, mosquitoes with legs and wings removed were fixed in 4% v/v paraformaldehyde/0.5% v/v Triton X-100 for 12 h, dehydrated in xylol followed by a graded ethanol series, embedded in paraffin and 3–4 µM sections fixed to slides. Sections were incubated in Diva antibody retrieval solution (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) at 125 °C for 5 min in a Biocare Medical Decloaking Chamber. Sections were cooled for 20 min and washed twice in 0.025% v/v Tween 20/PBS pH 7.2 for one minute each wash. Non-specific antibody binding was inhibited by incubating the sections in 2% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich)/Biocare Medical Background Sniper for 30 min. Excess Sniper/BSA was removed from the sections before they were incubated with anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody, 4G2, for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed three times with PBST and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:300 in PBST applied for 30 min. Sections were washed three times with PBST before being counterstained with DAPI for 10 min, and washed 4 times with PBST before being mounted.
