<p id="Par20">Colonies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were established from collections in Townsville and Innisfail in north-east Australia and maintained within the Australian Defence Force Malaria and Infectious Disease Institute and QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute insectaries, respectively. Both mosquito colonies were established before the release of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in northern Australia. Larvae were reared at a density of 200 larvae in 3 liters of water, prepared by reverse osmosis, in plastic trays (48 × 40 × 7 cm) and fed ground TetraMin tropical fish food flakes (Tetra, Melle, Germany) at a rate of 0.25–1.00 mg/larva/day as development progressed. Pupae were transferred to cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm) for adult emergence. Adults were provided with 10% w/v sucrose solution on cotton wool pledgets which were removed 24 h prior to feeding.
