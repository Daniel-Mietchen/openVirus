<p id="Par36">The marked differences between the ability of colonies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to become infected with and to transmit this highly divergent/primitive strain of DENV 2 (QML22) and a conventional strain (QML16) suggest further studies with 
 <italic>An. albopictus</italic> and arboreal strains of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> are warranted, if such colonies can be established, to determine whether other strains of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> also are poor vectors of QML22 or whether there is a gradient of competencies from arboreal to urban mosquitoes.
