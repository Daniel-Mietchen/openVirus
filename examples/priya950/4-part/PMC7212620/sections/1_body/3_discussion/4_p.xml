<p id="Par35">In order to transmit the virus to an uninfected human, DENV must escape the mosquito innate immune system to replicate and disseminate through the mosquito before entering saliva [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Several physiological ‘barriers’ to this dissemination have been hypothesised, including midgut infection and escape barriers (MIB and MEB) and salivary gland infection and escape barriers (SGIB and SGEB) and earlier studies have indicated that the MIB is a major determinant of vector competence for DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The lower body infection rate of QML22 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) suggested a MIB might be the first obstacle for the highly divergent QML22 where the virus/cell-receptor interaction and internalization into the midgut epithelial cells is occurring. When the MIB was overcome, QML22 replicated to titres similar to those for QML16 in body tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Lower dissemination rates and slower replication rates for QML22 than QML16 in legs and wings would have a significant effect on transmission given the relatively short half-life of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in nature. Failure to detect infectious QML22 in mosquito saliva by CCELISA was not surprising given the inability to detect DENV in salivary glands from a small number of mosquitoes infected with QML22 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the difference between the proportion of QML16 infected mosquitoes with infected salivary glands and the proportion with virus in saliva (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggested the SGEB may play a role in determining the competency of Australian 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes to transmit DENV. The relative importance of physiological infection barriers remains to be further determined.
