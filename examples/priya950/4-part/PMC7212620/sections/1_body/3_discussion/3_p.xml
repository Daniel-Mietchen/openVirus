<p id="Par34">Our data reinforce the extensive DENV vector competency literature that demonstrates that no two strains of DENV can be assumed to behave in exactly the same way in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from different localities. Investigations to determine the mechanisms underpinning the resistance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to infection with this sylvatic strain of DENV2 are likely to be complex given the enormous differences between the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of it and other strains of DENV2 for which 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is known to be able to be a competent vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Added to this is the additional complexity of host factors that this study observed in two colonies of mosquitoes derived from areas only 250Â km apart.
