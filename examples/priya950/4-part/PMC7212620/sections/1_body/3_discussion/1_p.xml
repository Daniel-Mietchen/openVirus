<p id="Par32">The introduction of a pathogenic, transmissible and highly divergent strain of DENV2 into areas of Australia with a human population largely susceptible to DENV infection as well as the existence of the principal urban vector of DENV, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], could have significant public health implications. However, while colonies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> established from two population centres in northern Australia were found to be susceptible to infection with, and able to transmit, a contemporary epidemic strain of DENV2, they were much less susceptible to infection with the highly divergent and sylvatic strain, of DENV2 QML22, and thus appear unlikely to be able to transmit it.
