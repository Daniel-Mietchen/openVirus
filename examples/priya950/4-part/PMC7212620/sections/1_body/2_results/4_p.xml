<p id="Par30">These investigations were repeated using a colony of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> established from mosquitoes collected at Innisfail, 250 km from Townsville several years after the Townsville colony was established. The infection rate of QML22 in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Innisfail fed on the same concentrations as above was lower (16%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 25 at 14 dpi) than that observed with the Townsville colony (above), while the rates of infection of mosquitoes from both 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> colonies with QML16 were similar (72%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 25 for Innisfail; and 79%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 75 for Townsville;

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This suggested that the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Innisfail were less susceptible to infection with QML22 than those from Townsville. Low numbers of infected mosquitoes from Innisfail prevented statistical analyses.
