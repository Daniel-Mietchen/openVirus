<p id="Par31">Histological examination of limited numbers of mosquitoes infected with QML16 and QML22 supported the above results. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Disseminated virus infection was observed in 88% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) mosquitoes ≥ 10 days after feeding on QML16 and infection was observed in 50% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) of the salivary glands of these insects. In contrast, no dissemination of virus could be detected beyond the midgut in any mosquitoes ≥ 10 days after feeding on QML22 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13).
