<p id="Par17">Dengue viruses (DENV) have two ecologically and evolutionarily discrete transmission cycles, sylvatic and urban endemic/epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The sylvatic cycle employs non-human primates as hosts and several arboreal 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species as transmission vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, the urban endemic/epidemic cycle has humans as the host and the peridomestic 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito as the principal vector. All four serotypes of endemic/epidemic DENV are considered to have evolved independently from sylvatic DENV progenitors over the past 1000 years. Whether sylvatic DENV strains can overcome adaptive barriers to infect peridomestic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, then enter the urban human-mosquito-human transmission cycle to cause secondary human infection (spillover epidemics), has been a source of debate for more than a decade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. DENV1-4 strains from Malaysia and DENV2 strain from West Africa have been reported to spillover from sylvatic cycles to infect humans causing similar, or milder, symptoms than those caused by the classic endemic/epidemic DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous assessments of the ability of sylvatic DENV strains to infect 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have produced a confusing picture in which the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to infection with sylvatic DENV2 has ranged from refractory to almost 100% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Significantly, none of the viruses studied were recovered from patients, instead, sylvatic viruses had been isolated from non-human primates and/or mosquitoes. In addition, these studies used virus dissemination to mosquito legs, wings and heads as a proxy for virus transmission, based on the assumption that if the virus were able to disseminate from midgut to other tissues, it would have infected the salivary glands and transmission would occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The detection of infectious virus in mosquito saliva provides a more accurate proxy for transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
