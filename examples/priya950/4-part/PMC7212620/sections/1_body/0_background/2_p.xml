<p id="Par18">In 2016, a sylvatic strain of DENV2, QML22, was recovered from a patient returning to Australia from Borneo. This virus was basal to all other strains of DENV in phylogenetic trees and was divergent from Asian and West African lineages of sylvatic DENV2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Susceptibility of Australian strains of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to infection with DENV varies with the geographical locations from which the mosquitoes are obtained [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This study determined whether colonies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> derived from two different locations in northern Australia, where dengue outbreaks have occurred, were likely to be able to transmit this sylvatic strain of DENV if it were to be introduced.
