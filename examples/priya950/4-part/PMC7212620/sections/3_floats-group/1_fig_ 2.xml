  <p>Midsagittal sections showing tissue distribution of DENV QML16 and QML22 strain infection within orally inoculated 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> Mosquitoes were examined for the distribution of DENV infection by IFA analysis of paraffin sections using an anti-flavivirus Envelope protein monoclonal antibody and Alexa-fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody for DENV (green) and DAPI staining for DNA (blue). 
   <bold>a</bold> Example of whole-body staining of mosquitoes infected with DENV QML16 at 14 dpi showing staining in head (H), midgut (M); and salivary glands (S). 
   <bold>b</bold> Example of whole-body staining of mosquitoes infected with DENV QML22 at 14 dpi showing infection limited to the midgut. No staining was observed beyond midguts for mosquitoes inoculated with QML22.
