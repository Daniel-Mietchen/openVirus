<p id="p0050">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquito bites and was historically confined to Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since 2006, chikungunya has emerged on a global scale, with outbreaks occurring in the Indian Ocean, Oceania, Southern Europe and, from 2013, in the Americas [

Their advice toward health risks in endemic or epidemic countries visited, as part of a pre-travel consultation, could be improved [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A lack of awareness may extend the time between the start of a viraemic illness, with risk of transmission to local mosquitoes, and the first notification and investigation of cases. Moreover, travel-acquired CHIKV infection may result in long-term sequelae, such as incapacitating arthralgias [
