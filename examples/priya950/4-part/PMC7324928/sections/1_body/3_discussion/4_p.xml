<p id="p0080">For the first time in 2006, a large part of the atoll was involved in a CHIKV outbreak, but unevenly so. Incidence was highest in the following atolls: Raa, Malé, Meemu and Lhaviyani. Interestingly, the French case in this report took a diving trip, which disembarked in only two locations, Dhenghethi Island and Malé, the capital, at the end of their trip. He arrived in Dhengheti (Alif Dhaal atoll) on 9 December and Malé on 12 December, 2019; date of symptom onset was 13 December, 2019. According to the patient's history and considering the 4 to 7-day incubation period of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Dhengethi Island was the most likely location of exposure. However, during former epidemics, this highly touristic place was considered to be low risk for CHIKV transmission compared to Malé and other atolls. This highlights the importance of mapping exposures of cases and determining places of transmission contemporary to an epidemic, with the aim of improving case detection and implementing targeted vector-control measures that limit CHIKV dissemination [

From a clinical point of view during the first CHIKV outbreak in the Maldives, patients reported fever during 1–6 days as a primary symptom of illness, and other symptoms included joint pain, arthritis, arthralgia, headache, rash and sore throat, but lymph nodes were not noticed [

No clinical description from the recent epidemic are available yet, however, lymphadenitis presented by the French case in this series have been mostly reported during infection with the Asian chikungunya lineage. Basically, we do not know exactly the origin of the viruses responsible for the 2006 and the 2019 chikungunya Maldivian outbreaks. Whether it is the same strains or not remains to be determined.
