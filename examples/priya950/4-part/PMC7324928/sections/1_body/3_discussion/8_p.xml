<p id="p0100">Despite true difficulties in implementing anti-CHIKV individual and community prevention programs worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], travel medicine practitioners can play a pivotal role in raising awareness of the potential for infection and importation of CHIKV in travellers [

Being a malaria-free certified WHO country since 2015, Maldives may be wrongly considered low risk for mosquito borne illnesses. Pre-travel visits have led to a significant decrease in malaria, hepatitis A virus infection and HIV/AIDS infections among travellers [

To date, no such effect has been demonstrated regarding arboviral diseases and it remains important therefore to make travellers aware of these risks and their prevention methods. Travellers must be advised to apply all-day long vector-borne preventive measures using physical and chemical barriers (use insect repellent, bed-nets, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants and stay in places with window and door screens or air conditioning). Moreover, it is important to advise travellers to present as soon as possible to a travel clinic in case of fever and/or arthralgia occurring during or after a travel to a country endemic for arboviral disease (dengue/chikungunya/Zika). It is worth stressing that Maldivian public health authorities apparently have meticulous record-keeping and efficient surveillance systems. Local epidemiological data assist in the timely adaptation of travel recommendations and the prompt detection and management of viremic cases imported into places at risk of local spread [
