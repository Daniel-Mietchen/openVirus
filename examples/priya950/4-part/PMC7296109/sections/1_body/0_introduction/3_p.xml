<p>ASFV is primarily transmitted via direct and indirect contact between animals, through infected swine and their products, and via contaminated fomites or uncooked meat from infected animals. Its ability to persist for a long time in the environment or in infected biological samples makes eradication difficult once the disease has become established. Additionally, some arthropods that may have acquired ASFV during preceding years (up to 5 years) can transmit the virus (

 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> spp. can be an effective reservoir of infection (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), with documented trans-stadial, trans-ovarial, and sexual transmission (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), whereas potential sources of infection in Europe are represented by infectious domestic pigs (
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic>) and wild boar (
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), contaminated carcasses, food waste, and vehicles or equipment. Furthermore, in Sardinia (Italy), where the disease has been persisting for more than 35 years, recent studies have reaffirmed the absence a role of 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks in the ASF cycle, despite strong climatic and ecological similarities with the Iberian Peninsula, where this tick was involved in ASFV transmission and the persistence of ASF (
