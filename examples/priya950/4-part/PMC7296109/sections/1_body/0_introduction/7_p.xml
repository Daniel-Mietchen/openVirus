<p>The sole European territory where ASF Genotype I (vp72) has been present for a long time is the Italian island of Sardinia (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The same genotype has been present in Spain and Portugal from 1960 to 1995, and caused outbreaks in some other European countries [France (1964, 1967, and 1977), Belgium (1985), Italy (1967, 1980) Malta (1978), and the Netherlands (1986)] (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This genotype was also responsible for several outbreaks in the Caribbean and South America (from 1971 until 1981) (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Since 1995, all affected European and south American countries had successfully eradicated the disease (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), with only Sardinia being the exception. On the other hand, all ASFV isolates circulating in Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Russian Federation, in other Eastern and Central European countries since 2007, are all clustered within Genotype II (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
