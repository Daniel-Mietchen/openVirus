<p>The virus can affect species of the Suidae family (both wild and domestic) of all breeds and ages. Virulent ASFV strains cause peracute or acute hemorrhagic fever in infected animals, with up to 100% mortality (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Generally, clinical disease can manifest in multiple ways, ranging from death, with no signs (peracute, mortality nearing 100%), to an asymptomatic infection; however, most isolates of ASFV cause acute hemorrhagic fever in domestic pigs and result in mortality nearing 100% (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). European wild boar (
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) is highly susceptible to the disease and shows similar clinical signs and lethality as domestic pigs (
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic>). In contrast, infected wild African suids usually have occult infections and develop subclinical and asymptomatic long-term persistent infections, acting as ASFV reservoirs in Africa.
