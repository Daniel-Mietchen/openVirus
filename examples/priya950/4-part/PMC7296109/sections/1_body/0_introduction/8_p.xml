<p>ASF epidemiology is thus very complex, determining different epidemiological patterns of infection when considering Africa or Europe. From an epidemiological point of view, three independent epidemiologic cycles (sylvatic, tick–pig, and domestic) have been described (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) until recently in literature. After the ASF epizootic occurred in Central and Eastern EU Member States, the researchers could consider a fourth cycle in addition to the three already recognized: the “wild boar–habitat cycle” (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This cycle focuses on the wild boar population and its habitat as a virus reservoir (
