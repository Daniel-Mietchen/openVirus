<p>Studies were initially selected through a search of the titles and abstracts (first screening), and then by reading the full texts (second screening). Decisions on study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers, using electronic forms, and differences between the reviewers were resolved by discussion to consensus or by consulting a third reviewer. References were managed in RefWorks.</p>
