<p>ASF was first notified in Malta in March 1978, after an outbreak involving infected imported waste illegally fed to animals. The first cases were notified in pigs in fattening premises, which had bought weaners from swill-fed premises where the disease was well-established, indicating that it had probably been in Malta for at least a month before diagnosis and notification. Therefore, ASF rapidly spread throughout the country affecting 25,100 pigs and 304 premises. In addition to the spread of virus in contaminated swill the movement of weaners from infected swill feeders was a key means of spreading the infection. In the early stages, farmers voluntarily depopulated their premises. A serum survey was carried out at slaughterhouse and at farm levels. By August, the pig population was reduced to one-third. A rigorous policy of slaughtering with compensation was applied in the island leading to the disease confinement and finally eradication. This result was achievable thanks to the restriction of pig movements and the elimination of the large number of infected pigs once the slaughter policy was adopted (
