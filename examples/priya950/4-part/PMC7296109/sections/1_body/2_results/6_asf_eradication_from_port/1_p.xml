<p>The first outbreak of ASF outside the African continent was notified in Portugal, and probably arose from Angola in May 1957. The spread of ASFV to Portugal was thought to have taken place via contaminated food waste from African airline flights and/or ships docking at seaports, which was fed to pigs (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), probably caused by the improper use of food waste and waste originating from an infected dead pig whose carcass was not well-buried. From the 1960 epizootic, ASFV spread to many other areas of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and other areas of Portugal), where it remained endemic for decades until 1994. In 1999, ASF appeared again in the Antalejo region, but it was successfully eradicated. The man-mediated transmission was considered as the most common cause of infection, via the uncontrolled movement of infected animals or the transport of infected animal products from contaminated sites. The uncontrolled movement of animals was probably closely related to the marketing circuits for live animals, as well as the decision-making mechanisms at farm level affecting production and marketing, and which in turn, were affected by the economic environment (

 <italic>O. erraticus</italic>, made the eradication very difficult, particularly in outdoor swine production areas where pigsties were used to shelter the free-range pigs (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In these types of areas, 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> was the cause of disease re-emergences, even after disease eradication, as it was the case of the single outbreak in Portugal in 1999 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Studies were performed to find 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> in the usual resting places of wild pigs; these suggested that the link between soft ticks and wild pigs was not important in the epidemiology of ASF in the wild pig population (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). After tremendous efforts, eradication was finally achieved, jointly with Spain, and specific programs were applied, including the detection of anti-tick antibodies in domestic and wild boars, as well as the destruction or isolation of the pigpens where ticks were present (
