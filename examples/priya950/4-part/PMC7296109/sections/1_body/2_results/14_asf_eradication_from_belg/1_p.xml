<p>The first case of the ASF in Belgium was reported in West Flanders in March 1985. The virus was probably introduced through infected pork from Spain that was fed to a wild boar. Afterwards the spread occurred through direct contact (trade) of infected animals and improper use of infected syringe needles (

The slow spread of the virus (due to epidemiological circumstances) together with the severe control measures applied led to eradication, which was declared in September 1985. The absence of viral circulation was confirmed by a large serological survey after the last confirmed case. The eradication goal was achieved by combining severe control measures with active and passive surveillance at farm level. Serological surveillance, aimed at eradicating the disease, was applied to both infected and not infected herds, and to several farms with indirect contact with those suspected to be infected. The interval between disease confirmation and eradication dates was short: for 5 of the 12 infected farms, the date of confirmation and the eradication date coincided, while, in other cases, a maximum of 5 days elapsed between confirmation and eradication. In the literature, no specific risk factors for maintenance were described given the fast eradication achievement (
