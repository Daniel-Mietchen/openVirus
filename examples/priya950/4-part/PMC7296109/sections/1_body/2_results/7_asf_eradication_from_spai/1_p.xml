<p>The first time ASF was reported in Spain was in 1960 where the disease remained endemic for decades until 1995. The disease spread within the pig sector when the family-type production system was characterized by low-level biosecurity. Extensive husbandry methods used in the management of Iberian pigs made ASF eradication extremely expensive and difficult. In fact, an analysis of the effort to control ASF in Spain in the year 1983 alone estimated costs at 11.4 million Euros (

Therefore, a specific plan for eradication providing new restrictive policy measures, as compared to the previous plan, was adopted in 1985 (and remained in force until 1995). From 1985 to 1990, the disease was completely confined to southwest Spain. The virus persisted in these areas for several reasons: primarily because of inadequate sanitary and biosafety conditions in outdoor pig production facilities, but also because of the presence of soft ticks (

Afterwards, in 1991, the infected region was divided into a surveillance area (with no acute outbreaks and very few seropositive animals for at least 1 year) and an infected area (
