<p>During the eradication plan, after outbreak confirmation a protection (with a radius of at least 3 km) and surveillance zone (with a radius of at least 10 km) were established and their radius was adapted according to epidemiological investigations. Movement of live pigs within the two zones was forbidden for 30 days; however, if serological tests proved that the area was negative, movements were allowed within the zones while movements of live pigs outside of the zones were forbidden. All pigs within the protection zone were serologically screened and further screenings were performed in the 3 and 10 km zones, not sooner than 30 days after the preliminary cleaning of the infected holding was completed (
