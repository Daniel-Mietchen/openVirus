<p>First notified in Río de Janeiro, in the municipality of Paracambi, in May 1978 (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), Brazil experienced ASF due to tourism between Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, and the illegal trade in leftover food from flights landed in Río de Janeiro that was used for swine feeding (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and rapidly applied proper control measures. The disease spread due to contaminated food used to feed pigs housed on farms with low-level biosecurity (thus, the epidemiological determinant was a social factor), and through contaminated classical swine fever (CSF) vaccines that arrived in Paraná via the municipalities of Ourinhos and Jacarezinho in Sâo Paulo State (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). During the emergency period (1978–1979), a federal level working group and an official laboratory for ASF diagnosis (ASFDL) were set up. The ASFDL was a paramount tool for the adoption of best eradication practices, providing information on ASFV heterogeneity (low- and high-virulence strains) (

Several actions to control the disease were implemented, such as the immediate notification of cases to neighboring countries with which Brazil had bilateral agreements, and to the OIE and the FAO. Other measures applied included the destruction of clandestine deposits of food waste in the cities, with the removal and destruction of all food waste, the ban on sale of animals and pork products and on feeding of food waste; control of pig movements, with a ban on exhibitions, fairs, and other events of aggregation; the setting up of check-posts; census activities in the focal area; culling and immediate cremation of pigs within the affected areas; repopulation 6 months after the last eliminated case, and at least two rounds of disinfection of the affected premises, with the reintroduction of sentinel pigs free from ASF and vaccinated against CSF; active training and social programs related to preventive measures (farmers and veterinarians received phone numbers for free direct calling, so that they could notify the authorities as easily as possible).
