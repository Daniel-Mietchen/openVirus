<p>After first confirmation of ASF in June 2017, hunting was regulated firstly through a ban within the infected area, then it was allowed only in infected area of the low risk zone, then it shifted from the trapping of wild boar in the high risk zone to individual hunting in the same zone in the infected area (

The success of ASF eradication in the Czech Republic relied on the management zones' demarcation, enhanced passive surveillance of dead wild boars through intensive and systematic searching and removal of carcasses, a ban on driven hunting, motivation for hunters through financial rewards and compensation, high biosecurity during hunting and sampling collection in the infected area, disposal of hunted wild boars from the infected area to/selected//definite rendering plants, effective hunting in the infected area by snipers, and awareness training campaigns and education of hunters, veterinary services, and the public (
