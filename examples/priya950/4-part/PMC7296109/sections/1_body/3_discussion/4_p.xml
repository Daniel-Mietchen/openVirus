<p>The recent experience of the Czech Republic was noteworthy, because it is the sole country officially declared free from ASF in recent years. Early detection and strict new measures in wild boar populations have been applied to prevent ASF spread, and containment efforts have recently met with success using different wild boar management zones; leaving wild boar in the infected area and by removing the carcasses, and depopulating around the infected zone (i.e., the fenced area, high- and low-risk areas, and intensive hunting area) (

As a matter of fact, 10 months after discovery of the index case, ASF had been confined to a very small territory in the Czech Republic and has apparently not spread. Although eradication has not been achieved in the other involved EU countries, the Czech Republic experience can be considered to be a first successful attempt in disease control in an epidemiological scenario characterized by a small cluster of infections in wild boar population. As in the past, classical surveillance strategies and control measures continue to be valid tools for disease control and eradication. Also the experience of Belgium deserves special mention. In this country the disease was absent since 1985 but reappeared in a confined area on 13 September 2018 in wild boars, likely due to human activities (

Even though Belgium has not yet been completely declared free from the disease, the control strategy applied was proving effective in limiting ASFV inside the affected area and confined to the wild population. This was possible thanks to preventive culling of all domestic pigs and captive wild pigs in the provisional “infected zone” extending over 630 km
 <sup>2</sup> along with a ban on the repopulation. In the rest of the country enhanced passive surveillance in all pig holdings, training of veterinarians, increased biosecurity measures and prohibition of assembly of pigs were assured. After the replacement of the provisional “infected zone” with zone II and I according to the Directive 2002/60/EC, specific additional and more stringent measures than those imposed by EU were applied within the three operational zones (an infected area bounded by two concentric peripheral zones called “reinforced observation area” and “vigilance area”). The ban of hunting and wild boars' feeding, the active and systematic searches for dead wild boar with immediate carcass removal and transport to the principal collection center then to the rendering plant jointly with soil disinfection were applied. Furthermore, a network of concentric fences was built with the dual purpose of slowing down the spatial diffusion of the disease and defining corridors aimed at collecting wild boars to be depopulated by avoiding their dispersal. The depopulation was carried in all the three zones by hunters who had received specific training on biosecurity procedures and compensation.
