<p>History of ASF eradication indicates that this infection may appear in different ways, although the ASFV can shows very limited genetic diversity (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). In fact, in continents where only genotypes I and II have been circulating the genetic diversity among isolates collected over long time periods and from different geographical regions was very limited (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>), in contrast to isolates from the sylvatic cycle in East and South Africa characterized by greater genetic diversity (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Furthermore, large differences highlighted in the virus genome (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>) do not seem even to influence the ASF epidemiology in terms of mortality, morbidity, and resistance; if ever, the interaction with the hosts and the environment are more affecting the virulence expression: in fact, recent studies (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>) indicate that the virulence may be modified as a consequence of the extended exposure of the host population to the infection.
