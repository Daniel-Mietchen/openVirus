 <italic>B. sphaericus</italic> (
 <italic>Bs</italic>) is found in numerous habitats, especially in soils and aquatic habitats. It is known as a producer of a characteristic spherical spore inside the swollen sporangium. Over the past 25 years, scientists had much interest and focused on isolating numerous strains because of their potential use as mosquito larvicides [
 <xref rid="B200-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Several formulations used in biocontrol are highly effective against mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B125-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Recently renamed 
 <italic>Lysinibacillus sphaericus</italic> (2007) [
 <xref rid="B201-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>], numerous studies have reported various levels of resistance to 
 <italic>Bs</italic> in laboratory and field populations from different countries [
 <xref rid="B176-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>] (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00310-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), mostly on 
 <italic>Culex</italic> populations. Different mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B202-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] have been observed in numerous locations, such as France, China, India, and Brazil [

 <xref rid="B203-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. If mosquitoes develop resistance to one strain of 
 <italic>Bs</italic>, it appears that they will develop resistance to other 
 <italic>Bs</italic> strains due to the similarity of the binary toxins in most strains; but, they remain susceptible to 
 <italic>Bti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B176-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Resistant strain fitness was found to be heavily impacted, especially fecundity and fertility, which became very low in a study [
 <xref rid="B204-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>,
 <xref rid="B205-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>], although opposite results were achieved in another study [
 <xref rid="B206-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>].
