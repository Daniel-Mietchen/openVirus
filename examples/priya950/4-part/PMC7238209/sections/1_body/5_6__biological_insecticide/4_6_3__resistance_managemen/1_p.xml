<p>When it comes to managing the rapid increase in insecticide resistance [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 
 <italic>Bti</italic> can be used as a powerful tool to mitigate resistance to 
 <italic>Bs</italic> in mosquitoes, although it has been reported that using them in rotation or in a mixture leads to a steady decline in resistance over 30 generations. They can also delay or prevent the emergence of resistance due to the synergistic action between their toxins, and recent formulations have shown greater larvicidal activity and efficacy [
 <xref rid="B176-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Other combinations with botanical pesticides are considered alternatives to mitigating the development of resistance to 
 <italic>Bs</italic> in mosquitoes [
