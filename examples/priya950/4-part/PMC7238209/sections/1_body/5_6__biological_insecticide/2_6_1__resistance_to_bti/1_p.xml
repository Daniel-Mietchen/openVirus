<p>Numerous factors, such as wild proliferation or environmental accumulation, as well as the persistence of human-spread 
 <italic>Bti</italic> in treated larvae breeding sites, may lead to a long exposure time of insects, which may increase the risk of acquiring resistance in target insects and also have a negative impact on non-target insects [
 <xref rid="B188-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. A study showed that a high resistance to each individual 
 <italic>Bti</italic> toxin can be obtained under some conditions in the laboratory after only a few generations of selection, and this resistance seems to be lowest for commercial and environmental 
 <italic>Bti</italic>, which might act as a first step in resistance to a complete 
 <italic>Bti</italic> toxin mixture (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00310-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Studies reporting that individuals show resistance to one toxin but not to another suggest that different resistance mechanisms exist [
 <xref rid="B189-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. The mechanisms of resistance to 
 <italic>Bti Cry</italic> toxins are widely studied in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species [
