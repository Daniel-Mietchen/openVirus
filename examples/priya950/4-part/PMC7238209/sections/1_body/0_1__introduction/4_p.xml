<p>In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge about mosquito-borne diseases and the latest figures from these resurgences, highlighting current techniques for their control and their limitations. We then focus on new innovative alternatives currently known but rarely used, others that are not used at all, and those that are still in the test or design phase but are very promising, which we suggest to be considered in the biological control of mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
