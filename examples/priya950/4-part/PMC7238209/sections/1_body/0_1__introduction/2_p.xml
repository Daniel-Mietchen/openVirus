<p>Deadly pathogens and parasites may be transmitted by arthropods [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the increasing global human and animal populations are threatened by such epidemics and pandemics [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) represent the most threatening vector due to their role in the transmission of dangerous pathogens [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Through trade and travel, key mosquito species are being introduced into novel habitats [
