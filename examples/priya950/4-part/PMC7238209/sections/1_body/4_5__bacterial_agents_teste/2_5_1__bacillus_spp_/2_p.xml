 <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> produces three classes of larvicidal proteins: 
 <italic>Cry</italic> (exert intoxication through toxin activation, receptor binding, and pore formation in a suitable larval gut environment), 
 <italic>Cyt</italic> (cytolytic toxicity) when sporulating (parasporal crystals), and 
 <italic>Vip</italic> proteins throughout the vegetative phase (ionic, non-ionic detergents and pore-forming mechanisms of action were suggested), some of which are toxic against a wide range of insect orders, nematodes, and human-cancer cells. This has been widely employed as an effective biopesticide to control pests that are harmful to crops, forests, and humans. 
 <italic>Cyt</italic> toxins possess less toxicity against mosquito larvae than 
 <italic>Cry</italic> toxins [
