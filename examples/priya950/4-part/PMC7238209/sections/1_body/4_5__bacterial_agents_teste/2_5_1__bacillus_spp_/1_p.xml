<p>Before the discovery of

 <italic>Bacillus sphaericus</italic> (
 <italic>Bs</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00310-f003">Figure 3</xref>), little attention was paid to bacteria as sources of agents for microbial control of mosquitoes. Around 1500 microorganisms were recently identified as good potential insecticidal agents, and looking for insecticidal activity, metabolites from approximately a thousand microbial isolates were examined [
 <xref rid="B123-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bti</italic> formulations are the predominant nonchemical means employed for controlling mosquito larvae [
 <xref rid="B124-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In addition, several studies indicate the highly effective and safe use of individuals or the mixture of 
 <italic>Bti</italic> and 
 <italic>Bs</italic> for mosquito control, and they are considered to be safe to non-target organisms cohabiting with mosquito larvae [
