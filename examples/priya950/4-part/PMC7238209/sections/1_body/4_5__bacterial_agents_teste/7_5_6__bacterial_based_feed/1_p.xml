<p>The fear of the occurrence of possible side effects of DEET, such as toxic encephalopathy, seizures, acute manic psychosis, cardiovascular toxicity, and dermatitis [
 <xref rid="B181-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>], as well as potential resistance that has become a reality with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B182-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>] and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B183-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>], has led to the use of innovative technologies to create other products free of DEET that are marketed in the form of sprays or creams and include other active ingredients [
 <xref rid="B184-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>], such as picaridin [
 <xref rid="B185-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>] and IR 3535 [
 <xref rid="B186-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], and a wide range of essential oils, which synergistically use various components and have been reported to provide a higher repellent activity than single isolated components [
 <xref rid="B187-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Recently, a mixture of compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Xenorhabdus budapestensis</italic> (entomopathogenic-associated bacteria) exhibited potent feeding-deterrent activity against three mosquito species considered to be the most important vectors of diseases affecting public health. They belong to the fabclavine class and exhibit a high activity comparable to or better than that of DEET or picaridin in side-by-side assays [
 <xref rid="B93-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], which supports the attempt to replace toxic molecules by considering bacteria as a very promising source of new alternative molecules for exploitation as mosquito repellents.
