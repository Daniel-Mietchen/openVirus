<p>Mosquito symbiont-associated bacteria may exert a pathogenic effect on their host, interfering with its reproduction and also reducing vector competence [
 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are endosymbiotic bacteria that naturally infect approximately 40% of insect species [
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> is a unique valid species of the genus [
 <xref rid="B147-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. They are present in some major mosquito disease vectors, such as 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and anopheline species, including malaria vectors such as 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> but never 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B148-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,

 <xref rid="B150-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. This maternally transmitted bacterium allowing the invasion of host populations can induce feminisation of males (turning genetic males into females), parthenogenesis (reproduction without males) [
 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>], and cytoplasmic incompatibility, leading to the generation of inviable offspring when a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected male mates with an uninfected female, but not in the contrary case [
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Successfully used in Myanmar in the 1960s to eradicate 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B151-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], it is currently also being used to target 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, using a triple 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected strain [
 <xref rid="B152-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], and to target 
 <italic>Ae. polynesiensis</italic> (2012) [
 <xref rid="B153-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. To date, it has been used in several countries, such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Colombia. The fear of resistance to the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has been highlighted, but no studies have demonstrated that this scenario is likely to happen, and the creation of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-superinfected lines, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with stable infection, could help to mitigate potential resistance [
 <xref rid="B145-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B154-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] and add to their role in reducing vector competence. Studies have reported that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits the transmission of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], YFV [
 <xref rid="B156-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], malaria parasites in 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B157-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B158-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], DENV [
 <xref rid="B159-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B160-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Recent reviews clearly explain 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as a form of biological control [
 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>,
