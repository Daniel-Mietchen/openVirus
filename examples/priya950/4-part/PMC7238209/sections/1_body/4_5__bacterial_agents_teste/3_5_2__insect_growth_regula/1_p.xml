<p>Due to several advantages, such as low toxicity to the environment and selectivity, IGRs present an effective tool to control mosquito populations. They are substances that are analogues or antagonists of hormones and interfere with insect development [
 <xref rid="B136-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. There is growing interest in the use of IGRs, such as methoprene and pyriproxyfen, two juvenile hormone agonists belonging to IGR insecticides. They are effective against mosquito larvae and may inhibit the emergence of adults [
