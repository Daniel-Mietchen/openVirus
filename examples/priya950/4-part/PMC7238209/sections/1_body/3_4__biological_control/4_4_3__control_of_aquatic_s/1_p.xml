<p>The use of fish to control the aquatic stages of mosquitoes was an important tool in the pre-DDT era. These fish were introduced into all potential mosquito-breeding habitats and their use decreased after the introduction of DDT and then was rekindled after the development of resistance and harmful effects [
 <xref rid="B114-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The use of indigenous larvivorous fishes is suggested [
 <xref rid="B115-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], and a limited number of species are used, primarily 
 <italic>Gambusia affinnis</italic> and 
 <italic>Poecilia reticulata</italic>, although several failures have been reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B114-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Other aquatic predators may play a role in reducing mosquito populations, especially in rainy periods [

 <xref rid="B117-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], and the combination of multiple predators can reduce mosquito populations [
