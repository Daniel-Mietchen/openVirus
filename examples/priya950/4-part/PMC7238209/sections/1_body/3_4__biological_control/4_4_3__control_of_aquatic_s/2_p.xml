<p>The naturally occurring non-biting 
 <italic>Toxorhynchites</italic> species, which exhibit predatory behaviour during their larval stages, have been explored for their potential use as biological control alternatives to chemical insecticides (the 4th instar larva is the most predaceous) [

 <xref rid="B120-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Important progress was made concerning their production for use as biological agents and they demonstrated remarkable effectiveness against numerous mosquito species, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B121-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. In certain situations, they have demonstrated practical potential, but their use continues to be limited by several problems, such as cannibalism during the early instars, temperature (limited by low temperatures), and also the inadequate overlap in the larval habitats between the prey and the predator mosquito [
