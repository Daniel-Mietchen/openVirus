<p>Particular attention has been paid to fungal species belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Lagenidium</italic>, 
 <italic>Coelomomyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Entomophthora</italic>, 
 <italic>Culicinomyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Beauveria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Metarhizium</italic> for their power to reduce mosquito populations, but unfortunately, none of them have been specifically adapted as larvicidal agents against important vector species [

Application to surfaces on which mosquitoes land or need to pass through, such as fungus-impregnated cloths around bed nets, attractive bait stations, and adult mosquito traps and PET traps, show promising results, with a 39â€“50% reduction in survival rates of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and elimination of 95% of 
 <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> mosquitoes in a bait station [
 <xref rid="B113-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. One of the most effective fungi studied recently against simultaneously 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquito adults is 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>. The production and persistence of its conidia was remarkably high [
