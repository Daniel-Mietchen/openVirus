<p>The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a species-specific and environmentally benign method for insect population control based on mass rearing, radiation-mediated sterilisation, and the release of a large number of male insects into a given target area, which compete for mates with wild males. A wild female mating with a released sterile male has no or fewer progeny, so the population tends to decline [

 <xref rid="B103-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], which was an improvement on RIDL (release of insects carrying a dominant lethal gene). The lethal dominant gene could be controlled by a female-specific promoter and its expression could be inactivated by antibiotic treatment (tetracycline), allowing the mosquito-colony to be maintained. When male and female separation is required, the antibiotic is removed from the system, causing the death of all females [
