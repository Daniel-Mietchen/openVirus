<p>Improving current strategies, such as the sterile insect technique, the release of insects with dominant lethality, or transgenesis, may provide key solutions to preventing outbreaks, decreasing the danger to at-risk populations and mitigating resistance. Meanwhile, promising techniques, such as those discussed in this manuscript, have already proven their effectiveness but remain under-used and require more attention and consideration in vector-control plans. </p>
