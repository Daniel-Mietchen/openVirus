<p>These are emerging technologies designed to combat the aquatic stages of mosquitoes by killing them with sound waves resulting in instantaneous mortality or inhibited emergence. They have proven to be effective as a beneficial non-chemical alternative for the treatment of drinking water supplies [

 <xref rid="B230-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>] without causing resistance within mosquito populations or harming non-target organisms when used properly [

Furthermore, even simple and cheap mobile phones can sensitively acquire acoustic data on the species-specific level of adult wingbeat sounds. This makes it possible to simultaneously record the time and location of the encounter between humans and mosquitos, which forms a powerful tool for acoustically mapping mosquito species distribution worldwide [
 <xref rid="B232-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Other innovative acoustic-based tools have been developed to control mosquitoes during rear-and-release operations, such as the low-cost and battery-powered sound-baited gravid 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> trap, which may be an effective replacement for the costly Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap [
