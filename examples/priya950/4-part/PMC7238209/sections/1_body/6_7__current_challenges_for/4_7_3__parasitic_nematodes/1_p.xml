<p>Lot of nematodes belonging to numerous orders and families are known to be parasites of insects [
 <xref rid="B224-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. Some insect parasitic nematodes that are specific to mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B225-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>] may be considered alternatives to chemical insecticides [
 <xref rid="B226-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. When tested, they were effective against malaria vectors and several other important mosquito species, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [

 <xref rid="B228-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>,
 <xref rid="B229-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. As they are naturally adapted to their host, such nematodes are highly specific to theirs hosts, which they can kill by producing high levels of parasitism. They are free swimming and disseminate easily in the infective stage [
 <xref rid="B225-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>], and species such as 
 <italic>Romanomermis iyengari</italic> are widely suggested to be a component of integrated mosquito control programmes in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries [
