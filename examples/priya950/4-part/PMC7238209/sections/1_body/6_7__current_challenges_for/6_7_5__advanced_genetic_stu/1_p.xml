<p>Recently, a new RNAi-based bioinsecticide was developed from D-RNA molecules, which was subsequently tested on

 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. A significant reduction in the viability of the larvae treated with dsRNA was reported while in the surviving larvae and adults, altered morphology and chitin content was observed. In combination with diflubenzuron, this innovative bioinsecticide had insecticidal adjuvant properties [
