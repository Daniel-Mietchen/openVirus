<p>In view of the current situation and the failures that have been experienced with mosquitos invading new territories associated with devastating outbreaks, new tools, molecules, plans, synergistic associations, and methods of mosquito control are being developed to facilitate strategic objectives, such as protecting at-risk populations, especially in endemic areas; preventing the international spread of mosquitoes and the diseases they carry; and rapidly containing epidemics. Some strategies are in the stage of preliminary testing or in the validation phase and others have recently been introduced into use.</p>
