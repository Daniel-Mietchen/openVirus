  <p>Cartography of significant resurgences of mosquito-borne diseases worldwide (until September 2019). We listed all reported outbreaks and imported and autochthon cases of malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya fever, and Zika fever between 2017 and 2019. This figure clearly shows their resurgence in almost all tropical countries. In many cases they were imported to several northern countries where the competent vector has become established, which may lead to potential local transmission.</p>
