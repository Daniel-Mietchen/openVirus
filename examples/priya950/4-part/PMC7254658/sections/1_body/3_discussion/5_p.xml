<p id="Par53">Adhering to preventive medical regimens can be difficult, especially when patients feel well, and regimens require months to complete.

The consequences of this adherence level were essential that patients were protected against the possibility of acquiring active TB disease during or at the end of the treatment. In our study outcomes, none of the patients developed active TB at the end of the six months of INH.
