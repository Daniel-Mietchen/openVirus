<p id="Par33">A national QI collaborative to improve IPT completion was initiated in January 2019 as part of a wider continuous quality improvement effort at scale in Uganda. The collaborative covered all the 14 health regions of Uganda, 126 out of 127 districts and 739 ART accredited sites. It entailed situational analysis of IPT completion in high volume facilities and coaching support to sites in all regions. The situation analysis helped to identify gaps and to come up with changes/innovations for IPT completion. Regional coaches supported district-based coaches to support site teams to understand underlying factors for low IPT completion, identify interventions for improving IPT completion and develop improvement action plans. Depending on context and informed by root cause analysis, different changes for improvement were tested to achieve adherence and completion for all patients on TPT in each facility. The site teams reviewed progress in addressing barriers to the completion of INH. We present outcomes from a prospective and longitudinal cohort study nested within the national QI collaborative.</p>
