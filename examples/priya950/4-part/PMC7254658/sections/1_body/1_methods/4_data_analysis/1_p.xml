<p id="Par39">Frequency and proportions were obtained to describe patient characteristics such as age, gender and outcome variables: retention, adherence, side effects, and completion. Association statistics were used to determine linear by linear associations between patient characteristics which, from a theoretical point of view, were assumed to influence both primary and secondary outcomes. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.05 were included in the logistical regression model using a backward stepwise method. The final model included those factors that retained statistical significance. The odds ratios (
 <italic>OR</italic>) and adjusted odds ratio (
 <italic>AOR</italic>) along with its 95% confidence interval (
 <italic>CI</italic>) were used to determine the power of relationship in determining the outcomes of interest. Results are presented as 
 <italic>AOR</italic> with 95% confidence intervals, and level of significance at 5% (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). The model was tested for fitness using the goodness-of-fit Hosmer–Lemeshow tests.
