<p id="Par41">Patients were recruited in January 2019 upon initiation on INH and followed up to the end of 6 months. Patients initiated after January 2019 were excluded from the study. One thousand and twenty-six patients (1026) patients were ultimately considered for the study in fourteen (14) high volume public health sites from different regions. Sixteen (16) patients were excluded in the analysis at the end of the 6 months period for lack of documented outcomes. We documented both secondary and primary outcomes at the end of 6 months of initiation on INH for 1010 patients.</p>
