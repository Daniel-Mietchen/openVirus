<p id="Par48">Multivariate logistic regression analysis of covariates of IPT completion revealed a strong and statistical association between IPT completion and age, gender, keeping appointments and side effects of INH. We found that completion of INH was statistically significantly related to gender in our multivariate model. Results showed that female patients were 2 times more likely to complete an INH dose than male patients (
 <italic>AOR </italic>= 1.598, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.018). Children below 15 years were less likely to complete INH than patients ≥ 15 years (AOR = 0.416, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.230, df = 1). Patients who kept all their scheduled appointment were 10 times more likely to complete IPT than those who missed one or more schedules (
 <italic>AOR </italic>= 10.72, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.000, df = 1). In our analysis, patients who did not report any side effects associated with INH were 2 times more likely to complete INH than patients who reported one or more side effects associated with INH (
 <italic>AOR </italic>= 1.958, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.016, df = 1). Adherence which was operationally defined as taking drugs as prescribed by the health worker was a predictor of completion. Patients who had an adherence score of ≥ 95% were 2 times more likely to complete treatment within 6 months (AOR = 1.526, p = 0.013, df = 1) than those with fair adherence (≥ 85%).
