<p id="Par47">The primary outcome for this study was the completion of a six-month dose of INH and the development of active TB. None of the patients developed active TB disease over the six-month period and excludes the 2% (n = 17) patients who were lost to follow up.. Completion of a six-month adult (300 mg) and child dose (150 mg) of INH was 89%, confirmed on the 7th appointment when all medicine was taken as prescribed. Nine percent (9%, n = 92) of patients stopped treatment and were excluded from analysis. Of these (55%, n = 51) stopped INH treatment because of ARV treatment interruption. The rest of the patients stopped treatment due to side effects (45%, n = 41). There were no deaths reported during the 6 months of INH. The results showing the primary outcomes for IPT are contained in Table
