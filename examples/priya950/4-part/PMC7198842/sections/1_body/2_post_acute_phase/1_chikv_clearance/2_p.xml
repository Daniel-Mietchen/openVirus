<p>In the context of antibodies, detection of anti-CHIKV IgG is mostly rare during the acute phase of infection while detection occurs in the post-acute phase and persists for months or even years (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). Persistence of CHIKV specific IgM antibodies in the blood and synovial fluid is associated with severe chronic CHIKD (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>–
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). IgG2c isotype is the major class of antibody produced in the case of CHIKV infected mice model due to IFN-γ produced from CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Numerous reports have sought to characterize the neutralizing ability of CHIKV specific antibodies, and it has been reported in mice models as a therapeutic treatment against chikungunya persistence (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>–
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). In accordance with that, mice mutant Rag1
 <sup>−/−</sup> which lack B and T cells, leading to high viral titres in various tissues, concluded that chikungunya infection persists in tissues that are controlled by adaptive immune cells (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>). Administration of polyclonal anti-CHIKV virus antisera in CHIKV infected RAG1
 <sup>−/−</sup> and B cell-deficient μMT mice resulted in clearance of the virus and could be not detected in blood (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Similarly, administration of human monoclonal CHIKV-specific antibodies in chikungunya infected rhesus monkeys led to inhibition of viral spread and inflammatory responses in various tissues like joints and muscles (
