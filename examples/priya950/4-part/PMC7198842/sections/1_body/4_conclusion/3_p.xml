<p>The resolution of CHIKD is not yet fully understood and would be the most interesting area to be studied in future, as there are several well-established mediators of inflammation that have not been studied in the context of CHIKV chronic infections. This review has strived to emphasize the various immunological aspects that may lead to disease resolution/progression in CHIKD and highlight the lacuna present currently in the field.</p>
