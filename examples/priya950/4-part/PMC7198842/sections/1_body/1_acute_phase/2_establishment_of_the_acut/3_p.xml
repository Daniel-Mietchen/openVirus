<p>Members of RIG-1-like helicase families such as RIG-1 and MDA5 play a significant role in the activation of IFN-I response (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). These PPRs from Class I detect dsRNA or 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol and induce IFN production. It was shown that stimulation with 5′-triphosphate RNA generates a robust antiviral response against CHIKV through RIG-1 pathway with the help of transcription factor IRF3 (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Simultaneously, TLR3 gene expression was found to be significantly elevated and associated with up-regulation of several downstream molecules including IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7 and OAS-3, IFN-β, and TFN-α production (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). An association of TLR3 with CHIKV replication was shown by an agonist of TRIF-dependent signaling of interferon induction (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) and TRIF knockout mice showed high viral titer with increased foot swelling in comparison to WT infected mice (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The role of TLR7 was also investigated by MyD88 knockout mice that showed high viremia but no difference in the severity of disease in comparison to WT infected mice (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), implying that MyD88 dependent pathway may not be involved in disease progression. However, another study showed a significant role of MyD88 signaling in controlling viral dissemination (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Transcriptional analyses of peripheral blood from CHIKV infected patients showed a high expression of viperin in monocyte (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The role of viperin was further evaluated using Rsad2 knockout mice that showed a significant direct correlation of the expression of this molecule with respect to higher viremia and joint inflammation (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>).
