<p>However, other studies have argued that bite-induced enhancement is too early a process to activate and engage cells of the adaptive immune response (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The authors showed that in the presence of saliva, two major events were observed. First, the development of edema that retained the virus at the bite site thus delaying the dissemination of the virus to draining lymph nodes, slowing the initial innate immune response activation and enhancing cutaneous cell replication. Second, an influx of neutrophils attracted by cutaneous cells was observed beginning from 90 min of infection in the presence of mosquito saliva (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Although neutrophils were themselves refractory to arboviral infection, they attracted cells of the myeloid lineage as new targets for viral replication. Myeloid cells are also responsible for spreading the virus from the initial site of infection, and neutrophil depletion at the bite site reduced viral dissemination (

The importance of type I IFNs during early infection is evidenced by IFNAR-deficient mice models of CHIKV infection in which mice died within 3 days post CHIKV infection. Skin fibroblast cells upon infection by CHIKV virus were found to be major producers of type I IFNs (Specifically IFN-β). IFN production in these cells was triggered by the activation of extracellular as well as intracellular pathogen sensing receptors, such as TLR3 and MyD88, as a result of infection, thus leading to a strong anti-viral defense early during CHIKV infection (
