<p>As CHIKV infection spreads, host immune responses are activated by engaging various subsets of myeloid cells as well as lymphocytes to control this spread. A major event in the acute phase is infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and other lymphocytes to the primary sites of infection, mainly joints and muscles, leading to hypertrophy in the cells of synovial lining as well as surrounding synovial vessels (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) that manifests as arthralgia in the patients (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). This cellular infiltration is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines rich milieu at the sites of infection (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). CCL2 (MCP-1) is a major chemokine that is produced by various cell types like endothelial, fibroblasts, epithelial, smooth muscle, mesangial, astrocytic, monocytic, and microglial cells (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>–
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Macrophages, being the major source of CCL2, regulate the infiltration of monocytes and NK cells to the site of infection. Cessation in macrophage recruitment by using Bindarit, a modulator of CCL2 production, has shown reduced inflammation in synovial and skeletal muscle tissues (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Another study showed contrasting results in which CCR2
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited increased foot swelling and cartilage erosion upon CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Macrophages are also known to be the reservoirs of CHIKV in later stages of infection (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which possibly plays an important role in prolonged inflammation. CCR2 plays an important role in controlling inflammation and musculoskeletal pathology by maintaining the balance of monocytes and neutrophil infiltration to the infected tissues (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). CCR2
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice upon CHIKV infection showed enhanced arthritic symptoms without any significant change in viremia, as compared to wild type mice. Also, the monocyte/macrophage infiltrates were replaced by an enhanced neutrophil infiltration, followed by eosinophils infiltrates as well (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). These results suggest that neutrophils are one of the key mediators of arthritic symptoms and tissue damage in CHIKV infection by releasing granules carrying antimicrobial molecules and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to an oxidative burst, which is also a well-established feature of neutrophils in other models of inflammation (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Neutrophils are also known to produce an anti-viral effect in an alternate way, by forming neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) through a process called NETosis. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> CHIKV infection in neutrophils isolated from mice resulted in the formation of NETs through TLR7 and ROS dependent mechanism. Also, the correlation of NETosis with susceptibility and viral load has been shown in IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice model and CHIKV infected patients, respectively, suggesting the anti-CHIKV role of NETosis (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). NETs are also known to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a subtype of dendritic cells, which secrete high levels of IFN-I (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). In CHIKV infection, the virus is sensed by pDCs in an indirect manner that results in selective IRF7 activation and type-I IFN production without the involvement of other inflammatory cytokine responses (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>).
