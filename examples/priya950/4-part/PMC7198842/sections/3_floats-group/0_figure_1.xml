  <p>Sequence of events during CHIKV infection: infected 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito deposits the virus into the dermis and epidermis of the skin. The viral infection is characterized by an incubation period of which is followed by the acute phase during which a rapid rise in viremia occurs and clinical symptoms such as joint pain, fever, maculopapular and petechial rash appear. As the viral load increases the host innate and adaptive immune responses are evoked simultaneously. IgM and IgG levels rise and the virus is resolved from the host. Despite the robust host immune response, viral particles persist in the synovial fluid of joints and alter joint pathology resulting in a chronic phase that lasts for months/years.
