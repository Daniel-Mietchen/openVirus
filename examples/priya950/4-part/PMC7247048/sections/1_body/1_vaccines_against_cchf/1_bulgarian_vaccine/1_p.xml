<p>Even though there is not a globally recognized vaccine for CCHFV, there is a vaccine that has been in use in Bulgaria since 1974. The Bulgarian vaccine originated in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This is an inactivated vaccine prepared from brain tissue of CCHFV infected newborn mice. Inactivation of the CCHFV particles was brought about by a combination of chloroform and heat treatment. The vaccine is administered subcutaneously multiple times in risk groups who are more than 16 years old. Between 1974 and 1996, there was a precipitous drop in cases (from 1105 to 279) reported to the Bulgarian Ministry of Health and fewer than 20 cases reported per annum after 1996.

 </sup> Remarkably, there were no reported cases from military and laboratory personnel who were vaccinated.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the decrease in reported Bulgarian cases could have been independent of vaccine efficacy but a product of other factors. The observed reduction could have been attributed to a change in CCHFV epidemiology and ecology in the absence of deliberate intervention.

 </sup> Increased CCHFV awareness could have led to behavior change thus reduced tick exposure or a different case definition and reporting following the introduction of vaccine.
