<p>Although the mouse brain-derived vaccine has been in use in Bulgaria, the vaccine is not a viable option for widespread global use largely due to safety concerns and lack of efficacy trials. Propagating CCHFV in brain tissue of newborn mice requires biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities. International approval of this vaccine is unlikely because of safety concerns surrounding the mouse neural tissue content, which has potential to cause autoimmune and allergic responses

 </sup> and the requirement for high containment facilities for propagation. Furthermore, the Bulgarian vaccine requires multiple immunizations with vaccinations every 5 years to preserve immunity. Individuals below the age of 16 do not qualify to receive the vaccine and leaves a fraction of the population without immunity to the virus. Apart from that, the efficacy of the Bulgarian vaccine is yet to be demonstrated in clinical trials.
