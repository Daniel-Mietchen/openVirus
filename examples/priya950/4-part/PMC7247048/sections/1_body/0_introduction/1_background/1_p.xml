<p>Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is exclusively associated with a virulent disease in humans. In the absence of approved therapeutics or vaccines against the virus, treatment is predominantly supportive. CCHFV possesses a trisegmented negative-sense RNA genome and is classified within the 
 <italic>Orthonairovirus</italic> genus of the 
 <italic>Nairoviridae</italic> family. Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was medically recognized in 1944 in the wake of an outbreak involving military personnel stationed in the Crimean peninsula, and the medical condition was named Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CHF).

 </sup> A viral etiology and a tick-borne origin for CHF were proposed after 
 <italic>Hyalomma marginatum</italic> tick filtrates produced the disease in human volunteers and individuals with psychiatric disorders.

 </sup> Following the Crimean peninsula outbreak, numerous epidemics of related disease conditions were described in Central Asia, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union.

 </sup> Meanwhile, Dr. Courtois from the Belgian Congo isolated a virus from a febrile teenage boy using newborn mice in 1956, and the virus was designated Congo virus strain V3011.

 </sup> The causative agent of CHF was isolated in 1967 in newborn mice after intracerebral inoculation.

 </sup> Characterization studies of agents responsible for global tick-borne diseases, at the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, established that the agent causing CHF was antigenically similar to Congo virus strain V3011.

 </sup> The names were subsequently combined and the virus named CCHFV.
