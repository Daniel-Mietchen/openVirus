<p>Animal models for CCHF have recently been described. Previously, besides humans, the only other vertebrate known to be susceptible to CCHFV were newborn mice and rats. The immature immune systems of these infant rodents meant these animals could not serve as models. CCHF infections in immunocompetent animals result in transient viremia and absence of noticeable symptoms.

 </sup> Experimental infection of knockout mice with CCHFV displayed some disease signs and physiological changes, which parallel findings in humans, although differences are found in rapidity of disease onset and level of lethality. The first animal models described lacked signaling either to all the three types of interferons (STAT-1
 <sup>−/−</sup>)
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>
 </sup> or type 1 interferon (IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup>).

 </sup> Besides the knockout mice, a mouse model whose type 1 interferon system is temporarily suppressed IS has been described.

 </sup> The knockout models and the (IS) model are permissive to infection, succumbing to CCHFV infection within 5 days. STAT-1 knockout mice present with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated levels of serum hepatic alanine aminotransferase, and proinflammatory cytokines.

 </sup> CCHFV RNA is widespread in tissues of STAT-1
 <sup>−/−</sup> and IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse models.

 </sup> Additionally, a humanized mouse model was prepared by injecting NSG-SGM3 mice with CD34
 <sup>+</sup> human stem cells.

 </sup> The humanized model displayed different disease patterns when inoculated with CCHF strain from Oman and Turkey. Lethal outcomes and neurological disease were only observed with the Turkish strain.

 </sup> A nonhuman primate model was described in 2018. 
 <italic>Cynomolgus macaque</italic> infected with the Kosova Hoti CCHFV strain developed disease patterns and outcomes characteristic of CCHF human cases.

 </sup> In an independent comparative investigation in 
 <italic>Cynomolgus macaque</italic>, animals infected with the CCHFV Afghanistan strain (Afg09-2990) and the Kosova Hoti CCHFV strain developed a clinical picture, laboratory clinical chemistry, and hematological parameters, as well as serum cytokine levels commonly seen in humans.

 </sup> However, all the 12 animals recovered, unlike the infection studies involving the Kosova Hoti strain, in which only 25% (1/4) of the animals did not meet euthanasia criteria. The nonhuman primate model has provided evidence regarding the ability of CCHFV to replicate and persist in the testes of monkeys, opening the possibility of sexual transmission.
