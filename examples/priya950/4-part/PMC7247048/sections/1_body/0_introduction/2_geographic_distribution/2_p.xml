<p>CCHF cases have over the past few years been described in new regions while the disease has re-emerged in some countries after periods of inactivity. CCHF was first described in Turkey in the year 2000, and the country has the highest incidence of CCHF cases per annum with a mortality rate slightly below 5%.

 </sup> Over 1660 cases were reported by Russian Pro-Med between 2005 and 2017.

 </sup> The first recorded CCHF cases in Spain were described in 2016 from an adult male (an index case) who most likely acquired infection through a tick bite and a nosocomially acquired infection by a health professional who nursed the index case.

 </sup> Even though CCHF has not been described in some countries, the presence of CCHFV in ticks and CCHFV-specific antibodies in wild and domesticated ruminants have been demonstrated.

 </sup> However, in some regions, the observed increase in reported cases could be a product of improved awareness and diagnostic capacity. CCHFV poses a zoonotic risk with public health implications and as such CCHF is a notifiable disease. Nonetheless, with the exception of Turkey reporting more than 50 cases per year,
