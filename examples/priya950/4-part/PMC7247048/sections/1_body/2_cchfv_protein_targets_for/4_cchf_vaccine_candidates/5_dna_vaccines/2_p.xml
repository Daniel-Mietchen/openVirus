<p>Vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy studies in IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> and interferon receptor antibody transiently suppressed (IS) mouse models were compared after intramuscular electroporation of a DNA expression vector encoding the entire GPC of the IbAr 10200 CCHFV strain

 </sup> Antibody responses in the two mouse models reflected a predominant Th1 response and the IS mouse model had a significantly lower Th1/Th2 ratio indicating balanced antibody responses with the immunocompetent mice.

 </sup> Although a higher survival rate after the lethal challenge was observed in the IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> model, with 71.4% (5 out 7 animals) compared with the IS model, with 60% (6 out 10 animals), this was not statistically different. Significantly, complete protection was not achieved in both mouse models.
