<p>Vaccinating IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice twice with a DNA vector encoding the complete NP of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 or codelivery of the DNA vectors encoding the complete NP of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 and the cluster differentiation 24 (CD24), protected animals from lethal challenge infection

 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Codelivery of CD24 and NP significantly enhanced induction of Th1 and Th2 cytokines as well as antibody responses, although the elicited antibodies lacked neutralization ability. Intramuscular administration of a DNA vector encoding the complete NP gene of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 produced 75% protection from lethal challenge infection, whereas a 50% survival rate was observed in the antibody passive transfer and T cell adoptive transfer experiment
