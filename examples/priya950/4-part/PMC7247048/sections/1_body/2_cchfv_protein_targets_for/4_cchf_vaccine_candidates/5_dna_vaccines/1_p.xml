<p>DNA vaccines do provide an attractive alternative for emerging and re-emerging pathogens such as CCHFV. DNA vaccines are temperature stable and can be designed to incorporate specific immunogenic viral proteins desired for immunization. Depending on the immune correlates of protection, genetic vaccines can be tailored to raise either type 1 T-helper (Th) or type 2 Th cell responses.

 </sup> DNA immunization also allows for the differentiation between natural infections and vaccine-induced responses since specific antigens are selected. The mechanisms of inducing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity are similar for DNA vaccines and live attenuated vaccines, but the risk of reverting to virulence associated with the latter is eliminated in DNA vaccines.

 </sup> A DNA-based vector designed to deliver the GPC of the IbAr 10200 CCHFV strain was first described in 2006. The CCHFV vaccine construct was either delivered three times individually or coadministered with DNA vectored vaccine constructs for Hantaan and Rift Valley fever viruses encoding the GPC and tick-borne encephalitis virus encoding the premembrane and envelope genes (

 </sup> Induction of cell-mediated immune responses was not evaluated and challenge studies were not performed. Intradermal immunization (three times) of a DNA vector encoding the mature CCHFV envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the NP of the IbAr 10200 strain, elicited antibody and T cell immune responses, which protected IFNAR

 </sup> (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing antibodies compared with the CCHFV DNA vaccine but protection was partial. These findings imply that neutralizing antibodies are not the sole correlate of CCHFV protection.
