<p>Recombinant viruses have been extensively investigated as vectors in gene therapy and gene delivery for vaccine development. Viral expression systems explored for CCHF vaccine development comprise the modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA),

  <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>
 </sup> recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>
 </sup> recombinant adenovirus type 5 (AdV-5),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
  <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>
 </sup> and recombinant bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BoHV-4).

 </sup> The MVA platform was used to deliver the GPC and the NP of the IbAr 10200 CCHFV strain. The N-termini of the GPC and NP were fused to the human tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence, whereas a V5 epitope tag was fused to the C-termini. An mH5 promoter was selected to drive gene transcription. The MVA-based vaccine constructs were administered two times intramuscularly (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses and complete protection in IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>
 </sup> after intradermal lethal challenge. Although the MVA-delivered NP induced humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice, the immune responses could not protect animals from lethal challenge infection.

 </sup> A replication-competent recombinant VSV encoding the CCHFV GPC gene of the IbAr 10200 CCHFV strain yielded 100% protection in a STAT-1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse model following single intraperitoneal immunization, while a replication-deficient VSV construct did not confer protection from intraperitoneally administered lethal virus challenge
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The replication-competent construct developed nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and two of these SNPs were nonsense mutations, which resulted in the truncation of part of the C-terminal tail of the Gc protein. Interestingly, although 100% protection was observed with the prime and boost group, the prime group elicited higher IgG and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing antibody titers compared with the boost group at the endpoint. The clinical data and immunohistochemistry analysis of the spleen and liver of study animals suggested higher CCHFV replication in the prime group compared with the boost group thus viral challenge may have served as a heterologous booster for the prime group.

 </sup> A CCHFV NP-based candidate vaccine based on the human adenovirus 5 encoding the NP of the CCHFV strain IbAr 10200 partially protected IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice against virus challenge
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A prime-boost strategy improved protection and resulted in reduced clinical signs compared with single-dose vaccination. IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice immunized intraperitoneally with a recombinant AdV-5 encoding the NP from the Turkey-Kelkit06 strain survived challenge with CCHFV Ank-2 strain, and half of the mice survived a lethal challenge in the antibody passive transfer and T cell adoptive transfer experiment
