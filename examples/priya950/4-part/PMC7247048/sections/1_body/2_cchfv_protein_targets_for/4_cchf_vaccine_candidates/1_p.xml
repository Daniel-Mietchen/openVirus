<p>The search for a CCHF vaccine has accelerated in recent years, and this has been partly attributed to the discovery of animal models for CCHF. Before the recognition of the animal models, there have been few attempts described in literature and vaccine efficacy studies were not performed. Investigated CCHF vaccine approaches include subunit antigen preparations, genetically modified plants, as well as DNA and viral vectors expressing CCHFV antigens, transcriptionally competent virus-like particles (VLPs), messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, and inactivated whole CCHFV particles.
