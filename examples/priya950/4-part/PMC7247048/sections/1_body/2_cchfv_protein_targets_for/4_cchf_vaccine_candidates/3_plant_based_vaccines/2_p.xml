<p>Vertebrate animals, particularly domestic animals, are significant in CCHFV transmission cycle. Reducing viral amplification in vertebrates could decrease CCHFV transmission to humans. Genetically modified tobacco plants expressing the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc from an Iranian strain were fed to BALB/c mice (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Gn and Gc glycoproteins were genetically engineered to form one reading frame. Immunized mice elicited CCHFV-specific anti-Gn/Gc IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and fecal material. End boost groups induced higher endpoint antibody titers (1:32768) compared with the fed groups (1:256). Interestingly, fecal pellets had higher IgA endpoint titer (1:512) compared with serum (1:256).
