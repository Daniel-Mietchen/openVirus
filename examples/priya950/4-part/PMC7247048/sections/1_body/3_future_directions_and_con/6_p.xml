<p>Since animals, particularly livestock, play an important role in CCHFV transmission cycle, the ability of vaccines to prevent viremia in livestock could reduce the rate of transmission to humans. CCHF human vaccine development has accelerated in recent years, and some vaccine studies have reported promising results in animal models. Whether these results can be translated to human clinical trials remains to be seen. Vaccine design and efficacy can be further enhanced by the delineation of correlates of CCHF protection which up to now have remained an enigma.</p>
