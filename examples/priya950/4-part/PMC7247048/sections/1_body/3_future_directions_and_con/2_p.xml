<p>Currently, immune responses conferring protection following CCHFV infection have not yet been described. CCHFV-neutralizing antibodies are likely produced against the Gn and Gc glycoproteins, which bind target cells,
 <sup>

 </sup> thus vaccine attempts focused on the M segment. Studies have demonstrated the absence of correlation between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization and protection in the available mouse models.

 </sup> Future studies should probe and delineate factors responsible for the observed differences between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization and protective efficacy. CCHFV is genetically diverse and the concern is whether a single vaccine can protect against global CCHFV strains. So far, efficacy studies against genetic strains have only been investigated for a VRP vaccine candidate.

 </sup> Recently, NP-based vaccine candidates have also resulted in complete protection in knockout mice despite the absence of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing antibodies.

 </sup> The NP has thus proved to be an important vaccine target. Since B and T cell epitopes have been mapped on the glycoproteins and NPs, efforts can be directed in developing multiepitope-based vaccines. Epitope-based vaccines would be one way to develop an effective vaccine against the diverse CCHFV strains by selecting multiple antigenic epitopes. The design of epitope-based vaccines allows B or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes to be linked together in series with helper T lymphocyte epitopes ensuring CD4 T cells and pathogen-derived molecules are appropriately primed facilitating robust humoral and CTL responses.

 </sup> One characteristic of an ideal vaccine is that it should confer long-term sterilizing immunity after single administration. Despite several vaccine strategies providing complete protection of knockout mice after viral challenge (
 <xref rid="tb1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), protective single-dose regimens have been achieved by a rVSV-based vaccine expressing the GPC
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>
 </sup> and a VRP vaccine,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
  <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>
 </sup> whereas the rest were administered using a prime/boost approach. Additionally, mice administered with the VRP vaccine did not develop clinical disease signs and CCHFV RNA was not detected in tissues at study end point. While complete protection has been achieved using a single-dose regimen, none of the available candidate vaccines has been evaluated for their ability to induce long-term immunity. Immune responses against either the NP or the GPC have been protective in efficacy studies necessitating the investigation of the role of both proteins in vaccine development. A thorough dissection of immune responses generated by the NP and GPC whether singly or in combination can help unmask the immune correlates of protection.
