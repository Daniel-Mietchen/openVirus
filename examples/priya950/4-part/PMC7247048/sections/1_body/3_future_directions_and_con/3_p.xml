<p>The use of genetic adjuvants to enhance immune responses in CCHF vaccine development has been sparsely investigated. Plasmid-expressing cytokines such as interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor,

 <sup>
  <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125–127</xref>
 </sup> have been investigated as genetic adjuvants 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> with promising results in different settings. In the sole CCHF vaccine study using genetic adjuvants described in the literature, the CD24 costimulatory molecule was codelivered with the CCHFV NP. CD24 enhanced antibody and cytokine responses, although this was not translated to protective efficacy studies.
