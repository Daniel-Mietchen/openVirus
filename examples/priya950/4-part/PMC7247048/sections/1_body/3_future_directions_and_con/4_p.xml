<p>The prototype IbAr 10200 CCHFV strain has mostly been used in vaccine studies. This prototype CCHFV strain was discovered in a tick

 </sup> VLP-bearing glycoproteins from the IbAr 10200 CCHF strain displayed the reduced capacity to enter monocyte-derived macrophages. The effect in stimulating immune responses although remains to be elucidated. Considering the diversity of the CCHFV glycoproteins, it will be interesting to evaluate if differences in amino acid sequences between various global CCHFV strains does affect immunogenicity.
