<p>In one study, the phage treatment of germ-free mice led to the expansion of immune cells in the intestine. It was reported that 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic> phages stimulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ) via Toll-like receptor 9, a member of the pattern recognition receptors, which are the mediators of innate immunity. Moreover, UC patients responsive to FMT had a reduced number of phages compared with non-responders, while mucosal IFN-γ positively correlated with the concentration of phages. It was also found that phages from active UC patients induced a higher IFN-γ response compared with controls [
