<p>An important aspect of possible PT for IBD that must be addressed is whether phages activate the immune system of the human host in a way which could cause inappropriate immune responses. Any phage engineered to be usable for PT should not be recognized by the immune system of the human organism. Several studies documented the ability of phages to stimulate the production of antibodies (
