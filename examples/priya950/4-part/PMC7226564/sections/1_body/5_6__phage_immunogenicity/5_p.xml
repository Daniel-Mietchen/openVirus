<p>There is a lack of experimental data regarding whether phage immunogenicity is related to the phage life cycle. Virulent and lysogenic life cycles have their advantages and reasons to be used. One might argue that introducing a preparation of several phages (referred to as a “phage cocktail”) into the colon of an IBD patient that could not incorporate its genetic information into bacteria may be important. Lysogenic phages might not destroy the desired bacterial strain and, thus, be so efficient in comparison with lytic phages. Therefore, phages for IBD patients may be engineered to lack integrase, the enzyme responsible for genome integration [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01013-f004">Figure 4</xref>A–C). It might be beneficial if the phage stayed incorporated in the genome of the bacteria of the host (otherwise, it would get depleted from the colon eventually), ready to strike if the balance of gut microbiota shifted toward a dysbiotic state. With these and many more questions in mind, how important the aspect of the phage life cycle will be for the efficiency of PT remains to be found.
