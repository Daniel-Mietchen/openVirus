<p>On the basis of these findings, it could seem that phages affect the environment of the gut negatively. However, there is evidence that they may also act in an anti-inflammatory manner. In one study, the T4 phage was immunomodulatory by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, this phage inhibited ROS generation from peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with either lipopolysaccharides or strains of
