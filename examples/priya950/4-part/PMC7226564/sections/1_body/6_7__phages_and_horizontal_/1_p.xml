<p>In addition to the immunogenicity, phages may provide bacteria via horizontal gene transfer with additional genetic material (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01013-f005">Figure 5</xref>Aâ€“E). Such genes may code toxins and products facilitating, for example, adhesion to the mucosa and invasion into the tissue or evasion from the immune cells of the host. For instance, a group of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains produce Shiga toxins, which originally came from phages [

 <italic>C. difficile</italic> was examined. While none of the phages were able to convert the bacteria to produce the toxin, phage infection resulted in an increase in toxin B production [
