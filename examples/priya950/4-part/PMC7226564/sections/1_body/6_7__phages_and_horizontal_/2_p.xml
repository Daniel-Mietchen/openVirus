 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the causative agent of cholera epidemics, has its main two virulence factors (cholera toxin and toxin coregulated pilus) of phage origin as well. These are encoded by phage CTXφ, and even other phages cooperating with CTXφ were characterized [

 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> uses a specialized type III secretion system to translocate effector proteins into host cells. The effector proteins are conserved among 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, and it is presumably a result of horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, phages carrying antibacterial resistance genes were detected in the sputum from cystic fibrosis patients [
 <xref rid="B60-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Conversely, another study analyzed the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in more than one thousand phage genomes. On the basis of the results, the authors concluded that the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in phages was vastly overestimated and is much more rare than previously thought [
