<p>Instead of acting directly, viruses may shape the effect of bacteria indirectly, for example, via lysogeny. Experimental data suggested that SopEPhi, a member of P2 family of phages, is able to transfer genes between different 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> strains by lysogenic conversion [
 <xref rid="B62-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. One such gene codes the SopE effector protein. This protein triggers mucosal inflammation via the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of interleukin-1Î² [
 <xref rid="B63-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Therefore, phage SopEPhi indirectly contributes to the development of colitis in streptomycin-pretreated mice [
 <xref rid="B64-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Some proteins are even able to bind C5a, a component of the complement system, and inhibit the chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes. This category is represented by an exoprotein CHIPS (chemotaxis inhibitory protein of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) produced by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B65-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
