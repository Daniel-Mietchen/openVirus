<p>The term “phage therapy” refers to the modulation of phageome and subsequently bacteriome of a person suffering from a disease which is thought to stem from bacterial origin. Usually, it involves several steps: modification of the genetic information of an existing phage in a way which ensures successful adsorption to the desired bacterial strain; preparation of either one or more phage strains; creation of a dosing schedule and administration of the phage preparation to the patient.</p>
