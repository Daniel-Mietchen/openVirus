<p>Relatively recently, metagenomic analyses began to uncover differences in the amount and abundance of viral sequences in stool samples from IBD patients. In one such study, patients who were found to have sequences from family 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> showed an increased diversity of their microbiome [

 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic> transcripts in UC patients compared with CD patients and controls. In the study, the samples from early-diagnosed treatment-naive IBD patients were used. Patients suffering from CD showed increased abundance of 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> compared with controls. The gut mucosa of UC samples was characterized by the lower concentration of 
 <italic>Polydnaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Tymoviridae</italic>, while the CD gut mucosa had reduced abundance of 
 <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> [
