<p>Tokarz et al. recently published an analysis of the stool virome of pediatric UC patients. Their findings contradicted the accepted notion of the association of viruses with UC. Despite discovering a significantly higher occurrence of anelloviruses in the UC cohort compared with controls, they did not find any viral taxa that could be implicated in the onset of UC. This led to the conclusion that the presence of viruses in stool was not associated with the onset of UC [

 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> seem to be important in the pathogenesis of

A study by Hannigan et al. did not find significant differences in Shannon diversity or viral richness between patients and healthy controls. Their findings suggested an indirect role for the virome by altering the bacterial community [
