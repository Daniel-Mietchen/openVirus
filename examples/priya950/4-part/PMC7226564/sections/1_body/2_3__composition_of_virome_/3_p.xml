<p>To date, studies fail to provide a definite answer, as some suggested that no differences exist between ulcerated and non-ulcerated mucosa [

 <xref rid="B27-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, whether healthy or ulcerated mucosa is inhabited by more bacteria and the exact role of phages in their abundance are unclear.
