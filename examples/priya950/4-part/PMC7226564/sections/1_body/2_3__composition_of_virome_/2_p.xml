<p>One of the first reports regarding the composition of viruses in gut samples came from Reyes et al. They analyzed the composition of the fecal virome in adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers throughout a period of one year. They also found that, while the composition of the fecal bacteriome showed a higher degree of similarity compared with unrelated individuals, viromes were unique to an individual regardless of any genetic relatedness. Moreover, despite high interpersonal variability, intrapersonal differences remained low [

 <italic>Siphoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Myoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Podoviridae</italic>, among others belonging to the order 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic>, were found to be most abundant [

This research group later continued with the assessment of bacterial and viral populations in samples from CD patients in various stages of the disease in comparison with control individuals. Interestingly, the impact of individual variability and sample origin on the composition of viral communities was larger than the presence of CD. On the basis of these findings, the authors concluded that bacteria reflect disease status in a more accurate manner than viruses [
