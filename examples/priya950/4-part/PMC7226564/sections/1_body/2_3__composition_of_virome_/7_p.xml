<p>Several caveats should be considered when assessing the usefulness of metagenomic studies. Firstly, there is still no widely accepted consensus regarding the protocol of sample collection or data evaluation. This fact contributes to the variability of the results, which makes the comparison of studies in this area more difficult. Secondly, in their study, Wang et al. mentioned that approximately one in four reads was unclassified [

The ratios reported by other studies vary considerably, but many viral sequences must apparently be characterized in order to obtain a complete picture. However, higher abundance of a certain taxon does not have to mean a direct causal relationship with any disease. Indeed, there is still much to be unraveled. Accordingly, our current understanding of virome in health and disease may be biased. Therefore, additional experiments will have to be undertaken to assess the precise role of virome in the development and progression of diseases, including IBD.
