<p>Although PT may be a reliable option against an infection caused by a single bacterial strain, there are situations in which a multitude of phages may be needed. Creating a phage cocktail is possible; however, compared with antibiotics, this approach is much more challenging [

Another probably less-known constraint for phages may be their region-restricted efficiency. This knowledge comes from a study in which phages were more effective against diarrhea-associated

This consists mostly of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids that form together a net-like structure. The penetration of this layer presents a challenge for antibiotics. However, evolution endowed phages with various enzymes capable of biofilm degradation. Phages can, thus, infect bacteria that would otherwise remain unreachable [

 <xref rid="B80-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Thus, phages possess advantages and disadvantages compared with antibiotics, and it would perhaps be unreasonable to try to think of PT as a complete substitution for antibiotics. Hence, there will always be cases in which antibiotics as a treatment of choice will be more effective and vice versa.
