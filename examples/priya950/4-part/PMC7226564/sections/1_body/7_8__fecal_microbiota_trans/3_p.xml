<p>Although the efficiency of FMT extends even beyond gastrointestinal diseases [
 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], the majority of studies used freshly prepared fecal suspensions. These suspensions usually contain viable bacteria to achieve the desired effect. Until the work of Ott and colleagues, it was not known what would happen if the donor fecal matter was sterile instead. Using filters with a pore diameter of up to 0.2 Î¼m, they removed any bacteria from the fecal suspension. Next, they administered the filtrate to five CDI patients. Interestingly, in all five patients, symptoms of CDI were eliminated, and the improved condition lasted for at least six months. Given that no living bacteria were present in the filtrates, the authors suggested the action of phages as a possible explanation [

The question is whether such an FMT graft devoid of living bacteria is able to mediate the desired therapeutic effect, such as alleviation of IBD or other gastrointestinal diseases. Removing the necessity of the presence of living bacteria in FMT graft could also provide an option for immunocompromised patients.
