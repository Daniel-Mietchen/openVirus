<p>Our previous findings suggest that the effect of bacterial therapy can be at least partially mediated by various parts of the bacterial cell, as even non-viable bacterial vectors showed certain therapeutic effect in IBD treatment [

 <xref rid="B75-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Taken together, it seems that the beneficial effect of FMT may not be entirely conferred by living bacteria and other mechanisms might play crucial role, including phages present on the graft. However, there is not yet enough evidence to conclude that knowledge is applicable in IBD management.
