<p>In addition to the concern of safety, it must be established if the administration of a large dose of phages could not cause the excessive breakdown of bacteria in a short amount of time. This could lead to a high release of enterotoxins that could act as proinflammatory mediators and, thus, provoke overstimulation of the immune system. Moreover, the mere presence of phages and their antigens might represent a direct immunogenic factor for the intestinal immune system. How the immune system reacts to various phage-associated antigens systemically and locally in the gut was not sufficiently explored. Thus, more research is crucial to evaluate the impact of the virome on IBD, and whether this impact could provide grounds for future therapeutic implications remains to be found.</p>
