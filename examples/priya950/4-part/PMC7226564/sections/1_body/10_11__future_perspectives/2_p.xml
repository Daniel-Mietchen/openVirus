<p>So far, the majority of studies focusing on the composition of the virome in IBD identified the abundance at only a single time point. It might be interesting to see if changes in the composition of the virome during IBD correspond to the changes in the severity of the disease. In this regard, constructing a reference phageome of a healthy person could prove useful, and it could be viewed as another step bringing us closer to personalized medicine. Despite a growing body of research, experimental data are still relatively scarce in the field of the virome composition and effect in IBD, especially studies focusing on multiple time points. Along with any change in the severity of inflammation during remission or relapse, bacterial and viral populations likely adapt to the ever-changing conditions in the colonic environment.</p>
