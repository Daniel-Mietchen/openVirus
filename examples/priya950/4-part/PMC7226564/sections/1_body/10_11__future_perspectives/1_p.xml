<p>For decades, the gut microbiota as a potential modulator of the development and progression of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including IBD was mostly overlooked by scientists. In recent years, the trend turned in favor of the intestinal microbiota; yet, from all the organisms that form the gut biosphere, bacteria are the main target of research. We believe that viruses, especially phages, deserve our attention as well. Although research in this field advanced considerably, there are still many challenges that must be resolved. For instance, it would be beneficial to see any potential changes in the composition of the intestinal phageome during the course of IBD.</p>
