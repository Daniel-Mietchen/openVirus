<p>Phage-based approaches hold the potential to become a valid alternative option for the treatment of not only gastrointestinal diseases, including IBD. The results of present-day research suggest that the introduction of a phage cocktail via FMT or PT into the colon of patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases is harmless and might provide a therapeutic benefit. However, mechanisms governing the key aspects, such as immunogenicity, horizontal gene transfer, or the composition of virome and phageome during flares and remissions, must continue to be studied to prove the potential. The complexity of the topic and the lack of hard evidence make it difficult to draw conclusions. In this regard, the creation of a standardized protocol for the isolation, detection, and quantification of viruses in the stool and intestinal biopsy samples and a reference panel for a healthy virome may prove helpful.</p>
