<p>On the basis of the condition of the surrounding environment, phages constantly assess the probability of their success in reproduction via the fitness of their bacterial host. Some hypotheses provided explanations on the basis of experimental data. For instance, Clooney et al. hypothesized that one of the conditions contributing to a healthy colon is the presence of a “healthy” core virome [

 <xref rid="B29-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The healthy core virome was absent in IBD samples. Moreover, it seems that IBD may be accompanied by a shift in the core virome from a virulent (lytic) life cycle toward temperate (lysogenic). The results are in line with another study where a stable core virome in healthy individuals was observed [
