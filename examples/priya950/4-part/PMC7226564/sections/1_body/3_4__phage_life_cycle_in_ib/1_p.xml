<p>Every organism capable of reproduction (either via division, mating, or, in the case of viruses, using their hosts) is under evolutionary pressure. Because of this pressure, animals constantly try to increase their fitness and outcompete their competitors, usually by gaining food resources, shelter possibilities, or number of offspring. Since viruses and bacteria are one of the oldest forms of life on Earth, there is an ancient competition among them, probably as old as life itself. Due to the occurrence of mutations in each new generation, a few bacteria escape their viral attackers on every occasion. However, this process works vice versa as well; in each new generation, a few viral particles are slightly different from the rest, which means that even the mutated bacteria may not be completely protected against these viruses. Therefore, this constant struggle may resemble an “arms race” where both sides are doing their best to outcompete their opponent [
