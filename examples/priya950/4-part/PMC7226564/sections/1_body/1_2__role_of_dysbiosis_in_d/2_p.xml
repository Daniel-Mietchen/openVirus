If the composition of the intestinal microbiome undergoes massive qualitative and quantitative changes and the balance is impaired, then a dysbiotic state occurs. Dysbiosis has a negative influence on the health of a person, as it is associated with many even seemingly unrelated diseases including liver disease [
