<p>It is estimated that an average human colon contains approximately 10
 <sup>11</sup> bacterial cells per one gram of fecal content [

 <sup>12</sup> bacteria on the skin and 10
 <sup>13</sup> in the intestine. This huge amount is said to outnumber the cells of our own body by a factor of 10 and continues to be frequently cited even in present day [
