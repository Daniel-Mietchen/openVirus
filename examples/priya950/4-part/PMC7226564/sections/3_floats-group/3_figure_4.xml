  <p>Modulation of phage therapy. The phage attaches to its host and incorporates its genetic information into the DNA of the host (
   <bold>A</bold>). If the bacterium was to be destroyed, for example, because of dysbiosis or pathogenicity, then the administration of a therapeutic agent (
   <bold>B</bold>) into the colon might induce the lytic cycle of the incorporated phages and subsequently degrade the bacterium (
   <bold>C</bold>).
