  <p>Presence of phages in circulation. Phages may be present in the circulation in a healthy individual (
   <bold>A</bold>) as well as during the course of intestinal inflammation (
   <bold>B</bold>). The higher abundance of phages in the circulation during intestinal inflammation may be due to increased intestinal permeability and the erosion of the mucosal wall.
