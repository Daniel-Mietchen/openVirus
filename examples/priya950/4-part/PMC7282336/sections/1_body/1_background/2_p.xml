<p>HAV transmission occurs when contaminated food or water is ingested (fecal-oral route) and via direct contact with an infectious person. Therefore, to prevent disease transmission, personal hygiene practices are very important. In addition, immunisation should be considered as a high priority. Immunity against HAV is acquired after complete recovery from acute hepatitis A and when properly vaccinated.</p>
