<p>According to the WHO, hepatitis A caused an estimated 7134 deaths in 2016. Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV). Globally, HAV infection occurs sporadically and as outbreaks. It is estimated that approximately 1.4 million people are infected each year.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Korea, one of the world’s high-income countries, has very low HAV endemicity levels, and a high proportion of the population is susceptible to HAV infection.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There were 14 214 cases of hepatitis A reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) from 1 January to 6 September 2019, which is approximately 7.8 times the number of cases reported during the same period in 2018. KCDC attributed this increased incidence to the consumption of contaminated salted clam products and weak herd immunity among young Koreans.
