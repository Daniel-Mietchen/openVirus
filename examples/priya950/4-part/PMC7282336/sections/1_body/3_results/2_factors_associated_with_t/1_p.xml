<p>In the fully adjusted logistic regression model, age, sex, BMI, disease history, hepatitis B status, occupational classification and number of workplace health managers showed significant association with HAV seropositivity (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Working in a workplace with ≥2 health managers (vs no health manager, adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43); age 40–49 years (vs 20–29 years, OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.36 to 2.68); female sex (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.59); and hepatitis B antibody seropositivity (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.49) had relatively greater magnitude of associations compared with the other factors. Regarding the number of health managers, there was a trend towards a higher anti-HAV seroprevalence with an increasing number of workplace health managers (p for trend &lt;0.001).
