<p>According to WHO in 2009, the estimated prevalence of immunity against hepatitis A in Korea increased with age, from 25% among those aged 20–24 years to 66% among those aged 45–54 years.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 2015, Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a population-based survey of anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence of 5856 people revealed that the seroprevalence increased with age, from 12.6% among those aged 19–29 years to 80.3% among those aged 40–49 years.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Our study results were closer to the WHO estimates. The variation in seroprevalence using surveys is likely because of the different conditions and time points at which the surveys were conducted, although there was a consistent trend toward increasing anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence across all surveys.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6</xref> This trend seems to have been due to the decrease in exposure to the HAV of the lower age groups due to the high economic growth and improvement of public health and living conditions in Korea over the past decades.
