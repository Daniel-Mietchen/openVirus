<p>We tried to identify clinical factors that could be used as surrogates of associations between personal behaviour and HAV immunity because several studies have shown that health behaviours were related to vaccination behaviours as well as medication adherence, management of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and dysfunctional health beliefs about obesity,
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> although no previous published studies have directly proved the relationship between personal behaviour and hepatitis A vaccination yet. Indeed, anti-HAV seroprevalence differed significantly by disease history, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol level and fasting blood glucose, suggesting that these factors presumably due to health behaviours related to vaccination rather than clinical or pathological mechanism and among them, disease history and BMI were significantly associated even after adjustment. HBsAb seropositivity was also significantly associated even after adjustment, and this result is understandable because the factor is associated with medical service utilisation. Most importantly, our study demonstrated distinctive difference in anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence with respect to occupational classification and a significant association between the presence of workplace health managers and anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence. In this study, most participants involved in the occupational category of health and social work activities were hospital workers. This higher seroprevalence among hospital workers may be because of the recent HAV epidemics in Korea, which resulted in immunisation campaigns to protect high-risk population such as healthcare providers. In Korea, occupational safety and health acts mandate companies to employ health managers to promote workersâ€™ health; however, the required number varies by size and classification of the business. One of the main duties of health managers is to review the results of regular health examinations and to implement workplace health policies. The positive trend between the number of workplace health managers and anti-HAV seroprevalence in our study suggests the importance of their role. In contrast, workers working for small businesses (without health managers, or with too few health managers) might not be protected against HAV epidemics.
