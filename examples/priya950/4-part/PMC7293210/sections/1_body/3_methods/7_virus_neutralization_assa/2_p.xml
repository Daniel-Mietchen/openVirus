<p id="Par33">Alternatively, VNA against RSV A2 or clinical isolate CL57 was determined using recombinant RSV viruses. These viruses encode for the firefly luciferase (FFL), harbor the G and F genes of RSV strains A2 or CL57 in an RSV A2 backbone, and have been derived via a BAC-based reverse genetics system as described in Hotard et al.

 </sup>. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were mixed with RSV A2 or CL57 FFL and incubated prior to the addition of A549 cells. After an incubation period of 20â€‰h, neolite substrate was added and the luminescence signal was measured. VNA titers were calculated as the antibody concentration that caused a 90% reduction in luminescence (expressed as IC90 values (log2)).
