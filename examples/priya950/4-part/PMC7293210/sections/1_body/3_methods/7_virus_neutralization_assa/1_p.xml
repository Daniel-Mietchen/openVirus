<p id="Par32">VNA titers against RSV Long or RSV B1 were determined by a microneutralization assay. Heat-inactivated serial diluted sera were mixed with RSV Long or B1 and incubated for one hour at 37 °C. Subsequently, VERO cells were added. Three days later monolayers were washed and fixed, and RSV replication was determined by measuring RSV F protein expression using a biotin-conjugated anti-F monoclonal antibody. Streptavidin–HRP was added to the wells, and the wells were developed with OPD substrate. VNA titers were calculated as the antibody concentration that caused a 50% reduction in the OD450, expressed as IC50 titers (log2).</p>
