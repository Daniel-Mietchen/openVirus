<p id="Par34">An ELISpot assay was used to determine the number of F protein-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells in the spleen. Splenocytes were stimulated overnight with a peptide pool consisting of 15-mer peptides with an 11-amino-acid-overlap, spanning the whole sequence of the F protein of RSV A2. The numbers of spot-forming units (SFU) were determined using mouse IFN-γ ELISpot kit (MabTech), according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and calculated to numbers of SFU per 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells. Background levels were calculated as the 95% percentile of the SFU observed in non-stimulated splenocytes.
