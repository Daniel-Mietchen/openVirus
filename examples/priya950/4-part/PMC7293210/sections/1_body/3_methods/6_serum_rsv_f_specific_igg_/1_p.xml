<p id="Par31">RSV F-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers in mouse serum were measured using ELISA. Serial dilutions of serum samples were added to plates coated with RSV A2 postfusion F protein. RSV-specific antibody subclasses were quantified using HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG1or IgG2a. Endpoint titers were calculated by linear interpolation.</p>
