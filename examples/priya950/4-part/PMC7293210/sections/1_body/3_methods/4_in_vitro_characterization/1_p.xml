<p id="Par28">Cultured A549 cells were transduced with Ad26.RSV.FA2, Ad26.RSV.preF, or empty Ad26 vector at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5000 or 20,000. Forty-eight hours after Adeno infection, cells were harvested and subjected to temperature shock by incubation for 10 min at the temperatures indicated. Temperature-shocked cells were stained using Alexa647-conjugated CR9501 or CR9503 antibodies, detecting prefusion F or both prefusion and postfusion F, respectively. Dead cells were stained using propidium iodide (PI). Cells were acquired on a FACSCanto, and results were analyzed using FlowJo software. Live cells were gated based on forward and sideward scatter, and PI negativity. The percentage of cells positive for Alexa647 signal was calculated relative to the percentage of positive cells at 37 °C.</p>
