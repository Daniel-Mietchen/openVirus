<p id="Par36">To analyze the Th1/Th2 skewing after immunization, cytokine secretion was assessed in culture supernatant of stimulated splenocytes. Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were stimulated for 48 h with a peptide pool representing the complete F protein in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum. The culture supernatant was harvested and analyzed for the presence of Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, KC/GRO) using the V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Mouse kit (MSD), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
