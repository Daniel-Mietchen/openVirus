<p id="Par35">Antigen-specific cellular immune responses were measured by ICS. Splenocytes were stimulated overnight with an RSV F peptide pool, hamster-anti-mouse CD28 and rat-anti-mouse CD49d. GolgiPlug was added after 1 h. Samples were stained by Amine Reactive Violet dye (Invitrogen) for dead cell discrimination. Anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibodies were used to block Fc receptors and cells were stained with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-PerCpCy5.5, and anti-CD8-APC-H7. The cells were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm and subsequently intracellularly stained using anti-IFN-γ-PE, anti-TNF-α-PE-Cy7, and anti-interleukin (IL)-2-APC antibodies. The percentage of CD3

 <sup>+</sup> and CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 was quantified by flow cytometry using BD FACS Canto II. All reagents were from BD Biosciences. Analysis of flow cytometric data was performed in FlowJo software version 9.6.1 (Ashland, OR). An example of the gating strategy applied is shown in Supplementary Fig.
