<p id="Par25">For studies with neonatal mice, pregnant SPF BALB/c mice (Charles River) were purchased and animals were randomized into groups by gender and litter. On Day 4–5 after birth, neonatal mice were prime-immunized with 1 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of Ad26.RSV.preF subcutaneously (s.c.) in the scuff of the neck (50 µl), and boosted 3 or 6 weeks later where indicated. Control groups received no immunization, or prime-boost immunization with FI-RSV. Cellular responses were evaluated at 9 and 25 weeks and humoral responses at 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, 21, and 25 weeks after prime immunization.
