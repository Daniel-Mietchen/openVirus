<p id="Par15">Cytokine secretion of RSV F-stimulated splenocytes of immunized neonatal mice was measured by a multiplex ELISA-based method. Whereas high expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 was observed in cultures of splenocytes from FI-RSV-immunized neonatal mice, splenocytes from Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized animals secreted increased levels of IFN-γ (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Consequently, the Th1/Th2 ratio, as characterized by IFN-γ/IL-4, IFN-γ/IL-5, and IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio, was significantly higher in Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized group compared to FI-RSV-immunized mice (Fig.
