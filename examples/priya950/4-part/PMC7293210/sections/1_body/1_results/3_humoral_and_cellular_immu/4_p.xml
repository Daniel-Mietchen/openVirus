<p id="Par16">To better assess the influence of the age of the mice on the Th1/Th2 profile, we compared immune responses after subcutaneous immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF shortly after birth (on Day 4 or 5), with subcutaneous immunization of mice of 3â€“4 weeks old in a single study. No meaningful differences were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF-induced cytokine secretion profiles in mice of these age groups, when measured at 9 weeks post immunization (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), resulting in similar Th1/Th2 cytokine ratios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In addition, comparable levels of IgG1 and IgG2a subclass antibodies were observed in both groups when assessed at 25 weeks post immunization (Fig.
