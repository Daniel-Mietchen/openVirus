<p id="Par14">This difference in Th1/Th2 skewing by Ad26.RSV.preF and FI-RSV in neonatal mice was further demonstrated by ICS staining of RSV F-stimulated splenocytes. Significantly increased numbers of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized mice, when compared to mice immunized with FI-RSV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). FI-RSV did induce RSV F-specific CD4+ T cells, as evidenced by increased IL-2 and TNF-α production, but without skewing towards the Th1 phenotype as expression of the prototype Th1 cytokine IFN-γ is very limited. In contrast, induction of Th1 skewed CD4+ T cells is observed after immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF, as demonstrated by increased numbers of RSV.F-specific CD4+ T cells positive for IFN-γ, IL2, and TNF-α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).
