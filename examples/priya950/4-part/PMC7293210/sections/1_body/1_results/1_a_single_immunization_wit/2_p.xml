<p id="Par6">To assess the relative Th1/Th2 skewing, we next compared Ad26.RSV.preF-induced immune responses in adult mice to those induced by FI-RSV given at a dose associated with ERD upon RSV challenge in preclinical animal models

 </sup>. Whereas FI-RSV did not induce VNA titers, VNA titers were induced in all Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized animals. Ad26.RSV.preF-induced antibodies bound both to preF and postF proteins, whereas antibodies induced by FI-RSV were mainly directed against postF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Th1/Th2 skewing of the response was assessed by determining the IgG subclass of postF antibodies. Ad26.RSV.preF induced a predominant Th1 response characterized by relatively high levels of IgG2a antibodies. In contrast, the FI-RSV response was characterized by high levels of IgG1 antibodies, and thus a Th2 skewing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The difference in IgG2a/IgG1 ratio at 10 weeks post immunization was observed for the complete dose range of Ad26.RSV.preF tested (10
 <sup>8</sup>–10
 <sup>10</sup> vp/animal), and also observed when analyzed 4 weeks post immunization (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A</xref>). In a separate study, the immune response induced by intranasal instillation of live RSV was assessed, as a reference for a response not associated with ERD. Intranasal inoculation of mice with 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu live RSV A2 resulted in induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, with a balanced IgG1 to IgG2a response of RSV F-binding antibodies. In addition, systemic IFNγ cellular responses were induced by intranasal application of live RSV A2, although levels were low (Supplementary Fig.
