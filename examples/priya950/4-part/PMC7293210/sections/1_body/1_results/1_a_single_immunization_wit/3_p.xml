<p id="Par7">We additionally evaluated cytokine responses in RSV F-stimulated splenocytes from Ad26.RSV.preF and FI-RSV immunized adult mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Th1/Th2 skewing was determined by calculating the ratio between IFN-γ (as prototypic Th1 cytokine) and IL-4, IL-5, or IL-10 (as prototypic Th2 cytokines). The Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio in samples from mice immunized with FI-RSV was used as reference for a Th2-biased response. Immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF-polarized splenocytes towards IFN-γ production (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The difference in cytokine ratio between Ad26.RSV.preF immunization and FI-RSV immunization was highly significant. In addition, this difference was independent of the dose of the Ad26.RSV.preF vector given (ranging from 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp/animal) (Supplementary Fig.
