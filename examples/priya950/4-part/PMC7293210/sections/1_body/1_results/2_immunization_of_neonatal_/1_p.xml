<p id="Par9">As the intended target populations for the Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine candidate include young infants, the immune responses were studied in neonatal mice representing a very immature immune system. Subcutaneous injection of BALB/c neonatal mice with 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 4–5 after birth resulted in detectable preF and postF ELISA titers at 3 weeks after immunization, that increased up to 6 and 9 weeks after immunization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, upper and middle panels, respectively). VNA titers were detected in sera of all Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized neonatal mice at 6 and 9 weeks post immunization, which were significantly higher compared to VNA titers in sera of non-immunized control mice (

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The ELISA and VNA titers were not significantly increased in groups that received a boost at 3 or 6 weeks after prime-immunization, when compared to animals that received a single immunization (Fig.
