<p id="Par19">In the here presented mouse studies, a second dose of Ad26.RSV.preF did not significantly increase the induced humoral responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast, in non-human primates we recently observed an increase in (neutralizing) antibody titers after immunization with a second homologous dose of an Ad26-based vaccine candidate

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting that the lack of a boost effect on the humoral responses is not due to the presence of anti-Ad26 immunity induced by prime immunization (Supplementary Fig.
