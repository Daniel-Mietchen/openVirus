<p id="Par21">ERD is a serious concern in neonates and young infants. ERD is, among other things, characterized by a Th2-biased immune response. Neonates, both mouse and human, are prone to mount Th2-biased responses, which for mice was shown to be due to epigenetic imprinting in CD4+ T cells

 </sup>. However, neonates are able to mount a Th1-biased response when given the right stimuli

 </sup>. As Th2-biased responses are undesirable for an RSV vaccine intended for the infant population, we carefully examined the Th1/Th2 skewing of the response in neonatal mice immunized with Ad26.RSV.preF. In mice, a Th1-biased immune response is dominated by antibodies of the IgG2a subclass, whereas IgG1 antibodies are a hallmark of a Th2-biased response making the IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio an indication for Th1/Th2 skewing

 </sup>. Upon FI-RSV immunization, a relatively low IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio was observed in both adult and neonatal mice, indicative for a Th2-biased response, although the absolute IgG titers differed considerably between both age groups (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Antibodies induced by Ad26.RSV.preF were strongly dominated by IgG2a in adult mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), whereas a more balanced response between IgG2a and IgG1 was observed in neonatal mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Thus, although differences were observed in the Ad26.RSV.preF response between adult and neonatal mice, the subtyping of the antibody response strongly deviates away from the Th2-biased profile induced by FI-RSV for both age groups. Cytokine profiles induced by FI-RSV were markedly similar between adult and neonatal mice, with relatively high levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Completely different profiles were induced by Ad26.RSV.preF, again very similar in adult and neonatal mice, with high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and background levels for IL-5 and IL-10 (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate a profound Th1 bias of the immune response in both adult and neonatal mice after Ad26.RSV.preF immunization. These data are in line with previously published data on newborn rhesus monkeys showing that an Ad26 vectored vaccine induces CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ when given on the day of birth

 </sup>. Altogether this indicates that the Adenoviral vector platform is able to overcome the Th2 bias of the neonatal immune system, and instead induces Th1-biased responses. Another feature of the FI-RSV-induced immune response thought to contribute to the predisposition to ERD is the induction of antibodies with poor neutralizing capacity. We previously demonstrated that Ad26 encoding wildtype RSV F did not induce any signs of ERD in an adult cotton rat RSV challenge model

 </sup>. We here demonstrate that Ad26.RSV.preF induces even higher levels of neutralizing antibodies accompanied by a higher ratio of RSV neutralizing to RSV postF-binding antibodies, combined with a similar Th1-biased cellular response when compared to Ad26 encoding wildtype RSV F. As these characteristics skew the response away from FI-RSV-induced immune responses, this is highly suggestive of a lack of ERD predisposition by Ad26.RSV.preF.
