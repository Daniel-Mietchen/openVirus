<p id="Par2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an orthopneumovirus of the 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family that causes annual epidemics of acute lower respiratory tract infections, while in addition, reinfection is common

 </sup>. Whereas infections in healthy adults are mild, RSV causes severe disease in immunocompromised persons and elderly
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, RSV remains the leading cause of hospitalization due to respiratory disease in infants and children under 5 years of age
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Despite the high disease burden of this viral pathogen and a strong incentive for vaccine development, no safe and effective vaccine is yet available
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Young infants are an important target population for an infant RSV vaccine, as the disease burden is highest in infants of &lt;6 months of age
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Several factors complicate RSV vaccine development for this target population, which include the relative immaturity of the infant immune system and the presence of maternal anti-RSV antibodies that might suppress vaccine-induced immune responses. Another major obstacle in RSV vaccine development is the legacy of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (ERD). In clinical trials in the 1960s, children vaccinated with formalin-inactivated (FI-) RSV were not protected against natural infection, but instead experienced more severe illness requiring hospitalizations during subsequent natural infection (including two mortalities), compared to children that did not receive this vaccine

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. In the FI-RSV-vaccinated children, the vaccine induced antibodies with poor virus-neutralizing capacity, and those were associated with immune complex formation and complement deposition in the small airways in the infants who died. Studies in animal models have shown that immunization with FI-RSV induced, next to these poorly neutralizing antibodies, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th2-biased responses and reduced cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell priming and evidence of eosinophilia in the lung after RSV challenge
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. The neonatal immune system is characterized by a preferential differentiation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thereby antagonizing T helper 1 (Th1) and cytotoxic responses that are crucial for protection against intracellular pathogens
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the immune profile induced by an ideal RSV candidate for infants should be skewed away from the immune profile induced by FI-RSV and preferably induce Th1 responses, even in the Th2-prone neonatal immune environment.
