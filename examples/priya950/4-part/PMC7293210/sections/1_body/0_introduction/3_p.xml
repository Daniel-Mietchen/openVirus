 </sup>. This contrasts to the Th2-biased profile of FI-RSV vaccine which has been associated with ERD upon infection with RSV. Therefore, the expected Th1 immune response elicited by an adenoviral-vectored RSV vaccine likely minimalizes the probability of ERD upon subsequent RSV infection of vaccine recipients. We have previously shown that immunization with Ad26 encoding the wildtype RSV F transgene elicited strong and long-lasting humoral and cellular responses in adult mice and cotton rats

 </sup>, we have genetically engineered an Ad26 vector encoding the full-length RSV F protein with amino acid substitutions that stabilize the RSV F protein in its prefusion conformation. In our present study we show improved immunogenicity of this Ad26.RSV.preF vector when compared to its parent Ad26.RSV.FA2, and furthermore demonstrate its induction of a potent Th1-biased immune response in neonatal mice.
