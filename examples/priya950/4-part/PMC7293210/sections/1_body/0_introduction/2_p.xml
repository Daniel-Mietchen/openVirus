 </sup>. RSV F is present on the viral surface in a metastable prefusion (preF) conformation, which is easily triggered to convert into a postfusion (postF) conformation. RSV preF is highly immunogenic and most RSV-neutralizing antibodies in human sera are directed against the preF conformation. We previously demonstrated that stabilized preF, when given as protein antigen, elicits superior levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral challenge in animal models when compared to non-stabilized F
