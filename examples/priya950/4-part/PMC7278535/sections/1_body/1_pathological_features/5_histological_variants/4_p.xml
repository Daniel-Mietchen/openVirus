<p id="p0085">In a minority of patients with acute viral hepatitis, confluent necrosis extends throughout entire lobules or acini (
 <bold>panlobular</bold> or 
 <bold>panacinar necrosis</bold>) or several adjacent ones (
 <bold>multilobular</bold> or 
 <bold>multiacinar necrosis</bold>). This is a common feature in patients with fulminant hepatitis. The term ‘massive necrosis’ is also sometimes used, but can be misleading in so far as a needle biopsy specimen may not be representative of the liver as a whole and can lead to over- or underestimation of the true extent of liver damage.

 </xref> This throws doubt on the usefulness of liver biopsy as a means of assessing prognosis in severe acute hepatitis. Sometimes multilobular necrosis involves only the subcapsular zone, and a small needle specimen may then give a falsely pessimistic picture (

 <bold>Fig. 1.3</bold>). In multilobular necrosis the parenchyma is replaced by collapsed stroma, inflammatory cells and activated macrophages (

 </xref> Study of liver biopsies and explanted livers from these patients has shown a consistent pattern of map-like necrosis together with areas of nodular regeneration.
