<p id="p0080">Bridges of confluent necrosis with subsequent collapse may be mistaken for the septa of chronic liver disease. In making the important distinction between them, the pathologist is often helped by stains for elastic tissue. Unlike stains for collagens, these normally give negative results in the parenchyma, but elastic tissue accumulates as septa age.

 </xref> Recent collapse is therefore negative (
