<p id="p0035">The mildest change is cell swelling, and this is probably reversible. The cytoplasm of affected cells is rarified, granular and sometimes finely vacuolated. The more severe degrees of cell swelling are called ballooning degeneration (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6.2</xref> ). This differs from the feathery degeneration of cholestasis, in which the cytoplasm has a reticular pattern (

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.3</xref>), and from the ballooning in steatohepatitis where the cytoplasm is less granular and more oedematous and ‘clarified’ (

 </xref> Shrinkage and increased staining of the cytoplasm, sometimes called acidophilic change or degeneration, is probably a precursor of apoptosis, in which the hepatocytes shrink further, become very dense and undergo fragmentation. The apoptotic bodies seen lying free in the sinusoids represent the largest fragments or entire unfragmented apoptotic cells (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6.2</xref>). They are also called acidophil bodies or Councilman bodies, Councilman having first described them in yellow fever

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6.3</xref> ). Apoptotic bodies sometimes contain pyknotic nuclear remnants and often appear to bulge beyond the plane of the section. Another form of hepatocellular damage in acute hepatitis is focal (spotty) necrosis, in which liver-cell plates are disrupted or replaced by small groups of lymphocytes and macrophages. Whether these mark a site of necrosis or of apoptosis is not clear; the damage to hepatocytes is deduced from their absence rather than seen. Whatever its mechanism, loss of hepatocytes or liver-cell drop-out, coupled with focal regeneration, leads to a characteristic irregularity of the liver-cell plates, which usually allows acute hepatitis to be distinguished from hepatocellular damage secondary to cholestasis. The loss of hepatocytes also leads to condensation of the extracellular matrix, best seen in reticulin preparations (
