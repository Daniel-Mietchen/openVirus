 </xref> In an outbreak of HDV infection among Venezuelan Indians, notable features included early small-droplet fatty change, sparse lymphocytes and abundant macrophages in the parenchyma, and substantial portal infiltration.

 </xref> In non-immunosuppressed patients with current HDV infection, liver biopsy is likely to show substantial necrosis and inflammation. However, there are HDV-endemic regions where the virus produces little significant disease.

  <sup>55</sup>
 </xref> Following liver transplantation, by contrast, HDV without HBV is sometimes demonstrable in the absence of hepatitic changes, indicating that HDV can survive in the absence of HBV. It does not then appear, however, to be capable of causing liver damage.
