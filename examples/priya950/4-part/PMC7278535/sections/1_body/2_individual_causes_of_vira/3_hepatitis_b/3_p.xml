 <bold>Reactivation</bold> of a previously occult or quiescent chronic hepatitis B infection may cause changes closely resembling acute hepatitis. In such instances the presence of (1) portal tract lymphoid aggregates, (2) significant lymphoplasmacytic interface hepatitis, (3) any evidence of fibrosis on connective tissue stains and (4) substantial positivity of HBsAg in hepatocytes on immunostaining points to the underlying chronicity of the process.
