<p>We determined the BFDV status of parents and nestlings in 82 nests in which nestlings successfully hatched during the two breeding seasons we investigated (

Sample sizes of blood samples were as follows: 122 blood samples of parents, 352 of nestlings when they were approximately one week old and 227 when they were approximately four weeks old. We used the following protocol to collect blood from breeding birds and their nestlings in order to test them for BFDV. Parents were trapped in the nest box during nestling provisioning (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Berg &amp; Ribot, 2008</xref>) and blood samples (approximately 100 µl from the brachial vein) and cloacal swabs taken from each individual. Blood samples were also taken from nestlings at one and four weeks of age. Blood was stored in ethanol at room temperature, and cloacal swabs at 4 °C in the field, then frozen at −80 °C upon return to the laboratory on the same day. To avoid virus transmission between sampled birds, birds were handled using nitrile gloves, the cotton bags used to hold birds in were autoclaved after each use, blood sampling equipment was single-use and banding and measuring tools were sprayed with F10 SC Veterinary Disinfectant (Health and Hygiene Pty Ltd, South Africa) after each use. For both parent and nestling samples, BFDV presence was determined using a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay (

 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Raidal, Sabine &amp; Cross, 1993</xref>). We sampled one or more birds at 82 nests; nests where eggs did not hatch were excluded from this study, as we could not sample birds in these nests. 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> were aged (subadult (&lt;1 year), young adult (1–3 years) and adult (&gt;3 years)) based on distinct plumage colouration (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2017</xref>). This was not possible for 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic>.
