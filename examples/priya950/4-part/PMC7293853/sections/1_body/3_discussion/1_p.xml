<p>Pathogens which can persist outside of their hosts can potentially play a substantial role in the spread of wildlife disease through indirect transmission via environmental contamination (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Rohani et al., 2009</xref>). BFDV has been considered an environmentally stable pathogen which is likely to be transmitted indirectly through nest hollows, and is a threat for psittacine birds in Australia and world-wide (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2014</xref>). In this first study of BFDV presence in nesting material of wild birds, we found BFDV-infected parents or nestlings in 11 out of 82 (13.4%) nests. Four out of five (80%) boxes with a shedding parent provided a BFDV-positive swab; BFDV-positive nest swabs were also derived from four out of six (66.7%) boxes occupied by parents which were BFDV-positive in blood samples, and in two out of three (66.7%) boxes occupied by parents with BFDV-positive cloacal swabs. Zero out of five (0%) boxes containing BFDV-positive nestlings had BFDV-positive nest swabs. This resulted in a total of four out of 11 (36.4%) boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds (parents or nestlings) that yielded a BFDV-positive nest swab during the breeding season. This decreased to one out of 11 (9.1%) nests after the breeding season. Using the conservative threshold
 <sub>36</sub>, both control groups had BFDV-negative nest swabs both before and after breeding.
