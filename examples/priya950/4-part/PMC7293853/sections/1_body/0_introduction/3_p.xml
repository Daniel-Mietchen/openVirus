<p>Our goal was to test a surveillance method and elucidate the tractability of environmental sampling for non-invasive pathogen surveillance in wild populations, while simultaneously providing insight into the potential for indirect transmission of an avian virus causing serious conservation concern globally. We used swabs from nests of wild parrots as a non-invasive method for wildlife pathogen detection, using beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) in congeners Crimson Rosella (
 <italic>Platycercus elegans</italic>) and Eastern Rosella (
 <italic>Platycercus eximius</italic>) as our model system. BFDV is a generalist ssDNA circovirus (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2014</xref>) which causes one of the most significant diseases of psittacine birds around the world, Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Fogell, Martin &amp; Groombridge, 2016</xref>). All psittacines world-wide are considered susceptible (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Amery-Gale et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2015</xref>), indicating susceptibility beyond parrots. BFDV is considered a threat in captive breeding programs for several endangered species (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Raidal, Sarker &amp; Peters, 2015</xref>). The peracute and acute forms of PBFD are usually observed in young nestlings (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Perry, 1981</xref>), which typically die within one to two weeks after first appearance of clinical signs, or develop the chronic form of PBFD (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Perry, 1981</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Raidal, 1995</xref>). Given nestlings are particularly likely to become infected, and given BFDV has been considered stable in the environment (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Raidal &amp; Peters, 2018</xref>), it has been hypothesised that nest hollows may contribute significantly to BFDV transmission (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2014</xref>).
