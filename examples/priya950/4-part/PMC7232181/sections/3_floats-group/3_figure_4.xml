  <p>The human alveolus-on-a-chip model was infected with 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> and /or IAV. (
   <bold>A</bold>) By using an SEM, it was possible to visualize 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> (red arrow) and IAV during the budding process (blue arrow), magnification x 10,000, scale bar represents 1 µm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) TNF-α (pg/mL) is upregulated and released into the supernatant during 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> mono- and co-infection measured in pg/mL. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of the epithelial cell side of the human alveolus-on-a-chip model shows SP-A staining (red) of mock infected, influenza virus, 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> and co-infected scenarios. Scale bar represents 50 µm. The quantification of the SP-A staining (measured as mean-fluorescence intensity, MFI) reveals decreased intracellular protein levels for 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> mono- and co-infection (
   <bold>D</bold>). Mock-treated cells obtained the same medium and treatment as infected cells without the pathogen. Ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey´s multiple comparison, *
