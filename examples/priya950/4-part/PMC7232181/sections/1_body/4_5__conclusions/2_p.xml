<p>Our study investigated the impact of IV and/or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection on the SP-A expression in vitro and in vivo. We can show that complex interactions of epithelial cells and immune cells result in the down-regulation of SP-A mRNA expression. Furthermore, bacterial mono- and super-infections reduce the SP-A expression in a murine model which might contribute to the severe outcome of bacterial pneumonia.
