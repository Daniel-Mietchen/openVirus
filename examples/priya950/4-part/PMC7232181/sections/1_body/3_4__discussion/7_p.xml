<p>The regulation of SP-A is dependent on cytokines, in particular on TNF-α. TNF-α is capable of altering the mRNA level of SP-A via the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections lead to a high release of TNF-α, in particular originating from immune cells, such as macrophages. Yet, TNF-α expression was not increased upon IAV infection in immune cells within the present experimental setting.
