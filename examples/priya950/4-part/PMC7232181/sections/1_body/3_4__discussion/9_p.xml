<p>By combining the different model systems in our present study, we demonstrate that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> reduces SP-A protein levels, as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> expresses the cysteine protease sspA which is able to cleave SP-A [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, neither IAV nor 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> directly affects the mRNA expression of SP-A in NCI-H441 mono-cell culture, indicating that bacterial and viral pathogens do not affect the SP-A expression within the epithelial cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that TNF-α is a strong inhibitor of SP-A mRNA-expression. Bacterial mono- or co-infection strongly induce the expression of TNF-α, in particular in hMdM cells. By contrast, IAV infection has only a minor effect on TNF-α synthesis, which can be explained by the fact that IAV is inhibited by TNF-α and therefore TNF-α is disadvantageous for the survival of the virus particles [
 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The interaction of epithelial, endothelial and immune cells within the human alveolus-on-a-chip model demonstrates high amounts of TNF-α in response to bacterial infection. Finally, through MFI quantification we could demonstrate that bacterial infection significantly decreased intracellular SP-A protein levels.
