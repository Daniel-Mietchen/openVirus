 <italic>S. aureus</italic> disposes of extracellular proteases with a wide variety of virulence-associated functions. Here, metallo-, cysteine and serine protease lead to tissue degradation and interference of the host immune response. The protease ssPA was described as the most efficient in degrading SP-A, even in a nanomolar concentration [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The direct effect of extracellular 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> proteases impairs the bacterial clearance and results in enhanced adherence and invasion of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, surfactant proteins affect IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, an interfering effect of IAV infection on SP-A has not been described.
