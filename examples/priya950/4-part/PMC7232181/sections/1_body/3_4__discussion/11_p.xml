<p>Our results show that beside the direct effect of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> leading to the cleavage of extracellular SP-A, there is an indirect effect based on infection via the cytokine production, notably by TNF-α. During infection, macrophages are one of the main sources for elevated TNF-α levels that have already been described to lower mRNA levels of SP-A.
