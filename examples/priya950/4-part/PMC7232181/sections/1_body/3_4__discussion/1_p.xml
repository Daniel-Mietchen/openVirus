<p>Secondary bacterial pneumonia is one of the main reasons for increased morbidity and death rates after IAV infections. Apart from the pathogen load caused by the super-infection, the dysregulated immune response is also involved in the severe outcome of concomitant bacterial and viral infections. The pulmonary surfactant plays an important role as the first line of defense. The aim of our study was to elucidate whether a viral/bacterial co-infection has an impact on SP-A expression, the major surfactant protein.</p>
