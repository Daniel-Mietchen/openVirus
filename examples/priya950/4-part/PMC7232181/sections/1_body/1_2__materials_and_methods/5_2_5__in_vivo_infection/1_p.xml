<p>For the murine pneumonia model the mice were purchased from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). The animal application was proven by the local ethics committee of the Thuringian State Office for Consumer Protection (Thüringer Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz, Reg.-Nr.: UKJ-018-028, 10/10/2018). The mice were maintained according to institutional guidelines in individually ventilated cages, and food and water were given ad libitum. For the in vivo model, we use specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57Bl/6 mice from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France), providing us with an excellent health status for the animals. The animal facility of the Jena University Hospital also provides an excellent unit for performing animal experiments. Under S2 conditions, the animals are housed in separate units, which are monitored frequently.</p>
