<p>Moreover, the right superior lung lobe was used to determine the mRNA expression of TNF-α and SP-A by quantitative real-time PCR. For histopathology, the left lung lobe of each mouse was fixed in 10% formalin for at least 24 h, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol and xylene, and mounted in paraffin. For each lung sample, about ten 5 µm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to study the degree of cellular infiltration. Sections of each lung were examined microscopically (Zeiss microscope Axio Vert.A1), and representative photographs were obtained (Axio Cam ERc5S).</p>
