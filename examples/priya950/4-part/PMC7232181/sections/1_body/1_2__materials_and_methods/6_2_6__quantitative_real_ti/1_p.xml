<p>For quantitative real-time PCR, cell infection was conducted as described above. Isolation of total RNA from macrophages, NCI-H441 and homogenized lungs was done by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells of the biochip model were first homogenized using the QIAshredder homogenizers (Qiagen) and total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of RNA were transcribed into cDNA using QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression of several genes was determined by qRT-PCR on a Thermo Scientific™ PikoReal™ Real-Time PCR System using QuantiTect SYBR Green (Qiagen) and gene-specific primers (
