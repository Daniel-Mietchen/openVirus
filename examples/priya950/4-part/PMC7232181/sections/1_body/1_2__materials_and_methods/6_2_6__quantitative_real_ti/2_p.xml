<p>To analyze the mRNA expression of SP-A, we have compared the data from the infection with the pathogens and the data of the stimulation with recombinant TNF-α. For this, we used 10 nM of TNF-α (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) added to RPMI. After 30 min of incubation on NCI-H441 cells, they were washed with PBS and incubated for 4 h. Afterward, the mRNA expression was performed as described above.</p>
