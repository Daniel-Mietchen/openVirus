<p>For the establishment of the human alveolus-on-a-chip model, we used MOTiF biochips, manufactured and purchased by microfluid ChipShop GmbH (Jena, Germany). The chip consists of two chambers that are separated by an 11 µm thick polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) membrane with a pore diameter of 8 µm and pore density pf 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pores/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The capacity of the endothelial is 220 µL (including afferent and efferent channels), and the volume of the epithelial chamber is 120 µL (also including the channels). Peristaltic pumps were used for the perfusion of the biochip, as explained previously [
