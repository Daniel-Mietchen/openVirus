<p>After 1 week of culture, hMdM cells were seeded on top of the NCI-H441 cell layer with a density of 0.9 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> macrophages/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00577">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The random-wise analysis of the macrophage density observed a typical monocyte differentiation rate of 90% without donor-specific variations. These data were obtained during the establishment of the human alveolus-on-a-chip model and were not determined for each chip.
