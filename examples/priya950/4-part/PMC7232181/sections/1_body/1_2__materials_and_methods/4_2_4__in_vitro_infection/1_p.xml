<p>For the viral infection of the NCI-H441 mono-cell culture as well as the infection on the human alveolus-on-a-chip model, cells were washed with PBS once ( 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00577">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The IV strain A/Puerto Rico/8 was added to the cells in RPMI (0.2% autologous human serum, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) and incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C without centrifugation. For the specification of the pathogen concentration, we have used the multiplicity of infection (MOI). This information describes the ratio of pathogens to infected cells. For the viral infection of the NCI-H441 cells we use MOI 1.
