<p>For the infection of the single cell-culture of hMdM, cells were isolated as described above and used after 6 days of cultivation. After a washing step with RPMI, the IV strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (MOI 1) was added to the cells in RPMI (0.2% autologous human serum, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) and incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C without centrifugation until the indicated time points. For the single bacterial infection as well as the co-infection, we use 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>/USA300/WT (MOI 1).
