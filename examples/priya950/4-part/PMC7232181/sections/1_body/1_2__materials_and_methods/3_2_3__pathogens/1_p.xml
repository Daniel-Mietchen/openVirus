<p>For the propagation of IV, we used Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCKs were cultured in EMEM (Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium, ATCC, Wesel, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calve serum (FCS). For the virus propagation, the IV strain A/Puerto Rico/8 was passaged on MDCK in EMEM supplemented with 25 mM MgCl, 1.3% bicarbonate, and 0.333% trypsin. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After freezing and a centrifugation step, the virus was stored at −80 °C.
