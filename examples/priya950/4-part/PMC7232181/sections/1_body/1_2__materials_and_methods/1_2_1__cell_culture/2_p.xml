<p>Besides this, primary monocytes were isolated from whole peripheral blood of healthy donors. The blood was diluted in an equal volume with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% FBS (Sigma Life Science, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then gently transferred to the surface of Biocoll separation solution (Biochrome GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The monocytes were separated from blood cells by centrifugation without bakes. Cells were washed with PBS three times with centrifugation steps in-between. For cell culture experiments, 6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> monocytes/well were cultured in 24-well dishes in RPMI-medium supplemented with 10% autologous human serum, 10 ng/mL human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulation factor (GM-CSF, PeproTech, Hamburg, Germany), 10 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulation factor (M-CSF, PeproTech, Hamburg, Germany), and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sup>2</sup> and then washed twice with RPMI. Cells were cultured for 6 days. A medium exchange was performed every second day. RPMI-medium was supplemented with 10% autologous human serum, 10 ng/mL GM-CSF, to induce macrophage differentiation, and penicillin/streptomycin.
