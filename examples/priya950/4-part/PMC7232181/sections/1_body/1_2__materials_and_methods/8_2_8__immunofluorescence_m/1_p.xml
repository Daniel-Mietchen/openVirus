<p>For the immunofluorescence staining of the cells of the human alveolus-on-a-chip model, the membranes with the NCI-H441 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. For the staining of the endothelial sides, cells were fixed for 15 min with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. Afterwards, intracellular staining of SP-A was performed. For this, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% Saponin, 3% donkey serum and anti-SP-A antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX, USA). Thereafter, fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies (donkey-anti-goat- AlexaFlour647, life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used and incubated for 30 min. The stained samples were embedded into a mounting medium (S3023, Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Imaging was performed with an Axio Observer Z1 fluorescence microscope with ApoTome.2 extension (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany), and images were analyzed with ImageJ2 software (Fiji distribution).</p>
