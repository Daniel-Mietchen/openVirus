<p>During viral and/or bacterial infection, the cytokine profile, including the expression of TNF-α, of infected cells is altered depending on the host cell type and on the pathogens. In an epithelial mono-cell culture (NCI-H441 cells) bacterial infection caused a much lower increase in TNF-α mRNA-expression compared to the infection of immune cells (hMdM) (
