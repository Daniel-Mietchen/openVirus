<p>Within the human alveolus-on-a-chip model, epithelial cells (NCI-H441), endothelial cells (HUVECs) and macrophages (hMdM) were co-cultured under perfusion of the endothelial side and infected via the epithelial side with the pathogens as indicated. The successful viral infection was proven by the budding process of IAV, as visible in the SEM-pictures (

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> on the epithelial surface within the alveolus-on-a-chip model (

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> mono- or IAV-coinfection, whereas IAV did not enhance TNF-α release (
