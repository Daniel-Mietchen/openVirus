<p>The first line of defense during infections, apart from physical barriers, is regulated by an innate host immune response in which white blood cells and chemical components play a crucial role [

 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides, the non-specific cellular response, including mucous and also surfactant proteins, are principal targets to fight pathogens [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pulmonary surfactant has long been known to be essential to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the lung and to prevent its collapse at end-expiration. However, surfactant proteins have also immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activity and thereby are important agents in primary host immune defense [
