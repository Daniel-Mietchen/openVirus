<p>DF is an arboviral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV). DENV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. It is a mosquito-borne pathogen that is traditionally transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito and to a lesser extent, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B59" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2014</xref>). In terms of disease burden and risk potential, DENV is one of the most important arboviral pathogens. One-third of the world’s population (∼2.5 billion people) is at risk of infection with DENV and it is estimated that approximately 390 million infections occur yearly in the tropical and subtropical regions (

Some patients with DF can progress to develop one of two life-threatening conditions, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DHF is characterized by hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia while DSS occurs due to excessive plasma leakage (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B29" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2016</xref>). Some of the factors contributing to these variations and the risk of development of life-threatening conditions include the genetic constitution of the virus, the genetic make-up of the individual as well as previous infection with a different serotype (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B57" ref-type="bibr">WHO 1999</xref>). The spread and co-circulation of the serotypes have caused epidemics with increasing frequency and magnitude. Efforts to control the virus still depend on vector control strategies, given that the recent attempts to introduce a dengue vaccine have faced numerous challenges and have resulted in little success (
