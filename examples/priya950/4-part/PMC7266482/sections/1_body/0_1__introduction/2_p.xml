<p>DENV has a single-stranded, positive sense nonsegmented RNA genome. Like many other RNA viruses, DENV is fast evolving due to the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to the formation of several genotypes within each DENV serotype over the years (

DENV-2 has been divided into six different genotypes that include Asian I (AI), Asian II (AII), Cosmopolitan (C), American (AM), Asian/American (AA), and sylvatic (S) genotypes. These genotypes were suggested based on phylogeny of DENV-2 using envelope gene sequences (
