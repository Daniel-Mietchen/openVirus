<p>ML phylogeny for the partial C/PrM gene, including additional sequences from Kenya, recovered one additional sequence from Mombasa that belonged to the C-II lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa026-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The other additional five sequences, all from the Kenyan Coast, fell under the C-I lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa026-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This finding agrees with our observation that C-I lineage was the most predominant during the 2013–4 outbreak and reinforces the evidence of the existence of C-II lineage in Mombasa during this outbreak period. There was, however, no additional C-II lineage sequences from any other additional country, pointing to the possibility of this strain currently being present only in the countries identified before; Burkina Faso, Niger, and Kenya.
