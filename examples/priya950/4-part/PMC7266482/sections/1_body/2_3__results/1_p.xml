<p>Overlapping PCR amplicon targets for fourteen DENV-2 isolates were obtained and subjected to NGS. We generated consensus sequences for all fourteen isolates which had varying lengths of between 8,424 and 10,292 nt, with an average length of 9,562 nt. Thirteen of the isolates sequenced in this study originated from Mombasa and one originated from Wajir, northeastern Kenya. The Wajir isolate was collected in June of 2014, during the northeastern Kenya dengue outbreak (
