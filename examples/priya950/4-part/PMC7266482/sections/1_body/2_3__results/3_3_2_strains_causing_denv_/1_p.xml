<p>The molecular clock analyses indicate that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the coastal Kenya outbreak strain existed in 2011 (2011.57; 95% HPD: 2010.83, 2012.24) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa026-F2">Fig. 2</xref>), making this the most probable latest time point of introduction of this particular strain to the Kenyan coast. We estimated the evolutionary rates of this particular strain under the uncorrelated lognormal clock (UCLN) and our findings showed that the mean nucleotide substitution rates of this strain was 1.6631E−3 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 6.0638E−4, 3.1978E−3), which was not significantly different from the nucleotide substitution rates of the entire cosmopolitan genotype, 8.403E−4 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 7.4527E−4, 9.3025E−4). These findings were consistent with previous evolutionary rate estimates for DENV2, 8.94E−4 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 7.39E−4, 1.04E−3 (
