<p>Original specimen material stored at −80°C was aliquoted and used for viral RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted using QiaAmp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, MD, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following extraction, Superscript III cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. Twelve primer pairs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were used to amplify 12 overlapping targets covering the entire genome of DENV-2. The amplicons were used to prepare libraries for next generation sequencing (NGS). In brief, the amplicons from each sample were pooled in equal volumes and cleaned using Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA) then quantified using Qubit 3.0 dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). Libraries were then prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using 1 ng of DNA from the cleaned amplicons. The samples were uniquely barcoded using Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Library normalization was done using the standard library normalization process according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The normalized libraries were pooled in equal volumes and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform, using a 2 × 300 base paired-end reads. Raw sequence reads were inspected for quality using FASTQC (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B33" ref-type="bibr">Cherokee Nation Technology Solutions 2015</xref>). The assembly followed default criteria set by the pipeline whereby the minimum base-calling quality of 25 and minimum mapping quality of 25 as well as a depth of coverage of 10 was used. Furthermore, every unambiguous nucleotide that was called had to have occurred in at least 80% of the assembled reads in the assembly. The sequences generated in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers [MN577551–MN577564].
