<p>DENV-2 has been the dominant serotype reported during dengue outbreaks in Kenya since the 1980s (

The outbreak that occurred in 1982 was considered to be extensive and although little information is available as to the extent of this outbreak, one group tested forty-three acutely ill patients and obtained seven virus isolates (
