<p>The C-I lineage contains DENV-2 genomes predominantly from South Asia. There are also sporadic isolations of this lineage in East Asia, particularly South Korea and China. Sequences isolated recently in the islands of Reunion and Seychelles also fell within this lineage. However, the strains that caused this Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles and Reunion) epidemic (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B37" ref-type="bibr">Pascalis et al. 2019</xref>) do not appear to have any link to the coastal Kenya outbreak strain. Our analysis show that the C-I lineage was introduced into the Kenyan coast between March 2010 and June 2011 and it led to successful local transmission of DENV-2, as evidenced during the outbreak in Mombasa in 2013–4 (

The C-II lineage, on the other hand, clustered together with DENV-2 genomes from Burkina Faso and Indonesia as well as one genome from Niger. This lineage appears to have been introduced into Kenya between September 1979 and March 2013. It was isolated during both the Coastal and northeastern Kenya outbreaks in 2013–4. The outbreak in northeastern Kenya in 2011 and in 2013 was responsible for at least 5,300 documented cases (with at least thirteen fatalities) (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B47" ref-type="bibr">The New Humanitarian 2013</xref>). Only one genome from Wajir was available in this study and, therefore, we cannot make any conclusion on the lineage or the DENV serotype that was mostly involved in that particular outbreak. Nonetheless, the Kenyan dengue outbreak between 2011 and 2014 involved DENV-1, 2, and 3 and the co-occurrence of these three serotypes may have played a major role in the extended nature of this outbreak as well as the increased number of cases and fatalities reported (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dhanoa et al. 2016</xref>). However, the contribution of DENV-2 was also quite significant considering that it was the most commonly isolated serotype during 2013 and 2014 (
