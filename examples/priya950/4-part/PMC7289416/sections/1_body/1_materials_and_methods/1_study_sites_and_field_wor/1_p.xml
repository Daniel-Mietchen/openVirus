<p>This study was conducted in Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province, located in Southeast China. Considering the aspects of environment, coordination and operability, the Chongwen village (28°53’46.68”N, 118°54’44.02”E) and Songyuan village (28°55’0.37”N, 118°54’15.57”E) exhibited good representatives of the general rural areas in Zhejiang Province and were selected as the study sites. Besides, no major epidemics of dengue fever have occurred in this area during the study period, which could minimize the mosquito density fluctuation for dengue controlling. The study was conducted from April 26 to November 23, 2018 and lasted for 31 weeks. The larval density was monitored in about 50 households every week in Chongwen and Songyuan village, respectively. Trained field workers inspected and recorded household water containers and collected any pupae or larvae present for entomological examination. The water containers included any container with water in or around the households, such as flower pots, water storage containers, idle containers, waste tyres, garbage, rockery pool, open channel, bamboo or tree holes, stone holes, standing water in basement and parking lot, etc. A container was considered positive if it contained at least one larva or pupa.</p>
