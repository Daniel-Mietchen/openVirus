<p>The statistical analyses were conducted with Statistical Program for Social Sciences 21.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R 3.6.2 software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform). A value of 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All the parameters were tested for normality. The Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation and Pearson correlation with or without time-lag were used to analyze the correlation of the larval density, the adult mosquito density and the meteorological factors according to the data distribution. Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the influencing factors of the mosquito density.
