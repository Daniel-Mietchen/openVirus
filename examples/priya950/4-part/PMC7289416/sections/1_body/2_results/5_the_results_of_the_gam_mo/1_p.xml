<p>GAM models were used to analyze the influencing factors related to different density indices of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. The significant variables in the correlation analysis were included in the models, and the best effect time of the same variable was selected with the highest correlation coefficient. Although there were high correlation among BI, CI and HI, they were different aspects of the larval density, and consequently the three indices were not included in the model of each other. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, BI was significantly associated with average temperature, average wind speed pre 1 week and female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density pre 4 weeks. BI increased to a peak value first, and then decreased with the increasing of the average temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g001">Fig 1</xref>), decreased with the increasing of the average wind speed pre 1 week straightly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and decreased smoothly with the increasing of the female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density pre 4 weeks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g003">Fig 3</xref>). CI was significantly associated with average temperature and average humidity pre 3 weeks. CI increased to a peak value first, and then decreased with the increasing of the average temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g004">Fig 4</xref>), and increased straightly with the increasing of the average humidity pre 3 weeks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g005">Fig 5</xref>). HI was significantly associated with average temperature and precipitation pre 4 weeks. The relationship between HI and the temperature was similar to those with BI and CI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g006">Fig 6</xref>), and with the increase of precipitation 4 week ago, HI increased first, then reached a plateau period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density or female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density had linear relationship with the average temperature with a time lag of two weeks (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g008">8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234555.g009">9</xref>).
