<p>Our findings suggested that the BG-trap was an effective adult trap for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, especially for the female mosquitoes. The adult 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density was slightly correlated with certain larval indices. The average temperature, precipitation, average humidity, and average wind speed played significant roles in the density of adult mosquito or larva with or without a time lag. To prevent dengue fever, new monitoring method and thresholds should be developed based on adult mosquitoes, with considering meteorological factors.
