 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse), the Asian tiger mosquito, is one of the most invasive insect species in the world with substantial biting activity and high disease vector potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is originally from East Asia and the islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean, and now can be found in all continents except for Antarctica [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> plays a crucial role in the transmission and reservation of dengue virus, not only because dengue virus can circulate in a horizontal transmission (human-mosquito-human), but also it can be transmitted vertically from adult mosquito to offspring [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which is considered to be a coping mechanism to maintain the virus level under adverse conditions. In the absence of vaccinations and effective drugs, the prevention and control of dengue fever are still focused on the elimination of the mosquito populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. From this perspective, developing appropriate strategies to monitor and control the
