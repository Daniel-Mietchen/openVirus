<p>Climatic factors, particularly the temperature, precipitation and humidity, could directly and indirectly affect the mosquito density and blood feeding behavior [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, the average temperature was the main influencing factor of the mosquito density, affecting all the study indices. Temperature is crucial for mosquitoes, not only for survival rate but also the lifecycle of the vector including oviposition, hatching, pupation, and emergence processes [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Higher temperature could reduce the development time of mosquitoes, and increase the propagation speed of the virus [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consistent with the above study, our results showed that the adult mosquito density increased straightly with the increase of the average temperature pre two weeks. Studies also found that the effects of temperature on the mortality rate of larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes could be U-shaped with a lower mortality rate was seen when temperature ranged from 15 to 30°C [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This probably explained the decrease of the BI, CI and HI from the peak value along with the increase of the average temperature in our study.
