<p>The thresholds of the classical larval indices for management of dengue epidemics were considered to be less effective and sometimes remained poor in predicting adult emergence [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Measuring adult mosquito density was the most representative quantitative estimate to obtain data about mosquito abundance, as larva needed to go through several developmental stages to become adult mosquitoes before they could transmit dengue virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Study had found that the household larval surveys and trap based surveillance systems were not interchangeable approaches [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density and female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density were calculated as two indices and the results were not exactly the same. The 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density, contained all the captured 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> including male and female, while the female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density, calculated the female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> only. The correlation analysis indicated that the two indices all were slightly correlated with CI with a certain time lag. While the female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density pre 4 weeks was negatively correlated with BI, which was consistent with the results of the GAM model but contrary to our common sense. As only female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was responsible for disease transmission, the indices would be more appropriate towards female mosquitoes directly. One interesting phenomenon found in our study was that, when the BG-traps were put in the grass or small bamboo grove, more mosquitoes would be caught and most of them were male. These findings may lead to bias of the result for different sites the traps placed, and the different emergence time of the male and female mosquito [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, regarding the correlation between the larval and adult mosquito density, it would be more appropriate towards 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density than female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density.
