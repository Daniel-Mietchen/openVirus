<p>As for adult

 <italic>albopictus</italic> monitoring, an effective trap would be less intrusive, labor saving, and more comprehensive coverage with an effective lure or attractant. The BG-trap, using CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the BG-lure to capture host-seeking female mosquitoes, is an effective mosquito monitoring method. Our entomological survey was conducted at the peak period of
