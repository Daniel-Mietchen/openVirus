<p>BI is considered as a decision making parameter for mosquito control and dengue epidemic risk. Generally, the BI value of 5 serves as the lowest threshold. In a scenario where the BI value &gt; 5 with reported dengue cases or BI &gt; 20 even without any dengue case, control measures should be taken [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Three different risks of HI, with &lt;0.1% as low, 0.1â€“5% as medium and &gt;5% as high, were suggested by the Pan American Health Organization to prevent dengue transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As for CI, one study found that 11.7 was the optimal cut-off value for discriminating outbreaks of dengue [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we found the average BI value was extremely high (86.25) in two villages, and similar values were also seen in HI (42.79%) and CI (30.46%). Although reasons for the high estimates in our study were complicated, there was possible explanation with respect to the breeding place for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. As the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> generally breed in artificial water containers, any type of water-holding container with clean water would be a good larval habitat [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The two villages investigated in this study had good sanitation conditions, and vegetation was abundant in and around the villages. Besides, considerable idle containers and water cisterns with clean water were put in or around the yard (accounting for 95.4% of the total number of water containers), which would provide perfect breeding place for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Furthermore, consistent with a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the positive rate for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larval was found to be higher in discarded tires.
