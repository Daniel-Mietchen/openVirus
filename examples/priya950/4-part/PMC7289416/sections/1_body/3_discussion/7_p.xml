<p>Relative humidity was an important meteorological factor in the life-cycle of mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Humidity could also increase the transmission rate of human dengue fever infection in the context of imported dengue cases and mosquito density [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Relative humidity could affect larvae density by affecting adult mosquito survival, and also had a synergistic effect with the temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While in our GAM models, CI increased with the rise of the average humidity pre 3 weeks. The wind speed could influence the effectiveness of the daily captures of mosquitoes [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> densities generally decreased with wind speed [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Endo N et al. found that wind direction and speed could influence the malaria vector populations by affecting the effect of CO
 <sub>2</sub> attraction and enable mosquitoes to identify village location [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our models, the average wind speed was negatively correlated with BI and with one week lag effect. Higher wind speed may affect the dynamics of the mosquito population by affecting wave activity, advection of adult mosquitoes, and CO
 <sub>2</sub> attraction, resulting in a low density of larvae after a period of time.
