 <italic>,</italic> and that it can effect a fitness change. However, we observed that this was uncommon across the avian and human viral proteomes. In contrast, switching between the other motifs was more common and collectively may have a larger role in contributing to the fitness selection of the virus. The motif switching phenomenon, also alluded by 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2013)</xref>, was not only observed for both the proteomes, but was extensive and complex; it is thought to be a contributor to fitness selection in other viruses as well, in particular those of quasispecies nature. The dynamic nature of motif switching can be attributed to merging, splitting, and gain/loss of nonatypes between the nonamer positions. Nonatype merging is observed when two or more distinct nonamers of a given incidence at a position combined/merged to become one in the subsequent position. Conversely, nonatype splitting is when a distinct variant nonamer separates into two or more distinct variant nonamers in the subsequent position. As for nonatype gain, it occurred when a motif was not present in the previous position but appeared in the subsequent position, and 
 <italic>vice versa</italic> for the loss; this was largely due to indels and in some cases because of our filtering of nonamers with ambiguous amino acids. Motif switching was common at all the three conservation levels (highly conserved, mixed-variable, and highly diverse) for both the avian and human viral proteomes. Positions of motif switch are hotspots for sequence change. Among the motif switch, index switching can be disruptive and is of concern for selection of vaccine target candidates. Positions that do not exhibit index switching may be considered as additional criteria for vaccine target selection.
