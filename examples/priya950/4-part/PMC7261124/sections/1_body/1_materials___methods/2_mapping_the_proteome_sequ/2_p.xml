<p>where 
 <italic>p(i,x)</italic> is the probability of a given nonamer sequence 
 <italic>i</italic> at nonamer position 
 <italic>x</italic>. The entropy value, 
 <italic>H</italic> at a given position increases with an increase in total number of distinct nonamer sequences, 
 <italic>n(x)</italic>. It is also affected by the relative probability of the sequences, such that it decreases when one sequence is significantly dominant at the position (i.e.,Â the position is conserved). The entropy value represents the diversity of the sequences at a given nonamer position, ranging from 0, a completely conserved position, to a theoretical maximum of 39, where all possible nonamer combinations are observed.
