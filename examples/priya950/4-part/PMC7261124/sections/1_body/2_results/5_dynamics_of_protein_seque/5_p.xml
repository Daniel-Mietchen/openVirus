<p>Frequency distribution of the diversity motifs incidences for H5N1 IAV proteomes of avian and human viruses were studied by the use of violin plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3G</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3H</xref>). Overall, the index nonamer was the principal motif, with a proteome-wide average incidence of about 86%. The proteome-wide, predominant mutation of the index was the major variant, with a greater incidence than any of the other variant motifs for ∼51% and ∼77% of the avian and human proteome nonamer positions, respectively. All the variant motifs (major, minor, unique) were predominantly of low (&lt;10%) incidence, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>, with the exception of minor variants showing a collective increase in incidence, even surpassing the index, at positions of more than 50% total variants. Nonetheless, the fraction of positions showing this increasing trend of minor variants incidence greater than that of the index was minimal (&lt;2%) for both avian and human viruses. The nonatypes, which typically would comprise of a single major variant, multiple different minor variants, and all the unique variants, were also mainly of low incidence (proteome-wide average: ∼2–3%), similar to the incidences of unique variants (proteome-wide average of ∼1%).
