<p>Motif switching, another relevant finding, revealed that there were a significant number of nonamer positions in the proteome where fitness change of one or more amino acids, such as through mutations, changed the incidence of a given nonamer sequence across its overlapping positions, resulting in a sequence rank change, and thus, a motif change. Although, this was observed for all the motifs (index, major, minor or unique), index switching was noteworthy, where a major variant replaced the prevalent index sequence. An example illustrating motif change is provided in
