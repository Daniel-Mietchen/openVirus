<p>Motif switching appeared to be common across the avian viral proteome as exemplified by both avian PB2 and PA-X proteins (∼88% and ∼89% of the protein nonamer positions). The occurrences of motif switching in these two proteins for the human viral proteome were also common, but relatively less (∼50% and ∼53% of the positions). Although the data studied was for PB2 and PA-X, we expect a similar observation for all the other proteins.</p>
