<p>Shannon’s entropy was used as a measure to quantify the diversity, considering the total number of distinct sequences and their relative probabilities at each aligned overlapping nonamer (nine amino acids) position (1–9, 2–10, etc.) of the proteome. Entropy provided an overview of the diversity, which was then characterized for its components that made up the diversity. All sequences at each of the nonamer positions in the protein alignments were analyzed and classified as characteristic diversity motifs based on the incidences of distinct sequences present at the position, as described in 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2013)</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). The sequence with the highest incidence (most common) is referred to as the “index” nonamer, while the others are grouped as variants (referred to as total variants), defined as sequences that are at least one amino acid different from the index nonamer. The “major” variant is the second highest incidence nonamer at the position, and thus, the most common variant, while “minor” variants are sequences that occur more than once in the aligned viruses, but each with an incidence less than or occasionally equal to the major variant. “Unique” variants are singletons, each observed only once in the alignment. Additionally, the incidence of all distinct variant nonamer sequences (nonatypes) at a given nonamer position was determined. These diversity motifs were then analyzed to quantify the dynamics of H5N1 IAV proteome sequence change.
