<p>Comprehensive collections of protein sequence data were retrieved from the public repository Influenza Research Database for the analyses. The collected and processed H5N1 IAV protein sequence datasets comprised a total of 13,145 full-length and partial sequences for the 12 proteins, with 11,326 avian and 1,819 human H5N1 sequences (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The six-fold lower number of human H5N1 protein sequences reflects the shorter history and incomplete adaptation of the human virus (Finkelstein et al., 2007). The earliest avian and human H5N1 sequences reported in the database were from 1959 and 1997, respectively, and the viruses originated from a diverse range of geographical areas (
