<p>Nearly all of the nonamer positions of the avian and human H5N1 IAV proteomes were classified as highly conserved (index incidence ≥ 90%) or mixed-variable (index incidence between 90% and 20%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7</xref>). Highly conserved positions, defined as those with index sequence incidence of 90% or more among the aligned viruses, represented ∼62% and ∼57% of the avian and human H5N1 IAV proteomes, respectively. Seven percent (∼7%; 320 positions) of the human H5N1 IAV proteome was completely conserved (index of 100% incidence), and 264 of these 320 can be considered evolutionarily conserved given the relatively larger sample size (≥100 sequences) in the alignment. In contrast, a smaller fraction (&lt;1%; 3 positions) of the avian viral proteome was completely conserved, observed only in the PB1. Given that less than 7% of the human and avian viral proteomes were completely conserved, nearly all nonamer positions of the aligned viral proteins of both proteomes contained variants with one or more mutations to the index sequence. Notably, only one position (170–178 of HA) in the avian H5N1 IAV proteome was classified as highly diverse (index incidence ≤ 20%) with total variants of ∼82%, and there were none in the human viral proteome.
