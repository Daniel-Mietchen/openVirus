<p>The overall diversity of the aligned overlapping nonamer sequences for each protein of avian and human H5N1 IAV was measured by use of Shannon’s entropy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). The avian virus proteome had a low average (mean) individual protein entropy, with values ranging from ∼0.4 (PB1) to ∼2.3 (PB1-F2), and a proteome-wide average of ∼0.8. Correspondingly, the percentage of conservation (index incidence) was generally high, with an average individual protein total variants incidence (cumulative of major variant, minor variants and unique variants) ranging from as low as ∼6% (PB1) to ∼39% (PB1-F2), and a proteome-wide average of ∼14%. Half of the proteins had an average entropy value of less than one. The highest absolute entropy value was ∼4.4 for the NS1 protein at position 205–213, with a total variants incidence of ∼73%. However, the highest absolute total variants incidence (∼82%) was for the HA protein at position 170–178, with an entropy of ∼4.1.
