  <title>Distribution of conservation level of nonamer positions.</title>
  <p>The nonamer positions of the proteome and the individual proteins were defined as highly conserved (red, index incidence ≥ 90%), mixed-variable (blue, index incidence &lt; 90% &amp; &gt; 20%), and highly diverse (green, index incidence ≤ 20%). Majority of the nonamer positions were highly conserved, representing ∼62% and ∼57% of avian (A) and human (B) H5N1 proteomes, respectively. Only one position was identified as highly diverse, which represented less than 1% (avian, HA protein), while mixed-variable positions represented ∼38% of the avian H5N1 proteome and ∼43% of the human H5N1 proteome. The M1, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 proteins were observed to have a higher percentage of highly conserved positions in both avian and human H5N1 proteomes.</p>
