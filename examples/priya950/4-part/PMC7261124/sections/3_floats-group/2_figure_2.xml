  <title> Relationship between entropy and incidence of total variants for (A) avian and (B) human H5N1 influenza A virus proteome nonamer positions.</title>
  <p>The entropy value for each aligned nonamer position of the avian and human viral proteomes were plotted against the corresponding total variants incidence. A positive correlation was observed for viruses of each host, with a distribution pattern similar between the two. The plot does not show the density of data points.</p>
