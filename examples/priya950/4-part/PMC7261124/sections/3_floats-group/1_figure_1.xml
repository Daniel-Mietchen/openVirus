  <title>H5N1 entropy and incidence of total variants for each aligned nonamer positions of H5N1 avian (A) and human (B) viral sequences.</title>
  <p>Entropy (black) and incidence of total variants (red) were measured for each aligned nonamer (nine amino acids) position (1–9, 2–10, etc.) of the proteins. The entropy values indicate the level of variability at the corresponding nonamer positions, with zero representing completely conserved positions (0% total variants incidence) and entropies of ∼4.4 and ∼4.1 were observed to be the highest for viruses of avian and human hosts, respectively.</p>
