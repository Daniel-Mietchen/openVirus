<p>No erythema or abscesses were observed in any of the negative control animals, post-inoculation. Two of the 10 animals in the vaccinated group (with LSD-RVF.mf) (animals A1-3 and C2-1) developed a mild local reaction at the site of inoculation at 7 dpi. In animal A1-3, this presented as a swelling (2 × 3 cm in size), which persisted to 15 dpi, after which it began to resolve and by 26 dpi it was completely resolved. Animal C2-1 presented with a single injection-site swelling, 1.5 × 1.5 cm in size. A biopsy sample from this region was not positive for LSDV antigen via immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. No pyrexia (temperature &gt; 39.5°C) was observed in any of the vaccinated animals (
