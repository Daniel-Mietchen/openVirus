<p>PBMCs were collected from calves on the day of inoculation (day 0), 7 and 14 dpi, and 7 and 14 dpc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). ELISPOT analyses showed increased levels of IFN-γ-producing cells at 14 dpi in two animals (A1-3 and A1-4) from Group 2 (the vaccinated and LSDV-challenged group: animals A1-1 to A1-5) when stimulated with LSDV antigen (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) in Group 2 animals (vaccinated and RVFV challenged animals: C2-1 to C2-5). Animals in Group 1 (mock–vaccinated: D1-1 to D1-5) challenged with LSDV also showed an increase in IFN-γ -producing cells post-challenge when stimulated with LSDV antigen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, line graph), while IFN-γ secretion was absent in the PBMCs of the same animals after stimulation with RVFV antigen. The vaccinated group challenged with virulent RVFV (Group 2: C2-1 to C2-5) was not immunologically monitored after challenge due to safety risks. Phenotypic analysis to determine memory T cells indicated that animals in Group 2 (vaccinated and LSDV-challenged animals: A1-1 to A1-5) had a significant increase in both CD4+ CD45Ro+ and CD8+ CD45Ro+ memory T cells at 7 dpi and 14 dpc after stimulation with LSDV antigen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A,B</xref>). PBMCs stimulated with RVFV antigen only showed an increase in CD8+ CD45Ro+ memory T cells at 14 dpi, while no CD4+ memory T cells were detected (
