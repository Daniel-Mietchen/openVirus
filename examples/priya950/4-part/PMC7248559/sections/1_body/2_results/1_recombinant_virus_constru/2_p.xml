<p>Multiple foci lacking EGFP expression were selected, half portions of each were frozen at −20°C and the remainder subjected to the “Intracellular ELISA” technique developed and described under the Materials and Methods. Wells containing foci showing signals (OD values) for the positive RVFV antiserum which were significantly higher than in duplicate wells for the negative serum were deemed to be positive for expression of the RVFV GPs and were further selected and sub-cultured after filtration and sonication (

The presence of amplification products of the correct size (~ 5.5 kpb) for the recombinant virus and absence of any amplification products of 1.9 kbp, indicative of parental virus, provided clear evidence that the sub-cultures were pure and thus free of parental virus.
