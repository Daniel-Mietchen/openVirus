Selection of foci with EGFP expression under mycophenolic acid (MPA) selection pressure was achieved through multiple rounds of plaque picking, followed by the progeny virions being grown in the absence of MPA to allow for removal of the selection markers. EGFP fluorescence was rapidly lost from these foci, indicating occurrence of a second recombination event resulting in either reversion to parental virus, or recombinant viruses containing the RVFV GP genes, but with the loss of the EGFP and gpt selection marker genes - LSD-RVF.mf.
