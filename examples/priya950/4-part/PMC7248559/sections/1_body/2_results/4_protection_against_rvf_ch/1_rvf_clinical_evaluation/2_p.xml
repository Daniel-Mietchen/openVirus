<p>All animals in the control group displayed typical clinical signs of RVFV infection, such as inappetence and occasional sternal recumbency. Control animal D2-2's temperature peaked at 42.2°C and it developed diarrhea 6 dpc. One control animal (D2-5) died at 5 dpc and was immediately necropsied. The carcass was bloated and partially autolyzed. The liver had multiple coalescing pale areas of necrosis surrounded by hemorrhagic hepatic parenchyma. Petechiae of the mucosa of the gall bladder and diffuse hemorrhaging of lymph nodes were observed – thus, the cause of death was linked to acute RVFV infection. Liver, kidney and spleen samples were sent for histopathology and IHC staining and evaluation related to RVFV infection (Idexx Laboratories, South Africa). Positive staining for RVFV antigen was detected in pooled organ samples from this animal, further supporting cause of death linked to RVFV infection.</p>
