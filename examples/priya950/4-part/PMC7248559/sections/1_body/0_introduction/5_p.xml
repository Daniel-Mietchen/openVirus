<p>The advantages of using a bivalent LSD-RVF.mf vaccine over conventional vaccination approaches include: (1) a vaccine which is cost effective; (2) since RVF outbreaks are cyclical, producers are reluctant to vaccinate as it is expensive, and thus having a bivalent capripoxvirus vaccine removes these economic reasons for not vaccinating; and (3) the bivalent vaccine is able to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) for RVF, allowing for serological surveillance testing to still be performed when it is in use. The impact of using the bivalent LSD-RVF.mf vaccine includes: (1) preventing mortality and debilitating disease in cattle caused by LSD and RVF in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa where the diseases both occur, leading to improved production and economic development; (2) indirectly protecting people from RVF virus by decreasing the viral loads in livestock; and (3) helping provide an effective barrier to further spread of RVFV into non-endemic countries.</p>
