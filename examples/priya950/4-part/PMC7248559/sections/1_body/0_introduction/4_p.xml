<p>However, not only is this bivalent vaccine classified as a genetically modified organism (GMO), but it also retains the dominant selection marker gene (gpt) conferring drug resistance, in addition to the EGFP marker gene. In order to satisfy environmental concerns over the use of products developed from micro-organisms expressing resistance genes and the sharp rise in pathogens in the field acquiring drug resistance (e.g., XDR tuberculosis) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) it is required that both marker genes are removed in order to satisfy regulatory agencies requirements for licensing the vaccine. This is routinely achieved for other poxvirus-vectored vaccine constructs using transient dominant selection (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As described in this paper, this method was employed to produce a selection marker-free LSD-RVF candidate vaccine, LSD-RVF.mf. Furthermore, this vaccine requires evaluation in the target species (cattle) to demonstrate its safety and efficacy, as there are numerous examples of vaccines which demonstrated protection in animal models, but failed when used in the target species.
