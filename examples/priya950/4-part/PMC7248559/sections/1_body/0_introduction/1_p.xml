<p>Capripoxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses in the family Poxviridae comprised of sheeppox, goatpox and lumpy skin disease viruses. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) causes fever and skin lesions in cattle leading to major economic losses as a result of high morbidity, and occasionally mortality (

The disease is most likely spread by insect and other arthropod vectors via mechanical transmission and is not highly contagious in the absence of potential vectors. This makes control of LSD difficult and impractical, even in non-endemic countries experiencing occasional incurrences, which have often used stamping-out through slaughter of infected cattle. Effective control can, however, be achieved through vaccination using live attenuated vaccines, as was more recently demonstrated in Europe using mass vaccination (
