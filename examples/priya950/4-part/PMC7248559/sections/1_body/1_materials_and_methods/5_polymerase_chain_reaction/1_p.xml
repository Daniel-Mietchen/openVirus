<p>Detection of recombinant viruses containing the RVFV GP genes and selection to homogeneity was performed using conventional PCR. In brief, a primer pair (MP1-F: 5′ – CTC CTG TAT TTA TAG AAC CTA – 3′; MP1-R: 5′ – GCA TTA TCA TTA TCG TCA TCA TC – 3′) was designed to amplify flanking regions of the LSDV TK gene (product size ~ 1.9 kilo-base pairs [kbp]), into which the RVFV GP genes were inserted (

 <sub>2</sub>), 2 μl 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Ex Taq
 <sup>TM</sup>) (Takara Biomedicals, Japan), 0.5 μl of each primer [20 pmoles each] [Gibco-BRL, UK], 1 μl template DNA (~ 0.1 ng) and 18.4 μl sterile distilled water. Template DNA was denatured for 45 s (sec) at 95°C, primer annealing was carried out at 62°C for 45 sec, and strand extension was at 72°C for 7 min (repeated through 35 amplification cycles) (preceded by an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 60 s and a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min and then holding at 4°C). PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel containing Ethidium bromide (EtBr).
