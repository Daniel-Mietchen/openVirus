<p>Total nucleic acid was extracted from serum samples using the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Kit (High Performance) (Roche, Switzerland). The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using the LC 480 One-step RNA Master kit (Roche, Switzerland), as per the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers and probe were used: RVS (Forward): 5′- AAA GGA ACA ATG GAC TCT GGT CA−3′; RVA (Reverse): 5′- CAC TTC TTA CTA CCA TGT CCT CCA AT−3′; RVP (Probe): 5′ –FAM- AAA GCT TTG ATA TCT CTC AGT GCC CCA A –BHQ−3′. The real-time RT-PCR reaction mix and the cycling conditions are listed in
