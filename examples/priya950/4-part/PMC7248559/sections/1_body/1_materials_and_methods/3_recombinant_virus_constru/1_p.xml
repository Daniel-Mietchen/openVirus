<p>The recombinant marker-free virus was generated, selected and characterized according to the improved method described by Wallace et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with the addition of a second round of selection in the absence of mycophenolic acid (MPA) selection pressure, resulting in a product free from both marker genes [known as transient dominant selection (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]. However, as a potential by-product of this selection method is a reconstituted parental virus (with an intact TK gene and no RVFV GP genes), a method was devised to enable selection of homogeneous marker-free recombinant virus expressing the RVFV GPs–in effect, an “intracellular” ELISA, as described below.
