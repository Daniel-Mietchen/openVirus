<p>The M35/74 field strain of RVFV was used as the inoculum for the RVFV challenge (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A freeze-dried ampule containing the virus was reconstituted in 1 ml Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Gibco, USA) and seeded onto a 90% confluent monolayer of BHK cells in EMEM (with 5% FCS and antibiotics). The infected cells were incubated at 37°C and were freeze-thawed between−20°C and room temperature (RT) three times 2 days after cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. The lysed cell/virus-containing medium was then aliquoted into 15 ml sterile conical tubes and stored at−20°C, and aliquots removed on two separate occasions for titration on BHK cells. On Day 0 of the trial, the required volume of inoculum was removed from a tube after thawing at RT, followed by mixing, and dilution to the required virus concentration in EMEM.
