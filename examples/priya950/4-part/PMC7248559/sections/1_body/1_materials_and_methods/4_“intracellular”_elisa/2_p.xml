<p>Once the cells were heavily infected (displaying &gt;80% cytopathogenic effect [cpe]), they were washed gently in PBS, fixed with ice-cold 70% acetone for 10 min (min) and allowed to dry overnight at 4°C. The fixed cells were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h in 10% fat-free milk powder (Elite, Clover, South Africa) (diluted in PBS) (300 μl/well), washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (with Tween 20, pH 8.0) (TST) wash buffer (Sigma, USA) (300 μl/well) and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 100 μl/well positive RVFV polyclonal sheep serum diluted 1:50 in 10% fat-free milk powder. The washing was repeated (as above) and the cells incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 100 μl/well Protein G-conjugated horseradish immunoperoxidase (Invitrogen, USA) diluted 1:10 000 in 10% fat-free milk powder. After another round of washing, 100 μl/well of TMB Ready-to-use substrate (Life Technologies [ThermoFisher Scientific, USA]) was added for 10 min and thereafter the color reaction development was stopped using sulphuric acid (Merck, USA) and the OD values were determined using a BioTek ELISA reader (Model: ELX808) (BioTek, USA) at 450 nm.</p>
