<p>Frozen half-aliquots of foci, selected due to their high OD values, as above, were removed from −20°C storage, thawed and frozen three times, and added to fresh uninfected FBT cells. Released virus was propagated and once cells displayed 100% cpe, viral and cellular DNA was purified using the Roche Magna Pure Total nucleic acid extraction kit (Roche, Switzerland) and a Roche MagNA Pure LC 2.0 extractor according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral foci were then characterized for homogeneity (free from parental LSDV virus and EGFP and gpt marker genes) using PCR-amplification of the target insertion region, as described next.</p>
