<p>Whole blood was collected from calves on the day of inoculation and 7 and 14 dpi, and similarly, equivalent days' post-challenge (dpc). The blood was aliquoted into sterile 1.5 ml tubes (Eppendorf, Germany). An equal volume of Lysis/binding buffer from the MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche, Switzerland) was added to the blood, which was then frozen at −20°C until further use. Once the samples were thawed, total nucleic acid extraction was performed using the kit (following its “Total NA HP” protocol) and a Roche MagNA Pure LC 2.0 extractor, both according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
