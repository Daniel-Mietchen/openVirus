<p>In the past, we developed and evaluated recombinant LSDV-vectored vaccines, including one expressing the protective glycoproteins (GPs) of RVFV, with retention of the selectable markers used for their generation and selection to homogeneity (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, due to environmental concerns regarding release of products containing genes that confer resistance to drugs (such as the 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> gpt gene), we have since redesigned our transfer vector plasmid to enable a second round of recombination after removal of selection pressure (called transient dominant selection) to remove the markers, resulting in a marker-free recombinant. This was performed in our laboratory for a new recombinant vaccine construct expressing the protective GPs of RVFV, called LSD-RVF.mf, as described in this paper.
