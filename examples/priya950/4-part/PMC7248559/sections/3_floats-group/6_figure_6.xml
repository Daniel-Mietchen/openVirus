   <bold>(B)</bold> CD8+ CD45RO+ cells in Group 2 (vaccinated and LSDV challenged animals) when PBMCs were stimulated with LSDV. Averages for the Group 1 (mock-vaccinated control animals: D1-1 to D1-5) are depicted in the line graph in both panels. PBMCs stimulated with antigen were normalized against unstimulated PBMCs. Significant differences, as compared to the negative control group with
