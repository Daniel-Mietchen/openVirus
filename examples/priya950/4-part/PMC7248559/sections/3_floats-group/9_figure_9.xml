  <p>RVFV neutralizing antibody titres in calves. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mock-vaccinated animals had no detectable virus neutralizing antibody levels at any days' post-inoculation (dpi) and are therefore not represented on the graph. Highest levels of neutralizing antibody titres were observed in all animals by 9 dpc. Animal D2-5 is not shown on the graph as neutralizing antibodies were not detected at 3 day's post-challenge (dpc), however, the animal died of acute RVF at 5 dpc. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Three calves inoculated with the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine sero-converted post-vaccination. A significant increase in titres were observed following challenge in all animals by 9 dpc (testing was performed up to a limit of 1:320 serum dilution, thus all final titres are higher).
