   <bold>(A)</bold> Temperatures of mock-vaccinated calves following challenge with the virulent LSDV_WB isolate. Increases in rectal temperatures indicative of pyrexia (&gt;39.5°C) were observed in calf D1-4 and D1-5 at 8 and 4 dpc, respectively. Febrile responses lasted for 4 days in animal D1-5, while the temperature normalized the following day in animal D1-4. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Temperatures of calves vaccinated with LSD-RVF.mf following challenge with the virulent LSDV_WB isolate. Increases in rectal temperatures indicative of pyrexia were observed in all calves, except animal A1-5, at 1 dpc. Febrile responses (in the range of 39.6–40.3°C) lasted for a single day, with temperatures normalizing by the following day.
