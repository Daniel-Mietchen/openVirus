  <p>LSDV-neutralizing antibody titres in calves. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mock-vaccinated animals had no detectable virus neutralizing antibody levels at any days' post-inoculation (dpi) and are therefore not represented on the graph. However, neutralizing antibody titres were observed in all animals by 11 days' post challenge (dpc) with the highest levels observed at 14 and 21 dpc. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> All calves inoculated with the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine sero-converted by 17 dpi with two animals sero-converting as early as 11 dpi. A significant increase in titres were observed following challenge in three animals by 14 dpc.
