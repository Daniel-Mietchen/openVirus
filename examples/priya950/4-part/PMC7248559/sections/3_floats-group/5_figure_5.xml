  <p>Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses in PBMCs collected from calves. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Group 2 (vaccinated and LSDV challenged) animals' PBMCs stimulated with LSDV. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Group 2 (vaccinated and RVFV challenged) animals stimulated with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antigen. Averages for the Group 1 (mock-vaccinated control animals: D1-1 to D1-5) are depicted in the line graph in both panels. PBMCs were isolated for IFN- γ responses on the day of inoculation (Day 0), 7 and 14 dpi, and 7 and 14 dpc. The average spots per million cells (spmc) for 5 calves are represented for ELISPOT as a bar graph while individual animals' data are also indicated at each time point. Significant differences, as compared to the average 0 dpi data with 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01, are indicated with**.
