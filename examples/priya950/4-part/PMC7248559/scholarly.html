Abstract</div> <p>Lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever are two high-priority livestock diseases which have the potential to spread into previously free regions through animal movement and/or vectors, as well as intentional release by bioterrorists. Since the distribution range of both diseases is similar in Africa, it makes sense to use a bivalent vaccine to control them. This may lead to the more consistent and sustainable use of vaccination against Rift Valley fever through a more cost-effective vaccine. In this study, a recombinant lumpy skin disease virus was constructed in which the thymidine kinase gene was used as the insertion site for the Gn and Gc protective glycoprotein genes of Rift Valley fever virus using homologous recombination. Selection markers, the enhanced green fluorescent protein and <i>Escherichia coli</i> guanidine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt), were used for selection of recombinant virus and in a manner enabling a second recombination event to occur upon removal of the gpt selection-pressure allowing the removal of both marker genes in the final product. This recombinant virus, LSD-RVF.mf, was selected to homogeneity, characterized and evaluated in cattle as a vaccine to show protection against both lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever in cattle. The results demonstrate that the LSD-RVF.mf is safe, immunogenic and can protect cattle against both diseases.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Introduction</div> <p>Capripoxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses in the family Poxviridae comprised of sheeppox, goatpox and lumpy skin disease viruses. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) causes fever and skin lesions in cattle leading to major economic losses as a result of high morbidity, and occasionally mortality (<a href="#B1">1</a>). No country in sub-Saharan Africa claimed freedom from this disease since its discovery (OIE, HandiSTATUS, 02/02/05). LSD has rapidly spread from its historical range in most of Africa, through the Middle East into Eastern Europe (<a href="#B2">2</a>) and many countries in Asia (<a href="#B3">3</a>), currently as far as China, Bangladesh and India. The disease is most likely spread by insect and other arthropod vectors via mechanical transmission and is not highly contagious in the absence of potential vectors. This makes control of LSD difficult and impractical, even in non-endemic countries experiencing occasional incurrences, which have often used stamping-out through slaughter of infected cattle. Effective control can, however, be achieved through vaccination using live attenuated vaccines, as was more recently demonstrated in Europe using mass vaccination (<a href="#B4">4</a>). Lumpy skin disease and sheep and goat pox are ranked in the top 20 global diseases for impact on the poor (<a href="#B5">5</a>).</p> <p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an RNA virus and member of the Phenuiviridae family (<a href="#B6">6</a>) originally described in the 1930's in Kenya in the Rift Valley (<a href="#B7">7</a>). The geographic distribution of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was limited to sub-Saharan Africa until outbreaks in Egypt in the 1970's (<a href="#B8">8</a>). In 2000, RVFV spread into Yemen and Saudi Arabia (<a href="#B9">9</a>). Fortunately, the outbreak was contained and it appears that RVFV is not currently present in the Middle East. However, there is always the risk of new outbreaks, which could become endemic. Rift Valley fever virus is a vector-borne pathogen spread by mosquitos and can infect a wide range of ruminants including cattle, sheep, goats and camels. In livestock, disease is characterized by fever, diarrhea, and abortions. Unlike LSDV, RVFV is a zoonotic virus that regularly causes epidemics among people (<a href="#B10">10</a>, <a href="#B11">11</a>). As a zoonotic disease, RVF is ranked in the top 10 globally. The virus is also of major economic importance in livestock across sub-Saharan Africa and more recently in the Middle East, primarily as a result of trade embargoes on exports of mainly sheep from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. There are vaccines available for controlling RVF and numerous experimental vaccines in development (<a href="#B12">12</a>, <a href="#B13">13</a>). Since both LSDV and RVFV infect cattle and share the same geographic distribution in Africa, a bivalent vaccine able to protect against both diseases would be advantageous. This can be achieved by either formulating a vaccine combining a live attenuated LSD vaccine strain together with a live attenuated RVF vaccine or by generating a single, recombinant vaccine with protective components of both viruses.</p> <p>Previously, an LSD-vectored candidate vaccine expressing the RVFV Gn (G2) and Gc (G1) glycoproteins was developed by the Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (ARC-OVI) in collaboration with Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP Ltd). This vaccine utilizes the South African live attenuated Onderstepoort LSD vaccine as vector, which co-expresses the RVFV structural glycoprotein (GP) genes under control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K early/late promoter inserted into the LSDV viral thymidine kinase gene (<a href="#B14">14</a>). Two selectable marker genes are also present (the <i>E. coli</i> guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) gene and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene), which assist with the initial stages of recombinant virus selection. This bivalent LSD-RVF vaccine has been shown to fully protect mice and 1-year old Merino sheep against virulent RVFV challenge, in preliminary safety and efficacy tests (<a href="#B15">15</a>).</p> <p>However, not only is this bivalent vaccine classified as a genetically modified organism (GMO), but it also retains the dominant selection marker gene (gpt) conferring drug resistance, in addition to the EGFP marker gene. In order to satisfy environmental concerns over the use of products developed from micro-organisms expressing resistance genes and the sharp rise in pathogens in the field acquiring drug resistance (e.g., XDR tuberculosis) (<a href="#B16">16</a>) it is required that both marker genes are removed in order to satisfy regulatory agencies requirements for licensing the vaccine. This is routinely achieved for other poxvirus-vectored vaccine constructs using transient dominant selection (<a href="#B17">17</a>, <a href="#B18">18</a>). As described in this paper, this method was employed to produce a selection marker-free LSD-RVF candidate vaccine, LSD-RVF.mf. Furthermore, this vaccine requires evaluation in the target species (cattle) to demonstrate its safety and efficacy, as there are numerous examples of vaccines which demonstrated protection in animal models, but failed when used in the target species.</p> <p>The advantages of using a bivalent LSD-RVF.mf vaccine over conventional vaccination approaches include: (1) a vaccine which is cost effective; (2) since RVF outbreaks are cyclical, producers are reluctant to vaccinate as it is expensive, and thus having a bivalent capripoxvirus vaccine removes these economic reasons for not vaccinating; and (3) the bivalent vaccine is able to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) for RVF, allowing for serological surveillance testing to still be performed when it is in use. The impact of using the bivalent LSD-RVF.mf vaccine includes: (1) preventing mortality and debilitating disease in cattle caused by LSD and RVF in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa where the diseases both occur, leading to improved production and economic development; (2) indirectly protecting people from RVF virus by decreasing the viral loads in livestock; and (3) helping provide an effective barrier to further spread of RVFV into non-endemic countries.</p> <p>Determining the precise impact of these diseases on incomes of the poor would require a dedicated study. However, bearing in mind the fact that LSD and RVF viruses are OIE listed diseases and the current vaccine uptake of individual vaccines against these diseases is relatively high, this vaccine could become more widely used and have greater benefit in developing countries than most other livestock vaccines currently available. A recent study determined that vaccination against LSD is cost effective and yields a significant investment return to both smallholder and large commercial producers (<a href="#B19">19</a>).</p> <p>Since currently used live attenuated LSD and RVF vaccines are effective following a single dose, any new vaccine must also be effective following a single administration in order to be used in the field. Therefore, the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine was evaluated in cattle for its ability to provide protection using a single administration against both virulent LSD and RVF challenge and the results are presented here.</p> </div> <div class="materials and methods" title="materials and methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Viruses</div> <p>The South African Neethling vaccine strain of LSDV, produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP LTD), was used as parental virus (<a href="#B21">21</a>) for the generation of recombinants.</p> <p>The virulent LSDV Warmbaths field isolate (LSDV_WB) (GenBank Accession no.

A freeze-dried ampule containing the virus was reconstituted in 1 ml Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Gibco, USA) and seeded onto a 90% confluent monolayer of BHK cells in EMEM (with 5% FCS and antibiotics).

Recombinant Virus Construction, Selection and Characterization</div> <p>The OBP vaccine strain of LSDV was used as the parental virus with the pLS(EG)-RV insertion plasmid containing the RVFV GP genes and EGFP and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> gpt selection marker genes to generate recombinant virus through the use of homologous recombination (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Material 1</a>) (<a href="#B24">24</a>). Selection of foci with EGFP expression under mycophenolic acid (MPA) selection pressure was achieved through multiple rounds of plaque picking, followed by the progeny virions being grown in the absence of MPA to allow for removal of the selection markers. EGFP fluorescence was rapidly lost from these foci, indicating occurrence of a second recombination event resulting in either reversion to parental virus, or recombinant viruses containing the RVFV GP genes, but with the loss of the EGFP and gpt selection marker genes - LSD-RVF.mf.</p> <p>Multiple foci lacking EGFP expression were selected, half portions of each were frozen at −20°C and the remainder subjected to the "Intracellular ELISA�? technique developed and described under the Materials and Methods.

Discussion</div> <p>Lumpy skin disease is no longer an "African�? disease, as it has spread into the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Russia and Kazakhstan, with rapid recent spread into China, Bangladesh and India, which significantly increases the risk of LSD spreading into the remaining free countries in Asia. Currently, only the Americas, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Indo-Pacific islands, amongst others, can claim to be LSD-free. However, these regions face a constant threat of inadvertent or intentional introduction.</p> <p>In contrast, so far Rift Valley fever has remained within Africa, except for infrequent spread to Saudi Arabia and Yemen in the Middle East. It is possible that Rift Valley fever virus could spread into new regions, including the Americas, as was the case with West Nile virus. Increasing socio-political unrest and bioterrorism have drastically increased the risk for further spread of the disease.</p> <p>Vaccination is the proven method for controlling both human and animal diseases, and its use has been demonstrated to successfully control LSD and RVF. Although efficacious vaccines exist for both, due to the sporadic nature of RVF outbreaks requiring factors such as weather and mosquito vectors acting together to produce a "perfect storm,�? vaccination against the disease is not practiced consistently. This results in increasing the susceptible ruminant population over time. Outbreaks of LSD, by contrast, generally occur annually, therefore vaccination is practiced more regularly. For many smallholder farmers across Africa, the high cost of vaccines, lack of education on their many benefits, and limited access and available infrastructure to enable their proper storage at low temperatures, are some factors which impede their regular use. In addition, not all governments provide aid to support vaccination programs. The development and use of multivalent and combination vaccines in the medical and veterinary field have offered a partial solution to these problems. Lumpy skin disease virus has been investigated for its ability to perform as a stable and versatile vaccine delivery platform, as has been the case for other poxviruses such as vaccinia virus and canarypox virus, but with the added advantage of providing additional protection against LSD – and, sheep- and goat-pox (<a href="#B12">12</a>). Since vaccination for LSD is routinely practiced, having a bivalent- or multivalent-vectored vaccine based on LSDV has advantages compared to conventional vaccination using multiple vaccines.</p> <p>In the past, we developed and evaluated recombinant LSDV-vectored vaccines, including one expressing the protective glycoproteins (GPs) of RVFV, with retention of the selectable markers used for their generation and selection to homogeneity (<a href="#B15">15</a>). However, due to environmental concerns regarding release of products containing genes that confer resistance to drugs (such as the <i>E.coli</i> gpt gene), we have since redesigned our transfer vector plasmid to enable a second round of recombination after removal of selection pressure (called transient dominant selection) to remove the markers, resulting in a marker-free recombinant. This was performed in our laboratory for a new recombinant vaccine construct expressing the protective GPs of RVFV, called LSD-RVF.mf, as described in this paper.</p> <p>This study demonstrates that the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine was safe in cattle. It was not detected in the blood following vaccination, indicating that the vaccine is attenuated, unlike virulent LSDV, which can be detected in blood following infection. The LSD-RVF.mf vaccine elicited protective immunity against both LSDV and RVFV challenge. It is likely that both antibody (humoral) and cell-mediated immunity elicited by the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine are important for protection against both diseases. Low levels of neutralizing antibodies specific for LSDV and RVFV were elicited by the LSD-RVF.mf vaccine prior to challenge. Protection against RVFV challenge in the vaccinated group of animals appears to be associated with neutralizing antibody development to the virus.</p> <p>Cellular immunity was measured using the same parameters as described in a related study (<a href="#B22">22</a>). ELISPOT assays were used to determine the number of IFN-γ-producing cells in calves and the results demonstrated that LSD-RVF.mf-vaccinated animals had higher numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells compared to calves in the control groups following challenge with LSDV and stimulation with LSDV antigen. The increased number of IFN-γ-producing cells correlated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in PBMCs of the vaccinated animals post-challenge. Production of IFN-γ by memory T cells is a key element required for the control of virus infections (<a href="#B33">33</a>). It was also demonstrated that the PBMCs of vaccinated calves produced IFN-γ 7 dpi when stimulated with RVFV antigen and a RVFV-specific memory CD8+ T cell response was detected at 14 dpi. The production of IFN-γ may be considered as a key factor for survival in RVFV infection. It has been shown that IFN-γ treatment can reduce RVF infection in rhesus monkeys (<a href="#B34">34</a>) and in other monkey models early production of IFN-γ and CD8+ T cells were detected in survivors (<a href="#B35">35</a>). The source of IFN-γ at 7 dpi is most likely NK cells (<a href="#B36">36</a>), but CD8+ T cells cannot be ruled out, since elevated levels of both were detected in the PBMCs of calf C2-4 at 7 dpi.</p> <p>This study demonstrates that the currently used commercial OBP LSD vaccine can be used as a vaccine vector in cattle for RVFV protective antigens. This vaccine has DIVA capability for RVF enabling improved surveillance of RVF. This vaccine also has the potential to improve vaccination coverage for RVF, as the current vaccines are not used consistently, due mainly to cost factors. Further work is required for registration of this vaccine to allow it to be used in the field, although it has undergone small-scale batch formulation and the process parameters at a small scale have been determined by Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP Ltd) in South Africa. The vaccine is safe to use and protects cattle against LSD and RVF, as demonstrated in this pilot phase cattle trial. However, recent updates in regulatory requirements for the biological license application for new veterinary vaccines necessitates additional regulatory process undertakings toward product registration for a marketing license in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No. 101 of 1965), as gazetted by the government of South Africa. This will require vaccine pilot batch production, including master seed characterization and clinical validation of this vaccine batch in cattle for safety and efficacy. Plans are in progress to enable these additional studies.</p> </div> <div class="data-availability" title="data-availability"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
