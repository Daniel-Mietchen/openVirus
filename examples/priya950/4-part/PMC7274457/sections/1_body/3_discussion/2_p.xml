<p>In the past two decades, a gradual replacement of JEV GIII by JEV GIb has occurred, JEV GIb is now dominant or co-circulates with JEV GIII in many JE endemic regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, further analyses of the genotype, hosts, and geographical distribution of the isolates revealed that although JEV GIb has become the dominant genotype since 2000, most of the JEVs isolated from JE cases were still JEV GIII (JEV GIb: 54 vs JEV GIII: 175), while most JEV isolates from mosquitoes were JEV GIb (JEV GIb: 278 vs JEV GIII: 197). These findings suggest that although JEV GIb has displaced JEV GIII by achieving a more efficient replication, its host is restricted as evidenced by the fewer number of isolates from cases than JEV GIII as reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The laboratory results of several JE outbreaks in Asia in recent years also confirm the above analyses. In the JE outbreak in Korea in 2010 (28 cases with 7 deaths), JEV GIb was only detected in local mosquito specimens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the JE outbreak in India the same year, 13 JEVs were isolated from JE cases, of which 11 were JEV GIII and 2 were JEV GI [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The same situation occurred in China, JEV GIII and GI were detected from both cases and local mosquitoes in a JE outbreak with 80 cases and 22 deaths [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In other words, although JEV GIb has become the dominant virus, JEV GIII still involved in each reported JE outbreak, In other words, although JEV GIb has become the dominant virus, JEV GIII still involved in each JE outbreak, that is to say, so far, no reports of JE outbreak has been reported with JEV GIb isolated from both collected case samples and local mosquito samples without the involvement of JEV GIII. Therefore, it seems that JEV GIb cannot cause an outbreak of JE in humans alone. However, recent data have shown that the infectivity of JEV GIb in

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]and 
 <italic>C</italic>.

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] is equivalent to that of JEV GIII and higher than that of JEV GIa. These findings show that JEV GIb has the potential to cause an outbreak, but data to support this is still lacking. In our study of the 2018 Ningxia JE outbreak, only JEV GIb were detected from both JE cases and
