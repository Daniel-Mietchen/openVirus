<p>The Serum samples were serially diluted two-fold beginning at a 1:5 dilution and ending at 1: 160, then mixed with an equal volume JEV P3 strain at 200 pfu/100 μL. Different virus dilutions (100 pfu/100 μL, 10 pfu/100 μL, and 1 pfu/100 μL) were used as controls. The mixed solution was incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h. The incubated mixed solution was then added to BHK-21 newborn hamster kidney cells [

 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h. Then the cells were supplemented with 4 mL 1.2% methylcellulose-MEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated for 3–5 days at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until significant viral plaques were observed. Finally, the cell layers were stained with crystal violet, the number of viral plaques was counted, and the neutralizing antibody titer was calculated [
