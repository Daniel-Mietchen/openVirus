<p>The mosquito grinding supernatant was filter-sterilized and inoculated into a 24-well plate (Corning, Inc, NY, USA) with Vero cells (African green ape kidney cells) grown to a 90% confluent monolayer. For virus isolation, 70 μL mosquito supernatant was added per well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. Then the cells were supplemented with 1 mL per well MEM containing 2% FBS. The cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily. Specimens with no CPE were used for blind transmission for three generations [
