 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> lists the results of JEV genetic testing and sequence determination of virus detected from JE patients (NX1889) and mosquito samples positive for JEV gene amplification. Among them, 16 pools of JEV positive mosquito samples were obtained by qRT-PCR, while 9 and 7 pools were positive of JEV C + PrM and E gene amplification and sequencing, respectively. The results of nucleotide sequence determination and evolution analyses of the 8 E gene positive samples showed that all of them were JEV GIb.
