<p>Worldwide, annual epidemics of seasonal influenza are estimated to result in 3–5 million cases of severe illness, and up to 650,000 deaths annually are associated with respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza.

 </sup> While influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics, only A types have been evidenced to cause pandemics. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes according to the combination of proteins on their surface; hemagglutinins (HA) and neuraminidases (NA)—for example, the H1N1 strain pandemic in 2009.

 </sup> During infection, influenza virus particles display trimeric HAs that bind to sialosides on the surface of their host cells to facilitate internalization. While all influenza strains bind sialosides, human strains preferentially bind to terminal α2,6 sialic acids, whereas avian influenza viruses show preference for α2,3 sialic acids.

 </sup> Zoonosis (interspecies transmission) can occur due to mutations in the HA, enabling a switch from α2,3 to α2,6. This allows avian influenza to infect humans, and often occurs in porcine (pig) hosts, which present both α2,3 to α2,6 sialosides in their respiratory tracts.

 </sup> Humans can be infected with avian, porcine, and other zoonotic influenza viruses including avian influenza subtypes; H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 and swine flu virus subtypes; H1N1 (swine flu pandemic 2009), H1N2, and H3N2.

 <italic>N</italic>-glycolyl modifications (in addition to 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl) play a significant role in species-dependent binding

 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans from human lungs,

 </sup> Therefore, the study of HA interactions with sialic acids is essential to increase our understanding of this global pathogen and to help guide the discovery of new diagnostics and treatments.
