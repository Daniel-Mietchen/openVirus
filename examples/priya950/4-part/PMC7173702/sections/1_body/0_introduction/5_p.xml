<p>Considering the above, the aim of this work was to develop a multivalent nanoparticle platform to dissect the binding trends of influenza HAs toward multivalent sialic acid isomers. A library-oriented screen of 27 nanoparticle formulations was used to identify the optimum size and linker length, and then translated to enable 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactosamine attachment to multivalent gold nanoparticles. The binding affinities of these particles were evaluated by colorimetric aggregation assays, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and biolayer interferometry (BLI) to ensure the whole binding landscape was probed. A panel of eight HAs, including human and avian, were interrogated with the particles, and it was demonstrated that the multivalent presentation enables significant cross-binding between human and avian strains.</p>
