<p>The binding affinity of a HA toward an individual sialoside is weak (

 <sub>d</sub> ≈ 2 mM),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> but because of the multivalent presentation of both the HA (∼200–1000 copies/virus) and the dense layer of sialic acids on the cell surface,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
 </sup> the affinity is significantly increased by the cluster glycoside effect.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
 </sup> Hence, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, HAs engage with cell–surface sialic acids which are not presented as free molecules in solution, but rather multivalent ensembles as in the glycocalyx. Strategies to probe and dissect HA function should reproduce this multivalent environment to be truly predictive. There are many examples where multivalent materials, in particular polymers, have been used to engage with carbohydrate binding proteins, with most studies focusing on plant lectins, which are of limited biomedical relevance.
