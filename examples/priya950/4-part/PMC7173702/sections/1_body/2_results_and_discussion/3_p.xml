<p>To enable protein binding studies, it was essential to first screen the library for colloidal stability in the buffer to prevent false positives in aggregation screens. Both particle size and polymer length impact this, and it is a crucial step in any binding assay. The galactose functional particles were screened for aggregation stability by observing the increase in Abs

From this, it was clear that for all particle sizes, ligands with a DP above 25 were essential to obtain colloidally stable particles, in line with the previous reports.

 </sup> From this screen, it was decided to study protein binding using particles coated with polymers DP25–DP50 to avoid false positives due to buffer-induced aggregation. To screen for binding, the model lectin, SBA was used to validate the methods and to establish which particle structural requirements gave the strongest outputs,
