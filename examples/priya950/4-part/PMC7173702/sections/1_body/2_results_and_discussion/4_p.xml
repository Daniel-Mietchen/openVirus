For all polymer lengths, the largest changes were seen for the shortest polymer chain length (DP25) with a step-wise decrease as polymer length increases, and the biggest (70 nm) particles gave the largest outputs. Although the aggregation assay used above provides a convenient output of binding, it cannot rule out the case where lectins bind but fail to agglutinate. For example, the longer polymer linkers are likely able to bind to SBA, but also provide a steric block against agglutination, highlighting the need for tuning of these parameters. Therefore, a second assay using BLI was developed.

 </sup> In short, biotinylated SBA was immobilized onto SA functional BLI sensors (ForteBio) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>B) and the nanoparticles exposed to this. As BLI is mass sensitive, individual glycans do not give a strong signal, but when coupled in this nanoparticle format, larger signals are obtained. In addition, cluster glycoside enhancement is achieved and is a key benefit of this approach. The total BLI signal as a function of particle parameters is shown in

 </xref>D. The shorter polymers at all particle sizes gave the largest outputs; however, there was little binding observed to the SBA when DP50 polymers were used. This suggests that the lower density of longer polymers is reducing overall affinity and multivalent enhancement. Brewer and co-workers,

 </sup> Larger particles gave more signal, but it should be noted that BLI is a mass-weighted analysis method and hence only qualitative trends can be compared for nanoparticle size.
