<p>Influenza A can be categorized by the different subtypes of the proteins present of which there are at least 18 different HA subtypes named H1 to H18.

 </sup> The panel of HAs used were from the five strains with human hosts: H1 from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, H2 from A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2), H3 from A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), H7 from, A/Canada/rv444/2004 (H7N3), and H9 from A/Hong Kong/33982/2009 (H9N2); and two from avian hosts: H4 from A/mallard/Alberta/455/2015 (H4N6) and H5 from A/duck/Hunan/795/2002 (H5N1); and another zoonotic strain, H10 from A/harbor seal/Germany/1/2014 (H10N7) (seal host), and it enables the study of pathogenic processes without the need for intact viral particles. HAs were immobilized onto the BLI sensors using biotin/SA (as above). BLI has been widely used to evaluate hemagglutinin/neuraminidase function using isolated proteins and the whole virus.

There was a difference in response in terms of total mass captured and the rate of binding, reiterating the range of binding affinities shown by HAs from different pathogenic strains (low pathogenic avian strains) when presented in a multivalent format.

 </xref>C shows the maximal binding of the particles to the HAs for both 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactosamine-functionalized AuNPs. A key feature here is that although many of the avian HAs are characterized as being α2,3-selective based on previous studies using monovalent compounds, there is clearly cross-affinity in most cases using our multivalent system. This shows the importance of this study, as it shows that glycan specificity can change when in multivalent format because of the enhancement of weak interactions, as well as stronger ones. H9 in particular showed significant binding to both 2,3-sialyllactosamine and 2,6-sialyllactosamine AuNPs, indicating that it can bind to both human and avian sialic acids, which is consistent with the virus being of avian origins infecting a human host. This crossover in binding has also been observed by Godula and co-workers,

 </sup> where significant binding of H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 which transmitted into humans) was noted toward both α2,6 and α2,3 sialylated polymer microarrays. In contrast, more discrete binding was observed with H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/68) which bound only to α2,6 but not to α2,3 sialylated polymer arrays (note that the specific strains were not the same as used in this study). Furthermore, McCauley and co-workers have investigated the mammalian transmissibility of many avian and other zoonotic influenza strains including H7N9,

 </sup> by looking at the binding of sialylated polymers to viruses. In particular, a panel of H9N2 viruses from different origins were assessed for their binding to α2,6 and α2,3 sialylated polymer-functionalized BLI sensors.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>
 </sup> Wide-ranging binding variability was noted to different H9N2 viruses, with the H9N2 (A/Hong Kong/33982/2009) virus (the same H9 used in this study) showing greater binding toward α2,6 sialylated polymers over α2,3 sialylated polymers, which is in agreement with our results here, supporting the approach taken (dose-dependent BLI binding curves for H1 from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, H7 from A/Canada/rv444/2004 (H7N3), and H9 from H9N2 (A/Hong Kong/33982/2009) in the

The H7N9 strain has been reported to retain its avian affinity preference even with mutations to target human receptors, which we also observed using this nanoparticle system.

 </xref>D plots the relative binding preferences, defined as the maximal binding of 2,6-sialyllactosamine nanoparticles, minus the maximal binding of 2,3-sialyllactosamine to each hemagglutinin. As the same coating and same nanoparticle core was used in each case, this enabled visualization of the differences in total particle captured to the haemagglutinin. These results show that our nanoparticle system generates sufficient signal amplification to enable the evaluation of glycans for binding haemagglutinins and to unravel the cross-affinity due to the multivalent presentation. It is important to note that these results may be specific to the sialyllactose ligands being employed here, which are readily available compared to, for example, complex branched glycans. It does show that, however, in multivalent format both the extent of binding and relative binding between the isomers varies between the hemagglutinins and may offer routes to multiplexed sensing and discrimination.
