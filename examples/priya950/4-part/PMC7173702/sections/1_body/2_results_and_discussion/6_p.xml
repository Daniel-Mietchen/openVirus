<p>These glycoparticles were first tested against WGA, a lectin known to have some affinity to sialic acids.

 </sup> Using UVâ€“vis to monitor aggregation, it appeared that both 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactosamines had similar affinities toward WGA (

 </xref>A), which was not expected. However, parallel DLS investigations (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>B) showed 2,6-sialyllactosamine to cluster faster and to give larger cluster sizes, which is consistent with it having a stronger interaction than 2,3-sialyllactosamine. BLI analysis against WGA immobilized on a surface showed greater specificity for the 2,6-sialyllactosamine compared to 2,3-sialyllactosamine, which is in line with the previous reports. This set of analyses shows that the colorimetric changes of glyconanoparticles are useful for comparisons of affinity, but more detailed methods (such as the BLI) are required, especially if unknown/new interactions are being evaluated.
