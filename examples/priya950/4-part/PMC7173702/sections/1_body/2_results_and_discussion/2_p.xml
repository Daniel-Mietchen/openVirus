 </xref>G–I). The three different nanoparticle sizes were coated with the nine different polymers to generate a diverse library of 27 multivalent glyconanoparticles, this convergent strategy maximized structural diversity. DLS measurements showed an increase in hydrodynamic diameter, along with a red-shift in the SPR peak (λ
 <sub>max</sub>), both consistent with polymer coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm polymer coating on AuNPs by increased N 1s (from amide) as well as C 1s signals (
