<p>The above data shows that DP25 PHEA ligands on 70 nm particles give strong binding, and that the amidation/conjugation methodology enables installation of sialic acid isomers with retention of their biological binding specificities and affinities. The particles were then taken forward into a screen against a panel of HAs. A single nanoparticle/polymer length combination was used to ensure that grafting density differences did not affect the observed outcomes, where glycan density display is likely to play a significant role.</p>
