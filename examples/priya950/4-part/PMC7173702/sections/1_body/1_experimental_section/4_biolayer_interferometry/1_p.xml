<p>BLI was carried out on ForteBio Octet Red96 (ForteBio, USA). Assays were performed in black 96-well half area plates. Assays were carried out at 30 °C and agitated at 1000 rpm. SA biosensor tips (ForteBio, USA) were hydrated in milliQ H
 <sub>2</sub>O water for at least 10 min prior to use. A stable baseline was established in milliQ water for 1 min. The biosensors were functionalized by loading with 10 μg/mL biotinylated lectin or HA in PBS for 5 min followed by a 1 min equilibration step in 10 mM HEPES with 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> to remove any unbound protein and to establish a stable baseline. Following protein immobilization, the binding association with galactosylated and sialylated AuNPs was carried out in 10 mM HEPES with 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min followed by dissociation in 10 mM HEPES with 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min.
