<p>HEA (0.5 g, 4.34 mmol), pentafluorophenyl 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid (PFP-DMP) (0.092 g, 0.17 mmol), and ACVA (0.0097 g, 0.034 mmol) were dissolved in 50:50 toluene/methanol (4 mL). Mesitylene (150 μL) was added as an internal reference. An aliquot was taken for NMR analysis in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>. The solution was degassed under N
 <sub>2</sub> for 30 min. The reaction was stirred at 70 °C for 90 min. An aliquot was taken for NMR analysis in MeOD. The reaction was rapidly cooled in liquid nitrogen and precipitated into diethyl ether. The polymer was reprecipitated into diethyl ether from methanol twice to yield a yellow polymer product that was dried under vacuum. 96% conversion by NMR,
