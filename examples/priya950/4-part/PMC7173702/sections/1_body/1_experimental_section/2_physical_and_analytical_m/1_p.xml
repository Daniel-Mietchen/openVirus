 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DPX-300 and DPX-400 spectrometers using deuterated solvents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chemical shifts are reported relative to residual non-deuterated solvent. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out in dimethylformamide (DMF) and run on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II-MDS instrument equipped with differential refractive index, dual wavelength UV detectors, viscometry and light scattering detectors. The system was equipped with 2× PLgel mixed D columns (300 × 7.5 mm) and a PLgel 5 μm guard column. The eluent is DMF with 5 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>BF
 <sub>4</sub> additive. Samples were run at 1 mL·min
 <sup>–1</sup> at 50 °C. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (Agilent EasiVials) were used for calibration. Analyte samples were filtered through a nylon filter with 0.22 μm pore size before injection. Experimental molar mass (
