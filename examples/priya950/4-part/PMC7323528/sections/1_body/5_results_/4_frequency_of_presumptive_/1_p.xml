<p>Among the 209 participants with a previous CHIKV infection, 24 (11.5%) reported receiving a clinical presumptive diagnosis of chikungunya. Although low, this frequency was 7.5 (95% CI 4.3â€“12.9) times greater than the 1.5% (24/1,563) frequency among the participants who were negative for CHIKV IgG (p&lt;0.01). Noteworthy for the 32 CHIKV-infected participants who had symptomatic disease, 20 (62.5%) reported a presumptive clinical diagnosis of chikungunya (
