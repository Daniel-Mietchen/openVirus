<p>In summary, our findings suggest that although CHIKV and ZIKV both spread through Salvador in the same year, 2015 (

 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>), transmission of CHIKV seems to have been much less intense, reaching ≈12% of the population, compared to estimates of 63%–73% for ZIKV (

 </xref>). Viral competition within hosts and vectors may be a key element in explaining this dynamic. Further comparative studies on immunopathogenesis and vectorial competence are needed to clarify why these 2 arboviruses, transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, presented such different patterns of transmission spread, given that the population was completely naive for both of them.
