<p>Serum surveys performed in Haiti during December 2014 and February 2015, about 1 year after detection of the index case in the country, also found large variations in the seroprevalence (mean of 78.4% for the urban sites and 44.9% for the rural sites) (

Furthermore, a very localized and self-restricted CHIKV outbreak has been recently described in Salvador (
