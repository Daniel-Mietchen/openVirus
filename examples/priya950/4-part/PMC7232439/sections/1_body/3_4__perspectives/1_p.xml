<p>During IAV infection, multiple immune systems coordinate together to protect the host. Accordingly, viruses antagonize the immune system through multiple measures to establish a successful infection. Considering the high frequencies in genome mutations and recombination, vaccination is the most effective way to defend against the viruses via inducing cross-protective antibodies and/or enhancing immune responses. Several studies in vaccine development have tried to enhance host immune responses. For instance, vaccine candidate containing HA targeted to chemokine receptor (porcine MIP1Î±) was shown to enhance T cell responses, resulting in a strong and cross-reactive cellular immunity in vaccinated pigs [

Another example is an attempt to intranasally administer a polyanhydride nano vaccine (IAV-nanovax), which could promote robust lung-resident germinal center (GC) B cells with lung-localized IAV-specific antibody responses as well as lung-resident memory CD4
