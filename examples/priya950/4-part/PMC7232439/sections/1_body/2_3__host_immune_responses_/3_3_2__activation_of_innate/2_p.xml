<p>Toll-like receptors are responsible for sensing pathogens at cell membranes, endosomes, and lysosome [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. TLR3 and TLR7 are shown to be involved in IAV detection at endosomes [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which may be released by cellular stress and cell death [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] and unidentified RNA structures in phagocytosed cells infected with IAVs [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In macrophages and dendritic cells, TLR3 interacted with TIR-domain-containing adapter, then activated the serine-threonine kinase IκKε (IKKε) and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), the process of which further led to expression of IFN-β [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. In addition, an over-reacting TLR3 activation promoted IAV pathogenesis, which could be reduced by a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON) functioning as a TLR3 inhibitor, resulting in restrained viral loads both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. TLR7 recognizes single stranded RNA (ssRNA). In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), after activation of TLR7 during IAV infection, IRF7 or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were activated via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) to induce type I IFNs [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. In avian macrophages, activation of TLR7 produced pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-1β [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. In addition, in mouse models, TLR7 played an important role in activation of NK cells [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. It was also shown to be involved in development of adaptive immunity to prevent IAV infection [
