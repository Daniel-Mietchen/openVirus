<p>The reaction of innate immunity is nonspecific. It is triggered by recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I proteins (RIG-I), and NOD-like receptors are common PRRs, the activation of which leads to activation of innate immune signaling and further production of cytokines as well as other antiviral molecules.</p>
