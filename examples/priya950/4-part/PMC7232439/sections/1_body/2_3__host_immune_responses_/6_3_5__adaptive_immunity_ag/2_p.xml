<p>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are major components for virus clearance in adaptive immunity. After activated by DCs, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells undergo rapid expansion, differentiation, and migration to the infected sites. In general, to establish effective primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells play an essential role, with a mouse model as an exception [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. CTLs produce cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes (GrA and GrB) to induce apoptosis and interrupt IAV replication [
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. In addition, CTLs produce cytokines, such as TNF, FASL, and TRAIL, which recruit death receptors to induce apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B190-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. In addition, IL16 deficiency enhanced the Th1 and CTL responses upon IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B191-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Furthermore, as CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells could last for two years in murine models, IAV-specific memory CTLs reacted specific to epitopes in conserved IAV proteins [
 <xref rid="B192-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. In the nasal epithelia, they could prevent the spread of the virus from the URT to the lung [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, autophagy plays an important role [
 <xref rid="B194-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], while the function of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in memory CTL responses is “context-dependent”. A recent study showed that CD4+ T cells promoted IAV-specific CTL memory at the initial priming stage of viral infection [
 <xref rid="B195-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Grant and her colleagues summarized and discussed the importance of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell immunity against IAVs [
 <xref rid="B192-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>], and this review is recommended for further reading.
