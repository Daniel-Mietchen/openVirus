<p>Several viral proteins are involved in regulation of host apoptosis. NP protein induces host apoptosis to favor viral replication through interaction with ring finger 43 (RNF43) [
 <xref rid="B208-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>], apoptotic inhibitor 5 (API5) [
 <xref rid="B209-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>], or clusterin [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. PB1-F2 also induced apoptosis and promoted viral replication through dysregulating mitochondrial potential [
 <xref rid="B206-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Furthermore, M1 promoted apoptosis by binding to heat shock protein 70, thus activating caspase and the subsequent apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B210-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. In addition, NS1 expression was reported to induce apoptosis in MDCK and HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B211-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. However, mutant IAV lacking the NS1 gene could induce apoptosis in cultured cells [
 <xref rid="B212-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. The function of NS1 in inhibiting apoptosis may be explained by its ability to inhibit type I IFN [

 <xref rid="B214-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. These data demonstrate sophisticated mechanisms of IAV in regulating host apoptosis. Furthermore, the role of these viral proteins in apoptosis suggests that these proteins may present suitable targets for anti-IAV therapies. A comprehensive review on influenza A virus-induced apoptosis discussed by Ampomah and Lim is recommended here [
 <xref rid="B181-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. In addition, recent in vitro research found that apoptosis was induced at early IAV infection stage, while later the cell death pathway was shifted to pyroptosis. The switch process was promoted by the type I IFN-mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway through expression of the Bcl-xL gene [
