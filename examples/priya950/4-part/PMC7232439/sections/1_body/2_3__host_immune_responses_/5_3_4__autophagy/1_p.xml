<p>Though autophagy is essential for cellular metabolism and homeostasis, it also plays important roles in innate immune responses against pathogen infection. For cellular homeostasis, the mTOR pathway is one of the most conserved autophagic pathways. The mTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) negatively regulates the ULK1 kinase activity, thus affecting the autophagy induction [
