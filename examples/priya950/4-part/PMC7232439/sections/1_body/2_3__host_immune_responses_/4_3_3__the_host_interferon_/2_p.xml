<p>The expressed IFNs consequentially bind to different receptors. Type I IFNs interact with IFN-α/β receptors (IFNAR), whereas type III IFNs interact with IFN-λ receptors (IFNLR). Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway is then activated, resulting in transcription of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [
