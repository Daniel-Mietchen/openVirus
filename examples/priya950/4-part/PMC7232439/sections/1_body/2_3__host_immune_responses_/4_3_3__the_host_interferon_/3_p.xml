<p>ISGs encode various antiviral proteins functioning in different ways to defend IAV infection. For instance, MxA GTPase from the Mx family could retain viral genome from entry to the cytoplasm via blocking the function of IAV NP. In addition, in vitro research found that avian IAVs were more sensitive to MxA than human IAVs [

 <xref rid="B152-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) were identified to block IAV entry via altering the cellular membrane properties to interfere with viral fusion, and amplified the activation of immune cells [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Guanylate-binding protein 3 (GBP3) of IFN-inducible GTPases inhibited IAV replication via binding to the viral polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="B154-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Members of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family are also involved in cellular anti-IAV processes. For instance, TRIM14 could interact with IAV NP for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus restricting IAV replication in a type I IFN and NF-ÎºB independent manner [

 <xref rid="B156-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. TRIM 25 regulated the re-localization of RIG-I and was responsible for RIG-I ubiquitination as well as RIG-I-mediated IFN production [

 <xref rid="B158-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. TRIM41 targeted NP for ubiquitination and degradation in vitro [
