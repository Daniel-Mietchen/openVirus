<p>Host immune system functions immediately after detection of the virus. Host mucosal immune system (MIS), induced after virus invasion, serves as the first line to prevent IAV from adhering to the susceptible cells. In the URT, mucosal response is induced in the naso-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), while in the LRT, it occurs in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT). Host innate immunity, including phagocytic cells, interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines, etc., applies multiple mechanisms in defending IAV infection [

Host adaptive immunity, mediated by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, together with other immune mechanisms, reacts specifically to neutralize and eliminate the virus. On the other hand, to establish a successful infection, IAVs also employ a plethora of strategies to avoid being detected or being cleared by the host immunity. Notable strategies include regulation of IFN signaling [
