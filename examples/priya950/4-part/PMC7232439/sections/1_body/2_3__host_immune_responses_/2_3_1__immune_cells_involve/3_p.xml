<p>The function of dendritic cells (DCs) is to monitor invading pathogens. After IAV infection, the conventional DCs migrate from lung to lymph nodes through interaction between CCR7 and its ligand, and present antigens to T cells [

One study based on a mouse model showed that, during IAV infection, immature and mature DCs were specialized in IAV HA processing, since both types of DCs could present one epitope of H1N1 HA (HA amino acids 107–119), whereas another epitope (HA amino acids 302–313) could only be processed by mature DCs [
