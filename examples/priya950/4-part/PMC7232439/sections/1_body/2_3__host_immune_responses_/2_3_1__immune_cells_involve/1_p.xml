<p>Upon detection of infection, innate effector cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs), etc., are recruited to the infected sites. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes, making up 10% of the resident lymphocytes in the lung. After recruitment from the blood, NK cells interact with DCs and macrophages to secret various cytokines and restrict infection via lysis of the IAV-infected cells. The lysis process is mediated by interaction between NK receptors p46 (most NKp46) and IAV HA protein expressed by the infected cell [
