<p>Mature viral mRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm by a “daisy-chain” complex and translated subsequently [

 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. New synthesis of HA occurs on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glycosylation and palmitoylation of the protein are completed later in the Golgi [

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. After synthesis and maturation of NA and M2 proteins, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), together with coat protein I (COPI) complex and GTPase Rab proteins, transport the newly synthesized HA, NA, and M2 proteins to the apical plasma membrane (PM). These proteins then assemble with viral genomic segments. The virions are finally closed and M1 and M2 proteins mediate virion budding from the apical side of the cells [
