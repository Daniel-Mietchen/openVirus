<p>Since IAV has a relatively small genome, host machinery is required in order to accomplish the viral life cycle. To uncover host dependency factors that are necessary for IAV replication, numerous large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screens and genome-wide CRISPR/Cas 9 screen were performed [

 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. For instance, SON DNA binding protein was important for IAV virion trafficking in an early infection stage and CDC-like kinase 1 facilitated AIV replication [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and WDR7, CCDC115, and TMEM199 were essential for viral entry and regulation of V-type ATPase assembly [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was applied to explore hostâ€“virus interactions, revealing a correlation between defective viral genomes and virus-induced host transcriptional programs [
