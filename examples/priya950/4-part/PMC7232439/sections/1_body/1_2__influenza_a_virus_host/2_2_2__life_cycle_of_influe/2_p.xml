<p>IAV infection starts from recognition of SA by HA protein, though in vitro research claimed that these N-linked glycans were not essential for virus entry [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The cleavage of HA precursor protein HA0 into HA1 (containing receptor binding domain) and HA2 (containing fusion peptide) in low pH environment during HA transport is critical for virion internalization [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Some research showed that type II transmembrane serine protease such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4), Homo sapiens serine protease DESC1 and Homo sapiens transmembrane protease, serine 13 (MSPL) can cleave human and avian IAV HA proteins at an arginine residue [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In addition, for avian IAVs, HA0 of HPAIVs can be cleaved by subtilisin-like protease, while that of LPAIVs is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] or thrombin [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Therefore, in avian IAVs, the cleavage sites are considered to be the major determinants for virus virulence [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and RNA folding in the cleavage region could be an important factor for virulence determination [
