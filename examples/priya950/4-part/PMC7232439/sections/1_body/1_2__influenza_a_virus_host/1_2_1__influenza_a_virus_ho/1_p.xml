<p>IAVs can infect a broad spectrum of host species, including both wild and domestic birds, as well as many mammalian species. The virus is capable of interspecies transmission to new species. However, no interspecies transmission of the bat IAVs has been reported so far [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Furthermore, the high frequency of mutations and recombination increases the risk of IAV adaptation in humans. Besides three pandemic subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2), other subtypes, including H5N1, H5N6, H7N7, H7N9, N9N2, and H10N8 could cross the species barrier and cause human infections [
