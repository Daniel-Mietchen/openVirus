<p>Noteworthy is the fact that most phylogenetically diverse IAVs with different origins could successfully replicate in swine [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Since pigs have both SA α-2,6 and SA α-2,3 galactose receptors [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], they can serve as a suitable mixing reservoir for both human and avian IAVs, thus raising global concern on periodic zoonotic infections. Take the emergence of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (pH1N1) and influenza A (H3N2) A/Canada/1158/2006 strains for instance, both strains are swine-origin IAVs and were the consequence of adaption and reassortment of several swine lineages [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, some genes of these strains originated from avian IAVs [
