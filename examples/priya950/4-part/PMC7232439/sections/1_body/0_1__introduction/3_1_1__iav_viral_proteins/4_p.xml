<p>M1 and M2 are encoded by the 
 <italic>M</italic> gene on segment 7 of the viral genome [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The conserved M1 bears a positively charged nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif RKLKR, which is essential for membrane binding, virus replication, nuclear export of the vRNPs, and self-polymerization [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. M2 is a type III integral transmembrane proton channel, structurally containing three domains: an amino-terminal ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is essential for uncoating the vRNP complex within the endosome, the process of which is essential for viral entry [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, in its retrograde migration route from the membrane to the cytoplasm, M2 was shown to prevent endosome fusion with the lysosome, suggesting new roles of the protein in the host cytoplasm after infection [
