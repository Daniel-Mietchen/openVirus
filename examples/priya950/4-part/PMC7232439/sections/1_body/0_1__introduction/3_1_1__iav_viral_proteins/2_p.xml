<p>NA is a type II glycoprotein with neuraminidase (sialidase) enzymatic activity. Each NA tetramer consists of four identical polypeptides, and each polypeptide contains an N-terminal, a hydrophobic membrane domain, a stalk region, and a globular head domain. NA can cleave SA from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins. While HA mediates virion-SA attachment and fusion, NA is responsible for terminal SA residues cleavage [

Furthermore, NA is also the major antigenic target of the host humoral immunity, and NA-specific antibodies function in limiting virus egress via interfering with the sialidase activity have drawn wide attention for development of antiviral therapies [
