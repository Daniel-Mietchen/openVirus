<p>The viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) is a rod-shaped structure composed of multiple copies of NP and a single trimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA) associated with viral genomic RNA [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NP mediates nuclear import of the vRNP complex, the PB1 subunit has the catalytic polymerase activity, the PB2 subunit contributes to cap binding, and the PA subunit is required for cleavage of the capped oligonucleotides. The complex is required for the transcription and replication of the viral genome [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the mechanism of vRNP assembly remains largely unknown and several host proteins were reported to be involved during IAV infection [
