<p>The virus is an enveloped, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus, belonging to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviriae</italic> family. The eight viral gene segments encode as many as 18 proteins. Besides polymerase basic 1 (PB1), PB1-N40, PB1-F2, PB2, polymerase acid (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix 1 (M1), matrix 2 (M2), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and NS2 (also known as nuclear export protein, NEP), new viral proteins were recently uncovered, such as PB2-S1 [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HA, NA, and M2 proteins constitute surface of the IAV virion, where HA is the most abundant surface protein. According to the genetic and antigenic diversity of the HA and NA proteins, IAVs were divided into 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes. H17N10 and H18N11 subtypes were recently identified in bats [
