<p>Since the “Spanish influenza” pandemic in 1918–1919, despite application of updating licensed vaccines and drugs, seasonal and pandemic influenza still cause millions of infection cases each year and remains a worldwide public-health concern. Most seasonal IAV infections are minimally symptomatic, while severe infection causes damage to host immune responses, thus resulting in lung inflammation and injury [

The virus itself, IAV–host interaction, as well as a need for next-generation IAV prevention and control strategies attract extensive attention worldwide. Understanding the virus–host interaction can facilitate investigation of antiviral measures. Therefore, in the current review, we summarized and discussed recent development in our understanding of IAV–host immune interaction and how IAV antagonizes different immune responses to achieve a successful infection.
