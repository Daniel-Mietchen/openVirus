<p>One of the main plant virus research objectives aims to control virus spread on crop plant communities in order to reduce yield or quality losses. In the specific case of solanaceous crops, great economic losses caused by virus infection have been documented [
 <xref rid="B95-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Because viral infections in plants cannot be cured, it is important to identify the presence of virus (es) in infected plants by timely and effective diagnostic methods, and to prevent further virus spread by eradicating infected plants or, in the best case, by interrupting the contamination pathway. Indeed, due to a lack of curative treatment measures, prophylactic control measures, consisting of a combination of vector management, biosecurity measures and cultural practices, constitute a major pillar of plant virus disease control strategies [

Techniques such as meristem cultures, chemo-, thermo-, electro- and cryotherapy are widely used, individually or in combination, for the production of virus-free plants, such as for potato, which is almost exclusively propagated vegetatively through tubers [
 <xref rid="B96-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Even such virus-free plants can later be infected by viruses under field conditions, as described throughout this review. Some plants of agricultural importance were bred to have resistance against selected virus pathogens. However, as in many other examples, the study of García-Andrés et al. [

 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>, the possible contribution of the deployment of the resistance gene Ty-1 in tomato in the emergence of resistance breaking TYLCV variants. Other resistance genes in tomato have also been reported to be broken when plants were infected by new viral strains. Such cases include, for example, Tm-22 resistance breaking by the emerging ToBRFV [
