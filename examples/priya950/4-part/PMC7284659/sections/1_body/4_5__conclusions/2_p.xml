<p>In conclusion, solanaceous plants continue to be a very interesting model for virology research because of their versatility, ubiquity and of the large amount of information available for virology studies. Moreover, due to their high susceptibility to a wide variety of plant-pathogenic viruses, several well-known model hosts in plant virology belongs to the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, e.g., 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> or 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. We are aware of the fact that research focused on 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants only will surely exclude some information on viruses from the available pool in the environment. Specialist viruses, which are not capable of infecting plants from this family, would not be detected at all, and generalist viruses could be underrepresented in number of hosts and infection pathways. Still, the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family includes cultivated, wild, annual and perennial plants growing in various environments with different levels of intraspecific genetic variation and a variety of biological connections among individual species (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00667-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, their study throughout the agro-ecological interface should be able to cover a majority of plant virus life strategies. We believe that focusing on this plant family would mean a possible simplification of sampling and data management associated with environmental effects. Because of the signs of co-evolution, the small phylogenetic distance between plants, processes happening during virus transmission and spillback could be, thus, characterized more closely, providing information necessary for the adjustment of plant protection practices in a continuously changing environment.
