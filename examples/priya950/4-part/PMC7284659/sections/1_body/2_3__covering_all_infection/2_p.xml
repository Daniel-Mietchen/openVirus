<p>Most studies of plant viruses are focused on crop species and on crop-virus interactions. There are much fewer studies addressing the effects of viruses on wild plants. When it comes to wild species, most studies are concerned with the directional spread of viruses from wild to crop species. Fewer address the transmission of viral infection from cultivated to wild plants. Overall, we are also lacking much knowledge about the natural virus/plant interactions within the wild compartment [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As agro-industrial practices have been very widely used in recent history, the natural plant-virus interactions within crop fields can be expected to have been substantially modified due to human induced global changes and the confounding factors associated with them [

In this respect, it is remarkable that datation efforts have suggested that the explosive radiation that has made the potyviruses the largest genus of plant-infecting RNA viruses might be associated with the development of early agriculture 6600 years ago [
