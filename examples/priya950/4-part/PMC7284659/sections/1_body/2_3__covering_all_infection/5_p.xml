<p>The previous limited interest given to wild plant virus research can be exemplified by the studies of henbane mosaic virus (HMV, Potyvirus, family Potyviridae). HMV was first described from black henbane plants [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Later on, HMV was found to be infecting deadly nightshade, 
 <italic>Physalis alkekengi</italic> and jimson weed [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Even though all the main hosts of HMV are members of the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, research on this virus has been scarce, and it was only recently that HMV was found naturally infecting field-grown tomato plants in Slovenia [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In this case, HMV was a part of mixed infection with PVM (carlavirus) and southern tomato virus (STV). The Slovenian HMV isolate (termed HMV-SI/L) was further found in the same study to be able to infect a range of tomato cultivars, a wild tobacco species (
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) and wild 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> species (black henbane, jimson weed).
