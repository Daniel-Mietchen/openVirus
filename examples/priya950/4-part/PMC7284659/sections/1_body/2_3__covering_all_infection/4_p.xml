<p>The information about natural plant-virus interactions is crucial for the future of agricultural production and of food safety, by informing the prediction of future emergence events or of future epidemies and by supporting the deployment of appropriate control measures. One recently highlighted facet of these interactions is the realization that there might exist, in some cases, a positive effect of mixed virus infection in wild plants [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and possibly also in cultivated ones [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Mild viruses are currently being used to control virus-induced diseases, by pre-inoculating plants with an attenuated or a symptomless variant, and by applying the knowledge of natural virus competition during super-infection for plant protection purposes [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Examples on 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants are numerous [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], including the use of a mild isolate of ToMV Fukushima strain (L11A) to protect tomatoes against highly virulent ToMV isolates [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], a mutant PepMV KD [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] or a mild isolate of the CH2 strain [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] to protect them from secondary infection by wild-type PepMV. The term “antagonism” is used to describe a type of virus-virus interaction in mixed infection, where infection by one virus prevents infection, or suppress symptoms, accumulation or transmission rates of another one. As indicated above, this type of interaction is widely used for protecting plants by the means of cross-protection [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The importance of virus infection timescale can be crucial for plants. Regarding wild solanaceous plants, Grupa &amp; Syller [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] presented the first example of potato virus M (PVM) cross protection with jimsonweed as a host plant. Cross protection was aimed against the PVM Uran strain by pre-inoculation with the PVM I-38 mild strain. Other means of plant protection are being used as well. Solanaceous crops are being bred for resistance against viral pathogens, as can be observed on tomatoes carrying the Tm-22 gene of resistance against ToMV [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The down-coming of genetic resistance is in the ability of viruses to adopt in the form of resistance-breaking isolates, as reported for Tm-22 breaking isolates of ToMV [

 <xref rid="B73-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. New methods for solanaceous plant protection are still being developed, such as dsRNA external treatment of plants triggering RNA interference, inhibiting TMV virus propagation [
