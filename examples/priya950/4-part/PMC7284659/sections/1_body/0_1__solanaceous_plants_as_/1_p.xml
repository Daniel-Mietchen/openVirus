<p>The 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family is a monophyletic dicot group, which contains widely cultivated crops with individual species serving as a food source, as a source of bioactive molecules or as ornamentals [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Species belonging to this family, such as the potato (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>), tomato (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>), pepper (
 <italic>Caspicum annuum</italic>) or tobacco (
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>), are grown on all continents with temperate or tropical climates and are commonly found in many households worldwide [

 <italic>Atropa belladonna</italic>), black henbane (
 <italic>Hyoscyamus niger</italic>) and jimson weed (
 <italic>Datura stramonium</italic>). Plants from the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family have also played an important part in genetic research over the last hundred years [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cultivated 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> species often grow side by side within the same ecosystem with wild species of the family, some of which are frequent weeds [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under all complex cultivation contexts, 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants are exposed to infectious pathogens, including viruses.
