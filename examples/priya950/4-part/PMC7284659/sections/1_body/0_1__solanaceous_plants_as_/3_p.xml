<p>Means of transmission from one host to another vary among viral species. The transmission can be vertical or horizontal, the latter being frequently mediated by vectors or by contact. Viruses infecting solanaceous species are mostly transmitted by insect vectors, in particular aphids [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other vectors are also capable of transmitting some viruses, as thrips mediating the transmission of tospoviruses [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whiteflies (e.g., 
 <italic>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. abutilonea</italic>, 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>) of torradoviruses [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or nematodes as seen with tobacco rattle virus (TRV) [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Transmission by soil Chytridiomycetes or Plasmodiophorids [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] is known for tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) as zoospores of 
 <italic>Olpidium brassicae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or for potato mot top virus (PMTV) as those of 
 <italic>Spongospora subterranea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A similar transmission route has also been hypothesized (but so far not confirmed) for pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and 
 <italic>Olpidium virulentus</italic> in tomato plants [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the existence of an additional transmission pathway for potato virus Y (PVY) involving mycorrhizal networks created by hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has been hypothesized [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], again without confirmation so far. On the other hand, vertical transmissions through seeds or pollen are also documented, e.g., tobamoviruses [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], PepMV [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or tomato torrado virus (ToTV) [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] infecting various 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> species.
