<p>There are indications suggesting that closely related species are more likely to exchange viruses with the wild landscape setting of a reservoir, or by being back infected from crops. The host diversity of 480 plant viruses was previously evaluated [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Significantly stronger barriers to infection were documented for viruses as the host diversity range crossed the taxonomic family border, with a continuous decrease in host diversity observed in higher taxonomy ranks. By further analysis of the plant-virus infectivity matrix of 37 plant viruses and 28 plant species, significant modularity was detected by these authors, where each module was associated with a plant family. In other words, this analysis implies that phylogenetic distance between prevalent and susceptible host plants can be linked to the likelihood of viral emergence. One module identified in this study was associated with the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, suggesting that studies limited to 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants can be relevant and informative, while being convenient for study design and sampling [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This notion is supported by a study of ToCV, where four wild plants from different families were evaluated as virus sources in transmission experiments. Black nightshade was proven to be the most efficient source for virus transmission of a ToCV isolate from tomato. Thus, both the source plant of the ToCV isolate used, and the most efficient transmission source species, belong to the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family [
