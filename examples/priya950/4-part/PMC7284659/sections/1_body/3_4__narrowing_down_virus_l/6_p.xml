<p>In a study addressing virus flow from wild plant to crops within the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, yellow tailflower mild mottle virus (YTMMV, Tobamovirus) was isolated from an indigenous wild host plant, and serially passaged through three exotic host species. Within the YTMMV genome, six polymorphic sites were detected during the experiment. One of these mutations was a non-synonymous one, observed only when YTMMV was passaged through tomato. The mutant increased in titer during tomato passages, and after passaging, it had higher reproductive fitness in tomato compared to the original isolate [

 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>. Adaptations improving virus fitness in different hosts are indeed known to be key in the emergence of viruses by host change [

 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] tested 26 different weed species for PLRV presence by ELISA, using RT-PCR for confirmation. Six of these species were found naturally infected by PLRV, of which four were from the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family (
 <italic>D. stramonium, Physalis minima, S. nigrum, Withania somnifera</italic>). The role of wild Solanaceous plants as a potential source of virus infection was addressed and confirmed for various virus/plant combinations in a number of other studies [

 <xref rid="B94-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. However, caution should also be exercised, in particular when virus presence is only ascertained by serology and not backed up by molecular data, demonstrating that the same viral isolates are indeed shared between the wild and cultivated hosts. Such data are indeed absolutely needed in order to exclude the hypothesis of different viral strains or ecotypes independently circulating in the wild and cultivated host plant populations.
