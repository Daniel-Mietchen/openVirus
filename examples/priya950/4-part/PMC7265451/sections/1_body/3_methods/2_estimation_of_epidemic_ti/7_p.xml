<p id="Par55">We tested a variety of 
 <italic>n-</italic> and 
 <italic>α</italic>-parameter values, and chose 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 and 
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.12 for the analyses presented in the text as a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity in the identification of all of the epidemics within the time series and their individual onset and end timings, which were confirmed by visual inspection. The results of these analyses are also robust to alternative parameter values and corresponding changes to the sensitivity and specificity of the Poisson count detection algorithm (see Supplementary Discussion for sensitivity analyses).
