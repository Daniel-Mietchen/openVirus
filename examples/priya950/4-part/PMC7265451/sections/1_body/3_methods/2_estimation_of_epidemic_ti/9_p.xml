<p id="Par57">We deemed an antigenic variant to have failed to cause an epidemic if, within a season, the algorithm was unable to define an epidemic period; we confirmed all putative failures by inspection of the raw time series. Once the epidemic period was defined, the size of an epidemic per antigenic variant was calculated using the estimated resident population for that particular year and city.</p>
