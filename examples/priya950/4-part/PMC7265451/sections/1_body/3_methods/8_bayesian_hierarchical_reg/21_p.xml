<p id="Par87">We ran four MCMC chains, each with a 1000-step sample warmup period followed by 1000 saved posterior samples, for a total of 4000 posterior draws. We verified convergence by inspecting trace plots, and confirming that all parameters had sufficiently low Rhat values (all Rhat &lt; 1.005) and sufficiently large effective sample sizes (all neff &gt;16% of total sample size). We visualised posteriors as quantile dotplots
