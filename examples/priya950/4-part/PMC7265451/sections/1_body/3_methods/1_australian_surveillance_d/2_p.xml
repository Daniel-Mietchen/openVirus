<p id="Par47">The data set consists of 18,250 influenza-positive cases, collected between 2000 and 2015 in the city of Brisbane, the city of Perth, the state of South Australia, the city of Sydney and the state of Victoria. The breakdown at the subtype/lineage level is as follows: A/H3 (7661), A/H1sea (1410), A/H1pdm09 (3987), B/Vic (3021) and B/Yam (2171). All of these correspond specifically to individual cities, except for the data from Victoria and South Australia. As of June 2015, 75 and 78% of the inhabitants of the states of Victoria and South Australia resided in the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide, respectively. We therefore treated the Victoria and South Australia data as representative of city-level patterns in those two major cities.</p>
