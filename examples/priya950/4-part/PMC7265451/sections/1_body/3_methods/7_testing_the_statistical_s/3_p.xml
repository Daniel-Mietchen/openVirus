<p id="Par66">We also evaluated whether or not epidemic onset is associated with climatic fluctuations that are anomalous for that particular time of the year. By definition, for any given 2-week period of the year, the 31-year mean for 
 <italic>T</italic>′ and 
 <italic>AH</italic>′ is 0. We used a Wilcoxon one-sample test to assess whether there were reductions in climatic values in the observed set of 
 <italic>T</italic>′ and 
 <italic>AH</italic>′ values in each of the 2-week blocks preceding the onset of the earliest epidemic of the season.
