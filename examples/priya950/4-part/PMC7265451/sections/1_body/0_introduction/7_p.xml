 </sup>, and limited laboratory characterisation obscures influenza virus type/subtype- and antigenic variant-specific patterns. These patterns become superimposed upon each other due to aggregation of ILI or virologically confirmed data to ecological scales (state/province/country) that sum over multiple local epidemics (county/city/town), which can individually vary substantially in timing, magnitude and influenza virus composition. Altogether, these sources of obfuscation make it difficult to disentangle local-level, antigenic variant-specific patterns, and critically investigate the impact of virus antigenic change.
