<p id="Par41">Another important caveat is that while we were able to include antigenic data in this study, these data were all derived from haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. HI assays do not measure virus antigenic changes that occur away from the receptor-binding site, and thus likely represent an incomplete picture of antigenic change. Reference viruses and sera used in the haemagglutination inhibition assays can also impact the interpretation of the assay readout, and the HI data used in this study were therefore treated with caution (see â€˜Methods').</p>
