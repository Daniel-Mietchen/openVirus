 </sup> showed that there was substantial heterogeneity among Australian cities in the activity of influenza A and B viruses. Our subtyped and antigenically characterised data set allowed us to confirm that further heterogeneity exists at the level of antigenic variants. In particular, specific antigenic variants often cause large epidemics in some cities while not causing detectable activity in others.
