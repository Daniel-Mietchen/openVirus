<p id="Par42">In this study, we attempted to identify associations between population susceptibility and epidemic incidence. Accurately quantifying the former is a complex challenge, so cumulative antigenic variant-specific epidemic incidence was used as a proxy, but that itself is subject to the limitations listed above. Besides natural infection, immunity can also be derived from vaccination, the contribution and effectiveness of which could not be determined due to a lack of temporally and geographically complete vaccination records over the study period. Regardless, we hypothesise that the impact of seasonal vaccination would be limited, particularly in the context of Australia, given the low uptake of vaccination
