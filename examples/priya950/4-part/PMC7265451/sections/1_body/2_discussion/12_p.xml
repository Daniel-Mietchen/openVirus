<p id="Par38">There are multiple caveats to our study that merit explicit consideration. The most important ones derive from our use of passive surveillance data that might not accurately reflect true underlying influenza virus activity. For example, surveillance intensity could plausibly vary between cities and years. While variation in surveillance efforts is evident among cities, there was no evidence of systematic increases or decreases in the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, or changes to surveillance practices within each city during the study period. Despite this, the longer duration of epidemics recorded after 2009 could be indicative of enhanced surveillance in the post-pandemic era: to mitigate this possibility, we repeated our analyses on the effect of antigenic change on epidemic size, splitting between pre- and post-pandemic eras and epidemic sizes normalising by their respective era-specific means. In either era, there was no consistent effect of antigenic change on epidemic size, with the caveat that splitting across eras reduced the number of observations in each era and thus our statistical power (Supplementary Fig.Â
