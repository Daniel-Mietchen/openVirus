 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. The sequential replacement of old antigenic variants by new ones is indicative that antigenicity and population immunity are important for the global-level phylodynamics of influenza viruses. In contrast, at the local level, we find for A/H3 and B/Vic viruses that neither antigenic change nor the accumulation of antigenic variant-specific immunity are strong drivers of epidemic size, though accumulating variant-specific immunity may moderately reduce the probability of successful epidemic initiation.
