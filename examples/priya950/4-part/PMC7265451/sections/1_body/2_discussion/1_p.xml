<p id="Par27">Based on city-level analyses of a subtyped and antigenically characterised influenza virus data set covering the five largest cities in Australia, we find that climate and antigenic novelty have limited effects on epidemic sizes. The results presented here suggest that, at least in temperate areas, epidemics are governed by factors other than host immunity at local scales, where global fitness advantages for new antigenic variants may not be realised. Conversely, competition for hosts among influenza virus types and subtypes has strong effects on local dynamics. The first virus subtype to establish above-baseline epidemic activity in a city and season typically dominates.</p>
