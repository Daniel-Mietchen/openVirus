<p id="Par45">Climatic drivers of seasonality and homosubtypic competition between virus antigenic variants are thought to be strong drivers of seasonal influenza epidemiology, but seasonal influenza virus epidemiological dynamics in major Australian cities appear to be more substantially shaped by other factors, particularly the establishment of sustained virus-transmission activity, and subsequent competition among virus types and subtypes. This implies that the time horizon for meaningful forecasting of epidemic subtype composition is very short (days to weeks), and forecasting efforts aimed at longer-term predictions will require further insights into the dynamics of virus introduction and epidemic establishment, and into the accumulation of population immunity to seasonal influenza viruses.</p>
