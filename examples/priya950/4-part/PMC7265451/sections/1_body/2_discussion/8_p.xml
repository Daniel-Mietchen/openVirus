<p id="Par34">There may also be substantial and previously unaccounted heterogeneity in individual susceptibility towards the same virus strain. The notion that population-level strain-specific immunity to influenza viruses is monolithic may be an artefact of the single-infection ferret models typically used to estimate antibody-mediated protection. In humans, there is substantial individual-to-individual variation in the antigenicity of amino acid escape mutations for influenza haemagglutinin

 </sup>. Such heterogeneity between individuals stems from their varied exposure histories to different influenza viruses. Unfortunately, age records for our data set were too incomplete to allow us to study age-specific heterogeneities in demographics, and attack rates between cities, and whether such patterns change over seasons.
