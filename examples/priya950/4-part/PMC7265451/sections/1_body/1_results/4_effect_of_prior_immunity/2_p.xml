<p id="Par22">The accumulation of population immunity should also reduce the probability of successful epidemic initiation, making epidemics, regardless of size, less likely to start after an antigenic variant has already caused an epidemic in that city. For B/Vic and A/H1sea viruses, binary logistic regression showed non-significant associations between the cumulative incidence over prior seasons and the probability of successful epidemic initiation (all OR &lt; 1; all

This partially resulted from the small number of A/H1sea epidemics during the study period, most of which were caused by newly emerged antigenic variants. However, B/Yam and H3 viruses showed significant negative relationships between cumulative prior incidence and epidemic probability, suggesting that prior incidence may have a substantial impact on the probability of successful epidemic initiation.
