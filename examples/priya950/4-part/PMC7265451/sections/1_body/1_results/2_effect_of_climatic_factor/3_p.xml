 </sup> estimated epidemic onset timings for influenza A virus epidemics in Australian postcodes for the seasons from 2007 to 2016. Despite the lack of subtype-level resolution, their data set is substantially larger (450,000 entries) than the one used here, and offers an opportunity to compare findings. We repeated our anomalous temperature and absolute humidity analyses on the Geoghegan et al.
