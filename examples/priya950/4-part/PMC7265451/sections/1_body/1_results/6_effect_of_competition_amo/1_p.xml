<p id="Par24">Competition among virus subtypes for hosts should create a first-mover advantage for the first subtype to sustain above-baseline epidemic activity in a city in a given season. Subsequent epidemics of other subtypes within that same season should therefore be reduced in size. We considered two proxies for this kind of intersubtypic interference: the cumulative amount of epidemic activity prior to the onset of a subtype’s epidemic and the lag between the focal epidemic and the season’s earliest epidemic. To allow for comparisons across cities and subtypes, we normalised log-epidemic case counts by subtracting off the city- and subtype-specific mean log- epidemic case count. There was a strongly negative and statistically significant correlation between prior epidemic activity and epidemic size (Pearson’s correlation test, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.420; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 8.7e–5, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). An important caveat is that seasonality in the transmission rate could result in epidemics that start later in a season being smaller than those that started earlier, regardless of intersubtypic competition.
