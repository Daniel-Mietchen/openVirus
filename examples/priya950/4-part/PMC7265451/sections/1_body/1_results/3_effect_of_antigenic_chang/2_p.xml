<p id="Par18">We also compared the timing of the first epidemic caused by an antigenic variant against the timings of subsequent epidemics (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) to test the hypothesis that new variants cause earlier epidemics. The range of onset timings was very broad, with epidemics starting from very early to late into the season, and there were no statistically significant differences in epidemic onset timing between new and extant variant epidemics.
