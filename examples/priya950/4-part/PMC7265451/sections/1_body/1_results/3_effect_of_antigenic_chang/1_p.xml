<p id="Par17">We next examined the effect of antigenic evolution on epidemic dynamics. Between 2000 and 2015, 7A/H3, 3A/H1sea, 1A/H1pdm09, 3 B/Vic and 5 B/Yam virus antigenic variants circulated in Australia. All A/H1pdm09 virus epidemics from 2009 to 2015 were excluded for this set of analyses for two reasons. First, we could not accurately estimate the size of the 2009 pandemic. Second, there was no subsequent, detectable antigenic change observed for A/H1pdm09 viruses during the study period. We normalised epidemic sizes (see ‘Methods') to enable comparisons between cities. Stratifying by subtype/lineage, we compared the size of the first epidemic caused by an antigenic variant against the sizes of epidemics of the same antigenic variant in subsequent years (Wilcoxon two-sample test, Fig.

 </sup>, newly emerged antigenic variants caused epidemics, both larger and smaller than city-specific mean epidemic sizes, and there was no evidence of a consistent effect of antigenic change on epidemic size.
