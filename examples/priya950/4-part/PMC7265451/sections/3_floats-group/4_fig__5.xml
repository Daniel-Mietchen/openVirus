  <title>Effect of competition among subtypes on epidemic incidence.</title>
  <p>The relationship between the size of an epidemic and 
   <bold>a</bold> the amount of prior activity of all other antigenic variants and subtypes, and 
   <bold>b</bold> the delay in epidemic onset. The size of each epidemic, relative to the earliest epidemic of that season, was log-transformed: the horizontal line at 0 denotes that the size of an epidemic is equal to that of the earliest epidemic of that season and city. In panel (
   <bold>a</bold>), prior activity by other subtypes within the same season was measured relative to the city-specific mean epidemic size. In panel 
   <bold>b</bold>, delay in epidemic onset was measured relative to the onset timing of the earliest epidemic of that season. 
   <italic>r</italic>- and 
   <italic>P</italic> values are from Pearson’s correlation tests (
   <italic>n</italic> = 82).
