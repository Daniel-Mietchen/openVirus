  <title>Climatic conditions around epidemic onset.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Anomalous temperature T′ and 
   <bold>b</bold> absolute humidity AH′ prior to and after epidemic onset across all five cities. Epidemic onset is marked by the vertical line at 0. For the earliest-onset epidemic in each season and city (15 years × 5 cities = 75 epidemics), T′ and AH′ for each time point are represented by grey points: a point below the horizontal line denotes that the value is lower than the 31-year city-specific mean. Blue points show the mean T′ and AH′ for that 2-week period for all epidemics across all cities within the study period. There were no periods with statistically significant reductions (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Non-parametric bootstrapping) in T′ or AH′ from the 31-year averages.
