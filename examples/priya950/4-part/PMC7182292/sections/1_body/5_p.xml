<p>Viral RNA was extracted from serum samples and pools of homogenized mosquitoes using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. Samples were screened for arthropod-borne viruses of the genera 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> using Multiplex-Nested RT-PCR employing specific primers targeting regions of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) and nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1)

 </xref>. PCR products from serum samples, mosquitoes, or viral isolation were purified using the PCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Purified products were directly sequenced with species-specific primers, using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and an ABI377 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Virus identity was determined using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
