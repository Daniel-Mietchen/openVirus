<p>We detected arthropod-borne viruses in 55 febrile patients. Two serum samples, collected in December 2015, tested positive for DENV-2 through multiplex-nested-PCR and viral isolation. One of the aforementioned samples (BR/Sinop/H361/2015) was isolated from a 13-year-old male patient presenting with headache and normal leukocyte (4,660/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) and platelet (157,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) counts. The other sample (BR/Sinop/H345/2015) was collected from a 47-year-old female patient presenting with headache, arthritis, itchiness, rash, and normal leukocyte (4,040/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) and platelet (332,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) counts. Interestingly, two pools of 
 <italic>Culex,</italic> subgenus 
 <italic>Melanoconion,</italic> collected in September 2014 tested positive for DENV-2 by multiple-nested-PCR, but not by cell culture. The mosquitoes were collected in a trap from a forest park area (11°50’0.0”S and 55°23’58, 3”W) in Sinop. The pools (BR/Sinop/Ar23/2014 and BR/Sinop/Ar6/2014) consisted of eight and five female specimens of 
 <italic>Culex sp</italic>., respectively.
