<p>We obtained one NS5 partial gene sequence of DENV-2 from a serum sample (BR/Sinop/H345/2015; GenBank accession number MH939171), and two sequences from mosquitoes pools (GenBank accession numbers MH939169 and MH939170). Phylogenetic analysis based on the NS5 partial gene sequences of DENV-2 (316 base pairs) indicated that our sequences clustered within the Asian II genotype and were closely related to isolates from Cuba 1981 and China 2015 epidemics, and the New Guinea C (NGC) 1944 prototype strain (
