<p>Dengue fever is endemic in Brazil, and several epidemics have been reported over the years. Although the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) are widespread throughout the country, a particular serotype is generally responsible for the majority of cases during an outbreak. DENV-2 is the most frequent cause of dengue fever epidemics worldwide and is usually associated with severe disease cases. DENV-2 is divided into six genotypes: (i) Asian I, comprising strains from Thailand; (ii) Asian II, consisting of strains from the Philippines; (iii) Cosmopolitan, comprising strains from South and Southeast Asia; (iv) American, comprising strains from Central America; (v) Southeast Asian/American, comprising strains from Southeast Asia and Central and South America; and (vi) Sylvatic, comprising strains from West Africa and Southeast Asia
