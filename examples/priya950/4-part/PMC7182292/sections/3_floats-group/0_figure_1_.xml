  <title>(A) Location of Sinop, in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. (B) The General Time Reversible (GTR) model with four gamma substitution rate categories (+ G, parameter = 0.203) (GTR + G) was used to reconstruct a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree (PhyML) based on nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) partial gene sequences of the six DENV-2 genotypes. The sequences investigated in the present study are indicated in boldface. The SPR technique was used for the tree search operation, and the statistical support for the phylogenetic nodes was assessed using aLRT SH-like, which is indicated for each genotype. The final tree was edited in FigTree.</title>
