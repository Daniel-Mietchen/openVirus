<p>Upon invasion of the CNS, viral pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) bind pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to expression of type I interferons (IFN-I), which includes IFN-α and IFN-β that both bind to IFN-α receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1) [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IFNAR is expressed by all cell types, and activates the JAK–STAT signaling pathway upon binding to ligand. One of the major functions of IFN-I is to induce direct antiviral activities in an autocrine, paracrine, or systemic manner [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Uninfected microglia and astrocytes can therefore be the sources of IFN-I in the context of viral encephalitis, which will increase IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression of themselves and other cells expressing IFNAR1 [

Although antiviral T-cell recruitment is a critical step in virologic control, recruited and resident myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for local T-cell restimulation [
