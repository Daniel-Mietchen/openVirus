<p>Cell-mediated immunity, especially the infiltration and accumulation of antiviral T cells in the CNS under virological challenge, is critical for virologic control and survival from viral encephalitis. Although both CD8 and CD4 T cells invade the CNS, CD8 T cells constitute the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes [

 <sup>▪▪</sup>]. CD8 T cells that clear virus from infected neurons may do so largely through noncytolytic mechanisms that may be regulated by peripheral expression of IL-7 [

 <sup>▪▪</sup>]. The CNS entry of T cells is tightly regulated through chemokine gradients that include luminal expression of CXCL10 and abluminal expression of CXCL12. CXCL10 expression at the BBB is associated with upregulation of barrier destabilizing cytokines, such as TNF, which increases BBB permeability [
