<p>The inquiry of how bTrms are developed is still an active area of investigation. Local infection and direct antigen encounter (or in the deep cervical lymph nodes) in the CNS have been demonstrated to be crucial for formation, but not maintenance of CD8 bTrms since neuroinflammation in the absence of cognate antigen for T cells only induced transient CD8 T-cell infiltration [
