<p>A subset of CD8 T cells, brain-resident memory T cells (bTrm), can still persist at the sites of original infection even after viral clearance and remain within the parenchyma unlike other circulating lymphocytes, which is observed in both murine and human [
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. bTrm have been often reported to express CD103 and CD69, which is usually involved in the downregulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1) to prevent tissue egress and to promote retention in lymphoid organs [

More IFN-γ production was also detected in CD103 + T cells compared to CD103− T cells in Murine polymavirus (MuPyV)-induced encephalitis, a model for the DNA virus JC virus, which causes multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with severe T cell deficiencies [
