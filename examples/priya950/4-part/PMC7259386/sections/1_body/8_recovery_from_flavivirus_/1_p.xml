<p>In addition to the acute neuroinvasive syndromes and persistent motor deficits, patients that recover from WN neuroinvasive disease (WNND) experience significant long-term cognitive sequelae, including high rates of memory impairment and abnormalities in executive function [

 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, although approximately 90% of patients survive WNND, 50–70% of survivors develop memory disorders that worsen over time [
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. New memory disorders have also been reported in adolescents and adults that recovered from ZIKV meningoencephalitils [

 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and animal models also demonstrate synapse loss and cognitive dysfunction [
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Few studies have examined mechanisms of postinfectious cognitive dysfunction after viral encephalitis, which might be generalizable to other neuroinflammatory diseases of cognition.
