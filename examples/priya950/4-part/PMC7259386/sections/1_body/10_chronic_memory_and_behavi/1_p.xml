<p>Recent studies using attenuated strains of flaviviruses in mice indicate that antiviral T cells that promote virologic clearance during CNS infection may underlie neurocognitive sequelae in survivors. IFN-γ released by CNS-infiltrating, virus-specific CD8 T cells induces microglial activation, as evidenced by upregulation of MHC class II expression on these cells, which is normally expressed at lower levels [

 <sup>▪▪</sup>]. Microglial activation has been shown to be associated with a variety of neurotoxic effects including synapse elimination, neurodegeneration, and decreased adult neurogenesis [
