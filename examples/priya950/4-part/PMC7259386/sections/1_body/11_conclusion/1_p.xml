<p>Mosquito-borne and tick-borne neurotropic arboviruses cause annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis throughout the world and are considered some of the most rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases. Emerging Flaviviruses, New World Alphaviruses, and Bunyaviruses, cause neurologic illness at a rate of 50–100 000 cases/year with lasting neurocognitive sequelae in up to 70% of survivors [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Viral infections within the brain pose a unique challenge for the immune system: the host must trigger an effective immune response to control and clear the infection while minimizing neuronal damage. The studies reviewed here illustrate the complex interactions between antiviral T cells and infected and/or inflamed neural cells that orchestrate their effector functions and ultimate fate within the CNS. These effects, which depend on age and immune status of affected individuals, not only determine survival but whether recovery is associated with progressive memory disorders. They also identify potential therapeutic targets with
