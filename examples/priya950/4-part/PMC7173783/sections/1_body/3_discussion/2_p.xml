<p>We examined the stochastic nature of recurrence peaks in detail: rare events, arising from weak transmissibilty between cohorts of populations, leading to opportunistic spread of infection from one cohort to another give rise to recurrences that can occur randomly. Within a cohort whose members are well-immunized, although the infectious number is limited, the times at which the peak occurs can be broadly distributed. The study of a two-strain model revealed that immunity induced by inoculation against one strain of infection can lead to increased occurrence of a second later infection. The simplicity of the model allowed us to conduct a detailed study of its behavior, leaving open for future work the consequences of including specific effects such as time-varying environmental influences.</p>
