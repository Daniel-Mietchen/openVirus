<p>This model was simulated with the following parameters. The virulence of the two strains in the model, i.e. the distributions of

 <sub>

 </sub> was uniformed randomly distributed between values 2 and 8 in contrast to [0, 6] for Individuals that are not inoculated. This implies an enhancement of the fundamental timescale of infection of inoculated individuals by at least a factor of 8.
