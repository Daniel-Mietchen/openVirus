<p>The key model assumption is based on the following experimental result. We note that in a recent experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], ex-vivo NHBE (normal human bronchial epithelial) cells were infected first with H1N1 virus, and then the H3N2 virus 509 A/Wyoming/03/2003. It was found that in bystander cells (cells that were not infected by H1N1), paracrine loops induced a strong anti-viral response (as measured by interferon-stimulated genes). Indeed, the replication of the H3N2 was decreased in comparison with single infection by H3N2. Thus, there is microscopic evidence for the influence of the immune response to the first strain on the infection by the second strain: it provides protection against it. While it is difficult to directly incorporate the results of such a microscopic model into the parameters of the macroscopic model, we assume that infection with the first virus (pandemic) provides increased immunity to the second virus (seasonal) in susceptible individuals, none of whom had received vaccinations against the seasonal flu.
