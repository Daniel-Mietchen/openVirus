<p>In the 2010-2011 flu season and particularly in the 2018-2019 flu season, according to the CDC [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], two flu strains circulated in the United States. The pandemic (swine flu) H1N1 peaked early in the season, while the seasonal H3N2 surged and peaked later in the season. Motivated by these observations, we investigate a scenario within our model in which the influenza vaccine is effective against the pandemic virus that spreads first, but ineffective against the specific seasonal virus that appears later. The issue we address is the extent to which the strain that appears later, against which the population is assumed to have no induced immunity, spreads and how that depends on the fraction of the population that receives inoculation against the earlier pandemic virus.
