<p>We have discussed the behavior of the model when the out-degree inside the cohort is taken to be 16. When the number of intra-cohort connections is decreased substantially, the spread is slow and stochastic with the possibility of extinction. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g010">Fig 10</xref>, we display sample runs as the number of intra-cohort connections are increased keeping the contact matrix element and other parameters unchanged. We see that at lower values of the connectivity, the peaks are separated on longer time scales and as the connectivity (the out-degree of agents within cohorts) is increased, the peaks occur closer together. The separation of the recurrences in time depends on the rate at which inter-cohort transmission occurs. This depends both on the strength of the inter-cohort connections that we have not changed, but also the speed with which the few (25) agents in one cohort who are directly connected to the next cohort become infectious. This rate depends on the speed with which the infection spreads within an individual cohort, and this time decreases as we increase the intra- (or inner) cohort connectivity. This is seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g010">Fig 10</xref>.
