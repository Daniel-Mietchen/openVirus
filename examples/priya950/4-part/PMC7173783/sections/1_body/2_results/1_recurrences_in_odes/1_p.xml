<p>We begin by presenting the results from the numerical solution of the ordinary differential equations describing a two-cohort SEIR model discussed in the Model and Methods section. The results capture the behavior of the mean value of the dynamical variables such as the infected fraction obtained from the stochastic simulation of the agent-based model discussed subsequently. The ODE solution also provides a computationally efficient way of finding parameter values that lead to different behaviors. Our agent-based model with weakly connected cohorts and probabilistic transition rates between different classes, in contrast, displays substantial sample-to-sample variability as discussed later.</p>
