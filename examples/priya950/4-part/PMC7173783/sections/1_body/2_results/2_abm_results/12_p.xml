<p>We explore another effect of events with low probability: we focus on the spread of the infection across cohorts; in particular, the time at which the first agent in the second cohort becomes exposed. This is a low-probability event because the number of agents in the second cohort who are connected to agents in the first cohort is small. We calculate the statistics for a situation in which we increase the number of inter-cohort connections for the weak immune case, and examine the first incidence of infection in the second cohort.</p>
