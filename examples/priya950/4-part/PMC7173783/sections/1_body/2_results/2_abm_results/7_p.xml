<p>The immune strength

 </sub> of the agents is uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 4] in the weak immune case and [2, 6] in the strong immune case. One consequence of the uniform increase of the immune strength by 2 units in the strong immune profile case is the reduced pool of susceptible agents that can be exposed in the course of the simulation that lasts a season of 200 days. In fact,

 <sup>2</sup>). The combination of fewer susceptible agents and lower probability for transitions means that new infections are relatively rare events. Since only a small number of new infectious occurs across the cohort in a short time interval, the fluctuations are large and this makes the peaks poorly defined in individual runs and smooths out the peaks on the average.
