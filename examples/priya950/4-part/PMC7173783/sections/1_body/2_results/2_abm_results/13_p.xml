 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g006">6</xref> correspond to the same set of simulations. We see that the distribution of times of first successful infection in the second cohort is very broad, despite the rapid spread through the first cohort. This is due to the relatively small number of weak inter-cohort connections. This bottleneck makes the dynamical behavior stochastic. Spread to the second cohort hinges on the small number of agents in the first cohort with connections to the second becoming infected. Typically, the small number of intra-cohort connections necessitates infection of a large fraction of the cohort before those few agents connected to the next cohort are infected. Since the probability of infection rarely rises above 0.1 for the parameters we have used, the spread is highly stochastic.
