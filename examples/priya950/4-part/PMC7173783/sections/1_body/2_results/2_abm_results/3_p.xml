<p>As explained in the previous section, a single parameter 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> characterizes an individual’s immune profile, consisting of various features: the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the immune system which is enhanced by vaccination. We investigate two cases; one corresponds to a population with a “strong” immune profile that can be viewed as arising from immunization in which 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> is drawn from a uniform distribution of range 2–6. The second case is a population with “weak” immune profiles corresponding to no immunization or ineffective vaccines. In this case, the values of 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> range from 0 to 4. We note that the rate at which the infection spreads decreases exponentially with the immunization strength. The different parameter choices discussed in the Model section are given in
