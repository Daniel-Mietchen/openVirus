<p>It is possible to generalize this model substantially by allowing these distributions to vary as a function of time, infectivity, contact with other individuals, and many other possible effects. Our goal is to study how the behavior changes when rates are varied according to biological and epidemiological considerations, and it would be well-nigh impossible computationally to include such effects. Quantitative characterization of the parameters from real data is difficult because of the multiplicity of causes for observed effects.</p>
