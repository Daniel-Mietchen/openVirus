<p>We solve these equations numerically with 
 <italic>Mathematica</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using the 
 <italic>NDSolve</italic> function. We note that the transition between different states of an agent occur in discrete time units of days in the ABM, while it occurs in continuous time with an exponential change in the ODE model. We report results for our choice of parameters for the ODE that are close to those used in the agent-based model.
