<p>Each susceptible agent is characterized by an immune strength that is determined by their immunological profile, whether they are vaccinated or not, and how effective the vaccine is [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We denote this by 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for the 
 <italic>i</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>th</italic>
 </sup> agent and the probability per day that a susceptible agent becomes exposed upon contact with an infectious agent decreases with increasing 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. This provides a simple way of including the effect of immunization in the model; the immune strength of an agent, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, increases in value, resulting in an increase in the mean time to become exposed by an infectious agent. A fully effective vaccine would extend this mean time well beyond the duration of time that an agent remains infectious, thus insulating the susceptible agent from infection. Different values of the immune strength 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> can be interpreted as being partly due to vaccine efficacy. While it is clearly a drastic simplification to represent the immunological profile by a single number, as more data become available, more detailed characterizations can be used. The value for each agent is chosen from a uniform distribution due to lack of data on individual variation in immunological profile.
