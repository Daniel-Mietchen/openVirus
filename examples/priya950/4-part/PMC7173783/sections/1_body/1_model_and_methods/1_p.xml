<p>In early, seminal work in the context of measles epidemics, Bartlett showed the existence of a critical population size below which the infection dies off and the occurrence of recurrent behavior if there is immigration providing a supply of susceptible individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. He argues this by examining the Hamer-Soper model [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a model with 
 <italic>s</italic> susceptible agents and 
 <italic>i</italic> infectious agents, which evolves stochastically in time. Three possible “transitions” can occur per unit time with specified rates: infection, defined by 
 <italic>s</italic> → 
 <italic>s</italic> − 1 and 
 <italic>i</italic> → 
 <italic>i</italic> + 1 at a rate λ 
 <italic>is</italic>, recovery, defined by infectious agents recovering 
 <italic>i</italic> → 
 <italic>i</italic> − 1 and becoming permanently immune at a rate 
 <italic>μi</italic>, and immigration, in which the susceptible agents 
 <italic>s</italic> → 
 <italic>s</italic> + 1 at a rate 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>. The first two correspond to the transitions in the SIR model and as we discuss below, the population structure of our model mimics an immigration-like term.
