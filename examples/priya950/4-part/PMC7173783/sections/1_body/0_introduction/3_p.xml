<p>Numerous works have appeared on how agent-based models and stochastic models have been applied to infectious diseases and their implications for health [

 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A simple version of the original mathematical model developed by Kermack and McKendrick known as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model has been used extensively and forms the basis of many investigations, including ours. Stochastic modeling was subsequently initiated by the pioneering work of Bartlett [

 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and others. Rvachev conducted one of the earliest studies of spatial-temporal model of influenza and applied it to spread in the Soviet Union [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are many models that have used stochastic simulation methods applied to metapopulation models and agent-based models to investigate the epidemiology of influenza and other infectious diseases. Watts et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] introduce and study a class of meta-population models with a hierarchy of successively larger domains with mixing, finding behavior with qualitative agreement with features extracted from data. Epidemic processes have been studied in a metapopulation approach with different flows based on coarse-grained empirical data in the air transportation network [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the impact of different strategies of intervention, random vs. targeted, on the spread of epidemics in a population, separated into subgroups in spatially discrete patches connected by migration pathways have been studied [
