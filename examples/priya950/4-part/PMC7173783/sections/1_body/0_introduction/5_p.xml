<p>The data reported by the CDC show that the number of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) measured by hospitalizations or outpatient visits can show more than one peak within a season in some years at the national [

 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and city [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] levels. There can be multiple reasons for such recurrences in the data. In this paper, we define and study a simple agent-based epidemiological model, with probabilistic dynamical rules, with the goal of describing a mechanism that can lead to recurrences within a flu season; we investigate how varying the topology of the network structure of contacts known to determine the spread of infection (see above) affects the occurrence of recurrences. We analyze, inter alia, the sample-to-sample variability due to stochastic fluctuations and their statistical properties. The antecedents of our model lie in the early work of Bartlett who used ordinary differential equations and numerical simulations to show that recurrences can occur in measles epidemics on the scale of years when immigration is included in the model. Emphasis is on the behavior of the spread of influenza infection during the course of one flu season, and we show that recurrences that are seen in the data can occur in the simulations for certain network structures of contacts and values of rate constants.
