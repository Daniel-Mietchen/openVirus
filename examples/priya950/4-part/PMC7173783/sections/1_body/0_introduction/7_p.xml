<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the Model and Methods section, we describe our model based on the SEIR paradigm with a number of agents that are divided into cohorts with strong transmissibility within, and weak connections between successive cohorts. The assumptions made that render the model parsimonious and tractable, yet describe behavior of interest, are specified. In the Results section, we first report the results of an ODE model of two groups or cohorts for weak coupling between the groups that provides a point of comparison for the ABM simulations. We present simulation results for the spread of infection: the dynamics of the infected number, reproduction number, and features of probability distributions that characterize the stochastic behavior and how these vary with the number of inter-cohort connections and strengths. Results obtained from our model for the case of a two-strain infection are then discussed. Our results and conclusions are summarized briefly in the Conclusions. Supplementary material provides more detailed support for various statements in the main text.</p>
