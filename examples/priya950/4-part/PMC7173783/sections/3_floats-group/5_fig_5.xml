  <title>Distributions of the occurrence time of the first peak in the infected number.</title>
  <p>The results for a weak population immune strength corresponding to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref> on the left, and for a strong population immune strength corresponding to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">Fig 4</xref> on the right. For a population with weak immune strength, infection spreads rapidly throughout the initial cohort, leading to a narrow distribution of times for the peak. Rapid spread reduces variance in the timing of the peak due to the finite size of the cohort. Increasing the collective immune strength, as shown on the right, broadens the distribution reflecting the increased time to spread as well as the availability of fewer susceptible agents, leading to many pauses in infection spread throughout the cohort. The histograms each represent 10,000 sample simulations.
