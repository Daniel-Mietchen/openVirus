  <p>Individual sample runs are shown with the ensemble average taken over 10,000 runs in the inset. This level of immunity leads to slow time scales for the rate of infection transmission between individuals compared to the duration before which an infectious individual recovers. The inter-cohort spread, through the weak, intermediate connections, is slower still and so we see an overall decay of the number of infectious agents. One sees smaller peaks punctuating the overall decline occurring randomly in time. The statistics of where the first peak occurs is shown in
