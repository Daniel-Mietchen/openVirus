  <title>Schematic for the population structure of the model.</title>
  <p>Within each cohort, each agent is connected to a fixed number of randomly chosen agents. Successive cohorts are connected through relatively few spanning connections between agents in the two cohorts. The inter-cohort connections are shown dashed, representing a weak connection value compared to the intra-cohort connections. There are no connections between agents in non-adjacent cohorts. The blue box represents further cohorts which are modeled the same way as the first two. Specific values and details of the structure are given in 
   <xref rid="pone.0231521.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and in the text of the Model section.
