  <p>There is a delay inserted between the time of infection and the transition of the susceptible number to infected. The model is solved with the initial conditions of 0.5% of the total population in the first cohort infected, with the remaining population being susceptible. We see the same oscillatory behavior as seen for the case of the SEIR model shown in
