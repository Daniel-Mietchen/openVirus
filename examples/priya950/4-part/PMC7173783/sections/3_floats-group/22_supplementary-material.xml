  <title>Sample runs of the infected number for the pandemic strain (left) and seasonal strain (right) for the two cases with low 50% and high 80% inoculation rates in the top and bottom rows respectively.</title>
  <p>The mean infected number dynamics for the corresponding parameters is shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g012">Fig 12</xref>. As expected, with lower levels of immunization, the number of people infected with pandemic flu increases. However, we observe the suppression of infection recurrences in the seasonal strain for lower levels of vaccination against the pandemic strain (b). In contrast, in the lower right panel for the higher rate of inoculation for the pandemic strain, the seasonal strain can spread more widely throughout the cohorts. This can be understood as a result of the immunity to the second, seasonal infection conferred by being infected earlier by first pandemic strain as explained in the text. The structure of the contact matrix is given in the model section, and virulence parameters are given in
