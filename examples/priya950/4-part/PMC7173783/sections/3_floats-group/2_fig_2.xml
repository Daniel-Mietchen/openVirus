  <title>Total infected (sum of exposed and infectious agents) number as a function of time for two-cohort SEIR model defined in

  <p>Here, 
   <italic>β</italic>
   <sub>11</sub> = 
   <italic>β</italic>
   <sub>22</sub> = 2, and 
   <italic>β</italic>
   <sub>12</sub> = 
   <italic>β</italic>
   <sub>21</sub> = 0.01, and the recovery rate 
   <italic>ν</italic> is 0.10. The separation in infection timescale between intra-cohort spread and inter-cohort spread leads to two distinct peaks in the infected number. This peak separation decreases if the infection rates are made closer in value, as well if the recovery rate is made too rapid. This behavior is compared with the mean behavior of the infected number in the ABM later in the text.
