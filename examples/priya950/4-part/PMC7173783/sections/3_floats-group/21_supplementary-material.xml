  <title>Analysis of the model as the inter-cohort connection degree increases.</title>
  <p>The behavior of the mean number is shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g011">Fig 11</xref>. Different colors correspond to individual runs which began with the same initial conditions of 30 people infected in a population of 6000. The trend we point out is that the recurrences which are well-defined and separated for low connection degree become smoothed into one larger infection peak as the degree is progressively increased. Since this increase leads to a much more well-connected population both inside and across cohorts, the model tends to the results for the single-cohort ODE SEIR model in this limit.
