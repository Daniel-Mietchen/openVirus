  <title>Mean number of infected (the sum of exposed and infectious) people as a function of time for four different total population sizes, all with the parameters given in 
   <xref rid="pone.0231521.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
  </title>
  <p>The black dots represent the ensemble average taken at each time point, with the error bars representing the ensemble standard deviations. Individual runs for each of these setups are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s007">S7 Fig</xref>. We observe the increasing stability of recurrences as the population grows through the the second peak which arises as 
   <italic>N</italic> is increased. For low values of 
   <italic>N</italic>, (1000 and 2000), stochastic population collapse occurs frequently enough that there is only one well-defined peak due to the initial infection. The averages are taken over 10,000 individual realizations.
