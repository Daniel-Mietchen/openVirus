<p>Anti-DcHEV IgG-Abs were detected using ELISA following the procedure of Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly 96-well ELISA microplates (Immulon 2; Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated with purified HEV-LPs (1 μg/mL, 100 μL/well) (kindly provided by Dr Tian-Cheng Li) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed twice with PBS/tween-20 (0.05%) (PBS-T) then blocked with 200 μL of 5% skim milk in PBS-T (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing three times with PBS-T. Camels’ sera (100 μL/well) were added at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed 3 times. Then, 100 μL of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-camel IgG (H + L) (1:1000 dilution) (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX, USA) in blocking buffer was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBS-T. Then 100 µL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The colorimetric reaction was stopped with 100 µL of 1N HCL (0.8%). Absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 650 nm. The cutoff was calculated based on the 20 known negative samples that were tested in triplicate (mean OD + 4 x SD) and was found to be 0.257. All serum samples were tested in duplicate and samples with an optical density above the cut-off values were considered positive. Samples with border line index values (OD/cutoff = 0.8–1.2) were tested in triplicate on three separate runs and the results of two repeats were taken as the final result if a discrepancy between the three repeats was found.
