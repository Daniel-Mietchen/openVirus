<p>Autochthonous HEV has been reported frequently in the developed world and has been linked to the consumption of pork or wild animal products [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. HEV was detected in dromedaries from the Middle East and the virus was named DcHEV [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. About 1.5% of the adult dromedary fecal samples showed the presence of DcHEV RNA [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that DcHEV represents a previously unrecognized HEV genotype and was designated as HEV-7. Recently, the zoonotic potential of DcHEV was reported in a liver transplant patient from the Middle East, who frequently ate camel meat and drank camel milk [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] indicating the possibility of zoonotic transmission of HEV-7 to humans. A recent study indicated that DcHEV prepared by a reverse genetic system resulted in HEV infection in cynomolgus monkeys, providing new evidence of zoonotic infection by DcHEV [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The pathogenicity of DcHEV has been unclear and may be multifactorial [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite the availability of DcHEV genome sequences in the sequence databases, the antigenicity, pathogenicity, and epidemiology of DcHEV is unclear due to the lack of a cell culture system for the virus [
