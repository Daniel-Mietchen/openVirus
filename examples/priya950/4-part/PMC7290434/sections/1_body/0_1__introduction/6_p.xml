<p>Very few reports including old reports are available on the prevalence of HEV in Saudi Arabia in humans [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and no reports exist on the HEV prevalence in camels. Dromedary camel trade and farming have been increasing in Saudi Arabia over the past three decades and importation is unidirectional from Africa to Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. More than 60% of the worldâ€™s dromedary camel population lives in East African countries [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This has instigated us to perform this investigation of the seroprevalence of HEV in imported and domestic camels to fill in this gap in knowledge in this important health area.
