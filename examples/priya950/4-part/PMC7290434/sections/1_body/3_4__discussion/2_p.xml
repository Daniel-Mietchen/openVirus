<p>In this study, we collected samples from imported camels from Africa and from domestic camels from farms and slaughterhouses from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The assay used in this study was established by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] based on using DcHEV-LPs as an antigen and was validated for the detection of DcHEV-Abs in Camels from Ethiopia. The overall seroprevalence of DcHEV in the collected samples was 23.1% showing a prevalence of 25.4% in domestic and 22.4% in imported camels. The prevalence of DcHEV in the imported camels was comparable to earlier reports from the African continent including a study that reported a prevalence of 20% in camels from Ethiopia [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This difference in prevalence between the two studies could be due to either the different assay used or the sampling time frame difference; Rasche et al. investigated samples in the period from 1983â€“2015 while the samples from Sudan were collected in 1983. The only significant association in our study was found between gender and the positivity of the DcHEV-IgG antibodies (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.015) while there was no statistical difference in prevalence between imported and domestic camels. A recent study [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed a similar prevalence in dromedaries where they found a seroprevalence of 86.6%.
