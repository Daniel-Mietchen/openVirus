A long-term epidemiological study confirmed the detection of partial DcHEV genome in camel serum or fecal samples from the UAE, North and East Africa and Pakistan during the period 1983â€“2015. The study indicated that DcHEV in dromedary camels has been long-established, diversified, and geographically widespread [
