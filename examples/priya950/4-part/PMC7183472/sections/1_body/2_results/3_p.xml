 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1</xref> Shows phylogeny of the VEEV obtained withMEGA Version 7.0 (https://www.megasoftware.net/) detected in frugivorous bats, and compared with other alphaviruses reported in Genbank. The consensus sequence obtained in this study presented a similarity of 97%, and 100% coverage with sequences of the gene was encoding the nsp4 protein registered in GenBank: KC344505.2 Guatemala/human [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] KC344485.2 (strain CoAn5384 equine isolated from Cali, Colombia) [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. That is, the sequences found in frugivorous bats of the Colombian Caribbean are similar to sequences of the epizootic cycle of VEEV (Subtype I, varieties AB and C), which are the main responsible for outbreaks in humans and equines.
