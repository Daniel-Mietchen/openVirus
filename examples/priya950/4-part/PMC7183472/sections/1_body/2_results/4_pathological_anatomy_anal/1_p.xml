<p>VEEV antigens and pathological lesions were detected in two specimens, and both were also positive by RT-PCR. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref> shows the findings of the pathological anatomy found in the tissues of 
 <italic>Sturnira lilium</italic> in the central nervous system, severe meningitis, and non-suppurative vasculitis of the lymphocytic type, perivascular and perineuronal edema, diffuse gliosis, satellitosis, neuronophagia, neuronal death, and neuropil vacuolization. In the liver, there is a severe mononuclear infiltrate of lymphocytic type in the portal triad and multifocally in the periacinar and centrolubulillar area and vascular changes in hepatocytes. The final diagnosis was a severe non-suppurative meningoencephalitis of viral type and severe non-suppurative hepatitis of infectious viral type. Concerning the other specimen 
 <italic>Artibeus planirostris</italic>, in the lung, there was a hyperplasia of a lymphoid type associated with bronchi, thickening of alveolar septa, mononuclear lymphocytic alveolitis, and mixed infiltrate with mononuclear predominance. In the liver, mild non-suppurative hepatitis of the lymphocytic type was observed.
