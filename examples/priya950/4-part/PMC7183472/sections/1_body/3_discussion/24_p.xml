<p>The analysis of the dynamic maintenance of these viruses appears to link to a transmission network instead of a transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mechanisms for the maintenance of arboviruses are intrinsically complicated and must be taken into account and incorporated when designing and constructing mathematical models that allow predicting their enzootic/epidemic activity in a given ecosystem (wild, urban, and agricultural, as well). Consequently, to better understand the activity pattern and the transmission networks of arboviruses, it is essential to understand the assembly of host species and vectors, their interactions, and fluctuations through time and space. Although the natural infection rate found in this study by molecular methods is low (0.2%), it poses the challenge of being able to complement surveillance with serological detection to establish the presence of the virus in regions where the disease is absent in humans. The role of naturally infected frugivorous bats is challenging due to the short period during which these infected animals “could be viremic,” and the serological detection of specific immunoglobulin offers the most effective means of confirming it.
