<p>Immunohistochemical detection of VEEV antigens in paraffin-embedded tissues provides a rapid and reliable means of confirmation of histological diagnosis. The results of this study correlate well with the results of molecular virus detection and sequencing. These results indicate that the IHC technique constitutes one of the useful tools of specific diagnosis due to its high sensitivity and specificity, the reason why it can also be used for the identification of other tropical etiologies. Unfortunately, this technique has a high cost to be transferred to regional reference laboratories in Colombia.</p>
