<p>On the other hand, the “viremic” animals in their wild cycle could reach the water sources and have contact with the mosquitoes, and these infect domestic animals that are in contact with humans. Likewise, the relative proximity of frugivorous bats and humans due to disruption of their natural habitat makes it possible for the viral transmission to occur through the consumption of contaminated fruits. Therefore, the approach of these arboviruses requires designs that contemplate an integral and connectable perspective in a network that allows to improve the understanding of the dynamics of the viruses and thus improve the preventive measures in vector control and public health policies.</p>
