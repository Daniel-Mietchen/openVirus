<p>Some seroprevalence studies in countries of the Americas have reported that bats can be infected naturally by the VEEV [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and they are likely to act as reservoirs to feed mosquitoes that feed on blood, and then they can transmit the virus to domestic animals and humans. Although in the bats captured in this investigation, no apparent neurological symptoms were observed that were related to VEEV, a diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate was found in the brain with neuronal necrosis and multifocal vasculitis detected by histopathological diagnosis compatible with non-suppurative encephalitis of viral type, these presumptive lesions of encephalitis were confirmed by specific labeling of VEEV antigens.
