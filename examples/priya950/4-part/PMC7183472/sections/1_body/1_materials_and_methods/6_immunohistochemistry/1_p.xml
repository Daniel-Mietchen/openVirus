<p>For the detection of VEEV, a Mouse Encephalitis, Equine, Venezuelan Monoclonal Antibody (Chemicon International, Inc. USA) was performed. Histological specimens of 4 μm were placed on positively charged slides, and these were placed at 60°C for 2 h. The antigenic recovery was made under pressure (Cuisinart Pressure Cooker Model CPC-600). For antigenic recovery, the heat-induced epitope recovery technique was used using the Trilogy
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution for 15 min at 125°C) that allowed dewaxing, rehydration, and antigenic recovery simultaneously. The slides were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then introduced in 9% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> diluted in methanol to block the peroxidase, washed with PBS, the cuts were delineated with Dako Pen. The tissues were covered with the monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100, and the HiDefTM amplifier was applied and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Later three washes with PBS were made, and the HiDefTM horseradish peroxidase polymer detector was applied and washed with PBS. The tissue was covered with the Dako Liquid DAB+Substrate Chromogen System, washed in PBS, and contrast stained with hematoxylin for 1 min, the sections were dehydrated with alcohols of increasing concentration. Finally, they were immersed in xylol and covered with coverslips using Entellan
 <sup>®</sup>. In all cases, as a negative control of the technique, the primary antibody was replaced by 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Mouse brain slices inoculated with VEEV were used as positive controls [
