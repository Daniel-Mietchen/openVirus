<p id="p0160">In the last two decades, notable progress has been made in the development of anti-HCV drugs. Treatments with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin for HCV eradication have been replaced by the second generation of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Compared to previous treatments, DAAs offer better tolerability and HCV eradication in almost 95% of cases (

Sofosbuvir was the first drug that demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating certain types of HCV infection without the need for co-administration of INF. The high potency of sofosbuvir is attributable, in part, to the first 5â€²-phosphate group, which was built into the structure of this prodrug, thereby eliminating the first rate-limiting enzymatic transformation into the monophosphate. Additional groups are attached to the phosphorus atom to temporarily mask the two negative charges of the phosphate group, thereby facilitating the entry of the drug into the infected cell (
