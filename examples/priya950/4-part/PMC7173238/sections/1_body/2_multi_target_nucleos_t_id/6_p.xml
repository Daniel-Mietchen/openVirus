<p id="p0150">In contrast to HBV, combination treatments have been the standard for the treatment of HIV infection for many years. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are commonly administered with other drugs in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to target multiple stages of the HIV life cycle. Lamivudine and tenofovir are among the most important drugs used in combination (

According to a survey, among the top 24 small-molecule combinations most frequently utilized as drug components, anti-HIV lamivudine occurred 15 times, while tenofovir disoproxil occurred 9 times. Lamivudine and tenofovir have been combined with other NRTIs (e.g., abacavir, emtricitabine, and zidovudine) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (e.g., efavirenz, darunavir, rilpivirine, and doravirine). Inhibitors of HIV integrase (elvitegravir, dolutegravir, raltegravir, and bictegravir) can also be found in several compositions (
