<p id="p0145">Treatment of HBV infections is usually carried out as a monotherapy; thus, combination therapies are not generally recommended (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2018</xref>). One of the exceptions is the use of ribavirin in combination with standard therapy to enhance the current treatment regimens. Ribavirin is commonly used to treat HCV, but there is evidence that it also induces immune effects that positively affect HBV treatment. A study on anti-HBV treatment with ribavirin and tenofovir, compared to tenofovir treatment alone, is currently in a phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03759782).
