<p id="p0280">Azacitidine (5-AC; 5-AZC; AZA-CR; 5-azacytidine; Vidaza) is a prodrug and antimetabolite of cytidine that has been approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To date, azacytidine has also been approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients with 20–30% bone marrow (BM) blasts and with &gt;30% BM blasts (

Hypomethylating agents—azacitidine and decitabine—were reported to influence tumour interactions with the host immune system. They activate endogenous retroviral elements that are normally epigenetically silenced (
