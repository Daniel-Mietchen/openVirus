<p id="p0255">Nucleoside antimetabolites are used against a broad range of human cancers, including leukaemias, lymphomas, and pancreatic, breast, bladder, ovarian, colon or kidney cancer. By mimicking the physiological role of their natural counterparts, they interfere with cellular metabolism, incorporate into DNA or RNA, inhibit enzymes (essential polymerases, DNA methyltransferases, kinases, phosphorylases, thymidylate synthase or ribonucleotide reductase) and thus inhibit cell division and viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Jordheim et al., 2013</xref>). Among the major players are purine analogues (including the commonly used cladribine, approved in 1992; fludarabine, approved in 1991; second-generation clofarabine, approved in 2004; and nelarabine, approved in 2005) and pyrimidine analogues (first approved in cytarabine in 1969, gemcitabine in 1996, azacytidine in 2004, decitabine in 2006, and floxuridine in 1970), which have had important roles in several cancer treatments (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, it was recently reported that several nucleoside analogues clinically approved as antivirals or antineoplastic agents also show antibacterial activity (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Thomson and Lamont, 2019</xref>). Examples of such drugs include gemcitabine, zidovudine, 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, idoxuridine and thiopurines. The application limitations of some nucleoside analogues as antibiotics could be connected with their side effects and toxicity (e.g., myelosuppression or pulmonary toxicity). However, the concentrations of nucleoside analogues that inhibited the growth of bacteria were lower than those used for the treatment of cancer patients, which can reduce the problem of toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jordheim et al., 2012</xref>). The antibiotic potency of nucleoside analogues could be useful, especially in hospital settings, to treat multi-drug-resistant bacteria.
