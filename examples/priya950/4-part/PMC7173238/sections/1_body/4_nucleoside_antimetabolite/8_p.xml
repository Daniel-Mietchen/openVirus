 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2018</xref>). A study of azacytidine activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 revealed that it primarily targets reverse transcription (in the form of 5-azacytidine-triphosphate or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine triphosphate). An increase in the HIV-1 mutation rate caused by incorporating azacytidine into viral RNA was observed (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dapp et al., 2009</xref>). An additional study indicated that the mutagenesis of HIV-1 was enhanced after the reduction of 5-azacytidine to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, which led to G-to-C hypermutation (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Rawson et al., 2016a</xref>). A comparison of azacytidine activity towards HIV-1 and HIV-2 revealed better efficacy towards HIV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.2 and 14.5 μM, respectively) (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Beach et al., 2014</xref>). The combination of 5-azacytidine with low concentrations of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors (e.g., resveratrol) had a synergistic effect and significantly reduced the infectivity of HIV-1. The synergism was explained by the reduced accumulation of reverse transcription products rather than increased viral mutagenesis (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Rawson et al., 2016b</xref>). A recent study on human adenoviruses revealed that azacytidine itself was an effective antiviral agent over a wide range of concentrations but its derivatives showed even better results, namely, N
 <sup>4</sup>-methyl-6-azacytidine and N
 <sup>4</sup>,O-tetraacetyl-6-azacytidine, for which high selectivity against AdV and low cytotoxicity were observed (
