<p id="p0200">Trifluridine (trifluorothymidine, 5-trifluoromethyl-2â€²-deoxyuridine, TFT) belongs to a group of fluorinated pyrimidine analogues. This compound is used as an anti-HSV drug in therapy for HSV-induced epithelial keratitis. After its conversion to trifluridine monophosphate, it inhibits thymidylate synthetase, which is elevated in different cancer cell lines. After further phosphorylation, the corresponding triphosphate competitively inhibits DNA polymerases with respect to thymidine triphosphate (

Trifluridine in combination with tipiracil (Lonsurf) has been approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were previously subjected to chemotherapy involving fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (

Phase 3 clinical trials are also underway to collect additional data about the safety and efficacy of trifluridine-tipiracil during the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (NCT03306394). Trifluridine was also tested as an antibacterial agent. Specifically, it was found that trifluridine strongly inhibits
