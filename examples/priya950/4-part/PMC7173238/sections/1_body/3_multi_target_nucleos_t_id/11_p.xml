<p id="p0220">Ganciclovir (GCV, 9-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)]guanine) differs from acyclovir in that it has an extra hydroxymethyl group in the acyclic chain. Due to its highly efficient action against CMV, ganciclovir has been approved for use in the treatment of infections with this virus, which belongs to the so-called beta-herpesvirus group. Ganciclovir, similar to acyclovir, is also active against alpha-herpesviruses such as HSV-1 and HSV-2 and has similar activity against VZV (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Jabs et al., 1986</xref>). For this reason, ganciclovir prodrugs have been explored. Valganciclovir (VGCV, 9-[(2-hydroxy-1-valyloxymethyl)ethoxymethyl]guanine), which was approved by the FDA in 2001, is the first example of such a prodrug. Valganciclovir is well absorbed after oral administration (over 60%). The addition of a valyl ester group to ganciclovir makes it a good substrate of the two peptide transporters (PEPT1 and PEPT2), which increase its absorption. The ester linkage between the valyl group and ganciclovir is easily hydrolysed by intestinal esterase and hepatic esterase (
