HSV is a highly infectious virus that causes so-called cold sores of the mouth (in cases of infection with HSV-1) or on the genitals (in cases of infection with HSV-2). These viruses can also attack the central nervous system and cause encephalitis. HSV-1 can be transmitted through oral contact, while HSV-2 is spread through sexual contact (

Unfortunately, even in cured patients, the virus remains latent in the body (cervical ganglia) and can be reactivated when the host's immune system is weakened (
