<p id="p0205">There are six approved acyclic guanosine analogues, namely, acyclovir, ganciclovir, valaciclovir, valganciclovir, penciclovir, and famciclovir (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). First, acyclovir (ACV, [9-(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl)guanine]) was originally designed as an inhibitor of adenosine deaminases, but in 1977, it was discovered to be an effective antiherpetic drug (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Elion et al., 1977</xref>). Acyclovir is most active against HSV-1, but its activity against HSV-2 and VZV has also been demonstrated (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Schaeffer et al., 1978</xref>). Acyclovir is also active against EBV and, at high concentrations, against CMV. Its activity is based on the inhibition of the DNA polymerase, which causes DNA chain termination because the active acyclovir form, the triphosphate, lacks the 3′-hydroxyl group required for DNA chain elongation (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Laskin, 1984</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Ostrosky-Zeichner and Rex, 2008</xref>). The bioavailability of oral acyclovir is relatively poor (15–21%); thus, high doses of this drug are required. It can also be administered in topical form. This drug has an excellent safety profile because acyclovir triphosphate is a much better substrate for the viral polymerase than for the cellular polymerase. Additionally, because the affinity of acyclovir for the viral thymidine kinase is approximately 200-fold greater than that for the cellular thymidine kinase, a higher concentration of its active metabolite is observed in infected cells (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Das and Hong, 2018</xref>). In 2017, studies conducted to determine the effect of acyclovir on breast cancer MCF-7 cells were described (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Shaimerdenova et al., 2017</xref>). The obtained results demonstrate the suppressive effect of acyclovir on breast cancer cells. Acyclovir treatment decreases the proliferation rate as well as the growth of cells and correlates with upregulation of apoptosis associated with caspase-3. Acyclovir also inhibits the colony formation ability and cell invasion capacity of cancer cells. These results demonstrate the possibility of partial suppression of cancer cell proliferation using this antiviral agent. However, further research is necessary to determine the mechanism of the anticancer activity of acyclovir. The literature also describes an approach based on the phosphorylation of acyclovir by the viral thymidine kinase but not the cellular enzyme (
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylated acyclovir inhibits cellular DNA synthesis and kills infected cells. It was assumed that phosphorylated acyclovir would be a cytotoxic agent when properly delivered to the cancer cells. To facilitate the targeted delivery of phosphorylated acyclovir to the tumour, lipid/calcium/phosphate nanoparticles with a membrane/core structure were used to encapsulate the phosphorylated drug. The nanoparticles containing phosphorylated acyclovir facilitated its delivery to the tumour, which contributed to the significantly enhanced inhibition of tumour growth without obvious toxicity.
