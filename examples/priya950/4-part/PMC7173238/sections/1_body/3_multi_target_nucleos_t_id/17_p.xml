<p id="p0250">Brincidofovir (CMX001), which is a lipid conjugate of cidofovir, seems to be the most promising antiviral compound. In contrast to the latter, brincidofovir is orally available. It is absorbed in the small intestine and transported throughout the body as a phospholipid. It crosses target cell membranes by facilitated and passive diffusion. Additionally, it has a long intracellular half-life (

It was studied for safety and efficacy against adenovirus (AdV) infection (phase 3 clinical trials; NCT02087306) and against serious diseases or conditions caused by DNA viruses (phase 3; NCT01143181). Another clinical trial (phase 2) revealed that patients taking brincidofovir were resistant to CMV infection (NCT942305). Unfortunately, the results of the phase 3 trial (NCT01769170) showed that the effect was only observed during active drug administration and disappeared immediately after treatment. Moreover, a significant number of patients developed diarrhoea. As a result, two other clinical trials for CMV prevention (NCT02439970 and NCT02439957) were stopped.
