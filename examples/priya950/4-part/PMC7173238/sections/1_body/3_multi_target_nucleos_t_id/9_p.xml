<p id="p0210">To increase the oral bioavailability of antiviral drugs, a prodrug strategy can be applied. Valaciclovir (VACV, L-valyl ester of acyclovir) is a highly efficient and safe prodrug of acyclovir. It can be dosed orally and is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract through both a passive transcellular mechanism and an active peptide transporter mechanism. The prodrug is then converted to acyclovir in the liver and intestinal walls by specific enzymes (

In clinical trials, valaciclovir has a similar antiviral activity and safety profile as acyclovir; therefore, it has superseded acyclovir for the treatment of HSV or VZV infections (
