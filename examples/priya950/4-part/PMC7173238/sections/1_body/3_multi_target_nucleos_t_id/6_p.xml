<p id="p0195">Brivudine (BVDU, 5-[2-bromovinyl]-2â€²-deoxyuridine), similar to idoxuridine, is a 5-substituted thymidine analogue approved as a drug for use against a wide range of herpesviruses. Brivudine is highly specific against HSV-1 and VZV; however, it does not show activity against HSV-2 (

The results of a comparison of brivudine, famciclovir and valaciclovir treatment in immunocompetent adult patients with herpes zoster indicate that brivudine may be the first choice in cases of severe herpes zoster because of its ability to promptly control pain and its once-a-day use (

The literature also describes a novel series of phosphoramidate nucleoside (idoxuridine and brivudine) prodrugs that include amino acid motifs based on L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid (so-called ProTides), which have been evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. Compared to parent nucleoside, such as idoxuridine or brivudine, which displayed only weak to moderate activity, the corresponding ProTide showed increased cytotoxic activity (
