<p id="p0225">Vidarabine (VDR, 9-Î²-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is an analogue of adenosine isolated from 
 <italic>Streptomyces antibioticus</italic>. Vidarabine, unlike previously discussed drugs, does not require viral enzymes at any step of the triphosphorylation process to generate an active metabolite. When phosphorylated by cellular enzymes, vidarabine is in the active triphosphate form. The lack of specificity is responsible for its toxicity. Vidarabine is oncogenic and teratogenic in laboratory animal models. Vidarabine triphosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of viral and cellular DNA polymerase. It functions as a chain terminator after incorporation into the DNA. Additionally, this metabolite also inhibits other viral and cellular enzymes, such as ribonucleoside reductase and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which may also contribute to the antiviral and toxic effects of vidarabine (

A few years ago, it was proposed that vidarabine could be applied as a potent and selective inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase 5 for the treatment of two human diseases: heart failure and cancer. This conclusion was based on the results of animal testing (
