<p id="p0110">Epidemics and pandemics have had significant impacts on human history for centuries. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been issuing a report on new viral pathogens that pose a threat to public health almost every year. Emerging epidemics caused by new pathogens or by strains that are more pathogenic than the preceding viral pathogens necessitate the development of effective strategies for combating and preventing viral infections. Immunoprophylaxis by a specific vaccination is one of the most important strategies for combating many infectious diseases. However, there are still many viruses for which no effective vaccine is available on the market. In these cases, the use of effective antiviral drugs is the only possible way to fight against infections caused by viruses.</p>
