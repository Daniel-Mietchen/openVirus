Nucleobases may be modified by halogenation, azotation, N-conjugation, ring opening or the introduction of another heterocyclic system. In the sugar moiety, substituents can be exchanged or removed, the configuration of carbon atoms in the ring can be changed, additional heteroatoms can be introduced into the ring, or the oxygen in the ring can be replaced with another atom. Moreover, the ring size can be changed or replaced with an acyclic fragment. The phosphate fragment may be protected, replaced by another phosphorus-containing group or by a fragment derived from another compound (e.g., an amino acid) or completely eliminated.
