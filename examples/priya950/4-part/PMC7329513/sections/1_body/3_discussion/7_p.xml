<p id="Par39">A similar unpublished study was carried out by the CDC and the Ministry of Health following the 2007 MVD outbreak in Kamwenge and Ibanda district in the same area. In that study, they found a seroprevalence of Marburg virus at 1.2% (7/564) and Sudan virus at 1.2% (7/564). The seroprevalence of Marburg virus was slightly lower in our study whereas that of ebolaviruses was higher. We do not have a clear explanation for these differences in seropositivity between the two studies conducted in the same area 8 years apart. Also, the seroprevalence in our study is lower than 8% and 3% for pooled seroprevalences reported in meta-analyses of seroprevalence of ebolaviruses performed in other parts of the world [
