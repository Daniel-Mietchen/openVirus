<p id="Par36">The four seropositive individuals we found in the “unexposed” Luweero district group could be due to travel and migration from high-risk areas but may also be due to the movement of reservoirs such as bats that are known to travel long distances hence spreading the infection. Ebola virus seropositivity has before been reported in a grassland savanna-like ecosystem in Nigeria similar to the grassland savannah ecosystem of Luweero where the three Sudan virus (3) seropositive individuals were identified [
