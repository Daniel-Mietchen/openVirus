<p id="Par40">Our investigation also reported a lower seroprevalence of ebolaviruses (2.5%) than pooled seroprevalences reported in other studies in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at 10% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], Central African Republic and Gabon at 11% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Sudan at 22% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], Madagascar at 4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Liberia at 13% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Cameroon at 7% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, our study showed higher seroprevalence than that reported in Nigeria at 2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Germany at 1% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Kenya at 1% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Only one Marburg virus seropositive person was confirmed in our study and this was much lower than has been reported in other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, further comparison of these studies is difficult due to differences in serological methods used and differences in filovirus species targeted.
