  <p>Phylogenetic trees obtained for the three genomic segments RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3, by concatenating coding and non-coding regions and fitting a heterogeneous nucleotide-substitution model using CODEML. See 
   <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for virus names and abbreviations. The three trees have been aligned with a color-coded system for each genus to show similitudes and differences.
