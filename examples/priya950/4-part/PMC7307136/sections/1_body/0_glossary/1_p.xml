   <term id="d0120">Cross Protection</term>
   <def>
    <p id="p0125">It describes a phenomenon in that an initial infection of a host plant with a mild strain of a virus induces resistance in that plant to the infection of another, closely related virus potentially protecting the plant from disease caused by a more virulent isolate.</p>

   <term id="d0125">Genome Activation</term>
   <def>
    <p id="p0130">Ilarviral genomic RNAs alone are unable to establish infection in plants, unless the coat protein is present. This function of the coat protein is termed genome activation and is specific for ilarviruses and closely related alfamoviruses. The event is triggered by binding of the coat protein RNA binding domain to the 3′ terminus of genomic RNA.</p>

   <term id="d0135">RNA Silencing</term>
   <def>
    <p id="p0140">A fundamental, evolutionarily conserved and sequence-specific mechanism that is triggered by double-stranded RNA and regulates gene expression in eukaryotes. It is a primary antiviral defense mechanism in plants and other living organisms.</p>

   <term id="d0130">RNA Silencing Suppressor</term>
   <def>
    <p id="p0135">A countermeasure to RNA silencing, often a protein encoded by a virus which interrupts a single, or multiple steps in the RNA silencing pathway such as binding to small interfering RNA and thereby preventing their incorporation into the RNA induced silencing complex.</p>

   <def>
    <p id="p0145">A segment of RNA generated from a genomic RNA via an internal promoter that has the same 3′ end as the genomic RNA, but has a deletion at the 5′ end. The sub-genomic RNA makes it possible to efficiently translate the downstream open reading frame of the genomic RNA.</p>
