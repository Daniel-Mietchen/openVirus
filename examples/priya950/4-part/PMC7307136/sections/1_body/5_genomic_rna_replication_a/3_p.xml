<p id="p0230">Members of the genera 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic> are capable of producing the defective (d)RNAs and defective-interfering (di)RNAs during infection (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, strains of Broad bean mottle virus (BBMV) do accumulate RNA2-derived deletion variants after serial passages through broad bean. In BMV, both replicating and non-replicating truncated RNA2-derived artificial diRNAs have been shown to interfere with BMV RNAs in protoplasts. For CMV, several types of RNA3-derived diRNAs have been described.
