<p id="p0195">The detailed knowledge of CCMV capsids provided opportunities in nanotechnology, e.g., for the reversible pH-dependent gating, useful during the regulation of size-constrained biomimetic mineralization. The interior surface of CCMV capsids can be engineered of as differentially functionalized CP subunits, to act e.g., as a ferritin surrogate that spatially constrains the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. Also, the electrostatically driven adsorption on Si and amine-functionalized Si as well as the fabrication of multilayer CCMV films have been reported. The electrostatically patchy protein cages of CCMV can be used to direct the assembly of super lattices for RNA encapsulation.</p>
