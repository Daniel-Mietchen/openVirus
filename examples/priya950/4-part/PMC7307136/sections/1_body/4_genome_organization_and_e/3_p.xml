<p id="p0210">The 32 kDa MP of bromovirids has a conserved RNA binding domain that binds to vRNA and assists with viral transport. There are two groups among the members of the family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic> regarding the cell-to-cell transport; those that do not require participation of virions and those that transport whole virions. In the first group only the MP-RNA entity is transported (non-virion transport) in a form of either the complex of MP and vRNA, or a triple complex of vRNA, MP and CP. For the first group, the prototype example is TMV whereas members of the genus 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> have a similar mechanism, which has been demonstrated for CCMV. The MP of these viruses belongs to the 30K superfamily of MPs that appear to interact with cellular microtubules. In the second subtype, where the transported complex is vRNA-MP-CP, the typical example is CMV, a comovirus. In this case, the CMV MP exhibits the binding affinity to the actine microfilaments. The second group transports whole virions intercellularly through plasmodesmata inside the microtubules (virion transport). BMV and AMV are the members of two genera that are transported this way. Also for ilarviruses such as PDV or PNRSV, their MPs likely assist during translocation of the entire viral particles alongside the tubular structures. It appears that MPs of these viruses interact with virion CP subunits via a 44C-terminal key aa domain.
