<p>Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation, or median (interquartile range [IQR]), depending on data distribution. Comparisons of categorical variables between groups were performed using χ 
 <sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Comparisons of continuous variables between groups were performed using Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic> test, one-way analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Multivariable binary logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine independent variables associated with length of stay ≥7 days and 1-year mortality, respectively. Variables with 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 observed in univariate analyses were included in these multivariable models. Assuming that 1-year mortality is 13%, and approximately 84% of patients would receive adherent empirical antibiotics, which would result in 20% reduction in mortality, we estimated a sample size of 292 would be required to achieve a statistical power of 80%, at a Type I error of 5% (PS: Power and Sample Size calculation software, version 3.0) [
