<p>We performed a prospective, observational study involving adult patients admitted for CAP to an acute care hospital in Hong Kong. Disease severity, antibiotic treatment, and outcomes were documented. Sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), and urine were collected within 72 hours from admission for microbiological studies. The study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kongâ€“New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.</p>
