<p>In conclusion, using molecular diagnostics and antigen tests in addition to traditional culture methods, pathogens were identified in 45% of patients hospitalized with CAP in Hong Kong. Viral pneumonia was most common. Influenza virus, 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> were the most common viral, bacterial, and atypical pathogens, respectively, supporting our treatment guidelines. Almost all bacterial pathogens were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, supporting its role as empirical treatment. Adherence to treatment guidelines was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and improved survival.
