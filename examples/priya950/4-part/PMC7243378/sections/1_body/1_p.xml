<p>The epidemiology, aetiologies, and antibiotic resistance patterns of pathogens causing CAP may differ in Asia from other regions of the world [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Local surveillance data on the aetiologies and susceptibility patterns of the most common pathogens causing CAP is crucial in formulating treatment guidelines in guiding empirical antibiotics choices. This is particularly important for management of CAP, because in clinical practice, no pathogens can be identified for the majority of patients, precluding pathogen-guided therapy [
