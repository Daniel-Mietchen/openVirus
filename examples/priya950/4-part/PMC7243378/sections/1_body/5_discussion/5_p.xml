<p>The findings of our study supported our current treatment guidelines [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. First, 93% of bacterial pathogens were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> was the most common atypical pathogen, supporting the recommendation of amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline for hospitalized nonsevere CAP. Macrolide resistance secondary to A2063G mutation among 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> isolates was present in 47% to 80% of isolates in Hong Kong and China in recent studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], whereas no resistance to tetracyclines had yet been reported.
