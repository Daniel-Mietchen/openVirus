<p>Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as important, or even predominant, causes of CAP in adult and elderly populations [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is partly due to improved detection rates of a wide spectrum of respiratory viruses using molecular tests performed on upper respiratory tract samples [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our cohort, influenza and rhinovirus are the predominant viral pathogens, similar to other studies of CAP [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In previous studies, researchers questioned the role of rhinoviruses in lower respiratory tract infections. More recent studies demonstrated a high rate of detection of rhinovirus from lower respiratory tract samples in patients with severe pneumonia, supporting its contributory role in the pathogenesis of CAP [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
