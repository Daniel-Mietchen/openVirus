<p>Doxycycline is recommended for coverage of certain atypical pathogens, such as macrolide-resistant 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> or 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, and where macrolide or fluoroquinolone resistance in 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or tuberculosis are prevalent [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our results and others supported that doxycycline-based combination therapy is a feasible first-line recommended empirical therapy for nonsevere CAP in regions with high macrolide resistance in atypical pathogens. However, the role of doxycycline in severe pneumonia is uncertain and needs further evaluation.
