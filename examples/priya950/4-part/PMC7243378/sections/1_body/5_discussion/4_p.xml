<p>Younger age groups had a higher proportion of bacterial pneumonia, largely due to higher detection rates of 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>. Prevalence of 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> was 2 to 12 times higher in younger versus older adult populations [

 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such coverage should be strongly recommended for younger patients. On the other hand, a lower rate of pathogen detection was observed in elderly patients. In a recent study, dysbiosis of the normal flora in the respiratory tract, which allows overgrowth of 1 or more of the resident flora, was observed to be a cause of CAP. This may explain the high rates of culture-negativity in elderly patients with CAP [
