<p>On the other hand, undertreatment was observed in patients with severe pneumonia or bronchiectasis who were prescribed beta-lactam antibiotics in the absence of macrolide combination therapy. Because only 7% of bacterial pathogens were nonsusceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate in our cohort, the lack of macrolide was possibly the major factor accounting for worse outcomes. Multiple studies have shown better outcomes in moderate-to-severe pneumonia with the combination of beta-lactam and macrolide, compared with beta-lactam monotherapy or combinations without a macrolide [
