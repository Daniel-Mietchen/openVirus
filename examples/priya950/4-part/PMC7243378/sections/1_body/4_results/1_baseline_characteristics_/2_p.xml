<p>The aetiologic type of pneumonia varied by age group (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Younger patients had the highest incidence of bacterial pneumonia, predominantly due to higher incidence of 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>. Patients 75 years or older were less likely to have a pathogen identified. The different types of pneumonia were not associated with disease severity.
