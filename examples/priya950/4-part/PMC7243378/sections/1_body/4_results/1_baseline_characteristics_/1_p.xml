<p>From February 2017 to July 2018, 1315 patients were screened for eligibility, and 258 patients were enrolled (

 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> [12%], 
 <italic>Hemophilus influenzae</italic> [7%], and 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> [1%], and 23 (9%) had polymicrobial pneumonia. Among those with a viral pathogen identified (N = 73), 20 (27%) had a bacterial copathogen (
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> 13, 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> 6, and 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> 1). Bacterial pathogens in 93% of patients with bacterial pneumonia (excluding atypical pathogens) were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.
