<p>The median (IQR) length of stay in hospital was 7 (3–13) days. Length of stay ≥7 days was associated with older age groups, male sex, underlying chronic illnesses, absence of pathogen identified, more severe disease, as well as nonadherent empirical antibiotics and use of corticosteroid (

After adjustment for age, underlying chronic illness, and disease severity, length of stay ≥7 days was independently associated with nonadherent empirical antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–5.06) and the absence of pathogen identified (adjusted odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.79) (
