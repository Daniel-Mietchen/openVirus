<p id="Par41">We developed a new CHIKV E1-antigen rapid diagnostic test with improved sensitivity (compared to the previous version) to the Asian and WA genotypes of CHIKV. Although the revised RDT needs to be validated against larger panels of sera with varying CHIKV genotypes, the new RDT holds a promise for use in endemic areas for ECSA-genotype CHIKV encoding a 6â€‰K-E1 protein with an E350 residue, viruses that are currently spreading from South Asia to South East Asia [
