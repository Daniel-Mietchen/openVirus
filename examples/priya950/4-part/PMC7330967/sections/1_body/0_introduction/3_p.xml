<p id="Par19">We previously showed that CK47, one of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in the RDT described by Okabayashi et al., has a limited ability to recognize the Asian-genotype E1 protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Notably, the Asian-genotype CHIKV encodes an aspartic acid (D) at residue 284 of the predicted E1 protein (residue 350 of the 6â€‰K-E1 polyprotein), a position that is encoded as a glutamic acid (E) in the predicted E1 proteins of certain ECSA-genotype CHIKVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This polymorphism critically affected the utility of that diagnostic tool across the various CHIKV genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of the IC RDT, we obtained several anti-CHIKV MAbs targeting the E1 and capsid (CA) proteins of CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These MAbs were shown to exhibit broad reactivity towards all genotypes of CHIKV, and some of these MAbs lacked cross-reactivity to other alphaviruses, including eastern, western, and Venezuela equine encephalitis viruses. Here, we report the development and evaluation of an improved CHIKV antigen-detection diagnostic test that incorporates these new MAbs.
