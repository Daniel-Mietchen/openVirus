<p id="Par25">The production of the CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was performed as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, the process employed three essential plasmids: a pCAGGS MSII derivative that harbors a DNA cassette encoding the Asian-genotype CHIKV E3-E2-6K-E1 polyprotein corresponding to the CK12–686 strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; pLenti CMV Puro LUC (w168–1), which carries a reporter gene encoding firefly luciferase (Addgene, Cambridge, MA); and psPAX2, a lentivirus packaging vector. All three plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells using polyethelenimine (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium after 6 h; the spent medium then was collected at 48 h after transfection. The titer of lentivector was determined using the RETROtek HIV-1 p24 Antigen-ELISA kit (Zeptometrix; Buffalo, NY), according to manufacturer’s instructions. For production of WA- and ECSA-genotype E1s, we used pCAGGS MSII derivatives encoding (respectively) the E3-E2-6K-E1 sequence of WA-genotype strain 37,997 or a chimeric E3-E2-6K-E1 sequence composed of sequences from strain 379,971 E3-E2 and strain CP10 6 K-E1.
