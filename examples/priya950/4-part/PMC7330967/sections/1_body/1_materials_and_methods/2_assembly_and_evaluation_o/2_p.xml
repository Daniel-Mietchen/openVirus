<p id="Par22">Thirty microliters of serially diluted culture supernatant containing CHIKV or CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector at various concentrations were mixed with 60 μL IC RDT extraction buffer in a tube. The IC dipstick then was inserted into the tube of diluted supernatant to start the reaction. After 15 min, the appearance of the control and test lines was assessed. An IC Reader also was used to quantitate the intensities of the test lines; values were expressed as milli-absorbance units (mAbs).</p>
