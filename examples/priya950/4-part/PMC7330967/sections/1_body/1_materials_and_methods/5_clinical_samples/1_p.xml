<p id="Par26">The Asian-genotype CHIKV serum panel was obtained for evaluation of the 2nd-generation version-B RDT from CHIKV-specific RT-PCR-positive (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26) and -negative (
 <italic>n</italic> = 54) samples of patients who had presented with febrile illness during the 2014–15 CHIKV epidemic in Aruba. These sera had been collected at 3–10 days (median 7 days) after the onset of symptoms. Median Ct value (and its interquartile range, IQR) of RT-PCR-positive samples were 35.29 (34.22–35.50). Forty samples were shown to be anti-CHIKV IgM- or IgG-positive by testing in Aruba using the Anti-Chikungunya Virus IgM/IgG IIFT assay (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). Among this sample subset, 34 were anti-CHIKV IgM-positive and 31 were IgG-positive (25 were both anti-CHIKV IgM- and IgG-positive). Samples then were stored at − 80 °C until shipped on dry ice to Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp (ITM), where CHIKV-specific RT-PCR testing was performed [
