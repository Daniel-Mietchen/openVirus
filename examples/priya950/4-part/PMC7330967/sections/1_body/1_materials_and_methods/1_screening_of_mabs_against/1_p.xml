<p id="Par20">To select anti-E1 MAbs suitable for use in an IC RDT, we screened 7 anti-E1 MAbs (3D11, 9E3, 11E11, 13H11, 15B2, 19B8, and RC-5) generated previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] by adsorbing each anti-E1 MAbs onto nitrocellulose membranes. Six of these MAbs (excepting 15B2) were conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs); 15B2 was excluded because that MAb is isotype IgG2b [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which is difficult to conjugate with AuNPs (unpublished observations). All combinations of anti-E1 MAbs were tested by placing dipsticks in microcentrifuge tubes or the wells of a 96-well plate containing (per tube or well) 60 μL of extraction buffer and 30 μL of formaldehyde-inactivated culture supernatant of CHIKV S27-infected Vero cells. After 15 min, a C10066–10 IC Reader (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) was used to quantitate the intensities of the signals, and results were expressed as signal/background (the intensities of the signals without CHIKV antigens) ratios. This procedure was repeated another three times using recombinant CHIKV E1 protein (Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd., Dublin, Ireland), culture supernatant from Vero cells infected with Sendai virus expressing Asian CHIKV CK12 6 K-E1protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and culture supernatant of CHIKV CP10-infected Vero cells. In the case of anti-CA MAbs, all five MAbs (24B3, 26A2, 32A3, 37C7, and 41G5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] were able to be conjugated with AuNP and evaluated by the procedure described for anti-E1 MAbs using culture supernatant of CHIKV CP10-infected Vero cells as the antigen.
