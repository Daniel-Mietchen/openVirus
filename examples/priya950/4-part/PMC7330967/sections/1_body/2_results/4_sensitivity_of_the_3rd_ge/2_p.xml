<p id="Par34">As described previously, Asian-genotype CHIKV carries an aspartic acid (D) at position 350 of the 6 K-E1 protein, whereas certain ECSA-genotype CHIKVs carry a glutamic acid (E) at the corresponding position; this substitution is responsible for the decreased sensitivity of RDT version A for Asian-genotype CHIKVs [
