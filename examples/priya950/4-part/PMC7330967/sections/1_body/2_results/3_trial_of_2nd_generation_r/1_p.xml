<p id="Par31">An Asian-genotype CHIKV outbreak occurred on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2014–2015. We previously evaluated the version-A RDT using Aruban clinical samples of Asian-genotype CHIKV and found low sensitivity (33.3%) for these specimens [

We performed an evaluation of the sensitivity of our the new generation of the RDT with 80 samples (40 anti-CHIKV IgM- and IgG-negative, 40 anti-CHIKV IgM- or IgG-positive). Individual data for the Aruba island patients are summarized in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Among the 80 samples, only 5 CHIKV RT-PCR-positive and IgG- and IgM-negative samples had been obtained. The 2nd-generation RDT version B detected 4 out of 5 of these samples (80, 95% confidence interval (95%-CI) 37.6–96.4), as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The sensitivity was lower in the IgG−/IgM-positive group (7 of 21 (33.3, 95%-CI 17.2–54.6)). Similarly, specificity was high (33 out of 35 (94.3, 95%-CI 81.4–98.4)) in the IgG- and IgM-negative group and lower in the IgG−/IgM-positive group (12 of 19 (63.2, 95%-CI 41.0–80.9)). The sensitivity and specificity did not change significantly in the 34 IgM-positive and 31 IgG-positive groups (Additional file
