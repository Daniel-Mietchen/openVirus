<p id="Par29">To evaluate the reactivity of these new CHIKV antigen detection RDTs, we used four dilutions of ECSA- and Asian-genotype viruses, at titers of 10^7, 10^6, 10^5, and 10^4 PFU/mL. The limit of visible detection (i.e., with naked eyes) of CHIKV protein was 15 m-absorbance units (mAbs) of color intensity as measured by an IC Reader. All rapid IC strips gave valid results, as indicated by the presence of the control lines. Quantitative measurement of the intensities of the test lines revealed that the E1 antigen-detecting RDT version B showed the best performance in detection of Asian-genotype CHIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). At higher concentrations of CHIKV, the gold-conjugated antibody in versions B and E tended to aggregate, thereby impeding quantifiability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the case of ECSA-genotype CHIKV, the previous version-A RDT exhibited the best performance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In contrast to the E1 detection RDTs, CA detection RDTs displayed similar reactivity to both CHIKV genotypes. Nevertheless, none of the CA detection RDTs was as sensitive as the E1 detection RDTs, especially at 10^5 pfu/mL of CHIKV. Furthermore, addition of anti-CA antibodies to an E1 detection RDT failed to improve the RDT sensitivity (RDT version N in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We therefore decided to use E1 as the target of the IC RDT. Comparison of sensitivities between versions B and E showed that gold-conjugated antibodies in version E yielded more aggregates at 10^7 pfu/mL of CHIKV, especially against Asian-genotype viruses. We therefore decided to stop further development of RDT version E.
