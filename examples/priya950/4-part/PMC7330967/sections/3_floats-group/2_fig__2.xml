  <p>RDT reaction to pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing CHIKV envelope proteins. Pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing CHIKV envelope proteins from ECSA-genotype strain CP10, Asian-genotype strain CK12–686 and WA-genotype strain 37,997 were prepared at three concentrations of HIV-1 capsid protein (210, 70, and 7 ng/mL). Blue circles and orange squares indicate version-A and -B RDT measurements, respectively. The y-axis indicates the intensity of the test line (milli-absorbance units; mAbs)</p>
