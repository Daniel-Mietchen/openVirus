  <p>RDT reactions to Asian-genotype CHIKV strains ARUBA-15801654 and ARUBA-15801125, and to ECSA-genotype strain CP10. ARUBA-15801654 (ARUBA1654) and ARUBA-15801125 (ARUBA1125) were propagated in C6/36 and CP10 was propagated in Vero cells. The x-axis denotes viral titer in plaque forming units (PFU) /mL. Blue diamonds, orange squares, gray triangles, and Xs indicate version-A, −B, −C, and -D RDT measurements, respectively. The y-axis indicates the intensity of the test line (milli-absorbance units; mAbs)</p>
