  <p>RDT reaction to pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing CHIKV envelope proteins with substitutions at residue 350. Pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing CHIKV envelope proteins from ECSA-genotype strain CP10, Asian-genotype strain CK12–686, WA-genotype strain 37,997, or mutant envelope proteins encoding glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid (CP10) or aspartic acid-to-glutamic acid (CK12–686 and 37,997) substitutions at residue 350 of the 6 K-E1 polyprotein were prepared at three concentrations of HIV-1 capsid protein (150, 30, and 6 ng/mL). Blue circles and red diamonds indicate version-A and -O RDT measurements, respectively. The y-axis indicates the intensity of the test line (milli-absorbance units; mAbs)</p>
