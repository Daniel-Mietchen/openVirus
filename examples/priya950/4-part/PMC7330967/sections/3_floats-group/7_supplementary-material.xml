    <bold>Additional file 1.</bold> Selection of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for CHIKV detection rapid diagnostic test. (A) Means and standard deviations of signal/background ratios for selection of MAbs against E1 protein. AuNPs column indicates MAb conjugated with AuNPs and membrane column indicates MAb adsorbed onto nitrocellulose membrane. Green: Signal/background ratio was lower than 1.0 (strong non-specific reaction or no signal). Orange: Signal/background ratio was between 1.0 and 2.0 (faint). Red: Signal/background ratio was higher than 2.0 (strong positive). Yellow: Signal/background ratio was higher than 2.0 but standard deviation was high. (B) Means of signal/background ratios for selection of MAbs against capsid protein. AuNPs column indicates MAb conjugated with AuNPs and membrane column indicates MAb adsorbed onto nitrocellulose membrane. Green: Signal/background ratio was lower than 1.0 (strong non-specific reaction or no signal). Orange: Signal/background ratio was between 1.0 and 2.0 (faint). Red: Signal/background ratio was higher than 2.0 (strong positive)
