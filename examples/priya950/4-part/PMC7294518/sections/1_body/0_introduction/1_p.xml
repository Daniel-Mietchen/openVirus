<p id="Par2">The Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus inside the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Unlike the ubiquitous dengue virus (DENV), which occurs as four distinct serotypes globally, ZIKV represents only a single serotype to which both the African and the Asian lineages of ZIKV belong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ZIKV genome encompasses about 10.7 kb containing two non-coding regions (5′- and 3′-UTR) and a single open reading frame that encodes for a polyprotein subsequently cleaved into three structural (core, envelope and membrane precursor) and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Virologic diagnosis usually requires both molecular detection and serologic detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, since viremia is usually low and transient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ZIKV serologic diagnosis is mostly based on antibodies against two viral proteins, envelope and NS1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The envelope protein has critical roles in the assembly of virions and cell entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and NS1 is a non-structural glycoprotein that plays a putative role in viral replication, and when secreted modulates viral immune invasion and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The NS1 of flaviviruses contains more highly diversified epitopes than the envelope protein, therefore its wide use in flavivirus serologic tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].
