<p>The RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler Array data was further analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to decipher the role of the differentially expressed genes in the cellular response to IAV infection. The analysis suggests that the knockdown of NLRC5 during IAV infection enhances the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway. In particular, seven genes that were upregulated in the absence of NLRC5 during infection were identified by this analysis as playing a direct or indirect role in the upregulation of the NFκB signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, the increase in IL-2 directly upregulates NFκB signaling, while the enhancement of CASP-1 or TLR5 can indirectly upregulate the pathway through IL-6. While there are limitations involved in obtaining monoclonal antibodies for chicken NFκB proteins, further studies are required to provide concrete phosphorylation evidence to determine the effect of NLRC5 on NFκB signaling pathway.
