<p>Macrophages act as the first line of defense following infection and are known to be susceptible to infection by both LPAIVs and HPAIVs. Besides, excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production is a major pathogenicity factor during HPAIV infection in chicken, and macrophages are the major contributors of cytokines during viral infection (Kuribayashi et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To determine whether IAV infection influences the regulation of NLRC5, we used chicken macrophage MQ-NCSU cells for these studies. MQ-NCSU cells were infected with three different subtypes: LPAIV H7N2, LPAIV H5N2, or HPAIV H5N1. In both LPAIV infections, NLRC5 was upregulated. At 24 hpi, infection with LPAIV H7N2 caused a significant increase in NLRC5 mRNA expression relative to the housekeeping gene HMBS from 0.40 ± 0.057 times in mock-infected cells to 8.86 ±0.499 times in LPAIV-infected cells (

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9515, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0127, two-tailed). This increase in NLRC5 mRNA was also seen in CEF cells infected with H5N2, albeit lower than observed in the macrophages (
