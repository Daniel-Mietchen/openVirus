<p>NLRs play a key role in immune responses, however their role during IAV infection in the chicken remains unexplored. To determine if members of this family are upregulated during IAV infection, microarray analysis was performed in primary chicken lung cells after infection with classical or Eurasian lineage H5N1 HPAIVs, H2N3 LPAIV, or sterile PBS. NLRC5 was observed to be upregulated in each of the AIV infections compared with the PBS mock infection control (
