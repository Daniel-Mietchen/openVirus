<p>To confirm the role of NLRC5 in AIV replication, siRNA mediated NLRC5 knockdown (KD) was carried out in chicken macrophages. At 32 hpt, the NLRC5 levels were found to be approximately 50% lower in siRNA-treated cells as compared to the control transfection (

NLRC5 KD cells showed significant reduction in virus replication compared to the wild type (scramble control) cells in both the H5N2 and H5N1 infections albeit to a greater level in the low pathogenicity H5N2 infection (
