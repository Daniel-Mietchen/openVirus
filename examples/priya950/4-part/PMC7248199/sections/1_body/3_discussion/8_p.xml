<p>In summary, our findings strongly suggest that NLRC5 is a negative regulator of NFκB pathway and a pro-viral factor of IAV infection in chicken, possibly involved in activation of inflammasome complexes. Further studies are warranted to identify viral factors responsible for upregulation of NLRC5 and define protein-protein interactions in the chicken which may lead to direct regulation of virus production and effect NFκB pathway regulators.</p>
