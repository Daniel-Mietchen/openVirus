<p>The role of NLR family members as innate immune sensors and pathogen recognition receptors has started to surface in last few years. In particular, NLRC5 is biologically conserved in the immune tissues as well as in lung and intestines, where the host often has initial contact with pathogens (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), suggesting a role in innate immunity. Further, NLRC5 is highly expressed in monocyte/macrophage cell lineages (Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), which are central drivers of the host innate immune response and have a well-defined role during invasion by viral pathogens. It is also known that NLRC5 is activated during several viral infections in different cell types including Raus sarcoma virus-infected A549 cells (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), cytomegalovirus-infected HFF cells (Kuenzel et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Sendai virus-infected HeLa cells (Neerincx et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To date, there have been few reports on the role of NLRC5 in IAV infection, for example it has been shown that NLRC5 is upregulated in HPAIV infected chicken by 2.9-folds (Ranaware et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most previous NLRC5 work has been limited to human and mouse cell-based infection systems (Benko et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ranjan et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Despite this, currently available data across hosts and stimuli suggest that NLRC5 can act as both positive and negative regulator of the inflammatory immune response. In the current study, we observed a number of effects on IAV replication and host immune function in chicken macrophage, which highlight NLRC5 as a cellular pro-viral factor and moderator of cytokine expression.
