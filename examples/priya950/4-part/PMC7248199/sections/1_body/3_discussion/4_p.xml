<p>NLRC5 also has the potential to serve as a pro-viral factor during AIV infection by modulating the immune response. NLRC5 has been implicated in the regulation of IFN-dependent gene transcription where its knockdown impaired the release of IP10, IFN-β and CCL5 and diminished secretion of IFN-α (Neerincx et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) suggesting NLRC5 can enhance the pro-inflammatory response. However, in addition to its role as a positive regulator of antiviral cytokines, it is also reported as a negative regulator of NFκB (Benko et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) which is a hallmark for most virus infections and gatekeeper to several key actors in the innate immune response (Santoro et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While AIV infection in the wild-type macrophage suppresses the expression of NFκB pathway modulators, this suppression was reversed when NLRC5 expression was decreased (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). The RT
 <sup>2</sup> profiler array analysis of the change in innate immune gene expression in AIV-infected NLRC5 KD revealed activation of the NFκB pathway based on the upregulation of several key pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-2, IL-6, CCL5, IL-5, STAT3, and IFN-ν (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This observation indicates a possibility of NLRC5 being a NFκB inhibitor in chicken macrophages. Further protein-based experiments are warranted to confirm this observation. This is in line with previous studies in the mouse model which have consistently shown activation of the NFκB pathway in the absence or suppression of NLRC5 expression. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from NLRC5
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice showed activation of NFκB and NFκB-dependent cytokine IL-6 after IAV infection (Lupfer et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and shRNA-mediated knockdown of NLRC5 murine macrophages have shown induction of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β (Benko et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As in murine models, our data suggests a possibility that the upregulation of NLRC5 in chicken macrophages dampens the NFκB signaling pathway which could dampen the secretion of the antiviral cytokines. These results indicate a possibility that, through modulation of the NFκB pathway, NLRC5 expression results in the establishment of a pro-viral state in the cells, leading to an increase in virus replication. Further protein-based experiments are warranted to fully uncover the mechanistic details of this observation.
