<p>It has been shown that NLRC5 competes with NEMO for binding to IKKa/IKKb in 293T cells and blocks IKK phosphorylation, thus inhibiting NFκB activation (Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While such mechanistic insights are yet to be confirmed in chickens, our data suggest there may be a similar protein-protein interaction taking place, leading to inhibition of the NFκB signaling pathway. Viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit NFκB activation by interfering with most steps of NFκB signaling pathway (Mulhern et al.,
