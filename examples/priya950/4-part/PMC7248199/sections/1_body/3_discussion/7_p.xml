<p>In addition to enhancing activation of NFκB pathway, IAV infection in NLRC5 KD cells resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), the two key cytokines involved in inflammasome formation. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of the inflammasome in antiviral defense (Allen et al.,

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It is currently thought that NLRC5 acts cooperatively with NLRP3 to activate the inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to stimuli (Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yao et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pontigo et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Further, overexpression of NLRC5 was shown to upregulate IL-1β in human hepatic stellate cells (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While it is not clear whether inflammasome activation also takes place in chickens, our data raises a strong possibility that chicken NLRC5 could be involved in the activation of inflammasome or a related response in chicken cells.
