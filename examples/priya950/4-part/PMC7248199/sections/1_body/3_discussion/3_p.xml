<p>In addition, we observed a strong positive correlation between the upregulation of NLRC5 and increasing AIV titers, a phenomenon also observed in human cell lines (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that NLRC5 activation leads to a more productive infection across species. Moreover, we did not observe an increase in virus replication over time in the A549 cell line where NLRC5 was not upregulated (data not shown). This was confirmed by knockdown experiments where, in the presence of decreased NLRC5, we observed decreased intracellular viral RNA and extracellular AIV (
