<p>All infection assays were performed in 6-well plates at a seeding density of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well and a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and washed with PBS. Serum-free medium (UltraCULTURE™; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with 1 μg/ml of TPCK-trypsin and containing the desired amount of IAV was added to each well and pre-incubated for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were then rinsed with PBS, and fresh supplemented media was added. Cells and supernatant were harvested at various time intervals and used in the previously described assays for virus quantification and relative host gene quantification, respectively. Three biological replicates were performed for each condition. The time course infections (4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hpi) were performed with LPAIV H5N2. The 24 hpi timepoint showed the most significant difference in NLRC5 mRNA expression. The future experiment with LPAIV H7N2 were carried out at 24 hpi. The HPAIV H5N1 experiments were performed in BSL3 laboratory to obtain the data for 24 hpi timepoint and a “late” 48 hpi timepoint as well.
