<p>Primary cell cultures were prepared in house using lungs of 4 wk old broiler chickens. Fine lung pieces were trypsin-digested overnight at 4°C. Large undigested tissue pieces were removed using a cell strainer and the remaining suspension was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 5 min. The resultant cell pellet was reconstituted in small volume of cell culture medium. Primary chicken lung cells were infected with A/mallard/duck/England/7277/06 (H2N3) LPAIV, A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1) HPAIV, or A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1) HPAIV. Mock infections were performed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was collected at 24 hpi, and microarray analysis was performed to evaluate the global gene expression as previously described (Kuchipudi et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Microarray datasets are available on the gene expression omnibus (GEO) site under accession number 
 <italic>GSE33389</italic>. Gene expression analysis was carried out using R build 3.3.1 [Bioconductor (V3.4)]. The core Bioconductor algorithms, including necessary library packages essential for the analysis of raw transcriptomic data, were installed locally before execution. The data analytical command line scripts were run through R studio (1.1.383), an integrated development environment interface for R. The Robust Multichip Averaging probe summarization algorithm described previously (Irizarry et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>) allowed for background correction and normalization of the data. Comprehensive annotation of normalized data yielded log expression values of over 33,000 transcripts, which were transferred to a spreadsheet for further grouping and selection of genes. Expression log values (duplicates) of pre-identified genes (selected based on peer-reviewed publications (Hers et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ehrlich et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) as well as commercial assay kits) were then plotted in Prism 7 (GraphPad; San Diego, CA, USA) for visual interpretation.
