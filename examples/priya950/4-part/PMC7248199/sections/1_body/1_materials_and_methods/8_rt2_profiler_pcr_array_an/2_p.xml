<p>RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler Array data was further subjected to pathway analysis using Qiagen's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to analyze gene expression data, identify upstream regulators and plot the differentially expressed genes in relation to the signaling pathways. The RT
 <sup>2</sup> profiler PCR expression fold change data for the experimental and control samples was utilized in the IPA analysis to determine the most significantly affected pathways.
