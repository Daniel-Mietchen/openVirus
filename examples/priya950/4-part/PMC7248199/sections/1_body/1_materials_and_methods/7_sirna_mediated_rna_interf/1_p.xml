<p>The chicken macrophage MQ-NCSU cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6 well plates. A previously described NLRC5 gene specific siRNA sequence, 5′-CAUAACACUGCAGUCCUGAGGUUUA-3′ was synthesized (Life Technologies Corporation) to mediate the interference (Lian et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Stealth RNAi™ siRNA Negative Control Med GC Duplex #3 (Invitrogen) was used as a negative scramble RNA control. Cells were transfected following the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Thirty-two hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with AIV at MOI 1. Three biological replicates were used in each treatment. Cells were harvested at 32 h post transfection (hpt) and 8, 24, and 48 hpi, and the supernatant was analyzed for host gene expression and virus quantification.
