  <p>Effect of NLRC5 KD on differentially expressed immune genes during H5N2 infection. NLRC5 siRNA and scramble control transfected MQ-NCSU cells were infected with H5N2 virus. Total RNA was collected at 24 hpi and assayed by the RT
   <sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Array system. Selected genes taking part in innate and adaptive immune response are shown as log
   <sub>2</sub> transform of fold-change expression relative to the gene expression in the mock-transfected cells. Data represent an average of three biological replicates.
