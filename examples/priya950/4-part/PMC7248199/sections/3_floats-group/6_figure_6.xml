  <p>Reduced mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in IAV infected NLRC5 KD cells. MQ-NCSU cells were transfected with NLRC5 siRNA or non-specific control siRNA (scramble). The relative mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-18 was determined at 32 hpt by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to the housekeeping gene HMBS. Data represents average of three biological replicates with error bars showing standard deviation.
