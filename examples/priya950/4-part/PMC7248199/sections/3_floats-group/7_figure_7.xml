  <p>Putative pathway showing regulatory relationships of key genes to NFκB activation transcriptionally regulated by NLRC5. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed seven genes (pink fill) which were significantly upregulated after NLRC5 KD macrophages were infected with LPAIV H5N2 and are indicative of activation of the NFκB gene response. The dashed lines represent an indirect relationship, and a solid black or pink line represents a direct relationship. The solid white molecules are the intermediate factors which take part in activation of NFκB and were also observed to be upregulated.</p>
