  <p>Structure of the Influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase and host adaptive mutations in PA. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Human H3N2 polymerase structure (PDB:6RR7) [
   <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The PA subunit is colored gray, PB2 subunit is colored teal, and PB1 subunit is colored blue. Viral genome (vRNA) bound to the PB1 and PA subunits is colored red and a 5â€² 7-methylguanosine (m7G)-capped substrate bound to PB2 is colored yellow. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Detailed view of the PA endonuclease domain with host adaptive mutations is indicated in green and residues involved in endonuclease activity are indicated in blue. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Detailed view of the PA C-terminal domain with host adaptive mutations indicated in green, residues involved in binding to RNA Pol II C-terminal domain peptides in pink, and residues involved in dimerization in orange.
