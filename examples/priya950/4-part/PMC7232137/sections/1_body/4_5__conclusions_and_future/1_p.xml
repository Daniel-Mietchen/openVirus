<p>While PB2 has traditionally been viewed as the major determinant for restriction of avian vRdRp activity in mammalian cells, recent studies on the H1N1pdm09 virus and avian IAVs, such as H5N1 and H7N9, found that PA plays an important role too. It is notable that many of the observed host adaptive mutations in PA are located within the endonuclease domain, which plays a critical role in the viral life cycle during both viral mRNA transcription and PA-X shutoff activity. Other host adaptive mutations are also found in surface-exposed residues on the PA C-terminal domain, which likely alter vRdRp activity through interactions with cellular factors. Overall, the multiple contributions of single mutations across various regions of PA to enhance vRdRp activity, replication, and pathogenicity in mammalian cells suggest that multiple mechanisms likely exist to modulate host adaptation. In addition to PA, the PA-X protein which is expressed from the PA gene segment has a significant impact on host gene expression and viral pathogenicity. Interestingly, PA-X proteins derived from avian IAVs appear to have greater host shutoff activity than PA-X proteins from human IAVs. The ability of PA-X to inhibit innate immune responses, such as cytokine and interferon production, is an important factor in regulating IAV virulence to facilitate efficient transmission and maintenance of the virus in the human population. Thus, the data support that there is likely modulation of PA-X activity as well during host adaptation of avian IAVs to humans and may prove crucial for the emergence of human IAVs. These facts clearly highlight the importance of PA gene products in host adaptation and clinical outcomes. In conclusion, host adaptive mutations in PA that regulate vRdRp activity and fine-tuning of PA-X activity may prove to be important factors in the emergence of new seasonal and/or pandemic IAVs. Further mechanistic studies are essential to understand how we may control and prepare for future IAV outbreaks as well as develop effective vaccines. In addition, continuing surveillance of avian IAVs, such as the H5N1 and H7N9 strains that have the capacity to infect humans, is crucial in order to screen for and identify novel host adaptive mutations. </p>
