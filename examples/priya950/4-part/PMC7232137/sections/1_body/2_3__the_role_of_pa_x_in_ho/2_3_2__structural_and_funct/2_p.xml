<p>Apart from the differences in overall length of the X-ORF, questions arose about the existence of functional domains within the X-ORF. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of the first 15 amino acids of the X-ORF in regulating overall PA-X shutoff activity. Truncated PA-X constructs containing only the first 15 amino acids from the X-ORF display shutoff activity similar to full-length PA-X containing either the 41 or 61 amino acid X-ORF. Furthermore, loss of all X-ORF residues significantly inactivates PA-X shutoff activity, showing the critical role that these first 15 X-ORF residues play in host shutoff [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Although it has been shown that host RNA transcription is not required for RNA degradation by PA-X, mutations that decrease or prevent nuclear localization of PA-X greatly reduce shutoff activity [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Despite the dual localization of PA-X, the reduced functionality when excluded from the nucleus suggests a significant portion of its activity is derived through its nuclear localization. Furthermore, re-localization of a truncated PA-X lacking the X-ORF to the nucleus by addition of an exogenous SV40 nuclear localization signal can partially restore shutoff activity. However, the failure to restore full shutoff activity suggests that the first 15 amino acids of the X-ORF play a role in both nuclear localization and functionality [
