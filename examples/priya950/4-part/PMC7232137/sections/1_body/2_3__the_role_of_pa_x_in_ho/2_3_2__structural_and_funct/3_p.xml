<p>Various groups have also determined the role of the shared N-terminal domain in regulating PA-X activity. As previously mentioned, key residues in the endonuclease active site are essential for PA-X activity as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00365-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Apart from these residues in the catalytic site, reporter gene assays have been used to identify critical residues for PA-X activity. An initial study using chimeric PA-X proteins constructed from highly active PA-X (A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)) and weakly active PA-X (A/WSN/33 (H1N1)) showed that multiple residues within the N-terminal domain affect PA-X shutoff activity [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Recently, a similar approach using PA-X derived from the same two strains identified two key residues at 28 and 65 that affect PA-X shutoff activity significantly [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The importance of these residues was confirmed in other viral strains including A/Yokohama/UT2017/2003 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/HN31604/2009 (H5N1), and A/Anui/1/2013 (H7N9) [

These data also suggest that specific residues regulate overall PA-X shutoff activity in a species-specific manner, as P28 and S65 correlate to stronger PA-X activity and are predominantly found in avian origin IAVs. In the context of the overall structure of PA-X, residues 28 (located in helix alpha 4) and 65 (located in the flexible loop region) are far from the endonuclease active site. However, mutations in residue 65 have previously been characterized to change the conformation of the flexible loop region [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that PA-X adjusts its shutoff activity through mutations at residues far from the endonuclease active site and may play a role in modulating interactions with cellular factors.
