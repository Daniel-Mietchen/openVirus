<p>In addition to mutations that enhance vRdRp activity, the modulation of host gene expression, especially related to the innate and acquired immune responses, is critical for the success of IAV infection and host adaptation. There is an obvious interest in the role PA-X plays in IAV virulence and pathogenesis because of the impact of host cytokine responses and inflammation on viral pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Studies using PA-X frame shift mutant viruses that express limited amounts of PA-X in avian origin H5N1 or H1N1pdm09 viruses have shown that PA-X downregulates interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines that are produced early in infection [

 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Additionally, reduced expression of PA-X in the 1918 H1N1 and H1N1pdm09 viruses increased pathogenicity in a mouse model [

 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. This phenomenon is also supported by experiments utilizing avian H5N1 strains, where loss of PA-X expression increased IAV virulence in mice, chickens, and ducks [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Similar results were observed for swine origin viruses, where expression of PA-X was shown to decrease virulence in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Overall these studies suggest that expression of PA-X decreases viral pathogenicity, highlighting the impact of host immune-induced pathology during IAV infection [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Conversely, a study using avian H9N2 virus reported that loss of PA-X expression results in decreased virulence in mice [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. While this study disagrees on the effect PA-X has on pathogenicity in vivo, there is nevertheless a clear role for PA-X in the downregulation of host immune responses during infections in both mammalian and avian hosts. As previously discussed, it has been shown that the strength of PA-X shutoff activity varies greatly between avian and mammalian IAVs raising the possibility that variations in PA-Xâ€™s effect on pathogenicity may correlate with its shutoff activities [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Furthermore, functional interplay and coordination between PA-X and NS1 also likely affect overall viral pathogenicity and replication in vivo [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The multi-functionality of NS1 as well as the varied activity of PA-X could correspond to differences in host species, with NS1 and PA-X activity fluctuating based on the presence of species-specific cellular factors. Transcriptomic analysis of infected cells from our lab found that shutoff active NS1 specifically targets cellular mRNAs related to IFN signaling pathways and cytokine release, while PA-X broadly targets cellular mRNAs [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. These differences in targeted genes also likely affect the overall pathogenicity and replication of IAVs in distinct host species.
