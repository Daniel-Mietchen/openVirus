<p>The first described host shutoff factor of IAV was the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which has multiple functions [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. NS1 is perhaps best known for its role in antagonizing cellular interferon (IFN) responses by blocking retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) activation and preventing nuclear localization of transcription factors that regulate expression of anti-viral proteins [

 <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. NS1 from human IAVs also suppresses host protein synthesis by preventing maturation of host transcripts [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In this context, NS1 has been shown to bind the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30), a 30 kDa subunit of the CPSF complex which is involved in the cleavage and maturation of the 3â€™ signaling region of newly synthesized cellular pre-mRNAs [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Crystal structures have shown that two NS1 molecules and two CPSF30 molecules form a complex and NS1 residues F103, M106, K108, D125, and D189 play a critical role in the interaction with CPSF30 [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Typically, these key NS1 residues are highly conserved amongst human IAVs. Interestingly, NS1 from the H1N1pdm09 virus has mutations in several of these conserved residues (K108R, D125E, and D189G), and therefore is inactive and unable to induce general host shutoff by blocking pre-mRNA maturation [
