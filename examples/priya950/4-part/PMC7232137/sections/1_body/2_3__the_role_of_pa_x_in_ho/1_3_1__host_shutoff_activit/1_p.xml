<p>IAV has multiple mechanisms that target host gene expression profiles such as RNA synthesis, stability, and translation [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The culmination of these targeted mechanisms results in an overall reduction of host mRNA levels which is matched by decreased host protein translation [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This process, termed “host shutoff”, is a classical strategy utilized by many viruses [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Early studies have shown that IAV most significantly achieves host shutoff through the degradation of host mRNAs [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This degradation of host mRNAs was thought to be a byproduct of the cap-snatching process since the first identified targets of cap-snatching were host mRNAs and it was not until very recently that other capped RNAs were discovered to also be cap-snatched [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While cleavage of the 5′ cap from host RNAs leaves them more susceptible to degradation, IAV has more specific mechanisms for targeting host mRNAs.
