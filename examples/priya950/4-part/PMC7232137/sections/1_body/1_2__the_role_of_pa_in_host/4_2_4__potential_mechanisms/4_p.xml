<p>Another possible mechanism of how host adaptive mutations in PA affect vRdRp activity has to do with the interaction between PA and RNA pol II. Crystal structures show that two binding pockets on the C-terminal domain of PA are positively charged to allow for the specificity of the vRdRp binding to the Ser5 phosphorylated form of RNA pol II [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This Ser5 phosphorylation on the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II is critical because it regulates the capping of nascent host RNAs; as transcription proceeds, Ser5 is gradually dephosphorylated while the transcript elongates [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The key residues in these two binding pockets on PA (S289, R454, K635, and R638) are highly conserved amongst different IAVs, but there are multiple host adaptive mutations around these sites as shown in

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most interesting is the host adaptive mutation T552S in PA; in avian IAVs T552 is prominent while S552 is highly conserved in human adapted IAVs [

The crystal structure of H17N10 bat IAV polymerase in complex with an RNA pol II mimetic peptide shows that residue 547 (corresponds to residue 552 in human and avian IAVs) is located within the second binding pocket and very close to RNA pol II CTD residues [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While it has yet to be experimentally verified, it will be interesting if interactions with the RNA pol II C-terminal domain affect host specificity of the vRdRp [
