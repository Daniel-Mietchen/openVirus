<p>Detailed deep sequencing analyses of IAV mRNAs found that cap-snatching most likely does not target specific RNAs but rather occurs based on the basal rate of host RNA transcription by RNA Pol II. Non-coding RNAs such as the U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs have high rates of transcription and as such appear as some of the most frequently cap-snatched transcripts [

The median length for cap-snatched primers is 11 or 12 nucleotides depending on the influenza vRNA template, and the endonuclease activity of PA preferentially cleaves after a 3′ G. Deep sequencing the cap-snatched primers from influenza mRNAs also provided definitive evidence for a mechanism to rescue suboptimal capped primers that are snatched by the vRdRp [

While the median length of cap-snatched primers that are attached to an influenza mRNA is 11 or 12 nucleotides, not all primers that are snatched are initially the appropriate length. About 15–20% of primers which are snatched from host RNAs go through a process termed prime and realignment (PAR), which is most likely related to the primer size when it is snatched [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. After a primer is snatched, it can be further processed by the vRdRp in which additional nucleotides are added to the 3′ end of the primer. It is assumed that these additional nucleotides are added because the original primer was not of sufficient length or complementarity for the viral RNA template. For IAVs, the length of the primer inversely correlates with the probability of PAR occurring, with primers shorter than nine nucleotides undergoing PAR at a rate of 73.6% [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Due to the structural relationship between the PA endonuclease domain, the PB1 catalytic site, the RNA pol II C-terminal domain binding pocket, and the PB2 cap-binding domain, it is very likely that mutations in the vRdRp affect host–protein interactions involved in the cap-snatching process.
