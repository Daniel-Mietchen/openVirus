<p>Despite being able to identify a significant number of mutations in PA that contribute to the host adaptation of IAV, the mechanism(s) by which these mutations modulate viral replication and transcription in mammalian hosts are largely unknown. So far, no cellular factors have been identified that determine host specificity through their interactions with PA. However, there are a number of host proteins reported to interact with PA in addition to RNA Pol II. Several large proteomics studies were carried out by various investigators to identify the IAV interactome [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. While these studies identified hundreds of potential host proteins that interact with PA, very few of these were independently verified. Additionally, the varied conditions under which these proteomics experiments were carried out complicates matters, as very few observed interactions between PA and host proteins overlap between these studies. Despite this, there is a handful of proteins individually verified to interact with PA including HAX1, CLE, and UBA52. HAX1 is suggested to be involved in the nuclear translocation of PA which is interesting because previous reports have shown that despite PA having two likely nuclear localization sequences in its N-terminus, it is not efficiently imported into the nucleus by itself. Reportedly, HAX1 binds PA and occludes the nuclear localization signals, but the presence of PB1 reduces HAX1 binding to PA, allowing the PA-PB1 heterodimer to be imported into the nucleus [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. CLE was also detected in purified IAV virions where it may be bound to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is unclear whether the presence of host adaptive mutations in PA modulates its interaction with any of these host factors.
