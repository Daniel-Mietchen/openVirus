<p>Many of the identified host adaptive mutations in PA are located within the N-terminus, which contains the endonuclease domain, thus raising the possibility that cap-snatching is affected by these mutations and plays an important role in host adaptation. Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have now provided more information than ever before on the cap-snatching process. Several studies have analyzed the host-derived cap-snatched sequences on the 5â€² UTR of IAV mRNAs to determine the specificity of target host RNAs for IAV cap-snatching [
