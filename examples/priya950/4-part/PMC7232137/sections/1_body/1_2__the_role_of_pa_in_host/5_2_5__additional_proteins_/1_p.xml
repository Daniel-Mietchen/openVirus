<p>Apart from PA, three additional proteins are expressed from the PA gene segment. PA-N182 and PA-N155, which were discovered in 2013, arise from translation initiation at the 11th and 13th internal start codons, respectively [

Little is known about their function or role in the viral life cycle, however the start codons for PA-N182 and PA-N155 are highly conserved amongst different strains of IAV. While loss of these proteins appears to have no effect on overall vRdR activity, as determined by reporter gene assays, a study showed that loss of PA-N155 affects viral replication and pathogenicity in a mouse model [
