<p>In contrast, the accessory protein PA-X is much better characterized due to its major function in virus-induced host shutoff activity. PA-X was discovered to be expressed from PA mRNA by a ribosomal frameshifting event in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. During translation ribosomes stall at a U-rich stretch in the PA mRNA following a slow-to-decode codon and a small fraction of ribosomes skip forward one nucleotide [

This rare +1 ribosomal frameshift event is estimated to occur for less than 2% of translation events and results in translation of the novel protein PA-X that shares the first 191 amino acids with PA while acquiring a unique C-terminus consisting of either 41 or 61 amino acids [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The length of this unique PA-X C-terminus can vary depending on the strain and is commonly referred to as the X open reading frame (X-ORF). The frameshift motif is highly conserved amongst IAVs, suggesting that PA-X is essential for the viral life cycle [
