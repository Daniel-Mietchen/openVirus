<p>As part of the vRdRp, PA helps to form the core structure of the polymerase with PB1 and PB2 [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Functional studies have also shown that the N-terminal domain of PA contains regions which are involved in binding to the vRNA/cRNA promoter [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most importantly, the endonuclease active site in PA plays an essential role in cap-snatching, which is required for viral mRNA transcription. Cap-snatching is the process by which the vRdRp acquires 5′ 7-methylguanosine (m7G) caps for viral mRNA [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has long been appreciated that viruses have very diverse ways of initiating translation by host cell machinery. These include internal ribosome entry sites which are inherent structures in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of viral mRNAs that recruit translation factors and/or ribosomes [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, many viruses take advantage of the canonical cap-dependent translation initiation process that is utilized by the host cell and is dependent on the presence of a 5′ m7G cap structure which recruits translation factors and ribosomes. Some viruses encode their own proteins which add the 5′ m7G cap structure onto viral mRNAs and others utilize cellular proteins to add the cap structure [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, IAV was the first virus discovered to steal 5′ m7G caps from nascent transcribed host RNAs [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is mediated by the vRdRp binding to cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to gain access to host RNAs which have recently been capped [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The PB2 subunit binds to the 5′ m7G cap structure and the endonuclease domain of PA cleaves the host RNA several nucleotides downstream of the 5′ cap [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This creates a short capped primer which is then inserted into the PB1 active site and used to initiate viral mRNA transcription from the vRNA genomic template [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This unique mechanism of transcription initiation means that viral mRNAs are actually chimeras of host RNAs and viral mRNA.
