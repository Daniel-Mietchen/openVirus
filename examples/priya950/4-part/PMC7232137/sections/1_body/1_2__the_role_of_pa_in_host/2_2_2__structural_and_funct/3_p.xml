<p>PA is believed to contain two areas involved in nuclear localization in the N-terminal domain [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; although PA by itself is not efficiently imported into the nucleus and instead relies on an interaction with PB1 for efficient nuclear import [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast to the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain of PA was thought to mostly be involved in interactions with PB1 to form the core structure of the vRdRp [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, several recent studies have highlighted the importance of the C-terminal domain of PA in regulating vRdRp activities. Two binding sites for the Ser5 phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA Pol II have been found to be located in the C-terminal domain of PA [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other structural data of the vRdRp have shown that there are two distinct forms: a “transcriptionally inactive” form and “transcription preinitiation” form [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A model has been suggested for the influenza C vRdRp in which binding of the RNA pol II C-terminal domain to P3 (equivalent to PA in IAV) regulates the conformational change between these two forms of the vRdRp by stabilizing the “transcription preinitiation” form [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While the mechanism for conformational regulation of the influenza A vRdRp still remains unclear, it is very likely that the binding of the RNA pol II C-terminal domain to PA plays an important role. Dimerization of the influenza A vRdRp has also been recently shown and is mediated by interactions between the C-terminal domain of PA and a small portion of the N-terminal domain of PB2 [
