<p>Within the viral polymerase complex, the PA protein is the smallest subunit at 716 amino acids in length [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The PA protein is encoded for by segment 3 of IAV and can essentially be divided into two major domains: the N-terminal domain which is approximately the first 200 amino acids and the C-terminal domain which includes amino acids 255â€“716 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These two domains are on opposite sides of the vRdRp complex and are connected by a flexible amino acid linker region. A crystal structure of the human H3N2 vRdRp and the two major domains of PA are detailed in

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent structural and biochemical studies have provided considerable new information about the vRdRp and PA. In 2009, the crystal structure of the N-terminal region of PA was solved by two independent groups [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This exciting work revealed that the N-terminal domain of PA contains an endonuclease active site motif, similar to type II restriction endonucleases [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. More recently in 2019, crystal structures of human H3N2 and avian H5N1 vRdRp were obtained [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These crystal structures show a high level of similarity to the H17N10 bat vRdRp and show dimerization of the polymerase. These studies, along with fundamental biochemical characterizations of polymerase activity have significantly enhanced our understanding of IAV host adaptation. Despite having an unknown function for many years, the multiple essential functions of PA in the vRdRp complex and viral life cycle are becoming clearer.
