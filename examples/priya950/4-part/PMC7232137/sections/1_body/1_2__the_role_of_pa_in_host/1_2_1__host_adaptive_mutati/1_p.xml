<p>PB2 was the first subunit of the vRdRp that was found to harbor species-specific mutations that significantly affect polymerase activity [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The most well-studied host adaptive mutation in PB2 is at residue 627, which is typically a glutamic acid in avian IAVs and a lysine in mammalian IAVs [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A single mutation from glutamic acid to lysine at this position is capable of significantly activating avian vRdRp in mammalian cells. The PB2 E627K mutation is considered a hallmark residue for host adaptation of avian IAVs to mammals. The precise mechanism(s) by which this polymerase mutation activates avian vRdRp activity is not known. However, the most preferred mechanism that has long been hypothesized is the involvement of one or more species-specific cellular factor(s) in viral genome replication and/or transcription [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since avian vRdRp is significantly restricted in its activity in mammalian cells, there are two possibilities for the involvement of a cellular factor. The first is that mammalian cells express antiviral restriction factors which inhibit avian vRdRp activities, thus adaptive mutations are required for escaping or overcoming the effect of the restriction factor(s). Alternatively, mammalian cells may lack a positive factor, or certain features of this factor, that is used by avian vRdRp in avian cells to ensure high polymerase activity. Interestingly, it was recently proposed that species-specific differences in the acidic nuclear phosphoproteins (ANPs), and specifically ANP 32 proteins, are involved in the restriction of avian vRdRp in mammalian cells, and the PB2 mutation, E627K, may play a role [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another well-known mammalian adaptive mutation in PB2, D701N, has been shown to regulate interaction of PB2 with cellular importin-Î± proteins [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This mutation enhances the nuclear import of PB2 by disrupting a salt-bridge, making the nuclear localization signal in PB2 more accessible to host factors [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This enhanced nuclear import of PB2 is considered to affect viral transcription and replication, which takes place in the nucleus.
