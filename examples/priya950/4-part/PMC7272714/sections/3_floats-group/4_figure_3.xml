  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes of influenza B/Yamagata isolates 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and B/Victoria isolates 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. The phylogenetic trees were generated by the maximum-likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using the MEGA X by applying default parameters. Bootstrap numbers shown at the nodes mean the percentages of 1000 replications producing the clade. The scale bar indicates the units of nucleotide substitutions per site Nucleotide sequences of the HA genes retrieved from the Influenza Research Database (

Sequences of the isolates obtained in this study are noted (▲), as well as sequences of the northern hemisphere vaccine strains of known clades as reported by WHO as reference (•). Δ2 means two amino acid deletions (177K and 178N).
