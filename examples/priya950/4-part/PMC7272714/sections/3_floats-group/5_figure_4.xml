  <p>Structural modeling of the HA mutations. The hemagglutinin structures of influenza A/H1N1 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, B/Yamagata 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and B/Victoria 
   <bold>(C)</bold> vaccine strains are presented, in which the antigenic epitopes of the protein are mapped and marked in yellow. Amino acid mutations of the isolates are either marked in pink, if not located in antigenic sites, or in red, if located in antigenic sites. The frequency was also noted.
