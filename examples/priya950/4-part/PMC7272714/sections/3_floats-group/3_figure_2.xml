  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and NA 
   <bold>(B)</bold> genes from influenza A/H1N1 viruses. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the maximum-likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using the MEGA X by applying default parameters. Bootstrap numbers shown at the nodes mean the percentages of 1000 replications producing the clade. The scale bar indicates the units of nucleotide substitutions per site. Nucleotide sequences of HA and NA genes retrieved from Influenza Research Database (
