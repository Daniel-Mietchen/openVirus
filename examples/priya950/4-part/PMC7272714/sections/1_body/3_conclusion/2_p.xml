<p>The highest incidence of influenza infection occurred among the 5â€“14-year-old children, which indicates that children and adolescents were more susceptible to influenza viruses. Outpatients accounted for more than 95% of influenza cases, which suggested that the illness was not particularly severe during this outbreak. H1N1 was the major subtype of influenza A (95.8%) and the Yamagata lineage was the major lineage of influenza B (80.8%). The outbreak of influenza viruses in Southern China in 2018 was mainly caused by Yamagata lineage, which was phylogenetically close to other influenza B strains circulating worldwide in the same timeframe.</p>
