<p>With respect to the phylogenetic, mutation, and 3D structure analysis of HA genes, the A/H1N1 vaccine strain used in 2017–2018 was antigen-specific and appeared to be effective in this season. However, the low influenza vaccination rate in China might have contributed to the emergence of H1N1 cases

 </sup>. Due to the lack of the influenza B/Yamagata vaccine during 2016–2018, the outbreak of the influenza B/Yamagata virus in 2018 might have been expected. According to our analysis, the influenza B/Yamagata vaccine strain used during the subsequent season (2018–2019) was antigen-specific for the circulating strains. An outbreak of influenza B/Yamagata infections did not occur in 2019 perhaps due to the use of the inactivated B/Yamagata vaccine. However, the HA gene of the 2018 B/Victoria isolates had accumulated mutations in several antigenic sites, which may have potentially changed the immunogenicity. Furthermore, when compared with the B/Vitoria 2018–2019 vaccine strain, more HA mutations were found in the circulating isolates, which may have reduced the protective efficacy of B/Vitoria 2018–2019 vaccine. This is an indication that the vaccine strain might not have been the best candidate vaccine for Southern China in future influenza seasons. According to the reports of the United States CDC, although the influenza vaccination rate for adults was as high as 45.3% in 2018–2019, an increase of 8.2% from the 2017–2018 influenza season, a severe influenza infection still broke out in 2019–2020, causing more than 10,000 deaths, primarily caused by influenza B/Victoria lineage (
