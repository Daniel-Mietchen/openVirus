<p>The epidemiological, phylogenetic, mutation, and 3D structural analyses presented in this study, contribute to a better understanding of circulating influenza strains by revealing critical mutations, allowing for an evaluation of vaccine efficacy, and providing a basis for the improved selection of more specific and effective influenza vaccine candidate strains. A continuing surveillance of the sequence variations of the HA genes is important for managing, controlling, and limiting future influenza outbreaks and pandemics. These surveys and characterizations of circulating influenza strains are especially important should there be emergent or re-emergent influenza viral pathogens crossing the human-animal interface.</p>
