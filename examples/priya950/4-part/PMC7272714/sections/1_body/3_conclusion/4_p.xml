<p>Previous studies demonstrated that vaccination with the live and attenuated influenza vaccine elicited lung CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and virus-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, similar in phenotype to those generated by influenza virus infection, and ultimately established lung Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) capable of providing long-term, hetero-subtypic protection to multiple, non-vaccine influenza strains. In contrast, vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine generated durable, strain-specific humoral immunity but failed to elicit T cell responses (
