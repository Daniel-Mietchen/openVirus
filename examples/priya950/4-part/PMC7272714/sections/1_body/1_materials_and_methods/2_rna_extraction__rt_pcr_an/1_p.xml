<p>Each nasal swab was eluted with 1 mL DMEM. The eluent was immediately stored at −80°C. Subsequently, 1 mL Trizol was used to extract viral RNA from the 200 μL of nasal swab eluent, and 200 μL chloroform was added immediately and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The upper aqueous layer was transferred to a tube, with 1 mL 100% isopropanol for RNA precipitation. Following centrifuge at 12,000 × g, 1 mL of 75% cold ethanol to the pellet as a wash. The RNA was eluted into 20 μL RNase-free water. This RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimerScript
 <sup>TM</sup> RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TAKARA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All primers used in this experiment are based on the “WHO protocols for molecular diagnosis of influenza virus”

 <sup>TM</sup> (TaKaRa
 <sup>TM</sup> Taq Version 2.0), under the following conditions: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; amplification in 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s/50°C for 30 s/72°C for 2 min; and final extension for 10 min at 72°C. These amplified sequences were confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing using the primers listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> as sequencing primers.
