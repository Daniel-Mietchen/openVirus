The gene reference sequences of H1N1, H3N2, and Victoria and Yamagata lineages were extracted from published sequences, using BLAST, obtained from strains that circulated worldwide in recent years, as well as China strains and northern hemisphere vaccine strains recommended by WHO and the reference strains of known clades as reported by WHO.
