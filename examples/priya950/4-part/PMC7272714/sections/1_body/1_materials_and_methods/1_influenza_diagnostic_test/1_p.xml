 </sup>. Briefly, each nasal swab was eluted with 192 μL lysis buffer and the immunochromatographic strip in the kit was inserted into the eluent and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then the results were determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The interaction between the colloidal gold conjugated antibodies and the influenza antigens will indicate red in the test line. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with the patient consent for using left-over specimens waived.
