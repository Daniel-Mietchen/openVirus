 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) was used to predict the 3D structure of the HA protein of the two northern hemisphere vaccine strains (A/Michigan/45/2015 and B/Phuket/3073/2013). SWISS-MODEL searches for related protein structure templates from the SMTL database by BLAST and HHblits were conducted to ensure accuracy and sensitivity as much as possible. The crystal structure of the B/Brisbane/60/2008 vaccine strain of the HA protein was retrieved from NCBI. The PDB ID: 4FQM. PyMOL software
