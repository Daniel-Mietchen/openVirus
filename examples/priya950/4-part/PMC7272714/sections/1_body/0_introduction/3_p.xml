 </sup>. To investigate whether this was due to the unavailability of B/Yamagata vaccine, we collected 9914 nasal swabs from patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms in Guangzhou, Southern China from January through March in 2018. Most of the patients were outpatients (88.7%). Influenza-positive samples were further subtyped by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes. The data provide a view into the molecular epidemiology of the influenza viruses circulating in the current population, which may, in turn, confirm the efficacy of the influenza vaccines administered as well as provide insights for the future development and deployment of effective subtype or lineage-specific influenza vaccines.
