<p>Influenza A virus presents as a permutation of 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) possible subtypes, with a wide range of hosts (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">White and Lowen, 2018</xref>). Influenza B virus, often neglected, has been circulating and, in some seasons, has predominated over influenza A, particularly among children (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Tewawong et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Furuse et al., 2016</xref>). Vaccines against influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 have been used effectively for more than 20 years for controlling and preventing potential pandemics. However, influenza vaccines against the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were used interchangeably. In the 2016â€“2018 seasons, the trivalent influenza vaccine did not include the B/Yamagata lineage.
