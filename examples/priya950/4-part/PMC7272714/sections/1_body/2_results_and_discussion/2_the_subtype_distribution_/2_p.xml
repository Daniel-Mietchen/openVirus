<p>The majority (80/99) of the influenza B isolates belonged to the Yamagata lineage, which was further divided into two sub-branches: One was phylogenetically close to strains circulating in China, Japan, Italy, South Korea, German, Canada, and the USA during 2016–2018 and the other was close to strains B/Georgia/7276/2018, B/Florida/31/2017, B/Idaho/03/2017, B/New Mexico/6335/2017, B/Turkey/5879/2017, and B/West Virginia/13/2017 (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Barr et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All of the B/Yamagata strains circulating during January to March and the 2018–2019 vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013) parsed into clade 3.
