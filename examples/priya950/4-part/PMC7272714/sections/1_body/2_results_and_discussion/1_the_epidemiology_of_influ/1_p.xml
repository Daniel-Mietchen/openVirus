<p>Type-specific colloidal gold test revealed that 2547 of 9914 patients (25.7%) during this outbreak were positive for influenza viruses, of which 312 (3.1%) were identified as influenza A and 2241 (22.6%) as influenza B. The dominant type circulating was influenza B (87.8%). Outpatients of influenza A and B positive accounted for 297 (95.2%) and 2141 (95.5%), respectively. Positive specimens collected during the outbreak were selected randomly (100 specimens for each month) for further subtyping by Sanger sequencing DNA sequencing of the HA and NA genes. The sequence data resulted in the typing of the influenza A strains as 23 H1N1 with one H3N2, and the typing of influenza B as identified 80 Yamagata and 19 Victoria strains.</p>
