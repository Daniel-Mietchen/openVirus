<p>When compared with the B/Victoria 2016–2018 vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008), all 19 isolates had one common amino acid mutation (K180N), located in the HA 160-loop (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Five mutations located in the HA antigenic epitopes were identified in the 19 B/Victoria isolates: K180N (19/19), I132V (16/19), N144D (15/19), I161V (3/19), H137Q or H137N (1/19), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Note that the mutations K180N, I132V, and N144D occurred in most of the isolates. In the 150-loop, three isolates contained a mutation I161V. Additionally, 17 of 19 isolates had three mutations located in the three antigenic sites (120-loop, 150-loop, and 160-loop). When compared with the B/Victoria 2018–2020 vaccine strain (B/Colorado/06/2017), surprisingly, all 19 isolates had K180N mutation in the 160-loop and 15 of 19 isolates had a G144D mutation in the 120-loop. A previous study found that the amino acid substitution N180K altered the epitope and affected the viral antigenicity. Human antibodies did not substantially inhibit the hemagglutination reaction in the hemagglutination inhibition tests (

Except for the B/Colorado/06/2017/vaccine strain, which had two deletions (Δ2) in the HA antigenic sites (177K and 178N), the other isolates had no amino acid deletions at any of the antigenic sites (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). A larger than expected number of mutations found within HA multiple antigenic epitopes of B/Victoria isolates suggest that the HA gene may be more variable than previously thought (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Lindstrom et al., 1999</xref>). The isolates accumulated mutations at several antigenic sites, which may reduce the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, the B/Vitoria vaccine strain used in 2018–2020 might not be appropriately selected for Southern China should this be the case. According to the report of the National Health Commission of China, the B/Victoria strain re-dominated in China in 2019

 </sup>. In the context of our study, this indicates that the protective efficacy of 2018–2019 B/Victoria vaccine is likely reduced due to the mutations in the antigenic sites of the HA protein, particularly if the vaccination rate in China remained at the same level in 2019 as in prior years.
