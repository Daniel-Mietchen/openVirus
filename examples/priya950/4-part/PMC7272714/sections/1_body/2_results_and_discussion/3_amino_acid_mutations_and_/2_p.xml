<p>When compared with the A/H1N1 2017â€“2019 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015), there were three major amino acid mutations within the HA gene of all 23 isolates (S91R, S181T, and I312V), of which one mutation, S91R, located in the Cb antigenic site was identified in all 23 isolates (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To be clear, it is not known if these patients were vaccinated for influenza. Whether these mutations actually changed the immunogenicity of these isolates needs to be investigated further. However, the incidence of influenza A was significantly lower than influenza B in Jan-Mar 2018. The use of the influenza A vaccine appears to have been effective in controlling the potential influenza A outbreak.
