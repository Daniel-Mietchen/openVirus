<p>Because there was no influenza B/Yamagata vaccine used during the 2017–2018 season, the 2018–2019 influenza B/Yamagata vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013) was used as reference. The HA gene of most of the isolates was conserved. Only five out of 80 isolates contained one non-synonymous substitution, located in the 120-loop, 150-loop, 160-loop, and 190-helix sites (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), respectively (marked in red in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). One isolate (SMU926) harbored four mutations in the 160-loop site. Except for these mutations, no other changes were found in the HA antigenic sites (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The mutation L187Q was noted in all 80 isolates, but it was not found in any antigenic sites and therefore may not affect the antigenicity. At amino acid residue 179, three of eighty isolates had amino acid mutations in the antigenic epitopes (
