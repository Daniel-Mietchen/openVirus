<p>Current influenza vaccines provide important protection in humans by inducing strain-specific neutralizing antibodies targeting highly variable antigenic epitopes in the globular domain of the HA protein that is in the virus envelope. They play a critical role in host cell recognition, viral binding, as well as the subsequent fusion and entry processes (
