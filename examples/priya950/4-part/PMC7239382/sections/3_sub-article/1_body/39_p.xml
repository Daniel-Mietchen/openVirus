<p>Overall the issue is of some importance given the well-known but poorly understood interactions between IAV and bacterial infections in humans, that have also been explored to some extent in mouse models. However this model using purified super antigens and IP IAV infection is rather oversimplified. When they infect intranasally the findings become quite complex. Overall it iis not clear how relevant these findings will be to humans and that could be discussed and reviewed in more detail in the Discussion.</p>
