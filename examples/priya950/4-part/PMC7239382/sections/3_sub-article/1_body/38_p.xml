<p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting study that explores how superantigens, particularly SEB, influence CD8 T cell responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In well designed and well executed experiments they show that SEB injected three days before A/PR8 IAV infection enhances the T cell response to peptide epitopes, where SEB-reactive TCRs are part of the response. They extend this to other superantigens and also use a mutated SEB to show the enhanced response is superantigen specific. These results were all found when the infection was intraperitoneal and when SEB was given ip and the IAV intranasally, there was no difference in the lung T cell response, though the splenic response was enhanced. Following ip SEB and IAV priming, secondary responses to a second (T cell ) cross reacting virus were enhanced. However, when SEB was given after the first priming, the secondary T cell response was decreased, implying differential effects of the SEB on na√Øve versus memory T cells. However early exposure to SEB after priming, enhances the T cell response.</p>
