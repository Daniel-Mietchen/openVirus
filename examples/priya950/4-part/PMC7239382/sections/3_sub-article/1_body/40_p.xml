<p>Reviewer #3: In this study by Meilleur et al, the authors investigate the impact of bacterial superantigen SEB on CD8 T cell responses. Intraperitoneal administration of SEB followed by ip administration of the influenza virus PR8 strain increased the numbers of CD8 T cells. This increase was specific to T cells with Vb3 or Vb8 TCR. A similar increase in CD8 T cells was observed with several influenza virus strains when SEB was administered prior to influenza virus injection. However, SEB administration had no effect on the numbers of CD8 T cells in the respiratory tract upon intranasal administration of influenza virus. There was some increase in NP147 epitope specific CD8 T cells in the spleen. Interestingly, SEB administration in influenza virus primed mice prior to boosting resulted in significantly decreased CD8 T cell numbers. Overall, the authors convincingly demonstrate that SEB administration prior to influenza virus administration increases the number of CD8 T cells with Vb3 and Vb8 TCR. A major weakness in the study is the relevance of the model system used here - ip injection of infectious influenza virus is very different from intramuscular injection of inactivated vaccine or natural infection of the respiratory tract. Thus, the significance of these results in the context of co-infection or the impact of SEB on influenza virus specific CD8 T cell responses is not thoroughly addressed.</p>
