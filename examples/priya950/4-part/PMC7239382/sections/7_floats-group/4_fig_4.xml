  <title>Pre-exposure to SEB raises the frequency of memory T
   <sub>CD8</sub> precursors and invigorates recall responses of SEB-binding IAV-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub>.
  </title>
  <p>(A-B) Mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg of SEB before they received i.p. immunization with PR8. On indicated days, members of each cohort were sacrificed for their spleens in which the frequencies of NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific (A) and HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific (B) T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were determined by ICS for IFN-γ. Each symbol represents an individual mouse, and data are pooled from two independent experiments yielding similar results. (C) On day 7 post-PR8 immunization, the frequencies of KLRG1
   <sup>+</sup>CD127
   <sup>-</sup> T
   <sub>CD8</sub> (short-lived effectors) and KLRG1
   <sup>-</sup>CD127
   <sup>+</sup> T
   <sub>CD8</sub> (memory precursors) were determined after surface staining of splenic cells with mAbs to CD3 and CD8α along with MHC I tetramers detecting NP
   <sub>147</sub>- or HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific cells. (D) Mice were injected with PBS or SEB three days before they were primed with PR8 i.p. Thirty days later, boosting immunization with SEQ12 was conducted using the same injection route. On day 7 post-challenge with SEQ12, the frequencies (E) and absolute numbers (F) of IFN-γ-producing epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> in the spleens were determined. The results depicted in E-F are pooled from two independent experiments. Error bars (A-C and E-F) represent SEM. * and ** denote significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively, using unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests.
