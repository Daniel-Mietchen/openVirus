  <title>Respiratory infection with an SEB deletion mutant of 
   <italic>S</italic>. 
   <italic>aureus</italic> before PR8 results in weaker NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses.
  </title>
  <p>(A) COL and COL Δ
   <italic>seb</italic> were cultured in half-BHI medium, and their growth rates at 37°C were monitored. OD
   <sub>600</sub> readings were used to generate a growth curve for each strain. Mice were then given PBS, 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> CFUs of COL or 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> CFUs of COL Δ
   <italic>seb</italic> i.n. three days before they were infected sublethally with PR8. On day 4 post-PR8 infection, mice (n = 3/group) were sacrificed for their lungs and BAL fluid in which infectious PR8 titres were determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assays. Each symbol represents an individual mouse (B). Separate cohorts of mice were monitored for weight loss until day 10 post-PR8 infection (C), at which point animals were sacrificed for their spleens and lungs in which NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated by MHC I tetramer staining or ICS for IFN-γ (C). Mean ± SEM values are depicted for 11 mice per group pooled from three independent experiments yielding similar results. Statistical comparisons between COL- and COL Δ
   <italic>seb</italic>-infected mice were carried out using an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, and * denotes a significant difference with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.
