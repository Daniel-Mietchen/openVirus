  <title>Intranasal instillation of SEB before PR8 does not worsen infection-induced weight loss but increases the pulmonary response to NP
   <sub>147</sub>.
  </title>
  <p>(A) BALB/c mice were injected i.n. with 50 ng of SEB in 25 μL PBS (n = 7) or with PBS alone (n = 6) three days before they were sublethally infected with PR8. Animals were monitored daily after PR8 infection, and their weight loss was recorded (B). On day 10 post-infection, the percentages of NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were determined in the lungs of PBS- and SEB-pretreated mice by MHC I tetramer staining (C). Representative contour plots are depicted, and mean ± SEM values are indicated. ** denotes a significant difference between PBS- and SEB-treated mice with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 using an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
