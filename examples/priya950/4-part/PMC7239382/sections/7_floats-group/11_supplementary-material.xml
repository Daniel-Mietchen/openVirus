  <title>Pretreatment with SEB prior to intramuscular immunization with heat-inactivated PR8 invigorate NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub>.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg SEB followed, three days later, by i.m. vaccination with heat-inactivated PR8. Seven days after vaccination, the frequency (B,C) and the absolute number (C) of NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> was determined in each spleen by ICS for IFN-γ. Representative dot plots (B) and summary data (C) are depicted. Error bars represent SEM, and ** and *** denote statistically significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively, using an unpaired Student’s
