  <title>Preferential TCR Vβ usage by T
   <sub>CD8</sub> clones dictates their enhanced or unaltered responsiveness to PR8 following exposure to bacterial SAgs.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with SEB. Seven days later, NP
   <sub>147</sub>-, PB2
   <sub>289</sub>- and HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were identified by ICS for IFN-γ and also surface-stained with 15 mAbs recognizing indicated TCR Vβ regions. The abundance of each Vβ region is expressed as a proportion of all detectable Vβs for each epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> population in individual mice (n = 3 per group). SEB-binding Vβs are shown using different patterns against a red background. (B) A ribbon diagram model of SEB (blue) in complex with mouse TCR Vβ8.3 (gray) and the MHC class II molecule HLA-DR1 (α-chain, red; β-chain, green) was constructed. The cognate peptide displayed within the open groove of HLA-DR1 is shown in black. The insert illustrates the key position of Asn
   <sup>23</sup> for interactions with indicated residues of the CDR2β region of mouse Vβ8.3. (C) Parallel cohorts of mice (n = 5 per group from two independent experiments) were injected i.p. with PBS, 50 μg of SEB, or 50 μg of SEB
   <sub>N23A</sub>, followed 3 days later by PR8 immunization i.p. After 7 days, T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses to indicated epitopes were quantified by ICS for IFN-γ. (D) Mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 ng of MAM before they received, 3 days later, an i.p. inoculum of PR8. On day 7 post-PR8 immunization, epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated. Data pooled from two independent experiments are shown. (E) Three days before PR8 inoculation, mice were injected with PBS or with 50 μg of SEA i.p. Seven days after PR8 immunization, epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated. Error bars represent SEM. * and ** denote significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively, using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests (D) or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests (C).
