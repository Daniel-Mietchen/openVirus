<p>Cells were washed and seeded at 0.3–2.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well of a U-bottom microplate containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 0.1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells were left untreated, exposed to an irrelevant control peptide (NP
 <sub>118-126</sub> or simply NP
 <sub>118</sub>), or stimulated with synthetic peptides corresponding to IAV- or VacV-derived T
 <sub>CD8</sub> epitopes (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). NP
 <sub>118</sub> is an immunodominant peptide epitope of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to which our animals had never been exposed. Each peptide was used at a final concentration of 500 nM. After 2 hours at 37°C, 10 μg/mL of brefeldin A was added to ensure the retention of IFN-γ in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of reactivated T
 <sub>CD8</sub>, and cultures were continued for another 3 hours. Cells were subsequently washed, briefly incubated on ice with 2.4G2 supernatant, and stained for surface CD8α. In several experiments, we additionally used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Vβ mAbs from a Mouse Vβ TCR Screening Panel kit (BD Pharmingen). Next, cells were washed, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and stained with an anti-IFN-γ mAb (clone XMG1.2 from Thermo Fisher). The percentage of IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> cells was determined after live gating on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> events, which was also used to calculate virus-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> numbers per organ/sample. Background noise from untreated cells was always negligible and deducted from values obtained from peptide re-stimulation cultures.
