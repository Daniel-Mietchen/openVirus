<p>Recombinant staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA and SEB) were cloned from

 <italic>aureus</italic> strains Newman and COL, respectively, expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3), and then purified by nickel column chromatography as we previously described [

 <sub>N23A</sub>). N23 is critical for binding to mouse TCR Vβ8.2 and Vβ8.3 [
