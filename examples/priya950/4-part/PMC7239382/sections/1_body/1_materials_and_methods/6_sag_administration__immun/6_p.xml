<p>For superinfection experiments, COL and COL Δ
 <italic>seb</italic> colonies were picked from TSA plates, grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB), and subcultured 2% (V/V) in TSB to yield an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 3.0–3.5. Bacterial pellets were washed and adjusted to a concentration of 4 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution. Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were instilled i.n. with 25 μL of PBS containing 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFUs of COL or COL Δ
 <italic>seb</italic>. This was followed, 3 days later, by i.n. PR8 inoculation. Separate cohorts of mice were sacrificed after 4 and 10 days to assay for infectious viral titres and IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses, respectively. Animals were monitored for morbidity throughout superinfection experiments.
