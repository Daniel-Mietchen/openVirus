<p>To induce active PR8 infection, a 25-Î¼L inoculum of infectious allantoic fluid approximating 0.3 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> (50% mouse lethal dose) was instilled into the nares of anesthetized mice. Animals were monitored for signs of morbidity, including lethargy, piloerection and weight loss. On day 4 post-PR8 infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the abundance of replicative viral particles was evaluated in lung homogenate specimens and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and reported as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34). We employed a previously published protocol in our TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assays [
