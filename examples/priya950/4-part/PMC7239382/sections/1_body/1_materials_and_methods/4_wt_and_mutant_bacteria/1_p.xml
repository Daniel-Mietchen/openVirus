<p>The methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> COL was used in superinfection experiments. A mutant strain of this bacterium with a deletion of 
 <italic>seb</italic>, the gene encoding staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), was previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These strains will be simply referred to as COL and COL Δ
 <italic>seb</italic>, respectively. For bacterial growth curve analysis, cells were picked from a tryptic soy agar (TSA) plate, grown overnight in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, and subcultured in half-BHI medium (BHI broth diluted 1:2 in sterile Milli-Q water). OD
 <sub>600</sub> was adjusted to 0.05 before 200 μL/well of cultures were placed in quadruplicate in a 96-well flat-bottom Microfluor 2 White plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacterial growth was monitored at 37°C with shaking using a Biotek Synergy H4 plate reader, and OD
 <sub>600</sub> readings were recorded at one-hour intervals.
