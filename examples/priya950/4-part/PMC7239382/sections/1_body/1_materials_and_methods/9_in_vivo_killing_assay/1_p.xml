 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Briefly, to prepare control and cognate target cells, erythrocyte-depleted syngeneic splenic cell suspensions were pulsed in separate tubes with 500 nM of NP
 <sub>118</sub> or indicated IAV-derived peptides. After 45 minutes at 37°C, cells in each tube were washed, resuspended in PBS and labeled for 15 minutes at 37°C with a specific CFSE concentration. Typically, target cells displaying NP
 <sub>118</sub>, HA
 <sub>518</sub> and NP
 <sub>147</sub> were labeled with 0.025, 0.25 and 2 μM of CFSE, respectively. The CFSE reaction was stopped using cold FBS, and target cells were washed and mixed in equal numbers for intravenous (i.v.) tail vein injections into naïve and IAV-primed recipients. Where indicated, target cells were injected into animals that had been given SEB (or PBS), but not PR8, as an additional control. Each mouse received a total of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells in 200 μL of PBS. Exactly 1, 2 or 4 hours later, mice were sacrificed for their spleens, which were quickly homogenized and immediately transferred onto ice. Two thousand CFSE
 <sup>low</sup> events were acquired on a cytometer, and specific lysis of target cells was determined by the following formula: % specific cytotoxicity = {1 –[(CFSE
 <sup>int/high</sup> event number in IAV-primed mouse ÷ CFSE
 <sup>low</sup> event number in IAV-primed mouse) ÷ (CFSE
 <sup>int/high</sup> event number in naive mouse ÷ CFSE
 <sup>low</sup> event number in naive mouse)]} × 100.
