<p>Three weeks after i.n. infection with PR8, mice were terminally bled via cardiac puncture. Blood specimens were left to clot and then centrifuged at 17,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 40 minutes at 4°C. IAV-specific IgG2b was detected in serum samples using a previously established protocol [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and an Invitrogen eBioscience Ready-SET-Go! Kit. MDCK cells were infected with PR8 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, harvested 36 hours later, washed and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. The resulting cell lysate was diluted 1:400 in a coating buffer, transferred to wells of an ELISA plate and incubated overnight at 4°C. The wells were subsequently blocked with PBS containing 2% FBS before they were washed using PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. Serially diluted serum samples were then added for 1 hour at room temperature. After removing unbound serum, a mAb against mouse IgG2b was used to capture bound IgG2b. Next, the plate was washed, and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG polyclonal Ab was added to each well for 3 hours at room temperature. The plate was washed again and received 100 μL/well of a tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution. The enzymatic reaction was stopped using 1 M phosphoric acid, and OD
 <sub>450</sub> values were determined using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader.
