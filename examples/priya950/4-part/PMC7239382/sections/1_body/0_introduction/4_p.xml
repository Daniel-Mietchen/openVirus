<p>How bacterial SAgs manipulate IAV infection- and vaccination-elicited T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses is poorly understood. Exposure to SAgs can create physical and/or functional holes in mouse T cell repertoires by eliminating or anergizing many T cells [

 <sub>CD8</sub> with antiviral specificities out of commission, at least temporarily. Paradoxically, we demonstrated that SAgs activate and expand preexisting IAV-specific memory T
 <sub>CD8</sub> in mice and humans [
