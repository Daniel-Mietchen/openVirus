<p>IAV has been a workhorse for studies of antiviral T
 <sub>CD8</sub> immunodominance, the marked tendency of T cells to respond to viral peptides in a predictable hierarchy based on the MHC class I allomorphs present in an individual. T
 <sub>CD8</sub> immunodominance hierarchies are controlled by many factors, including the type of APCs participating in Ag processing [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the expression kinetics of viral proteins and the efficiency of their degradation in the cytosol [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the rough selectivity of TAP for the resulting peptides [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the affinity of MHC I molecules for transported peptides [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and of course the frequencies of naïve peptide-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> in one’s repertoire [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that may indeed be altered by SAgs. We previously demonstrated that the breadth of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses can also be influenced by the immunomodulatory functions of CD4
 <sup>+</sup>CD25
 <sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], intracellular indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the cell surface checkpoint molecule programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and by the enzymatic actions of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [
