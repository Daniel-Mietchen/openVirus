<p>On day 10 post-PR8 infection, which corresponds to the peak of the anti-IAV response in the lungs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], IFN-Î³-producing epitope-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> numbers were nearly equal in the lungs and within the BAL fluid of PBS- and SEB-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Interestingly however, SEB administration almost doubled splenic NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T cell numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In this setting, only a trend towards an increased response to HA
 <sub>518</sub> was noticeable in SEB-primed animals. These data indicate that i.p. pretreatment with SEB can enhance the systemic, but not the local, immunodominant T
 <sub>CD8</sub> response in the aftermath of a respiratory IAV infection.
