<p>Intraperitoneally injected SEB can reportedly reach the lungs and increase vascular permeability and leukocyte accumulation in mice [

 <sub>CD8</sub> numbers in the lungs or in BAL in our model as indicated above, which was curious. We posited that pulmonary IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses may be influenced more forcibly by local SEB administration. Injection of SEB via the i.n. route has been used in the past to model exposure to this SAg due to bacterial colonization or through inhalation of aerosolized SEB maliciously employed as a bioweapon [
