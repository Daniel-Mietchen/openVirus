<p>We next sought to determine whether exposure to SEB affects T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to IAV infection as opposed to vaccination. Separate cohorts of mice were left uninfected or injected i.p. with PBS or SEB before they received a sublethal i.n. inoculum of PR8. As anticipated, while uninfected mice showed a slight weight gain in the course of these experiments, infection resulted in a gradual weight loss, which was worst at around day 7 post-PR8 inoculation and which was partially reversed afterwards (
