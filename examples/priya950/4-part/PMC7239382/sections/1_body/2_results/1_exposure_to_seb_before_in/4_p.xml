<p>MHC I multimers identify Ag-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> based solely on their TCR specificity while providing little information about their functional competence. Since SAgs may anergize T cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], it was important to study T cell responses using functional readouts. Furthermore, although NP
 <sub>147</sub> is immunodominant in our system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], it is not the only epitope recognized in PR8-primed BALB/c mice. Therefore, in the next series of experiments, we tracked functional T
 <sub>CD8</sub> recognizing all known peptide epitopes of PR8 by ICS for IFN-γ. Upon incubation with an irrelevant peptide (NP
 <sub>118</sub>), splenocytes from PR8-inoculated mice did not synthesize any IFN-γ above the background level. In contrast, NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> exhibited a high IFN-γ production capacity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Interestingly, SEB administration before PR8 inoculation also ‘selectively’ increased the frequencies and absolute numbers of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> recognizing HA
 <sub>518</sub> and HA
 <sub>462</sub> without affecting the clonal size of other subdominant T
 <sub>CD8</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). In fact, the observed increase in the case of the HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific clone resulted in its ‘rank promotion’, thus placing it in the second position in the immunodominance hierarchy and only behind NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub>. We also confirmed the enlarged clonal size of the HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific population by dextramer staining (
