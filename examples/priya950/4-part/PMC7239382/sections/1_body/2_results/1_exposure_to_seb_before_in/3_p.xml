<p>We found a single i.p. injection of SEB prior to IAV immunization to raise the frequency of splenic NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> by dextramer staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This could be translated, in terms of absolute numbers, to an approximately 3-fold increase over control values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The observed rise in NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> was also clearly evident in the peripheral blood of SAg-pretreated animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).
