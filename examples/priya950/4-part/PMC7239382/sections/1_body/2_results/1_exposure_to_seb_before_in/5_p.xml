<p>When analyzing IFN-γ production by NP
 <sub>147</sub>-, HA
 <sub>518</sub>- and HA
 <sub>462</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> on a per-cell basis, we found comparable geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) values in PBS- and SEB-pretreated animals. To be exact, the mean gMFI ± SEM of IFN-γ staining in PBS- and SEB-pretreated mice (n = 23 per group) was 3,341 ± 373 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 3,624 ± 347 (NP
 <sub>147</sub>), 2,207 ± 277 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 2,163 ± 298 (HA
 <sub>518</sub>), and 1,529 ± 210 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 1,716 ± 240 (HA
 <sub>462</sub>), respectively. Therefore, SEB had simply expanded the above-indicated IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> clones without tampering with their ability to produce IFN-γ.
