<p>First, we determined the TCR Vβ usage of the three top-ranked clones in the hierarchy (NP
 <sub>147</sub>, PB2
 <sub>289</sub> and HA
 <sub>518</sub>). These clones were chosen also because they were impacted differently by SEB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Examination of 15 different TCR Vβ segments revealed that NP
 <sub>147</sub>- and HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub>, but not PB2
 <sub>289</sub>-specific cells, preferentially utilized TCR Vβ families that are known to be ‘SEB-responsive’. These Vβs are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2A</xref> using various patterns against a red background. The most predominantly utilized Vβs in NP
 <sub>147</sub>- and HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific clones were Vβ8.1/2 and Vβ8.3, respectively. This was apparent in both PBS- and SEB-pretreated animals, but more so in the latter cohort (
