<p>In our primary vaccination model, introducing SEB three days before PR8 led to augmented responses against NP

 <sub>CD8</sub> to a memory state. We found that at the peak of their primary response, both NP
 <sub>147</sub>- and HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> pools contained more CD127

 <sup>low</sup> cells and less CD127
 <sup>low</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>high</sup> cells in SEB-treated mice (
