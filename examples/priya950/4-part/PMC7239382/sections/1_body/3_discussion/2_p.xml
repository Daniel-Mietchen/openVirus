<p>Another important question is whether SAgs may manipulate or reshape the immunodominance hierarchies of Ag-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub>, including IAV-specific cells, which in turn determines the narrowness or breadth of primary and recall anti-IAV responses. Although immunodominance has been often investigated in experimental settings using mouse models, increasing evidence suggests that it is also relevant to human anti-IAV responses [
