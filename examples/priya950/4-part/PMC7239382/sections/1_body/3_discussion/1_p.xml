<p>How bacterial SAgs modify bulk or Ag-specific T cell responses has been a subject of several investigations in the past. Anergy, TCR downregulation and apoptotic death have often been reported as outcomes of exposure to these potent exotoxins, which may contribute to either a transient state of unresponsiveness or longer-term immunosuppression [
