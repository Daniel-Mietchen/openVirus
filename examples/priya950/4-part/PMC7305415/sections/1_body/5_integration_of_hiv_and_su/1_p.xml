<p>As examples of contexts in which integration of services for key populations can form a potentially synergistic package of comprehensive care, two mathematical modelling studies in this Supplement examine intersections between HIV and substance use in Latin America. Cepeda

 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>] model a range of scenarios in which ART and harm reduction services are scaled up among PWID in Tijuana, Mexico, predicting the impact that concomitant scale‐up could have on the incidence of both HIV and overdose. In contrast, Bórquez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>] focus on stimulant use and HIV among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru, exploring the impact of HIV pre‐exposure prophylaxis and harm reduction interventions on HIV incidence, suicide and CVD deaths in this population. Though the specifics of their inquiries differ, both articles conclude – perhaps unsurprisingly – that intervention strategies attending to both HIV and substance use could have substantial beneficial impacts on the comorbid conditions evaluated.
