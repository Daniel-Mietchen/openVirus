<p>The articles in this Supplement examine a specific set of issues and perspectives around integration of services for HIV and other conditions. In particular, these articles focus on (1) integration of HIV care with services for NCDs, especially CVD, in settings with a high “dual burden” of HIV and CVD, and (2) integration of HIV and substance use services in populations that can benefit from HIV prevention and treatment as a package that also includes services for substance abuse. Although each individual article addresses a narrowly defined topic, these articles collectively provide important insight into some of the potential epidemiological and economic consequences of moving towards more integrated HIV services. They also illustrate that the landscape of integrating HIV services into broader health systems – and integrating broader healthcare services into HIV‐specific systems – is one that is only beginning to take shape; the need for additional data and corresponding analysis to inform specific policy decisions is urgent.</p>
