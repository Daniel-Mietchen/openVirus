<p>This hypothesis of a favourable risk‐benefit balance is tested in three modelling papers that seek to determine if adding CVD care to existing HIV services would be an impactful and/or cost‐effective use of resources. Kasaie 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>] consider screening PLHIV for hypertension and diabetes in the context of outreach campaigns and HIV treatment in the Sustained East Africa Research in Community Health programme in Kenya [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>], and Sando 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>] consider screening persons on ART in Uganda for hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol and initiating treatment for these conditions where indicated. Both papers find that such programmes may be cost‐effective in circumstances when the costs of CVD treatments are low, effectiveness is high and persons receiving services are otherwise at elevated risk of suffering ill effects of CVD.
