<p>The cost and budget impact of an alternative model – of expanding NCD care for all persons in HIV and acute health clinics more generally (i.e. not in a manner that stems solely from HIV platforms) – is estimated in another paper in this Supplement, by Osetinsky 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>]. The authors argue that costs of expanding NCD care in western Kenya can be mitigated by growing capacity in existing clinics without NCD services, strengthening referral systems and task shifting between healthcare workers with different levels of training. The costs of expanding NCD care in this study were relatively modest on a per‐visit or per‐facility basis, but a comparison to current conditions is difficult because the health benefit and opportunity costs of this expansion are uncertain. The authors note that a major challenge in the status quo “unintegrated” approach is patients’ out‐of‐pocket expenditure to attend clinic visits, especially for patients who would not otherwise make these trips. As noted by both Osetinsky 
 <italic>et al</italic>. and Kibachio 
 <italic>et al</italic>., this represents an argument in favour of prioritizing NCD management for PLHIV, who unlike the general population must already make frequent clinic visits while on ART.
