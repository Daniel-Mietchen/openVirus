<p>Finally, the papers in this Supplement highlight the importance of more precise thinking about integrated HIV services and their effects. “Integrated HIV care” is not a single intervention that can be universally applied; rather, this broad term encompasses a wide array of specific intervention and policy options that must be tailored to the appropriate population and evaluated individually. As data on such specific integrated HIV interventions emerge, models will evolve from the more generic approaches taken today to answering more specific research questions to help inform specific sets of decision makers. To be useful, this next generation of models will need to be more carefully calibrated to data for particular populations, more advanced in their ability to incorporate analyses of uncertainty and generalizability to other settings, and more grounded in empirical data about intervention effects (as those data emerge). They must also be more cognizant of potential secondary effects of HIV integration policy; such effects might include (a) adverse consequences to health systems and/or funding streams that are incapable of handling additional capacity and (b) unintended inequities from providing additional services to those who already have better access to other health services (while also acknowledging the potential efficiencies of doing so). The analyses presented in this Supplement are an important first step in the direction of informing HIV integration policy, but there is much more work to be done – in terms of collecting requisite data on effectiveness and costs of specific interventions as well as developing models that can exploit those data to their maximum utility.</p>
