<p>Our findings have interesting parallels to puzzling examples from other RNA viruses, such as two Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014 and 2018 [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Isolates from both outbreaks were minimally divergent from isolates collected about a decade earlier, resulting in a far lower evolutionary rate than other known lineages. It has been suggested that such slow evolution may be caused by the maintenance of the virus in an animal reservoir, where infection might be associated with lower replication rates compared to human hosts [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Rabies virus may provide an additional peculiar example based on a handful of reports in human patients of virus reactivation after latency of several years [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], but it has not been documented whether these cases involved a lack of evolutionary changes. In other cases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, viral RNA and infectious virus have been shown to persist in reservoir hosts for multiple years. However, re-isolation of virus (as opposed to detection of viral RNA) indicates that the virus replicates during persistent infection and accumulates nucleotide substitutions at a rate comparable to actively replicating viruses [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Hepatitis C virus, for example, is also known to persist in a number of patients for a number of years but, again, with continuing viraemia and thus virus replication [
