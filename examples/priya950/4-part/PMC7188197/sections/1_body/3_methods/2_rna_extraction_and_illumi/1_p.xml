<p>Total RNA was extracted from infected blood samples, and virus isolates using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) and purified with 3× Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Total RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and Qubit RNA HS Assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), while RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). In order to avoid cross-contamination, RNA extractions from virus isolates were performed separately from those of infected blood samples. Similarly, RNA extractions were carried out separately on the basis of geographical origin and year of collection of the samples. In addition, library preparations, target enrichment, and sequencing runs (see below) were carried out also on separate days, following the same criteria as above. Libraries from low and without measurable RNA (low input) were also prepared separately from those with measurable RNA (high input). Libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using 5 μL of sample RNA (up to 250 ng of total RNA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after RNA was fragmented, it was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamers. Single-stranded cDNA was immediately converted to double-stranded cDNA, cleaned up with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), quantified using Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and the size distribution was assessed using a 4200 TapeStation System with High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A-tailing was performed, followed by indexed adapter ligation. After a purification step, dual indexed libraries were PCR amplified, and the purified PCR products were pooled in equimolar concentrations and sequenced using 150 paired-end sequencing on MiSeq or NextSeq500/550 sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p>
