<p>To explore the diversity of the outbreaks, we generated a ML tree. All segments were concatenated into a single sequence, and a phylogeny using the GTR+G+I nucleotide model was run in PhyML v. 20120412 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. All parameters were optimised by ML. The algorithm was the best of NNI and SPR moves with 10 random starts, with 1,000 bootstraps being performed on the best tree found. A ML tree containing all sequences was then run using the same settings as the first, and 1,000 bootstraps were performed on the best tree found in those 12 starts. Given the observed short branch between the first and second outbreaks, this tree was then rooted at the optimal root found from the tree containing only the sequences from the first outbreak, generated under the same settings, as calculated by TempEst v. 1.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The TempEst rooting procedure also confirmed clock-like evolution for this dataset.
