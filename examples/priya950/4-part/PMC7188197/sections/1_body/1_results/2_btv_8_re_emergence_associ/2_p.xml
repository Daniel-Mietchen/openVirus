<p>Using BEAST, we reconstructed the sequence of the most recent common ancestor of the viruses sequenced from the second outbreak. This ancestral sequence displayed only 7 nucleotide substitutions (of which 6 were synonymous or in the untranslated regions [UTRs] of the viral genome) compared to BTV-8
 <sub>FRA2007-3673</sub>, the genetically closest virus within the dataset, which was collected in France in August 2007 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000673.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In comparison, BTV-8
 <sub>FRA2007-3673</sub> displayed 23 nucleotide substitutions (of which 16 were synonymous or in the UTR) compared to the first sequence available from the first outbreak and collected in August 2006 in the Netherlands (BTV-8
 <sub>NET2006-04</sub>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000673.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The number of mutations of BTV-8
 <sub>FRA2007-3673</sub> compared to the BTV-8 sequences in the dataset in 2006 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23) ranges between 15 and 23, while those compared to the virus sequences collected in 2008 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 37) varies between 2 and 56. Hence, sequence variation between BTV-8 samples collected only a year apart during the first outbreak is, in general, far higher than that between the ancestor of the re-emerged BTV-8 strain and its closest relative in the first outbreak.
