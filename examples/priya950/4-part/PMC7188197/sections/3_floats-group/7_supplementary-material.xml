  <title>Phylogenetic tree of 164 BTV-8 samples collected during the European outbreak between 2006 and 2018 with tip labels.</title>
  <p>ML tree estimated in PhyML. The scale shows substitutions per site. Clades represented 700 or more times within 1,000 bootstraps are indicated by a white circle. Samples from the first outbreak are shown with purple circles, while samples form the second outbreak are shown with an orange circle. BTV-8, bluetongue virus serotype 8; ML, maximum likelihood.</p>
