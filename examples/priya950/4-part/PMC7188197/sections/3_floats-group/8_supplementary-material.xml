  <title>Timescaled phylogenetic tree of BTV-8 samples collected during the European outbreaks between 2006 and 2018 with tip labels.</title>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility time-calibrated phylogenetic tree generated in BEAST. The tree is scaled in years, with the final sampling date being October 2018. Clades with posterior support of 0.9 or higher are indicated by a white circle. Samples from the first outbreak are shown with a purple circle, while samples from the second are shown with orange circles. The branches are coloured accordingly to their median evolutionary rate across the posterior (see heatmap within the figure). BTV-8, bluetongue virus serotype 8.</p>
