<p id="Par34">The overall seroprevalence of the DENV, as measured by the rate of positive anti-DENV IgG antibody ELISA results, was 83.4% (95% CI 77.7–88.3%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The prevalence of the DENV was slightly higher in Honiara (88.4%) than in Gizo (80.0%), but the difference was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.14). The prevalence of the DENV differed significantly between females (88.6%) and males (77.1%) (
 <italic>p</italic> value = 0.04). Neither the main household source of income nor recalled illnesses in the last 12 months significantly affected the prevalence of the DENV. The prevalence of the DENV increased with age, with the lowest prevalence rate (61.5%) seen in the 1–5 years age group and plateaued in the 16–20 years age group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The mean ages of the subjects that tested positive and negative for anti-DENV IgG antibodies were 23.0 years and 11.7 years, respectively. The difference between the two groups (11.3 years) was significant. The FOI, which was defined as the annual risk of infection by any DENV serotype among DENV-naïve individuals, was 16.4% in the 1–20 years age group.
