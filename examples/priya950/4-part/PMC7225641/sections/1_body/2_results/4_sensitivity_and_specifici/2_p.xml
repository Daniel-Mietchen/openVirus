<p id="Par40">The DENV RDT combo kit included tests for NS1, IgM, and IgG. The sensitivity and specificity of the NS1-based RDT were found to be 60% and 84%, respectively. When the NS1-based test was combined with the IgM-based test, the sensitivity of the RDT increased to 66%, but its specificity was reduced to 69%. The sensitivity and specificity of the IgG-based RDT were 46% and 50%, respectively, which the kit manufacturerâ€™s information suggested was indicative of a high rate of secondary infections.</p>
