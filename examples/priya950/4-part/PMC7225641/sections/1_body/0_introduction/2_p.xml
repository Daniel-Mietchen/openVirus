<p id="Par22">Most global DF cases occur in the Asia-Pacific region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Countries in Southeast Asia (SE Asia) are generally more urban and have high population densities, while the Pacific Island countries (PICTs) are rural, and their populations are scattered across many islands. Previous DF outbreaks in the PICTs were caused by a single serotype, which occurred every 5 to 10â€‰years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, in SE Asia all four DENV serotypes are circulating, and a 3-year wave-like outbreak pattern, in which the disease emanates from a central metropolitan city, is seen. There have been very few quality descriptive studies of DF conducted in the PICTs, resulting in a paucity of information about the magnitudes and drivers of DF epidemics in this region. The available studies were mostly based in a clinic setting or involved specific groups like a blood donor population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The principal vectors of DF, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus, 1762) and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse, 1894), are present in both SE Asia and the PICTs.
