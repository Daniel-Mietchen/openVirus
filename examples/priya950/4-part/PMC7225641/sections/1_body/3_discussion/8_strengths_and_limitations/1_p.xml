<p id="Par52">The seroprevalence study was initially designed to explore the populationâ€™s immunity to DENV in order to predict its outbreak potential. The sample size was small, as it was based on the high DENV positivity rate (approximately 30%) seen during the last outbreak. It was therefore not ideal for investigating the ZIKV or CHKV, which have low prevalence rates. As the clinical study was initially only planned to involve molecular virological surveillance, it lacks demographic and clinical information. This also explains why the April 2016 samples were not subjected to serological testing. However, this study provided important information that will aid understanding of the unique outbreak pattern seen in this small population.</p>
