<p id="Par48">The use of NS1-based DENV RDT in a resource-poor setting was very useful for diagnosis and management. However, the sensitivity value of the NS1-based RDT (60%) was low compared to the 95% sensitivity value reported in the previous DENV-3 outbreak in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Secondary infections and the DENV serotype are important factors affecting the diagnostic sensitivity of NS1-based RDT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our study, the NS1-based RDT was found to have lower sensitivity for the DENV-2 serotype than for the previously reported DENV-3.
