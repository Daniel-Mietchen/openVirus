<p id="Par29">The qPCR screening was performed using cDNA extracted from 200 μL of the serum samples from the patients with suspected DF. The cDNA was synthesized using the random primer protocol in the ReverTra Ace-α-® system (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), as recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA samples were stored at − 20 °C, before being used for various molecular tests. The qPCR screening used previously described DENV serotype-specific and ZIKV-specific primers (Table

A 10-μL reaction mixture, containing 0.2 μM of each forward and reverse primer, 5 μL of 2× SsoAdvanced universal SYBR Green supermix taq (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and 1 μL template, was used together with the Rotor-Gene qPCR system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The qPCR setup involved an initial temperature of 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 57 °C. To detect CHKV, the primers listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were designed based on the conserved region of the envelope gene, which was based on an alignment that included the Papua New Guinea (PNG) sequence (MF773569). The primer was first characterized by making 10-fold serial dilutions of 9.6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies of the E1 gene using the qPCR conditions described above. The amplification curve and
