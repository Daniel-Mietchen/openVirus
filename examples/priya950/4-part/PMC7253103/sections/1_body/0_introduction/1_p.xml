<p>Dengue virus (DENV) infection is hyperendemic in tropical and subtropical areas, with an estimated 390 million patients per year.

 </sup> There is recent evidence to suggest alarming global expansion of two other mosquito-borne viruses, chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses.

 </sup> In Southeast Asia (SEA), urban outbreaks of CHIKV have been well documented in the past decade, but epidemiology in rural areas is not well characterized.

 </sup> Zika virus is considered to be endemic at low prevalence in SEA. With only limited data available, ZIKV circulation is probably underestimated.

 </sup> However, a few countries reported increasing number of patients in 2016–2017, 686 in Thailand, 493 in Singapore, 232 in Vietnam, and 57 patients in the Philippines.

 </sup> The three arboviruses are transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, and consequently have overlapping geographical distributions.

  <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup> They also share remarkably similar clinical presentations, with common symptoms reported as fever, headache, vomiting, rash, myalgia, and severe arthralgia. For these reasons, strategic public health programs advocate for combined surveillance and control efforts.
