<p>Our findings suggest that the distribution of SD BIOLINE Dengue DUO RDTs in rural areas could be extremely useful for the combined surveillance of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses in Laos, and locations with similar environments. Although patients with the lowest viral titers would probably not be detected, especially for Zika infection, the detection of the patients with medium and high titers would permit the identification of epidemics. To date, in Laos, reports of ZIKV and CHIKV infections have been limited, despite a favorable climate for the rapid breeding of the vector and transmission of the viruses. There have been only 18 confirmed ZIKV cases detected from a retrospective analysis of sera, 2012â€“2013, and one ZIKV case was reported in 2016.

 </sup> Co-circulation of CHIKV during a DENV epidemic in 2013 in southern Laos has been reported.

 </sup> It is likely that CHIKV and ZIKV circulation have been underestimated and misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses circulating in the areas in the absence of confirmatory diagnostic tests.
