<p>This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential use of DENV RDTs for the storage, transport, and RT-qPCR co-detection of CHIKV and ZIKV as well as for DENV.

 </sup> CHIKV RNA was detected at 2 logfold lower dilution from RDT than direct extraction, and ZIKV RNA at 1 logfold lower dilution from RDT than direct extraction. As has been shown for DENV, less RNA is recovered when extracted from RDT as compared with direct viral extraction,

 </sup> 1â€“2 log differences, as observed in this study, would still enable detection of infected patients as shown for DENV with high agreement when comparing RT-qPCR results after direct and RDT extractions when tested with a panel of patient samples stored on RDTs.

 </sup> However, the practical utility of this system for enhancing surveillance in rural Asia requires testing of the RDTs using patient samples collected in the provinces, especially for ZIKV which is known to produce low viremia.

 </sup> It would need parallel development of guidelines for the inclusion criteria for performing the RDTs, enhancement of infrastructure for RDT shipping to a centralized laboratory for PCR assays, dashboard systems for the reporting of data to provincial hospitals and the Ministry of Health. In addition, funding of the dengue RDTs would be required to expand the coverage area, which is often limited to provincial hospitals and not yet available in remoter areas.
