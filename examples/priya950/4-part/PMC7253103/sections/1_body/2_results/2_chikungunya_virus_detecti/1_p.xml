<p>CHIKV RT-qPCR data, for experiments performed on RNA directly extracted and extracted after loading on RDT for CHIKV dilutions 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–10
 <sup>−9</sup>, are presented in 
 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The LOD for RNA extraction from RDT was 10
 <sup>−7</sup>, as compared with 10
 <sup>−9</sup> for direct virus extraction. For all dilutions, standard deviation (SD) of quantification cycle value (Cq) from triplicate RDTs was ≤ 0.52; a similar result was observed for direct extraction with SD from 0.14 to 0.6 (excluding dilution at the LOD). This is indicative of good reproducibility of CHIKV RT-qPCR from RDTs.
