<p>With strong support of bootstrap values (&gt; 80%), both hexon and fiber trees indicated that all sequences could be divided into two lineages, designated subtype 1 and subtype 2. Three strains, including HAdV-7 prototype stains from 1954 (strain Gomen) and two strains isolated in China from 2007 and 2008 (strains gz07 and GZ08), were grouped as subtype 1. All other 31 international HAdV-7 strains from five countries and regions isolated during 1955â€“2017 and 25 HAdV-7 strains (19 from GenBank database and six from this study) covering 14 provinces of China circulating since 2009 formed a separate main lineage of HAdV-7, which was recognized as subtype 2 (
