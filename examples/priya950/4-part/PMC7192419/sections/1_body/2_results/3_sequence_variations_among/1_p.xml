<p>Based on the three capsid genes evaluated in this study, the nucleotide and amino acid similarities of all HAdV-7 sequences were 98.1–100% and 97.9–100%, respectively, for penton base, 96.1–100% and 96.9–100%, respectively, for hexon, and 98.2–100% and 96.6–100%, respectively, for fiber. Further analysis of the sequences within the subtypes showed that only 3-bp synonymous mutations in the hexon gene were found for subtype 1. Additionally, nucleotide variations in subtype 3 sequences in the penton base gene were very low (&lt; 0.2%). Similar results were observed for subtype 2; the minimum nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities for the three genes were 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively, except for one strain (BJ/CHN/2018) from China, which exhibited relatively higher variation (nine unique variations) in the fiber gene. The results further confirmed that the sequences within the subtypes of HAdV-7 were highly conserved.</p>
