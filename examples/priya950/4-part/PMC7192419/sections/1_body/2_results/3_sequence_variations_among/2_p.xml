<p>Further analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three genes showed that the variations were closely related to the different subtypes and that viruses within the same subtype shared similar variation sites. These variation sites were mainly concentrated in important functional domains and hypervariable regions. In addition, there were no substantial differences between sequences according to the severity of HAdV-7 infection in this study (
