<p>Homologous recombination is an important feature for molecular evolution and immune escape of HAdV [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the results of this study indicated that the three major capsid gene of HAdV-7 were relatively stable across time and geographic space, particularly for viruses within the same subtype. For example, only 3 bp synonymous mutations were found for subtype 1 viruses across a 54-year interval, and subtype 2 viruses had relatively low evolutionary rates (2.3 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>–9.5 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) and low mutation rates in important functional domains across a 50-year interval. This feature was also found for other types of HAdVs, such as HAdV-3 [

The relative stable genome of the virus could maintain the long-term effectiveness of the vaccine, given the fact that the HAdV-7 vaccine (subtype 3 of penton base genes and subtype 2 of hexon and fiber genes) has been administered to members of the USA military since the 1970s. This vaccine greatly reduced the incidence of ARDs caused by HAdV-7 in military camps [
