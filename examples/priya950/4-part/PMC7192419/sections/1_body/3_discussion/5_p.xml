<p>Subtype 2 virus, including some known types of HAdV-7 identified by REA (e.g., HAdV-7a, -7b, -7d2, -7d, and -7l), was also first detected in the 1950s. In contrast to subtype 1, subtype 2 viruses have been greatly expanding worldwide since the 1980s [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and this subtype has gradually became the predominant subtype worldwide, causing substantial increases in mortality and morbidity in recent years. In China, a long-term survey of adenoviral-related pneumonia since 1958 indicated that HAdV-7b was the predominant type before 1980; HAdV-7d then became the predominant type from 1980 to approximately 1990 [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Notably, all strains covering 14 provinces of China isolated after 2008 in the dataset in the current study belonged to subtype 2. The results indicated that the two subtypes of HAdV-7 cocirculated in China before 2008, with subtype 2 virus being the predominant subtype in recent years [
