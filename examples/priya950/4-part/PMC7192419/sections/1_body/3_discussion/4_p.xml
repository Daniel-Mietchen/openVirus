<p>In the current study, phylogenetic analysis of HAdV-7 sequences based on three major capsid genes showed that all HAdV-7 strains could be divided into two subtypes (subtypes 1 and 2), as reported previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Subtype 1 has been reported fewer times than subtype 2 worldwide. Limited data have shown that subtype 1 virus can be traced back to 1954, when the HAdV-7 prototype strain (Gomen, HAdV-7p) was detected in the USA; this strain became the major virus type circulating in the USA during 1966â€“2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In China, an HAdV-7 prototype-like strain was identified in Beijing in 1981 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in Guangzhou in 2007 and 2008. However, no subtype 1 viruses have been reported since 2008.
