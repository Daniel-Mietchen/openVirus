<p>HAdV-7 is prevalent worldwide and accounts for approximately 20% of all adenoviral respiratory infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In China, reports on HAdV-7 infections were found as early as the 1950s [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the 1950s to 1970s, a serious epidemic of HAdV-associated infantile pneumonia occurred in northern China, and the fatality rate associated with HAdV-7 was up to 24% [

Since then, because of the absence of a national surveillance system, few reports of HAdV-7-related acute respiratory disease (ARD) have been published until recently. However, HAdV-7 epidemics have been frequent reported in western China (Shaanxi province in 2009 [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Chongqing city during 2009–2012 [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and eastern China (Guangzhou city in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Beijing in 2012–2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Zhejiang and Shanghai in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In particular, clusters of severe and fatal cases have occurred during HAdV-7 epidemics, making this virus a major public health threat.
