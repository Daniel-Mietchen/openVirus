<p>Although China has not yet established a complete adenovirus surveillance system, HAdV sentinel surveillance was recently integrated into the febrile respiratory syndrome (FRS) surveillance program supported by the Key Technologies R&amp;D Program of the National Ministry of Science during 2012â€“2015. With the HAdV-7 strains obtained through this program, we aimed to study the epidemic patterns, genetic variability, and molecular evolution of HAdV-7 based on the three major capsid proteins. This information will be essential for the development of effective strategies for the prevention and control of adenoviral respiratory infections in China.</p>
