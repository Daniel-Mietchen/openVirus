<p id="p0370">The diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is critically dependent on the type and quality of the clinical specimen and proper handling of the specimen. The preferred specimens for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised hosts are respiratory secretions obtained as a mid-turbinate or nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash, nasal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. A nasal wash specimen is the classic sample used for viral diagnosis by culture and for obtaining samples to assess cytokines or antibodies.</p>
