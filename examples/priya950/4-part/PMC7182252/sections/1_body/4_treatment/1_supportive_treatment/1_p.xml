<p id="p0385">The potential hypoxemia, apnea, and poor oral intake resulting from infection in young infants, both previously healthy as well as moderately or severely immunocompromised, requires close medical management. Hospitalization may be required for immunocompromised children younger than 1 year, particularly if intravenous (IV) fluid replacement and oxygen therapy are necessary. Systemic or inhaled steroids and bronchodilator therapies are not recommended for treatment of RSV, based on studies that failed to show decreased time in the hospital or improved outcomes.

 </xref> Children with airway obstruction or signs of hypoxia require admission to an intensive care setting for close monitoring, and children with severe disease may require intubation. Supportive care for lower respiratory tract infections caused by PIV and HMPV in immunocompromised hosts similarly may require hospitalization and adjunct therapy, including IV fluids and oxygen support, as well as aggressive therapy of secondary fungal, bacterial, or viral infections.
