 </xref> M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) are currently ineffective, and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are now first-line therapy for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. NAIs available in the United States include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, IV peramivir, and baloxavir. Clinical efficacy with oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir has been demonstrated in patients with leukemia or HCT recipients.

 </xref> The optimal duration of peramivir therapy has not been determined for immunocompromised hosts. Longer treatment courses (10 days), although not higher doses, with oseltamivir or zanamivir have been suggested, given the potential for recurrence and the median time for progression to lower respiratory tract infection. Baloxavir was recently approved for treatment of uncomplicated influenza in adults and adolescents
