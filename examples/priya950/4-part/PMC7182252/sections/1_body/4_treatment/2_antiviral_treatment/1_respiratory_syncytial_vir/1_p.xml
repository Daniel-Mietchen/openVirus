<p id="p0390">Ribavirin, a synthetic guanosine nucleoside, has been licensed for the treatment of RSV respiratory disease in children since 1986 and for the treatment of RSV disease in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation since 1993. Ribavirin is the only approved drug for lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, but concerns regarding efficacy, difficulties in administration, and the extremely high cost of the drug have resulted in minimal current use of the drug.

 </xref> Ribavirin is available in aerosolized, oral, and IV forms. Several retrospective studies, including a pooled analysis, have shown aerosolized or oral ribavirin is protective against disease progression to lower respiratory tract infection and mortality in HCT recipients; however, conclusive evidence of efficacy from randomized trials is not available.

 </xref> Oral ribavirin has been retrospectively evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy or in HCT recipients, suggesting a possible effect of oral ribavirin; however, lack of randomized controls has been a limitation in all studies.
