<p id="p0310">With the increased use of molecular diagnostic assays, HRVs and HCoVs are now the most common respiratory viruses detected in immunocompromised patients. HRV can be detected in 20% to 30% of HCT recipients, with progression to lower respiratory tract infection occurring in 17% of patients.

 </xref> In addition to HRVs, other members of the 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus, including Enterovirus-D68, can be associated with outbreaks and severe disease. Enterovirus D68 was associated with several hundred cases of severe respiratory illnesses in children in the United States in 2014 and 2018; severe disease was also seen in immunocompromised patients.
