<p id="p0295">Initial clinical symptoms related to RSV infection in immunocompromised hosts are similar to those in immunocompetent persons. Upper respiratory tract infection may progress to lower respiratory tract disease, with likelihood of progression probably related to immune status. Over 1 to 2 weeks, lower respiratory tract involvement may become evident by increasing respiratory distress, worsening hypoxia, and potentially, the need for assisted ventilation. Children or adults who acquire RSV or HMPV during or shortly after chemotherapy for malignancy may also have severe, life-threatening disease.

 </xref> Recovery after assisted ventilation for RSV and HMPV pneumonia occurs but remains uncommon despite advances in supportive care. The associated respiratory failure in severely immunocompromised patients may result in multiorgan system failure, with high mortality rates in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

 </xref> Quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) viral load has not been associated with mechanical ventilation or death for RSV, PIV, or HMPV in adult patients after HCT; however, the detection of respiratory virus RNA in serum has been associated with fatal outcomes.
