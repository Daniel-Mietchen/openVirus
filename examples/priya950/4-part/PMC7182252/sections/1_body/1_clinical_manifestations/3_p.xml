<p id="p0300">PIV infection with lower respiratory tract disease in immunosuppressed patients, particularly those in the immediate posttransplantation period, may result in a similar clinical picture, although the overall mortality rate may be less than that associated with RSV.

 </xref> Many immunocompromised adults with PIV infection first present with symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract disease, but in contrast to RSV, influenza, and HMPV, detection of PIV-1 and PIV-3 in asymptomatic HCT recipients is relatively common, reported in 6 of 17 (35%) infection episodes in a prospective study.

 </xref> Fewer than half of PIV-infected patients have a fever. In severely immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients less than 100 days after transplant, PIV-3 is the most common PIV subtype detected, reported in 80% of 544 HCT recipients with PIV.

 </xref> In all PIV-infected transplant recipients, infection may progress to lower respiratory tract disease with more serious disease linked to supplemental oxygen requirement, low monocyte counts, and high-dose steroid use. The detection of PIV in BAL or other lower respiratory tract specimens is associated with decreased survival overall in HCT recipients.

 </xref> Concomitant infections with other viruses, fungi, or severe graft-versus-host disease are relatively common in adult patients with PIV pneumonitis.
