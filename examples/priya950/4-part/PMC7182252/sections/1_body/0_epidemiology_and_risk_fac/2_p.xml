<p id="p0260">Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) vary in seasonality by type. PIV-1 causes croup epidemics in the autumn, generally every other year. PIV-2 infections usually follow the same pattern as PIV-1 and PIV-3 outbreaks, usually occuring in the spring. PIV-3 remains the most common PIV subtype detected in both hospitalized and outpatient studies, but newer molecular epidemiology suggests that either PIV-1 or PIV-4 may be the second most common PIV detected in children, depending on the year. PIV-4 may be detected year-round. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are present at moderate levels year-round, although there may be peaks of certain strains over the course of the year.</p>
