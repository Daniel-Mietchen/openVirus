 </xref> The transmission of identical strains of RSV from the outpatient setting into the hospital has been documented, demonstrating the importance of infection control measures. Nosocomial transmission of HMPV also occurs, with outbreaks in both inpatient and outpatient units. In one study, 15 patients were diagnosed with HMPV within 7 weeks in a tertiary care cancer unit.
