<p id="p0330">The mainstay of influenza prevention in immunocompromised children is vaccination. Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is recommended for all patients 6 months and older with hematologic malignancies by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Vaccination is not recommended for in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, such as induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukemia, or those who have received antiâ€“B-cell antibodies in the past 6 months.

 </xref> Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) should not be used for immunosuppressed patients except in an outbreak setting when LAIV is determined to be a more effective option owing to strain type. Quadrivalent vaccine should be offered when available. Studies are ongoing to assess the immunogenicity and safety of high-dose influenza vaccination in immunocompromised adults and children.
