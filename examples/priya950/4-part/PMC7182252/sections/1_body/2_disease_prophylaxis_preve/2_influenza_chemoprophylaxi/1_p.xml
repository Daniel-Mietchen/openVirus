<p id="p0355">Postexposure chemoprophylaxis should be considered in immunosuppressed patients who are in close contact with confirmed influenza cases or during influenza outbreaks.

 </xref> In outbreak settings, HCT recipients should receive vaccine immediately if they are 4 months or longer posttransplant. Chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir or zanamivir should also be initiated for 2 weeks after vaccination while immunity develops.

 </xref> Chemoprophylaxis is also recommended for HCT recipients who are less than 24 months posttransplant or those who remain substantially immunocompromised at 24 months or longer after HCT, regardless of vaccination history. For SOT, similar concerns regarding vaccine response in the early posttransplant period exist and chemoprophylaxis should be considered, although recommendations regarding the timing of this strategy are lacking.

  <sup>28</sup>
 </xref> Season-long prophylaxis has been evaluated in a randomized trial of SOT and HCT and showed reduction in culture- or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza, although this approach is not universally used and may be targeted to periods of high influenza virus circulation.

  <sup>29</sup>
 </xref> Antiviral resistance may emerge with widespread prophylaxis; drug resistance patterns of circulating strains should be considered when initiating prophylaxis and/or preemptive therapy.
