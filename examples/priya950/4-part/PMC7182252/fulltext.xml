In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd9800"><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>hematopoietic cell transplant, immunocompromised, oncology, respiratory virus, solid organ transplant, viral pneumonia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0015"><title>Epidemiology and risk factors</title><p id="p0255">The seasonality of respiratory virus infections among immunocompromised children is similar to that in the community (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 21.1</xref>
). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) typically circulates in the community from November through March, with peak detection in January. Human metapneumovirus follows a similar pattern although often somewhat later. Influenza epidemiology can vary somewhat from year to year, with typical seasons lasting from December to March. Influenza A tends to be more predominant early in the season and influenza B is often seen later in the season. Up-to-date influenza surveillance data for the United States are published on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm" id="ter00101">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm</ext-link>), and global surveillance data are maintained by the World Health Organization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/" id="ter00102">https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/</ext-link>).<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 21.1</label><caption><p>Typical seasonal pattern of respiratory virus detection at a major pediatric medical center. <italic>HRV/Entero,</italic> human rhinovirus or enterovirus; <italic>HCoV,</italic> human coronavirus; <italic>HMPV,</italic> human metapneumovirus; <italic>PIV,</italic> parainfluenza virus; <italic>RSV,</italic> respiratory syncytial virus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="f21-01-9780323641982"/></fig></p><p id="p0260">Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) vary in seasonality by type. PIV-1 causes croup epidemics in the autumn, generally every other year. PIV-2 infections usually follow the same pattern as PIV-1 and PIV-3 outbreaks, usually occuring in the spring. PIV-3 remains the most common PIV subtype detected in both hospitalized and outpatient studies, but newer molecular epidemiology suggests that either PIV-1 or PIV-4 may be the second most common PIV detected in children, depending on the year. PIV-4 may be detected year-round. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are present at moderate levels year-round, although there may be peaks of certain strains over the course of the year.</p><p id="p0265">Exposure to sick contacts is the single most well-described risk factor for respiratory viral acquisition in immunocompromised children. Respiratory viruses are typically transmitted by respiratory secretions through direct contact, via fomites, or by large droplet spread. Entry generally occurs through contact with nasal mucosa or eyes, in contrast to the less permissive oral route. Transmission by small-particle aerosols of RSV has not been proven and, if it occurs, it is an infrequent route. Clinical observations suggest PIVs and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are transmitted similarly to RSV. Although PIV-1 and PIV-3 have been recovered from air samples collected in the vicinity of infected patients, direct contact and transmission via fomites are likely to be more important. The high initial and subsequent infection rates, as well as outbreaks reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients in both inpatient and outpatient settings, demonstrate that these viruses spread readily and that a relatively small inoculum is likely able to cause infection.</p><p id="p0270">Epidemiologic patterns of respiratory viral detection in children are roughly similar among HCT recipients, solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, and oncology patients, although risk factors for viral detection are unique.</p><sec id="s0020"><sec id="s0025"><title>HCT recipients.</title><p id="p0275">In a surveillance study of pediatric and adult HCT recipients in the first year after transplant, the most common viruses detected were HRV and HCoV, followed by PIV, adenovirus, RSV, influenza, HMPV, and human bocavirus.<xref rid="bib_1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In a separate multicenter retrospective study of pediatric HCT recipients, 16.6% of patient had at least one respiratory virus detected by PCR in the first year after HCT<xref rid="bib_2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>; younger age was associated with viral detection in univariate analysis.

Notable exceptions include a stronger association between RSV and bronchiolitis in young infants, PIV and laryngotracheobronchitis, and HRVs and reactive airway disease exacerbations. In immunocompromised patients, respiratory viral infections can be associated with prolonged shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death.

In general, aerosolized ribavirin is reserved for subjects with virologically confirmed (BAL positive for RSV) lower respiratory tract infection. It is administered by small-particle aerosol from a solution containing the drug at a concentration of 20 mg/mL sterile water via aerosol for 2 to 20 hours/day, or at a concentration of 60 mg/mL water over 2 hours 3 times daily. Aerosol administration results in high levels of ribavirin in the secretions, with levels exceeding 1000 &#x003bc;M and little systemic absorption. The potential environmental release of ribavirin has caused concern in hospital personnel because of the potential teratogenicity of ribavirin and thus exposure is contraindicated in pregnant women because of its teratogenic potential. Administration of ribavirin via a ventilator, using a high-dose, short-duration method of drug delivery or with a vacuum-exhausted treatment hood, results in minimal or no detectable ribavirin in the rooms of treated children.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010"><label>TABLE 21.1</label><caption><p>Prevention and Treatment of Respiratory Viral Infections for Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients, Solid Organ Transplant Recipients, and Oncology Patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Virus</th><th>Prophylaxis</th><th>Asymptomatic Shedding</th><th>Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</th><th>Lower Respiratory Tract Infection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RSV</td><td><list list-type="simple" id="l9800"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Infection control procedures</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Palivizumab for children &#x02264;2 years (during season) undergoing HCT</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="l9801"><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Isolation</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="l9802"><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Isolation</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">HCT and Oncology: Ribavirin for high-risk situations<xref rid="tfn0015" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref>
