<p>A future challenge that must be addressed before clinical use of anti-RRV mAbs is time of administration, since RRV disease currently is diagnosed using paired serology, typically 2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our mouse models have demonstrated efficacy of mAbs during the period of peak viremia; however, administration of mAbs to patients within this time window would necessitate more rapid diagnostic procedures, such as virus identification through qRT-PCR. Reduction of viral load in the early phases of disease might not only reduce disease severity, but also might decrease likelihood of human-mosquito transmission. Outbreaks of polyarthritis caused by RRV have been observed recently among Australian military personnel, in which human-mosquito-human transmission was thought to have occurred without an intermediate host [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Such transmission highlights another potential clinical use for an RRV mAb, in which travelers or deployed military personnel returning from an epidemic area could be given mAb therapeutically to reduce likelihood of virus transmission to mosquitoes in their local area or country. Therefore, despite challenges associated with mAb therapy, further study is warranted to understand how these mAbs might best be used for treatment or prevention of RRV disease.
