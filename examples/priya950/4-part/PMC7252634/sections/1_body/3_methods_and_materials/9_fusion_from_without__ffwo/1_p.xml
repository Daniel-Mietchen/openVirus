<p>Vero cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates the day before use in the assay. Before the start of assay, cells were washed once with binding medium (RPMI 1640, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, and 20 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl) at 4°C, and incubated for 15 min at 4°C. The T48 strain of RRV was concentrated to 10
 <sup>8</sup> FFU/mL using 100 kDa centrifugal filters (Amicon) Centricon. Virus was prepared in binding medium and added to cells at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15 for 1 h at 4°C. Any remaining free virus was removed with two washes in binding medium. Antibodies were prepared in DMEM containing 2% FBS at 10 μg/mL concentrations and added to cells for 1 h at 4°C. Antibody was removed and fusion with the plasma membrane was initiated by the addition of fusion media (RPMI 1640, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES, and 30 mM succinic acid at pH 5.5) for 2 min at 37°C. Binding medium (RPMI 1640, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4) was used in place of low pH fusion medium in controls wells to ensure that virus entry into cells only occurred due to pH-dependent plasma membrane fusion. After a 2-min incubation, medium was removed and cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, and 20 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl (pH 7.4). Fourteen hours later, cells were detached with trypsin, fixed with 1% PFA in PBS for 1 hour, and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin detergent solution. For staining prior to flow cytometry analysis, cells were incubated sequentially with RRV mouse ascites fluid (1:6000 dilution ATCC Cat. No. VR-1246AF) for 1 h and PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 h (ThermoFisher). Cells were analyzed on BD Fortessa flow cytometer with FlowJo software.
