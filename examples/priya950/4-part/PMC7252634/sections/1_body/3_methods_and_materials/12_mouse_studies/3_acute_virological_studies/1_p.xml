<p>Four-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV strain T48 and then 24 hpi were given 100 μg of antibody by intraperitoneal injection. Three days post-infection, the ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and ankle tissues were collected as well as the spleen following extensive perfusion with PBS. RNA was isolated from tissues using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR using the TaqMan RNA to C
 <sub>T</sub> one-step kit (Applied Biosystems) with nsp3 specific primers (Forward: 5′- GTG TTC TCC GGA GGT AAA GAT AG -3′, Reverse: 5′- TCG CGG CAA TAG ATG ACT AC -3′)and probe (5′- /56-FAM/ACC TGT TTA/ZEN/CCG CAA TGG ACA CCA/ 3IABkFQ/ -3′) and compared to RNA isolated from viral stocks as a standard curve to determine FFU equivalents.
