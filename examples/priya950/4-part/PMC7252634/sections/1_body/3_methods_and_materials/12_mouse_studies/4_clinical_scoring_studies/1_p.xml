<p>Three-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV strain T48 and then 24 hpi were given 100 Î¼g of antibody by intraperitoneal injection. Mice were weighed and assigned a clinical score based on grip strength, gait, and righting reflex, as previously described[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Mice were scored blinded and as follows: 0, no disease; 1, mild defect in ipsilateral hind paw gripping; 2, mild defect in bilateral hind paw gripping; 3, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping; 4, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with moderate hind limb weakness, observable mild altered gait, and difficulty or failure to right self; 5, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with severe hind limb weakness, moderate altered gait, and loss of righting reflex; 6, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with severe hind limb weakness, severely altered gait with possible dragging hind paw, and loss of righting reflex; 7, moribund. No mice received a score of 7 throughout the course of the experiment. Eighteen days post-infection, the spleen, ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and ankle tissues were collected following extensive perfusion with PBS. Viral RNA was quantified as described above.
