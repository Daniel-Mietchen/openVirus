<p>Vero cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] Cat. No. CCL-81) were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well the day before use. Antibodies were diluted in 96-well U-bottom plates, with a 1:3 dilution series across the plate and a virus-only control in the left column. A solution containing infectious RRV was diluted to a concentration of 100 focus-forming units (FFU)/mL and mixed 1:1 by volume in a 96-well plate with antibody suspensions. The virus/antibody mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C before transfer to Vero cell monolayer cultures. Infection was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h and then 1% methylcellulose overlay prepared in DMEM with 2% FBS was added to cells. After 18 h, 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in PBS was used to fix cells for at least one hour. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS before addition of a 1:6,000 dilution of anti-RRV mouse ascites fluid (ATCC Cat. No. VR-1246AF) prepared in cell permeabilizing buffer (PBS with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After incubation for at least 2 h at room temperature, plates were washed 3 times in permeabilizing buffer, and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories [KPL]) was added at a 1:2,000 dilution in permeabilizing buffer. Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed 3 times before addition of TrueBlue Peroxidase substrate (KPL) for 20 min. Plates were rinsed with dH
 <sub>2</sub>O, and then plates were imaged with an ImmunoSpot plate reader (Cellular Technology Limited [CTL]). Foci were counted with BioSpot 5.1 software (CTL), and the percent relative infection was calculated based on the virus-only control. Triplicate tests were performed for each antibody, and the results were averaged.
