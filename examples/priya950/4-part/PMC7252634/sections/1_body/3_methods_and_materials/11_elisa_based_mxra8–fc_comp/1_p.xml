<p>RRV-86 (2 μg/mL) was diluted in PBS and immobilized onto a 384-well ELISA plate before incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The plate was washed four times with PBS containing Tween (PBST) using an EL406 combination washer dispenser instrument (BioTek) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk powder and 2% goat serum, diluted in PBS. RRV T48 strain was diluted to 4 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> FFU/mL in PBS and 25 μL per well was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with PBST, RRV mAbs were diluted to 20 μg/mL in PBS and 25 μL of mAb was added to each well, except for control wells where just PBS was added. Blocking mAbs were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and were left in when 25 μL of Mxra8-Fc (mouse Fc region) [

After incubation at room temperature for an hour, the plate was washed four times with PBST and 25 μL per well of a goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated anti-mouse Fc secondary antibody (SeraCare) was added at a 1:2,000 dilution. After five washes with PBST, plates were developed with TMB Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the reaction was stopped with H
