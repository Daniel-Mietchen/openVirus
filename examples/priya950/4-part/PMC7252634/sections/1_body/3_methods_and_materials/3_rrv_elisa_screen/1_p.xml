<p>RRV strain T48 was propagated in monolayer cultures of Vero cells. The cell line was authenticated and tested monthly during culture for the presence of mycoplasma and found to be negative in all cases. Infected cell supernatants containing virus with a titer of approximately 5 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/mL were harvested when cytopathic effect was maximal, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, then frozen and stored at –80°C until use. 384-well ELISA plates were coated with 25 μL of RRV strain T48 diluted 1:100 in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed 5 times with PBS containing Tween (PBST) using an EL406 combination washer dispenser instrument (BioTek) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk powder and 2% goat serum, diluted in PBS. After washing 2 times with PBST, 25 μL of supernatants from hybridoma cultures or EBV-transformed cell lines were added to plates, which then were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed 4 times, and 25 μL of goat anti-human alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Meridian Life Science) diluted 1:5,000 in PBS was added to plates. After a 45-min incubation period, plates were washed 5 times and 25 μL of alkaline phosphatase substrate tablets (Sigma) diluted in Tris buffer with 1M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> was added. Optical density was read at 405 nm after 1 h using a Biotek plate reader.
