<p>The first research subject was a 50-year old woman living in the U.S. who had a history of laboratory-confirmed infection in Australia in 1987. The second subject was a 32-year old male who was exposed to the virus during childhood in Australia in a clinically diagnosed but non-laboratory confirmed case of infection. Peripheral blood was obtained from the first donor in 2015 (28 years after infection) and from the second donor in 2017 (approximately 20 years after infection) with written informed consent following approval of the study by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from both donors using density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll and were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until used in the experiments.</p>
