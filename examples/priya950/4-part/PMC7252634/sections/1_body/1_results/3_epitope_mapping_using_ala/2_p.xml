<p>As another method to distinguish antibody epitopes, we performed a quantitative competition-binding assay using biolayer interferometry (BLI). We used RRV-86 immobilized on Fc-specific anti-human IgG biosensor to capture virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing the full set of structural proteins (C-E3-E2-6K-E1). We then added two antibodies sequentially, and the percent binding of the second antibody in the presence of saturating concentrations of the first antibody was determined. Five out of twenty-one mAbs were excluded from the analysis due to undectable or weak binding to VLPs in this format. Antibodies in the panel binned roughly into two competition-binding groups, with seven mAbs in the first group (red box), seven in the second group (blue boxes), and two in an overlapping group (grey boxes) (

The order of antibody addition made a difference in the competition profile, as in some cases the first antibody blocked binding of the second antibody, but the reverse was not true, as in the case of RRV-200 and RRV-34. This effect may be due in part to steric hindrance mediated by Fc regions in the full-length antibody during binding to the VLP. While there was no correlation between whether mAbs were completely neutralizing or not and their competition group, we did observe a correlation between our alanine scanning mutagenesis data and competition data. MAbs in the first competition group (red) showed predominant epitopes within the B domain (green) and C domain (magenta) when overlaid on the CHIKV E1/E2 trimer, whereas those in the second group (orange) mapped primarily to the A domain (dark blue) and arch regions (grey) (
