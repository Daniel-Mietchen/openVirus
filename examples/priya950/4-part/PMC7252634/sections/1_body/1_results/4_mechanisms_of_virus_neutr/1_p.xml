<p>To gain insight into the mechanism(s) of neutralization used by these mAbs, we performed pre- and post-attachment neutralization assays with representative mAbs from each of the competition-binding groups. RRV-19, RRV-133, and RRV-139 were chosen from group 1, and RRV-12, RRV-130, and RRV-135 were chosen from group 2. These mAbs have a range of neutralization potencies, and at least one mAb (RRV-12) neutralizes incompletely. In the pre-attachment assay, virus was incubated with antibody at 4°C before addition to Vero cell monolayers, also at 4°C. Virus not attached to the cells and unbound antibody were washed out, and then attached virus was allowed to internalize during a brief incubation period at 37°C. Cell monolayers were stained 18 h later, as in the FRNT. All six mAbs neutralized in the pre-attachment assay, indicating that these mAbs block either cell adherence or entry of virus (

 </bold>). In the post-attachment assay, which detects effects both on viral entry and on downstream steps such as fusion from the endosome, virus was adsorbed first to cells at 4°C. Excess virus was washed out before mAb was added, also at 4°C. After a brief incubation period at 37°C to allow virus internalization, cells were overlaid with methylcellulose, incubated, and then fixed and stained 18 h later. All mAbs also blocked at post-attachment steps, although post-attachment neutralization was slightly less potent than pre-attachment for RRV-130, RRV-133, RRV-135, and RRV-139 (
