  <title>RRV mAbs improve clinical disease and reduce viral RNA burden when given therapeutically in a WT mouse model.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Three-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV strain T48 before administration of 100 Î¼g antibody by intraperitoneal injection at 24 hpi. Mice were then weighed each day over the course of 18 days and assigned a clinical score based on grip strength, gait, and righting reflex. Blind scoring of mice was performed using the following scoring system: 0, no disease; 1, mild defect in ipsilateral hind paw gripping; 2, mild defect in bilateral hind paw gripping; 3, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping; 4, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with moderate hind limb weakness, observable mild altered gait, and difficulty or failure to right self; 5, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with severe hind limb weakness, moderate altered gait, and loss of righting reflex; 6, bilateral loss in hind paw gripping with severe hind limb weakness, severely altered gait with possible dragging hind paw, and loss of righting reflex; 7, moribund. Two independent experiments were performed, for a total of n = 8 mice in each antibody group. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA of area under the curve test (****p &lt; 0.0001). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Eighteen days post-infection, the spleen, ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and ankle tissues were collected following extensive perfusion with PBS. Viral RNA was quantified through qRT-PCR and statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons test (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01; ns = not significant).
