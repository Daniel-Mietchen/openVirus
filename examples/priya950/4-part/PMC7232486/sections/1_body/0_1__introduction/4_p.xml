<p>This study quantifies 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns and vertebrate host availability in residential environments in South Texas, to compare the observed frequency of blood meals relative to the expected frequency in the study location. We rely on empirical data on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> abundance, human population density, and epidemiological data of epidemics in South Texas and in Tamaulipas, Mexico, to evaluate the risk of human-amplified urban arbovirus transmission. We present evidence contrary to the most commonly reported observation that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> feeds mostly on humans by showing a high utilization of dogs and other non-human hosts in South Texas, and that this contributes to a lower risk of human exposure to ZIKV, which reduces epidemic potential.
