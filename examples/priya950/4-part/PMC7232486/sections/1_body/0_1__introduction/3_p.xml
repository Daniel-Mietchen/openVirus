 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-driven viruses continue to have intense epidemics in the Americas, resulting in high rates of viremic humans entering the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but minimal local transmission has occurred [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This discrepancy in the magnitude of virus transmission along geo-political boundaries of the U.S.â€”Mexico border has attracted research attention to identify the mechanisms responsible for these patterns. This is especially perplexing given that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in U.S. border communities has comparable relative abundances in residential neighborhoods to areas with a much higher burden of human disease across the border in Mexico [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Prior studies have identified several factors contributing to this discrepancy, which have identified social-ecological factors, such as window screens and air conditioning, that reduce the risk of exposure to the viruses [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, despite evidence that housing quality is associated with virus transmission [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], there remains limited knowledge of how this influences the ability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to feed on humans and how proportional human feeding might drive virus transmission potential on both sides of the border.
