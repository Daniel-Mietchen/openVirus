<p>Forage ratios for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> were calculated with host availability estimated from our vertebrate surveys in the neighborhoods where we collected engorged mosquitoes. The 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> forage ratio (observed frequency of bloodmeals from a given host divided by the expected frequency) for dogs (1.61) was nearly twice the forage ratio for humans (0.81; 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the highest forage ratio for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> was on chicken (3.92; 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The human blood index (total number of human blood meals divided by the total number of engorged females with a confirmed result) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> was 30.7% and 0.8% respectively.
