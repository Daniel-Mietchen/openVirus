<p>In total, 230 bloodfed 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Sella score of 2–5) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were collected, molecularly confirmed to species and processed for the blood meal analysis (four indoor, 226 outdoor; 181 using BGS2 traps, 49 using AGO). Of these, 186 (81%) yielded a bloodmeal analysis result which include 50% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 93) from dogs (
 <italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>), 31% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 57) from humans (
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), 12% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) from cats (
 <italic>Felis catus</italic>), 3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) from chicken (
 <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) and 4% from other mammals (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Of the four 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected indoors by AGO traps, three yielded a result (one human, two dogs). Bloodfed 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with results came from two different homes in MM, two homes in DF, one home in MCH, four homes in PF/PE, 34 homes in IHE, nine homes in IHW, 19 homes in LP, 10 homes in TB, one home in LF, two homes in MLV, and two homes in WCT. For 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 124 bloodfed individuals (Sella score of 2–4) were collected, molecularly confirmed to species, and processed for bloodmeal analysis (0 indoor, 124 outdoor; 113 using BGS2 traps, 11 using AGO traps). Of these, 123 (99%) yielded a bloodmeal analysis result which included 67% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 82) from chicken, 22% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27) were from dog, 9% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) from six wild bird species and 2% from other mammals (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Two 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> samples had mixed bloodmeals including dog and human, while no 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> had evidence of mixed bloodmeals. The success of the vertebrate host identification of the blooded abdomen for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was significantly different across Sella scores (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0333; 92% for Sella score of two, 76% for three, 33% for four, and 25% for five). The success of the vertebrate host identification of the blooded abdomen for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> was not significantly different among Sella scores (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3333; 99% for Sella score of two, 100% for three, and 100% for four). The quantitative analysis of 18 published studies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns reveals that humans are the dominant host with an average of 83.1% (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If we only consider prior studies with outdoor mosquito collections, the average percentage of human feeding is 85%. Only two studies, one in Nigeria (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and this current study from South Texas, reveal feeding patterns where humans represent less than half of the bloodmeals.
