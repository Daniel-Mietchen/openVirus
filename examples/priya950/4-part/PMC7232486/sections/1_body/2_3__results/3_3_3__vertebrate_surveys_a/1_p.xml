<p>We conducted a vertebrate questionnaire for 44 homes in four communities asking about all vertebrates living in the home, property, or neighborhood (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00453">Table S3</xref>). The average number of occupants per home was 4.7 (± 0.41 SEM) and the total estimated number of homes in all four communities was 612. With our vertebrate surveys, we estimated 5,146 humans per km
 <sup>2</sup>, 4,161 dogs per km
 <sup>2</sup>, 1,751 cats per km
 <sup>2</sup>, 2,299 chickens per km

Independent from the household questionnaires, our analysis of US Census data using QGIS for the combined communities in the current study where blood-fed individuals were collected and in the eight communities with AGO surveillance [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00453">Table S5</xref>). In Nuevo Amanecer, Reynosa, we identified 885 homes in the neighborhood minus the soccer field open space. The area with homes is 0.27 km
 <sup>2</sup> and using an average occupancy of 4.2 persons per home (based on unpublished data from co-author M. A. Rodríguez-Pérez), the estimated human density for this area is 13,767 per km
 <sup>2</sup>. The human density in Reynosa is between 2.7- and 3.8-fold higher than comparable low-income communities in the LRGV.
