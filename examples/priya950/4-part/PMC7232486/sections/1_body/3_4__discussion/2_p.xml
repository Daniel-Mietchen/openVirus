<p>Non-human feeding by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> may have important consequences for arboviral pathogen transmission. For example, the receptivity of certain regions of the world to 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic>-driven arboviruses might vary not simply due to the abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, but due to the proclivity and availability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to feed on humans relative to other hosts. In that sense, threshold indices, such as R
 <sub>0</sub>, that indicate when the transmission of viruses will persist, can guide management activities and even inform urban planning and home modification to further reduce the probability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> feeding on humans.
