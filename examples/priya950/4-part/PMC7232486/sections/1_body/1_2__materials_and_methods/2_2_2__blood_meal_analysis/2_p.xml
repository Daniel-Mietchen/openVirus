<p>We adopted previously-published protocols to conduct a PCR-Sanger sequencing blood meal analysis [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Three primer pairs were used in a tiered approach: (I) A vertebrate cocktail targeting a 648 base pair region of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene, (II) blood meal (BM) primers targeting a 358 base pair region of the cytochrome b gene, and (III) ‘Herp’ primers that target a 228 base pair region of the cytochrome b gene (

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. First, every sample was tested using the vertebrate cocktail primers. Samples producing an amplicon of 648 bp were cleaned using ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and submitted to Eton Bioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) for Sanger sequencing. Sequencing results were analyzed using Geneious R9 software (Biomatters, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Only samples with ≥ 95% pairwise identity match to a vertebrate host sequence in NCBI, and ≥ 95% grade (a weighted score comprised of 
 <italic>e</italic>-value, pairwise identity, and the coverage) were accepted as a confirmed result.
