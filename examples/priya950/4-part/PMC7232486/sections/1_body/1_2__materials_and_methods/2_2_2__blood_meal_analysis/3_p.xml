<p>Based upon the outcome of the initial PCR, we continued the iterative bloodmeal analysis PCR process if there was (I) match to human basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), (II) no PCR amplicon, (III) poor sequence quality, or (IV) evidence of mixed DNA (double-nucleotide peaks in chromatograph) [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finally, using the same criteria, the analysis was either concluded or subjected to a third primer pair and PCR thermal profile, the ‘Herp’ primers [
