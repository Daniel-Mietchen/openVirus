<p>At present, molecular assays (eg, nucleic acid amplification tests and antigen tests) targeting respiratory tract specimens are recommended as critical diagnostic tests for clinical decision‐making according to influenza clinical practice guidelines in different countries.

 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> However, these tests are limited by some technical provisions and specifications for molecular assay utilization, especially in underdeveloped areas and community hospitals. Furthermore, antigen tests have poor sensitivity to some influenza viruses.

 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> This study aimed to conduct a retrospective analysis of hematological inflammatory parameters (eg, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets) and blood cell count indexes, particularly the NLR, in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza. Moreover, this study aimed to validate hematological indexes as potential indicators to discriminate influenza virus infection from non‐influenza infection, which would facilitate a clear diagnosis and enable the initiation of antiviral treatment as early as possible when molecular assays for respiratory specimen tests are not performed.
