<p>The present study retrospectively enrolled 307 suspected influenza virus‐infected patients with typical acute onset of respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion), myalgia and headache with or without fever at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2017 to June 2019. The diagnostic criteria for influenza virus infection included the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of influenza combined with positive influenza virus nucleic acid detection. Bacterial infection was confirmed by bacterial cultures. Finally, 107 patients were diagnosed with definite influenza virus infection (influenza virus positive), of which 88 had influenza A, 16 had influenza B, and 3 had combined influenza A and B (53 male and 54 female; age range: 9‐91 years; mean age: 56.54 ± 18.84 years). A total of 109 patients with respiratory symptoms were diagnosed with bacterial infection by bacterial cultures, including 33 cases of 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 9 cases of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 28 cases of 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii,</italic> and 39 cases of other bacterial species (79 male and 30 female; age range: 13‐92 years; mean age: 63.46 ± 18.53 years). A total of 91 patients were identified as negative controls with typical respiratory symptoms; these patients were negative for both the nucleic acid and bacterial culture results (58 male and 33 female; age range: 23‐95 years; mean age: 56.04 ± 18.53 years). In addition, 100 individuals were recruited for the control group (healthy controls) (60 male and 40 female; age range: 26‐64 years; mean age: 41.53 ± 9.88 years) (Figure
