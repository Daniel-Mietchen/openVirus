<p>The complete blood count was routinely examined in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza virus infection in the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood was placed in hemogram tubes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The blood count was determined using an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex‐20 instrument, Sysmex). The NLR was calculated as neutrophils/lymphocytes, the PLR as platelets/lymphocytes, and the PNR as platelets/neutrophils. The viral nucleic acid of respiratory tract specimens was detected using a Viral Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (silica‐based spin column) (BioPerfectus Technologies) and an Influenza A and B Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit (BioPerfectus Technologies) with a Roche LightCycler 480 sequence detection system (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
