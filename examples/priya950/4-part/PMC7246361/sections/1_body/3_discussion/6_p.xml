<p>In conclusion, NLR was found to have a high sensitivity in detecting influenza virus infection. PLT count had a high correlation and specificity to preliminarily discriminate influenza virus infection from suspected influenza virus infection. In addition, RBC, Hb, NLR, and PNR showed some diagnostic value for differentiating between influenza virus infection and bacterial infection. In summary, some hematological indexes (eg, PLT, NLR, RBC, and Hb) as simple early laboratory indicators have promising value in the diagnosis of influenza virus infection. Further investigation of the reference ranges of hematological parameters based on influenza virus infection and individual physiological levels is warranted.</p>
