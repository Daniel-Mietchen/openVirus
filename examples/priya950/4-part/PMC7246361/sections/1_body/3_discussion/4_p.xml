<p>Among patients with typical symptoms of respiratory influenza infection, only approximately 40% were truly infected by influenza virus during its seasonal peak based on the results of nucleic acid detection, and this percentage was much lower during the non‐epidemic season of influenza.
 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> The differential diagnosis of influenza virus from other microbial infections based only on clinical symptoms before performing the nucleic acid test is very challenging. In our retrospective analysis of the hematological parameters of suspected influenza patients, PLT count was significantly lower (169.869 ± 93.379) in influenza virus‐positive patients than in negative controls (226.209 ± 119.245) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that decreased PLT counts could differentiate influenza virus infections from others. Furthermore, PLT count returned to a normal level concomitantly while influenza patients were completely cured, indicating that PLT count had a high correlation and specificity in influenza laboratory diagnosis. This was the first study to present real laboratory data to confirm other reports on the mechanism of platelet inhibition induced by influenza virus. It has been reported that influenza virus could induce uncontrolled platelet activation to fuel a harmful inflammatory response in the respiratory tract.

Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism can be complex and further studies are warranted to confirm these associations.
