<p>In the present paper, we found that PLT was lower in the influenza virus infection group (169.869 ± 93.379) than in the negative control group (226.209 ± 119.245) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), while Hb was higher (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Moreover, the other routine blood parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) (Table 
 <xref rid="jcla23191-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In addition, L and PLT increased to normal levels concomitantly when influenza patients were completely cured (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Furthermore, no other hematological parameters were found to have significance with a complete cure of influenza (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) (Table 
 <xref rid="jcla23191-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
