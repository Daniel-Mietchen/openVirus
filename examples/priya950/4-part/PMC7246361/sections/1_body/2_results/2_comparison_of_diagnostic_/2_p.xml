<p>The results showed that WBC, N, RDW, NLR, and PLR increased significantly in the influenza virus infection group compared with the healthy control (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 for all) (Table 
 <xref rid="jcla23191-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Specifically, the sensitivity of NLR detection was higher than the common systemic inflammatory markers, including neutrophils and lymphocytes (Table 
 <xref rid="jcla23191-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). No significant differences were found between influenza virus A and B.
