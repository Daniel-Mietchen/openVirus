<p>To avoid false-positive errors in RT-PSR, we selected several common viruses with high infection rates in children for specific testing. Through the clinical diagnostic standard test, all four non-target viruses had positive clinical test results, so they can be used for specific detection (

The results for CVA-16 were sky blue, and the rest were violet. Consistent with agarose electrophoresis results, none of the above viruses showed cross-reactivity (
