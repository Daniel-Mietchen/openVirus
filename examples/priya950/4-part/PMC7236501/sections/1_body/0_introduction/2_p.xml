<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease is sometimes difficult to diagnose based on its clinical symptoms alone, as some symptoms are also common in other respiratory diseases. Since the last decade, researchers have been developing cost-effective virus detection techniques. To date, many investigations for CVA-16 detection have been established, including virus isolation combined with serological test, immunological, and molecular biological methods. The virus isolation combined with serological test is the gold standard for detection, but it is time-consuming and complicated to meet the requirements of prevention and rapid detection (

Quantitative real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a commonly used clinical screening method for HFMD and has excellent sensitivity and practicality but is still expensive and requires sophisticated instruments (
