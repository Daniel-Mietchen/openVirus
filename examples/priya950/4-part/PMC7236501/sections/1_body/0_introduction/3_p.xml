 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2015)</xref>. PSR combines the advantages of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), without complicated heterothermic apparatus, and simple PCR primer design for rapid and effective detection of pathogens. Since its emergence, PSR has been applied to the detection of bacteria and double-stranded DNA viruses (

However, Coxsackievirus is a member of the Picornaviridae family of non-enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses, whose amplification involves a complex process of reverse transcription. In this study, reverse transcription and amplification were performed in a single system at a constant temperature simply by adding DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase to the reaction system. In order to accelerate the reaction, we also designed accelerated primers so that the entire reaction could be completed within 40 min. Thus, a simple heating facility (such as a water bath) was sufficient to implement the RT-PSR requirements, eliminating costly thermal cycle instrumentation. By visualizing the turbidity change of the mixture, real-time fluorescence monitoring, and hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) chromogenic dye, the RT-PSR results could be quickly visualized. Afterward, the results were confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PSR provides strong technical support for real-time and on-site diagnostic, which fully proves its great potential in the screening and extensive application of HFMD pathogens.
