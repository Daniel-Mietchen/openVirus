<p>We developed a novel approach for rapid detection of CVA-16. The entire process, including reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification, can be completed in a single tube within 40 min. Without using any sophisticated instruments, the detection limit of RT-PSR can reach between 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl, with excellent specificity. The method was validated by clinical specimens and proven to be highly efficient and suitable for detecting CVA-16. In the future, we envision that RT-PSR may demonstrate even greater potency in clinical applications and become a novel method for isothermal nucleic acid testing of other single-stranded RNA viruses.
