<p>All the virus strains were from the Children’s Hospital of Changchun (China). Each virus used in this study underwent clinically standardized tests. Specimens identified as positive for CVA-16 by qRT-PCR were inoculated into African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, cultured in a 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. We observed the cytopathic effect (CPE) daily, harvested virus culture fluid when CPE reached + + + or + + + +, and stored it at −20°C. After three cycles of freezing and thawing, the cells burst and released the virus, which was then centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 5 min). Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant using an automated nucleic acid extractor according to the instructions. Other viruses, including Norwalk virus genogroup II (NVG II), Rotavirus A (RVA), CVA-6, and EV-A71, were used as non-target samples.
