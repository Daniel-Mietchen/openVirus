<p>Since the temperature has a huge impact on the efficiency of RT-PSR amplification, we performed the reaction at different temperatures (62–66°C) and screened the optimal temperature of the reaction by the amplified fluorescence curve. As a metal ion indicator, HNB is usually used to achieve visual product detection based on the color change of the reaction solution under natural light (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Goto et al., 2009</xref>). To make it easier to distinguish negative and positive results with the naked eye, the concentration of HNB was optimized. After the reaction, different volumes (2.5, 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 μl) of HNB indicators with a mass fraction of 0.2% were added to four groups of negative and positive samples and screened to observe the color change.
