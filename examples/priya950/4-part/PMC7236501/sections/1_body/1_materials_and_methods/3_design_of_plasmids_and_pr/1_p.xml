<p>RT-PSR primers adopt the design concept of mixed primers, that is, the primer includes two sequences that are sequentially combined with the target sequence, and can be folded into a U-like sequence during amplification. After RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, the primers were combined with the target sequence, and the steps of amplification, folding, and dissociation were repeated using the strand displacement and polymerase activity of Bst DNA Polymerase, and finally the nucleic acid sequence was amplified. VP1 is the variable capsid protein of CV-A16, which includes a major immunogenic site. It can be used to diagnose HFMD by detecting the conserved coding sequence of VP1 (GenBank Accession No.

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2019</xref>). After performing blast sequence alignment in NCBI, two sets of primers were designed using the conserved sequence of the VP1 coding region as the target sequence (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2019</xref>), including primary primers (FT and BT) and accelerated primers (LF and LB). The primary primers were used for binding and folding with the target sequence, and the accelerated primers were used to accelerate the reaction process and achieve rapid detection. An additional set of PCR primers was designed based on the sequence. These primer sequences were synthesized and HPLC-purified at Sangon Biotech. To determine the detection limit, 220-bp VP1 coding region containing the target sequence was cloned into pUC57 vectors. The detailed sequence information of the plasmid and primers are shown in
