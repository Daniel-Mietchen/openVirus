<p>Forty clinical stool samples were randomly selected for examination. Normal saline (1 ml) was added to samples (1 g) and then subjected to percussion blending. Supernatant (200 μl) was absorbed and added to the nucleic acid extraction kit. Protease K (20 μl) was added to each sample for nucleic acid extraction. Since qRT-PCR is the most widely used virus nucleic acid detection technology for CVA-16 in clinical practice (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2013</xref>), we performed qRT-PCR and RT-PSR on the extracted RNA. The results of the two methods were compared. We also collected the case information of these patients such as age, length of stay, symptoms, and signs, and we performed further comparisons and analysis.
