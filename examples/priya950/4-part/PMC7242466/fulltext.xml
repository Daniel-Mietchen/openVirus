It is recognized as a major public health concern resulting yearly in significant disease and economic burden. Frequent nucleotide substitutions lead to changes on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins on the surface of IAV particles (also known as antigenic drift) that contribute to the need for continuous vaccine updates. This evolutionary arms race between vaccine design and viral mutation contributes to annual influenza epidemics worldwide, which on average results in 3&#x02013;5 million cases of severe illness and up to 291,000 to 646,000 deaths annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The modular architecture of the segmented IAV genome allows for genetic re-assortment (antigenic shift) with other divergent IAVs, resulting in the sporadic emergence of novel viruses capable of causing large epidemics or pandemics. Circulation of a new IAV in the naive human population has caused pandemics in the past resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, the most notable in 1918 and 1919, when the Spanish flu killed ~20 to 50 million people worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Retrospective analyses of autopsy specimens from the 1918 pandemic revealed the prevalence of secondary superinfection caused by URT bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the role of bacterial co-infection in disease prognosis is not only confined to pandemics; bacterial and virus co-infection during seasonal influenza epidemics are commonly associated with increase hospital admissions, severe disease, and deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although the microbiome of non-diseased individuals is relatively stable, IAV infection has been shown to increase the diversity of bacterial taxa that are present in the URT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Specifically, IAV can cause changes in the relative abundances of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, and other taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Temporary disturbances to the microbiome due to the changes in the local epithelia during acute or chronic conditions has also been reported as a predisposing factor for infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The observed diversity in the human URT microbiome, together with its role in immunity and susceptibility to pathogens has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Other studies have reported that the URT microbiome may also play a beneficial role in modulating the inflammatory response induced during IAV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the intestinal microbiome composition has been shown to positively regulate the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway following infection with IAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms by which prior infection with IAV increase susceptibility to a secondary bacterial infection have not been determined. Importantly, the effect of IAV replication and induction of innate immune response on the composition of the human or animal URT microbiome remains to be elucidated and analyzed in depth on a community wide scale.</p><p id="Par5">Humans and ferrets share similar lung physiology, and both are known to be susceptible and transmit the same strains of the IAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This has made the ferrets an ideal model to study the dynamics of IAV infection in URT. However, it is unknown whether there is similarity between the ferret and human URT microbiome in terms of composition and its temporal dynamics and modulation upon IAV infection. In this study, we examine the longitudinal diversity of the URT microbiome of influenza-infected and uninfected human cohorts, as well as control uninfected and experimentally infected ferrets. These experiments reveal a strong consistency in the microbiome composition and dynamics between the two host systems, demonstrating that experimentally infected ferrets recapitulate closely the modulation of the microbiome observed in naturally infected humans. Our results suggest that microbiome disturbance and resilience dynamics may be critical to addressing the bacterial co-infections associated with influenza-derived morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of influenza on the human URT microbiome dynamics</title><p id="Par6">In order to determine if the human microbiome structure is modulated by the IAV infection, we established a human cohort study and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs at multiple time points after the initial influenza-prompted hospital visits (days 1&#x02013;37 after initial onset of symptoms) from 28 human subjects recruited during 2011 and 2012. As healthy controls, we included nasal swab samples taken at six time points (days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 28) from 22 healthy human subjects free of any respiratory infections (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At the extreme age ranges, the case and controls were not age balanced, with a lack of healthy controls for the nine cases older than 65 years in age and the two cases that were younger than 5 years in age. Our goal was to assess and compare the temporal microbiome biodiversity in response to ecological disturbances of the URT caused by viral infection.</p><p id="Par7">The dynamics and relative abundances of bacteria in the URT microbiome were examined by pyrosequencing of the V1&#x02013;V3 region of the 16S rRNA, which yielded a total of 2.3 million sequences, which clustered into 707 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The count abundance data for the OTUs was normalized to account for the sampling process and the library size, as confounding factors for the beta-diversity analyses. In addition, OTUs with counts &#x0003c;5 were removed to avoid inflating the importance of any contaminant sequences that might be present in the data. This resulted in over 90% of the reads mapped back to the OTUs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Metric multidimensional scaling of the beta-diversity explains 38.5% of the variability across the first three components (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The plot shows that the IAV infection status has a strong influence on the ordination of the samples, as measured by the Bray&#x02013;Curtis metric (ANOSIM <italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.696, <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The uninfected and infected communities cluster away from each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of interest, the microbiome for the IAV-infected cohort is more dynamic than that of the uninfected IAV-free cohort, validating the Anna Karenina principle of microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which refers to the notion that there is much more variability in the microbial communities of infected (dysbiotic) individuals than in healthy individuals. The nasopharyngeal samples from infected humans demonstrated higher diversity between infection states than within them (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The t-statistic for the &#x0201c;All within infection&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;All between infection&#x0201d; for the human data set was &#x02212;144.78, and the <italic>p</italic>-value was also significant (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which indicates that IAV infection in humans results in the clustering of microbiomes according to infection status.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary statistics for amplicon-based sequencing of the V1&#x02013;V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Humans</th><th>Ferrets</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total no. of samples<sup>a</sup></td><td>262</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza-negative subjects</td><td>22</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza-positive subjects</td><td>28</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total no. of reads</td><td>2,300,072</td><td>649,440</td></tr><tr><td>Total no. of OTUs</td><td>707</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>No. of reads mapped to OTUs</td><td>2,111, 66 (91.8%)</td><td>514,099 (79.2%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>All human and ferret samples were extracted from nasal washes and nasopharyngeal swabs, respectively, at several time points post symptom onset (humans) or post infection (ferret).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Diversity of the URT microbiome of human patients infected with influenza A virus (IAV).</title><p>Beta-diversity analysis for longitudinal nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from healthy and IAV-infected individuals.

Positive and unknown infected microbiomes were tested to determine if they were distinct enough to cluster separately based on their beta-diversity. Analyses of the beta-diversity metrics using PCoA, focusing just on the IAV-infected samples, did not allow deriving any conclusions from this analysis alone. In addition, the grouping of infected samples based on gender did not show any significant association (ANOSIM <italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.118 d<italic>f</italic> 1), implying that there was no significant effect of gender on the clustering of the samples (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). When we used distances between the samples as the response variable (ADONIS d<italic>f</italic> 1, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009), only 0.9% of the variation in the distances was explained when the gender of the patients was accounted for as a predictor of the model. Hence, sex could not be correlated with the microbiome of the infected human samples. Age and effects of post visit antibiotic treatment on the microbiome trends were also examined.

Thus, we used the Infinite Dirichlet-multinomial Mixture Model (iDMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which is an extension of the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model (DMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> that helps understand and interpret taxon abundance data by adding statistical validation if a taxa is associated with a given case&#x02013;control condition. This is an un-supervised clustering method that applies Bayesian statistics to quantitatively assess the data and accurately capture the features that are present. Essentially, given a set of subsampled distributions, the iDMM model predicts the original number of full-size distributions together with their composition. The nonparametric nature of the iDMM model makes it ideal for understanding the complex ecological data in this study, where the original number of the sampled communities (known as ecostates) is unknown.</p><p id="Par11">The iDMM model was run over 2000 iterations over all data points (50 patients at multiple time points), which collapsed the data into a total of four ecostates (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Plotting the mean of the likelihood ratio at each iteration showed that, 25 iterations into the analysis, the maximum likelihood ratio converges for the model. One of the four ecostates included all 127 uninfected data points (or the healthy ecostate), while the 135 infected data points were distributed across the three other ecostates (or unhealthy ecostates). Interestingly, a few patients moved from the unhealthy ecostates during acute influenza infection to the healthy ecostate in the later time points.

We collected nasal washes from seven uninfected ferrets and seven ferrets infected with the A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) pandemic strain, at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post infection (dpi).

Our results strongly suggest that the core URT microbiome is perturbed by IAV infection via direct and uncharacterized indirect processes, which may in turn might facilitate co-infections with bacterial pathogens causing increased hospitalizations and morbidity associated with IAV infection. In addition, our results provide a clear approach for the design of future studies explicitly examining the mechanistic links between IAV and bacterial co-infection, along with the development of therapeutic treatments aimed at the microbiome as a community.</p><p id="Par20">Without disturbance or perturbation, the URT microbiome was stable in both uninfected humans and ferrets. IAV does not directly infect any microbiome constituents, yet infection disturbs the healthy-state microbiome in both hosts in a statistically robust manner. The microbiomes of infected (unhealthy) individuals or animals were quite different from each other (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, in both hosts, unhealthy microbiomes were divergent from the healthy microbiomes, and numerous community assemblies were possible in the unhealthy state. This is a clear demonstration of the Anna Karenina principle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, restated as &#x0201c;all healthy microbiomes are the same, while unhealthy microbiomes are unique.&#x0201d; This high diversity of unhealthy microbiomes during early stages of acute infection is consistent with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but here we demonstrate specifically that it can occur as a consequence of an indirect disturbance such as IAV infection. In agreement, in recent studies changes in the microbiome structure were also reported in a household contact setting in secondary cases of IAV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and in a cohort of infected individuals with either H3N2 Influenza Infection or individuals infected with Influenza B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We propose that the disturbance of the healthy URT microbiome creates transient ecological niches for opportunistic bacterial pathogens. How viral infection induces a disturbance in the microbiome requires further assessment. Nevertheless, the host antiviral responses such as the induction of interferon during IAV infection could contribute to the perturbation of the microbiome in a dynamic manner, though this requires host and microbiome metatranscriptomics or metaproteomics measurements in controlled experiments focused at the onset of infection. Nevertheless, maximum disturbance correlated with maximum viral loads and weight loss in the ferret model, which suggests a close relationship between active infection, disease, and disturbance of the microbiome, with kinetics that are similar to the antiviral response induced during IAV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to a recent study of previously healthy individuals experimentally infected with a H3N2 influenza strain from 2005, where no oropharyngeal microbiome changes were reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This discrepancy might be due to the fundamentally different nature of the oro- and nasopharyngeal microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, to potential differences induced by natural versus experimental infection in humans, or due to intrinsic differences induced by different IAV subtypes. No significant influence of the host type (age and sex) or behavior (antibiotic usage) was observed on the temporal nature of the microbiome elasticity. However, more statistical power would be needed to draw any further robust associations from the data. This is particularly the case for our cases under 5 years of age and greater than 65 years of age, for which we lacked healthy age-matched controls. Hence, additional human cohort studies to underpin the factors modulating microbiome dynamics during IAV infection are warranted.</p><p id="Par21">The sole statistical exception to the high community diversity of infected microbiomes was the increased relative abundance of <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>, regardless of age, sex, antibiotic treatment, or even host organism. Yet, the bloom of <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> is consistent with previous reports in H1N1-infected patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It must be noted that, while the DNA extraction method used could result in a slight underrepresentation of Gram-positive bacteria, this bias would be consistent across both infected and healthy control samples. In our study, <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> are present in relatively low proportions in the healthy microbiome of these host organisms. Therefore, their bloom might be due to a more hostile environment for the other taxa or perhaps a more hospitable environment for the <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>, making this an excellent candidate for future strain isolation, genome sequencing, and transcriptional profiling. The differences in relative abundance observed between the infected cohorts opens the idea of using treatments capable of modulating the microbiome back into the healthy ecostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Such a treatment would be homologous to those proposed for perturbing or restoring the gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Understanding how and why <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> succeed after disturbance will provide valuable information for conducting future microbiome centric URT studies in a controlled setting. It should be noted that the blooming <italic>Pseudomonads</italic> are not <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and understanding their functional potential and role requires shotgun metagenomics analyses for more detailed phylogenetic and functional profiling.</p><p id="Par22">In addition, in humans secondary <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infections have been extensively described before, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infections have been specifically linked to nosocomial infections as a result respiratory support treatments in hospital settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It is currently unknown whether infection with other respiratory viruses can also induce the modulation of the URT microbiome; however, since severe viral infections often require respiratory support, including intubation, it is likely that co-infection with pathogens such as the <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> could actually be favored due to previous perturbations of the microbiome. Hence, additional associative studies to elucidate factors that modulate the temporal change of the microbiome structure could also aid in understanding the factors that promote or support secondary bacterial colonization during severe respiratory viral infections.</p><p id="Par23">In the ferret model, there is a clear demonstration of ecological resilience in the URT microbiome; namely a return to the original community after disturbance, a phenomenon also observed, albeit less clearly, in the human samples, which had an unknown and likely more diverse ecostate prior to infection. Similar observations have been reported in the human gut microbiome after the disturbance associated with antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, though our findings expands it to the URT and the indirect effects of the IAV infection. The controlled experiments with ferrets resulted in near complete recovery. Human URT microbiomes do not unequivocally show a return to the health state, but in several patients, the microbiome returned to the healthy ecostate. Although it is tempting to suggest that the ferret microbiome might have greater elasticity (i.e., less time required for demonstration of resilience), there are multiple potential reasons for the discrepancy between ferrets and humans. For instance, the routes of and mode of infection are different, with the ferrets receiving a high volume containing a high titer dose intranasally, whereas human likely get infected by the aerosol route at potentially lower titer. On the other hand, considering metabolic rate relative to organism size, the ferret may recover at a more rapid rate simply due to a higher metabolism. More pertinently, the human cohort has an undetermined infection date, were infected by different viral strains (and viral variants as determined by whole IAV genome sequences) and had a selection bias towards phenotypically responsive patients (e.g., symptomatic hospitalized patients), where zero time (day 0) was the first day of symptom. Beyond the potential differences in absolute temporal trends in microbiome resilience and elasticity, the human and ferret microbiomes share similar trends at the ecosystem and individual taxon level that warrant further experimentation. The results here provide an experimental baseline for examining both predictive and therapeutic intervention focused experiments in the ferret model system. For example, the presented hypothesis that IAV driven microbiome disturbance increases the propensity for bacterial pathogen co-infection can be robustly tested by bi-partite exposures to viral, and then bacterial pathogens. The effects of lifestyle (diet, smoking, exercise) and abiotic influences (humidity, temperature) on the microbiome and its resilience should also be examined, particularly with regards to temporal dynamics of microbiome disturbance and recovery. Potential therapeutic approaches involve thwarting the associated threat of opportunistic bacterial pathogens or interventions focused on the bloom of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, where probiotic treatments could be explored to maintain the homeostasis as seen in the healthy individuals. Our results are especially relevant in the context of secondary bacterial infections following primary infection with IAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Multiple studies, including this one, have now shown that a subset of the taxa that are most frequently associated with secondary infections have increased relative abundance during IAV infection. It is possible that such outcomes could be reduced by modulating the host immune response during IAV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Reducing the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such secondary infections would improve quality of life and longevity while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Human sample collection and study design</title><p id="Par24">Patient clinical&#x02013;epidemiological data, along with nasopharyngeal swabs were collected after informed written consent was obtained under protocols 11-116 and 16-066, reviewed and approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) before the start of sample collection. Between July and August of 2011 and June and September of 2012 (during the Southern Hemisphere autumn&#x02013;winter season), a total of 146 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from 30 hospitalized patients in Santiago, Chile, diagnosed clinically with influenza-like illness (ILI). Of the 30 patients in the study, 28 were confirmed and subtyped as H1N1pdm09 or H3N2 Influenza through RT-PCR by the&#x000a0;Clinical Virology Laboratory at PUC. The remaining two patients could not be confirmed as influenza positive by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR and/or the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, so they were not included in further analyses.

Upon collection of all samples, the timing of the infected cohort samples was established as the time in days since the onset of symptoms. Control samples from 22 healthy individuals, confirmed as negative against influenza A virus and 13 other common respiratory viruses, were obtained at the outpatient clinic with the same criteria in March to June of 2014.
