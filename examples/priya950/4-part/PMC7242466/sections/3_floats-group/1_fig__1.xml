  <title>Diversity of the URT microbiome of human patients infected with influenza A virus (IAV).</title>
  <p>Beta-diversity analysis for longitudinal nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from healthy and IAV-infected individuals. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Brayâ€“Curtis distances was done for samples from humans, labeled as influenza positive in red (P, indicating data points with positive IAV qRT-PCR detection), influenza unknown in yellow (U, indicates time points from positive individuals that were below the qRT-PCR detection limits at different time points after the onset of symptoms), and uninfected samples in blue (Flu negative). The total variability explained by all three principal coordinates (PCs) is shown on the axes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.</p>
