  <title>Qualitative and quantitative representation of the temporal trajectory of the ferret microbiome.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Percent body weights of groups of seven ferrets mock inoculated (uninfected) or intranasally infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu of influenza A/Neth/602/09 virus. Body weights were determined daily for 14 days, and are represented as the average percent body weight compared with the initial weight of each animal on the day of inoculation and error bars are the standard deviation for each time point. 
   <bold>b</bold> Viral titers of nasal washes of ferrets infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu of A/Neth/602/09 virus. Nasal washes were obtained on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post infection, and are represented as the average viral titer of seven infected animals. Error bars indicate the standard deviation for each time point. The limit of detection of the assay was 10 pfu/ml (dashed line). 
   <bold>b</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold> Comprehensive taxonomic breakdown of two influenza-infected, both representing divergent baseline microbiomes (
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold>) and uninfected ferret (
   <bold>e</bold>), at different time points. Taxa abundance values for top ten most prevalent taxa at the order level for different time points (0–14 dpi). Only taxa labels with a confidence score of &gt; = 90% were retained in the analysis. The remaining taxa are pooled into an additional taxon labeled “Other”. 
   <bold>f</bold>, 
   <bold>g</bold> The boxplots represent the relative 
   <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> abundance across all infected (
   <bold>f</bold>) and unin
   <bold>f</bold>ected (
   <bold>g</bold>) ferrets (
   <italic>n</italic> = 7 for each). The box represents the interquartile range, the horizontal line within the box indicates the median for each sample grouping, observations are indicated by dots, and the whiskers outside the box extend from the highest to the lowest observation represented in the plot. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
