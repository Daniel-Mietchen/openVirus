<p id="Par27">Reads were de-multiplexed according to barcodes followed by trimming of both barcodes and adapter sequences. Following the initial processing of the sequence data, sequences were combined, dereplicated, and aligned in mothur (version 1.36.1

 </sup>) using the SILVA template
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup> (SSURef_NR99_123), and the sequences were organized into clusters of representative sequences based on taxonomy called operational taxonomic units (OTU) using the UPARSE pipeline
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. In the ferrets, all except two libraries generated more than 3000 reads per sample. A total of 649,440 sequences were subsequently clustered into 259 OTUs with a sequence similarity threshold of 97%

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>, a length threshold of 250 bp and an expected error threshold of 0.15. For human samples, the distribution of reads per sample was much more variable, with an average of ~10,000 reads per sample. A handful of under-represented samples (below read threshold of 50 reads) were removed prior to the downstream analyses. A total of 2,300,072 sequences were sorted into 707 OTUs, using the same thresholds as above and the same downstream filtering of the OTUs and samples was performed in a similar manner. Initial filtering of the samples ensured discarding samples containing less than five sequences. Libraries were normalized using metagenomeSeq’s cumulative sum-scaling method

 </sup> to account for library size acting as a confounding factor for the beta-diversity analysis. In addition to discarding singletons, OTUs that were observed fewer than five times in the count data were also filtered out to avoid the inflation of any contaminants that might skew the diversity estimates.
