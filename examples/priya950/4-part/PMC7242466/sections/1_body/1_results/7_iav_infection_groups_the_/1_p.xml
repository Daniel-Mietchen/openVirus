<p id="Par17">Since the timing of infection was controlled in the ferret experiment, we hypothesized that upon infection the microbiome structure would be ordered into more defined ecostates for the infected and uninfected animals. Hence, we run the iDMM model over 1000 iterations, which collapsed the data into two ecostates. The mean of the likelihood ratio at each iteration converged 70 iterations into the analysis, splitting into two ecostates until the last iteration. Of interest, one of the two ecostates comprised all the uninfected data points (or the healthy ecostate), while the other contained most of the influenza-infected data points (the unhealthy ecostate, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There were notable exceptions; despite the perturbation caused by the infection, all day 14 samples in the infected cohort moved from the unhealthy ecostate to the healthy ecostate, which is also shown in the ordination plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The healthy ecostate also contained a few of the earlier data points (day 0 and day 1) of the influenza-infected cohort, indicating a temporal lag in changes to the ferret microbiome at those time points when the IAV titer was submaximal (Fig.
