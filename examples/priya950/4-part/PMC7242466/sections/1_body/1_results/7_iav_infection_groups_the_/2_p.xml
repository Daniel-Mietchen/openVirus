<p id="Par18">The iDMM analysis for ferrets predicted the diagnostic OTU for the unhealthy ecostate to be Otu000004 that belonged to the 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> order, with a posterior-predictive probability of 0.11 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), followed by Otu000003 with the next highest predictive probability of 0.08, belonging more specifically to the 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). This is consistent with the qualitative taxonomic profiling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For the healthy ecostate, Otu000001, which belongs to the 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic> family, was the diagnostic OTU with a posterior-predictive probability of 0.19 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The posterior probabilities for each taxon were calculated within each sample by observing the fraction of simulated samples with more counts than the observed value. The probabilities associated with the diagnostic OTUs can be thought in terms of being relative to all taxa present. Similar to the human data, the diagnostic OTUs for both ecostates are among the ten most abundant OTUs for the data (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). This was also confirmed when the microbiome for all ferrets from both infected and uninfected groups was analyzed individually (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), which indicates that 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> are not only predictive of the unhealthy ecostate but also undergo the greatest temporal dynamic change during IAV infection. This was confirmed when alpha-diversity analyses were conducted, which showed a drastic decrease in diversity by day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The results from the random-forest analysis aligned well with the iDMM diagnostic OTU prediction in that Otu000004 (
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>) was the most predictive attribute for the samples from IAV-infected ferrets, followed by Otu000028 (
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>) and Otu000017 (
 <italic>Bacillales</italic>), with a maximum accuracy of 96% (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that IAV infection results in a nasal bloom of multiple 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> in the ferrets, displacing the 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic> associated with the healthy and stable ecostate.
