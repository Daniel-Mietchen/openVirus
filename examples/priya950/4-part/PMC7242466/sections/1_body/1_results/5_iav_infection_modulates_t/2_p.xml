<p id="Par15">Quantitative metrics of diversity were used to compare the microbiomes of influenza-infected and control ferrets. Beta-diversity distance analyses (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) demonstrated that ferret microbiomes had higher diversity between infection states than within them. Student’s two sample two-sided 
 <italic>t</italic> tests confirmed that the diversity between the two states (infected and uninfected) was statistically significant, with the microbiomes of infected ferrets being more diverse (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The t-statistic for the “All within infection” versus “All between infection” was −28.681 corresponding to a Bonferroni-corrected parametric 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of 8.85e-161 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The PCoA and statistical analyses showed that infected ferrets have a far more dynamic URT microbiome than that of the uninfected group. A separate healthy baseline experiment was conducted, in which we identified some divergence of the microbiomes in the absence of infection, hence differences in the microbiome structure of each animal was expected given the high level of personalization, and that ferrets are outbred. Remarkably, 7/7 
 <italic>T</italic> = 14 time points converged to the healthy microbiome, together with 4/7 
 <italic>T</italic> = 0 time point samples. Overall, the quantitative examination revealed that the range for infection-associated beta-diversity was much lower in the ferret samples than it was from human clinical samples.
