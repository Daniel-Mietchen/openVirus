<p id="Par14">We hypothesized that IAV infection in ferrets will result in the clustering of microbiomes according to infection status, as observed during IAV infection in humans. Therefore, using the well-established ferret model of IAV infection, we designed a longitudinal study resembling the clinical specimens obtained from human patients to obtain nasal wash samples from infected animals. We collected nasal washes from seven uninfected ferrets and seven ferrets infected with the A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) pandemic strain, at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post infection (dpi). The dynamics and relative abundances of bacteria in the URT microbiome were examined by pyrosequencing of the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA using similar thresholds for length, and expected error as was chosen for the human data. A total of 649,440 reads clustered into 259 (OTUs) with 79% of reads mapping (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As before, the count abundance data for the OTUs was normalized, and the low abundance taxa were filtered out from the count data. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of beta-diversity between the healthy and IAV-infected groups demonstrated variability consistent with the virus perturbing and modulating the microbiome structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Infection status strongly influenced the ordination of the samples as measured by the Bray–Curtis beta-diversity metric (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.503, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). The IAV-negative and IAV-positive ferret microbial communities formed discrete clusters, while samples from the IAV-infected animals showed divergence from each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). By the final time point, day 14, the microbiome of infected ferrets (light blue) was more similar to the day 0 samples (lavender) and those of the uninfected controls (dark blue).
