<p id="Par12">We also identified a diagnostic OTU for each of these ecostates, which is the OTU with the highest posterior-predictive probability in the ecostate and therefore drives the clustering. The iDMM analysis predicted the diagnostic OTU for the healthy ecostate to be Otu000008 which belongs to the 
 <italic>Flavobacteria</italic> class (
 <italic>Cloacibacterium</italic>), with a posterior-predictive probability of 0.08, followed by Otu000010 (Corynebacterium_1) and Otu000013 (
 <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic>), belonging to the class Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For the unhealthy ecostates, Otu000003, Otu000004, and Otu000002 were diagnostic for Ecostate 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Ecostate 1 had the largest number of infected data points (104), followed by Ecostate 3 (20) and Ecostate 2 (8). Otu000003 and Otu000002 belong to the 
 <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic> family (the latter being an unclassified 
 <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic>), with relatively high posterior probabilities associated with each of them (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Otu000004 belonged to the 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> class, and was the diagnostic OTU for Ecostate 2 with eight infected data points. The diagnostic OTUs for all four ecostates for the human samples are also among the first ten most abundant OTUs for the data.
