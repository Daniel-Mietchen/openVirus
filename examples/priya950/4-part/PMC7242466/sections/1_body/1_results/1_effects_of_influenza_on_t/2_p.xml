<p id="Par7">The dynamics and relative abundances of bacteria in the URT microbiome were examined by pyrosequencing of the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA, which yielded a total of 2.3 million sequences, which clustered into 707 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The count abundance data for the OTUs was normalized to account for the sampling process and the library size, as confounding factors for the beta-diversity analyses. In addition, OTUs with counts &lt;5 were removed to avoid inflating the importance of any contaminant sequences that might be present in the data. This resulted in over 90% of the reads mapped back to the OTUs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Metric multidimensional scaling of the beta-diversity explains 38.5% of the variability across the first three components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The plot shows that the IAV infection status has a strong influence on the ordination of the samples, as measured by the Bray–Curtis metric (ANOSIM 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.696, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). The uninfected and infected communities cluster away from each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of interest, the microbiome for the IAV-infected cohort is more dynamic than that of the uninfected IAV-free cohort, validating the Anna Karenina principle of microbiomes

 </sup>, which refers to the notion that there is much more variability in the microbial communities of infected (dysbiotic) individuals than in healthy individuals. The nasopharyngeal samples from infected humans demonstrated higher diversity between infection states than within them (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The t-statistic for the “All within infection” versus “All between infection” for the human data set was −144.78, and the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value was also significant (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which indicates that IAV infection in humans results in the clustering of microbiomes according to infection status.
