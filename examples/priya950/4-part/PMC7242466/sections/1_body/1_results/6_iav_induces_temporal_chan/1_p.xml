<p id="Par16">To assess the correlation of clinical symptoms over time during acute IAV infection, we monitored the body weight of all ferrets from 0 to 14 dpi, which demonstrated a clear weight loss among the infected animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As expected, the maximum weight loss coincided with peak IAV titer from 3 to 5 dpi, and recovery in body weight correlated with the lack of detectable virus after day 7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). To better visualize the temporal trajectory of the ferret microbiome, the community composition for two influenza-infected (with divergent baseline microbiomes) and one uninfected ferret (ferret_595 and ferret_587, and ferret_592, respectively) were examined with regards to their taxonomic profiles across six different time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–e</xref>). At the order level, the IAV-infected ferrets exhibited peak 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> abundance at days 5 and 7 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–g</xref>), which correlated with maximal weight loss and peak viral titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>), suggesting the direct or indirect influence of the infection on the microbiome. A phylogenetic inference shows this OTU to be in the order 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>, but belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). A few of the less-abundant phyla included 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The abundance of 
 <italic>Pseudomonodales</italic> decreased over time in the infected ferrets, reaching the basal abundance found in healthy ferrets 14 dpi. For the uninfected ferrets, the microbiomes were more stable and 
 <italic>Clostridiales</italic> was the most abundant taxonomic group, followed by 
 <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> (light blue). 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> were among the least-abundant taxonomic group in the uninfected controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). This was also observed when we analyzed the microbiome abundance of each individual animal in both infected and uninfected groups (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). These results demonstrate that IAV infection induces a dynamic modulation of the microbiome structure in the URT of ferrets, which correlated with viral replication and pathogenesis.
