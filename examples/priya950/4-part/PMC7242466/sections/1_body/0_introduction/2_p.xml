<p id="Par4">Although the microbiome of non-diseased individuals is relatively stable, IAV infection has been shown to increase the diversity of bacterial taxa that are present in the URT

 </sup>. Specifically, IAV can cause changes in the relative abundances of

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the intestinal microbiome composition has been shown to positively regulate the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway following infection with IAV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms by which prior infection with IAV increase susceptibility to a secondary bacterial infection have not been determined. Importantly, the effect of IAV replication and induction of innate immune response on the composition of the human or animal URT microbiome remains to be elucidated and analyzed in depth on a community wide scale.
