<p id="Par19">This longitudinal study describes taxonomic microbiome population dynamics in the upper respiratory tract of humans and ferrets during IAV infection. Given the unequivocal association between viral and bacterial co-infection and influenza disease severity, there is a pressing need to better understand how perturbation of the host microbiome correlates with viral infections that facilitate opportunistic co-infections. The nature of the 16S sequencing approach taken, that is a loci-based population survey, means that we can address taxonomy-centric ecological principles of disturbance and resilience

 </sup> in the URT microbiome. Our results strongly suggest that the core URT microbiome is perturbed by IAV infection via direct and uncharacterized indirect processes, which may in turn might facilitate co-infections with bacterial pathogens causing increased hospitalizations and morbidity associated with IAV infection. In addition, our results provide a clear approach for the design of future studies explicitly examining the mechanistic links between IAV and bacterial co-infection, along with the development of therapeutic treatments aimed at the microbiome as a community.
