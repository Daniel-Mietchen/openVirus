 <title>Funding</title>
 <p>OpenHealth coordinates the GIHSN network and performs data collection and analysis. OpenHealth is paid for this workÂ by the Foundation for Influenza Epidemiology, a 
  <italic>Fondation de France</italic> created by Sanofi Pasteur in 2015 to support influenza epidemiological research. In addition, the Foundation for Influenza Epidemiology provided financial support to sites for work related to the GIHSN, although each site also has additional sources of funding. Sanofi Pasteur does not have access to the data and did not participate in the analysis, interpretation, or decision to publish the results of the current study. Medical writing was paid for by OpenHealth.
