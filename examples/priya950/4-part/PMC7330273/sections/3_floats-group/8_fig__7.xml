  <p>Adjusted coefficients for long hospital stays in influenza-positive patients. Coefficient estimates for length of hospital stay were determined in influenza-positive patients aged &lt; 15 years (
   <italic>N</italic> = 1306), 15 to &lt; 65 years (
   <italic>N</italic> = 1189), and ≥ 65 years (
   <italic>N</italic> = 775) by linear mixed-effects regression model adjusted for age and vaccination status and with site as a random effect. The coefficient indicates the change in length of hospital stay in days when the indicated factor is changed by one unit (i.e. from yes to no). Abbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease
