<p id="Par17">After patients or their legal representatives provided informed consent, nasopharyngeal, nasal, oral, or oropharyngeal samples are obtained from each patient (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> for sample collection). Samples are placed in a single viral transport media tube and stored at ≤−20 °C at the study site or sent directly to the coordinating site’s reference laboratory for testing. Samples are collected within 48 h of hospital admission. Influenza virus infection is confirmed by RT-PCR, and positive samples are subtyped by RT-PCR to identify A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Yamagata-lineage, and B/Victoria-lineage strains. Core questionnaires (one for patients aged &lt; 5 years and one for patients aged ≥5 years), translated into the local language, are used to collect patient demographics, comorbidities, and influenza vaccination status through face-to-face interviews of patients or legal representatives, interviews of attending physicians, and a review of clinical records. Obesity is assessed only in adults (≥18 years). Direct exposure to smoking is assessed in participants ≥14 years of age and passive exposure to smoking in participants &lt; 14 years of age. Obesity was defined as a body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>. Functional status is assessed by Barthel Index [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in patients aged ≥65 years. Patients were considered vaccinated if they had received at least one dose of a 2017–2018 seasonal influenza vaccine ≥14 days before the onset of symptoms. Physicians involved in clinical care of patients may be involved in patient recruitment but are not involved in assessing eligibility for inclusion.
