<p id="Par43">This study showed that more than one in ten hospitalized cases of influenza virus infections detected during the 2017â€“2018 influenza season was complicated by need for mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, or death. Common factors associated with an increased risk of severe influenza were also found to be associated with complicated or longer hospitalization in these patients, but the study did not find differences between influenza strains. The study also provides further evidence that influenza can cause severe illness even in individuals without high-risk conditions. Further studies are needed to determine how other factors, such as health-seeking behaviors, access to care, access to vaccination, and appropriate use of antivirals influence complicated hospitalization due to influenza virus infection.</p>
