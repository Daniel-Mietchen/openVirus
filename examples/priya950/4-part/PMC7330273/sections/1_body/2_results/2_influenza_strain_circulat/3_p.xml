<p id="Par29">In the Central American Caribbean transmission zone (Mexico), the timing of seasonal influenza was similar to that of the Northern Hemisphere transmission zones. However, strain circulation differed, with influenza A/H3N2 (67.2%) virus dominating and little influenza B detected. In the Temperate South America transmission zone (Argentina), influenza circulated earlier (weeks 30 to 39 of 2017), with influenza B/Yamagata-like (49.0%) and A/H1N1pdm09 (45.1%) viruses dominating.</p>
