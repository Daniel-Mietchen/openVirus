<p id="Par28">In the influenza transmission zones of North America (Canada), Eastern Europe (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Czech Republic, and Romania), East Asia (China), and South West Europe (Spain, Serbia, and France), influenza was first detected during the last few weeks of 2017 or first few weeks of 2018, after which circulation reached a single peak and then tapered off by week 10 to 15 of 2018 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Influenza B/Yamagata-like, A/H1N1pdm09, and A/H3N2 viruses dominated and co-circulated in Eastern and South West Europe. In Eastern Asia, all strains co-circulated, but influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus was dominant. Even within these transmission zones, however, strain circulation varied substantially (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, influenza B/Yamagata-like virus was common at all sites within the East Europe transmission zone, but influenza A/H3N2 virus was common only at the St. Petersburg and Moscow sites (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Influenza A and B strains also co-circulated in North America (Canada), but subtyping was mostly unavailable at the time of the current analysis.
