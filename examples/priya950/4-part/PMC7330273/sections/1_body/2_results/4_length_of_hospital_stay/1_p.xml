<p id="Par34">The mean length of hospital stay in influenza-positive admissions was lowest in admissions aged &lt; 15 years (approximately 6 days) and highest in admissions aged 65–74 years (approximately 9 days) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). COPD (coefficient, 3.22 [95% CI, 1.18–5.27]) and diabetes (coefficient, 2.77 [95% CI, 0.59–4.94]) were associated with a longer hospital stay and influenza B (vs. A) with a shorter hospital stay (coefficient, − 1.82 [− 3.61−− 0.03]) in influenza-positive admissions aged 50 to &lt; 65 years, and other chronic conditions (coefficient, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.06–2.33]) were associated with a longer hospital stay in influenza-positive admissions aged 15 to &lt; 50 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Hospitalization during the previous 12 months was associated with a longer hospital stay in influenza-positive admissions aged &lt; 15 years (coefficient, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.41–1.52]). No factors associated with a longer hospital stay were identified in influenza-positive admissions aged ≥65 years. Length of hospital stay did not differ between influenza A and B for any age group. The length of hospital stay also did not differ between A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 for any age group (data not shown).
