<p id="Par22">A total of 28,096 hospitalized patients at 46 participating hospitals in 13 countries were screened for eligibility (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Six of the sites included in the GIHSN during the 2017–2018 influenza season (Paris [France], Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Peru, Poland, and Tunisia) were not included in the current analysis because they recruited fewer than 40 patients each. Of the 27,096 screened patients, 12,803 (47.3%) met selection criteria and were included in the analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most common reasons for exclusion were admission outside the epidemic season for the site, not having the required symptoms, or having had symptoms for &gt; 7 days.
