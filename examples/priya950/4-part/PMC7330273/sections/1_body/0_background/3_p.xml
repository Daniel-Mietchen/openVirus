<p id="Par13">The GIHSN has reported epidemiological findings from 2012–2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], 2013–2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], 2014–2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and 2016–2017 influenza seasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The studies have shown that all strains of influenza can result in hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death and that the strains responsible for severe cases vary substantially between seasons, sites, and even within single regions or countries. In addition, these studies have confirmed that influenza can cause serious outcomes not only in older adults, individuals with comorbidities, and pregnant women but also in the wider population, irrespective of age, sex, or comorbidities [
