<p>N is population size of the community, 1000 in our simulation. Susceptible individuals in class S in contact with the virus enter the exposed class E. Exposed individuals undergo an incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days, before progressing to the infectious class I: infectious individuals eventually move to R (death or recovered). We assumed no further transmission would occur once a person entered into the status of R. We began the simulation assuming the aggregate of S, E, I, R to be 1000, and simulation started with S = 999, E = 1, I = 0, and R = 0. We constructed mathematical models of prediction for the following 100 days after importation of one infection as follows: we assumed the parameters to be distributed uniformly, which means each parameter has an equal chance of taking a value within the range in each scenario. For example, in scenario (a), the nu was chosen from 0.5 to 1 with equal probability density.</p>
