<p>With five scenarios in β, three in δ, and three in ν, we developed 45 scenarios and simulated each. With stochastic imputation, data between upper limit and lower limit of each parameter were assigned randomly. While certain parameters such as ν outside China remain unknown, we incorporated some known parameters with some intervals into our simulation model. For example, β in a study conducted in China was 1/7 [
