<p>We obtained the number of patients in each status (i.e., S, E, I, and R) at every 0.2 day from the beginning to the 100th day using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We set a sampling sequence of 200 random samples without warmup. Two-sided 95% credible intervals (CrI) were also calculated.</p>
