<p>Among 45 scenarios, the worst scenario, in which the largest number of infected and recovered would occur, was when β was 0.8–1, δ was 1/14–1/10, and ν was 1/10–1/7. The simulation showed a total number of recovered or removed patients of 997 (95% CrI 990–1000) at day 100 and maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232–478) (
