<p>Our study does have several inherent limitations. First, because most parameters regarding 2019-nCoV remain unknown, especially those in different countries other than China, we had to rely on arbitrary hypothetical numbers, and they may not be accurate. A table compares our scenarios with estimated/assumed parameters used in studies for patients in China (
 <xref rid="jcm-09-00944-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Second, there is a hypothesis that asymptomatic patients could be infectious to others [
 <xref rid="B18-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], although how frequently this occurs remains unknown. We did not incorporate this hypothesis into our analysis. Third, we assumed that there would be no nosocomial outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the region we hypothesized, presuming adequate infection control practices could prevent this occurring. However, breach of infection control practice could happen in any area and we have had nosocomial outbreaks of imported infections in developed nations such as Canada [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the United States [
 <xref rid="B20-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and South Korea [
 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fourth, we hypothesized that 2019-nCoV infection would lead to fairly long-lasting immunity and did not assume the possibility of re-infection to the infected persons. With these limitations, we need to gain more data, and to study the risk of this new infection and the virus further.
