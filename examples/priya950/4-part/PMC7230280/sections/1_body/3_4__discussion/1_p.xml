<p>The number of new patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection keeps increasing as of this writing [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several studies estimated basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) by different methods and they range from 2.2 to 5.5 [

 <sub>0</sub> in countries outside China has not been fully investigated as of this writing [

 <xref rid="B8-jcm-09-00944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since R
 <sub>0</sub> is determined not only by virologic nature and biological characteristics of hosts, but also by other factors, such as the number of close contacts with the infected, use of protection such as surgical masks, or timely isolation of patients at health care facilities, published mathematical models based on existing coronavirus and other epidemics within China might not apply to 2019-nCoV infections in a different setting. Our simulation with multiple scenarios indeed demonstrated that shortening the duration from the onset of symptoms to medical visit could decrease the number of infected even with the same level of force of infection. For example, our simulations suggested if β was 0.8–1, and the patient spent 7 to 10 days without attending medical services, almost all in the community of 1000 would be infected within 2 months. If β was the same, but a patient spent only 2 to 4 days before visiting a hospital, only less than 200 might be infected by day 100. With advanced reporting systems and adequate infection control practices in health care facilities, transmissibility of this virus could be decreased in other developed countries compared to Wuhan. Therefore, the estimation of the risk of secondary outbreaks separately, as we have done, has value in infection control in other nations.
