<p>The mean age, inpatient mortality, and discharge rates vary from year to year. Influenza discharges over the time interval are found in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>. The characterization of the variables are listed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG2">2</xref>. For the percentage of inpatient mortality, the deviation from the linear configuration was not statistically significant, with a P-value = 0.75 and F-value = 0.09. Similarly, the mean age was also not statistically significant, with a P-value = 0.97 and F-value = 0.001. However, the linear regression analysis for the rate of discharges was remarkable for statistical significance with a P-value = 0.0002, and F-value = 19.5. No pattern was discernable in year-to-year changes in inpatient mortality (taken by subtracting the mortality percentage of consecutive years) as noted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG3">3</xref>. The magnitude of inpatient mortality from year-to-year did not change significantly and did not exhibit a consistent pattern as illustrated by Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG4">4</xref>.
