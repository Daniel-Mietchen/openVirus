<p>In the context of increased discharges, stagnant inpatient mortality raises the question if the discharges were due to a higher turnover of the same capability to manage influenza by healthcare institutions. A further prospective study is warranted to assess the impact of these tests on health outcomes. Furthermore, while detection methods have been bolstered by advances in technology and implementation, the magnitude of the mortality percentage number has remained relatively stagnant over nearly two decades, representing a possible deficiency in institutions and providers to be equipped with better decision-making algorithms to effectively manage the patients with influenza. Another area of potential interesting further study and analysis is the trend that while hospital discharge rates are increasing in recent times, so is the mean age of hospital discharges with influenza since the 2009 influenza pandemic, which shows not only a return to baseline rates of discharges but the first yearly mean age greater than 65 years of age (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG5">5</xref>). This may represent challenges primary care institutions have at reaching out to older populations in vaccination efforts, preventative measures, and health education. Alternatively, this may represent longer life expectancies reached with better healthcare initiatives and longer living patients perhaps contributing to the discharge population for influenza, driving the mean figure up. More research needs to be done to characterize the features of patients who undergo hospitalization and subsequent discharge for influenza with a focus on demographics, socioeconomic status, locale, and clinical workup to better identify areas of improvement.
