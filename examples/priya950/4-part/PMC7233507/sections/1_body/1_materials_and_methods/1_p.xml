 <xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The rate of discharges per 100,000 in the population, inpatient mortality, and mean age were trended along the duration mentioned. Linear regression was then utilized to assess if the deviation from horizontal was statistically significant for the rate of discharges per 100,000 population, mean age, and percentage of the inpatient mortality.
