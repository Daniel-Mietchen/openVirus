<p>Influenza, known colloquially as “the flu,” is a viral infection of the influenza virus with ramifications that range from relatively benign to fatal on the scale of the patient. Common symptoms are very broad, sharing an overlap with a wide array of infectious diseases and inherent pathologies, such as malaise, fever, coughs, and myalgias [

 <xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This represents a significant multifactorial impact on society. For example, the economic and clinical consequences of influenza-related hospitalizations include days of work or school missed, mitigated productivity of affected patients, the burden of caregivers, medication expenses, treatment complications, and secondary illnesses that result from an immunocompromised status. While complex to forecast, attempts in the literature to gauge the fiscal impact of influenza in the US estimate the figure to be in the range of $45B USD to as much as $87B, depending on the analyses and factors weighted [

 <xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To understand this effect in the context of health outcomes and clinical decision-making, it is prudent to assess how hospital discharges related to influenza have changed with advances in healthcare. In this work, we seek to present trends in the rates of hospital discharges within the population from the years 1993 through 2015, as well as to characterize demographic variables (such as age) and outcome variables (such as inpatient mortality rates). Doing so will present the opportunity to report shifts in influenza treatments, as well as to elucidate areas for improvement on the institutional level.
