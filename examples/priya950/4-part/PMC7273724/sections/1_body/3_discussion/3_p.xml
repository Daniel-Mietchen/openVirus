<p>We have shown complete protection of mice by R1a-B6-Fc fusion in challenge models covering two different influenza subtypes of pandemic potential. The mice that survived had no residual virus in their lungs and normal lung morphology with complete viral clearance. We were also able to see an HAI response post challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting that AAV delivery and expression of R1a-B6 which neutralizes virus by post attachment mechanisms and is itself HAI negative did not interfere with the natural immune response to virus. Surprisingly, monovalent R1a-B6, which was only detectable at very low levels in circulation (

We can infer that continuous AAV production of R1a-B6 partially offsets the rate of clearance by glomerular filtration in the kidneys, providing some protection even in the absence of Fc mediated half-life extension. However, fusion of R1a-B6 to an Fc fragment dramatically improved its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allowing protective levels to be reached over an extended period. The mechanism is expected to be due to FcRn-mediated recycling or Fc-mediated distribution and retention in tissues (
