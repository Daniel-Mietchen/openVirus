<p>We have expressed R1a-B6 both as a single domain and as an Fc fusion of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes to evaluate the importance of half-life extension and effector function for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. We have shown that a single IM injection gave robust expression of R1a-B6-Fc fusions (0.5–1.1 mg/mL) in the systemic circulation which was sustained for a minimum of 6 months with no observable ill effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We did not see any evidence of reduction over time which suggests that there was no significant loss of transgenes, transfected cells or immune mediated clearance of R1a-B6 or AAV vector. The level of production is higher than previously reported for conventional human mAbs delivered intramuscularly (50-200 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or intranasally (1 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In one case, much lower expression levels were reported for intranasal delivery of 0.5 μg/mL in nose, 2 μg/mL in lung, and 120 ng/mL in circulation which decline over time (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The very high serum concentration we see in our study might reflect the simpler nanobody transgene as compared to a conventional monoclonal antibody which requires the stable assembly of two light chains and two heavy chains inside the cell for successful secretion. It will be interesting to directly compare the impact of route of vector delivery on antibody efficacy as at present, it is unclear if localized AAV gene delivery in the nasal passages will be able to provide long term durable expression.
