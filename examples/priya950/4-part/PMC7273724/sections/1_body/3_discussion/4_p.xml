<p>Monoclonal antibodies which bind to the HA stem have been described as utilizing additional mechanisms to neutralize influenza virus 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> through recruitment of the effector arm of the immune system via Fc-Fcγ receptor interaction (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For instance, HA stem-binding antibodies have been reported to neutralize influenza virus by binding HA on virally infected cells and recruiting NK cells to mediate ADCC (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). As R1a-B6 is functionally equivalent to other HA stem binding human mAbs (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), it may also have the potential to utilize these additional mechanisms of action. To evaluate the extent ADCC might contribute to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of R1a-B6 we re-formatted it as either a mouse IgG2a-Fc fusion (ADCC+) or a mouse IgG1-Fc fusion (ADCC-) to ensure compatibility with mouse FcγRs as confirmed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As protection was complete with R1a-B6 formatted with either isotype we were not able to see any obvious difference in efficacy between R1a-B6-Fc fusions 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This contrasts with previous studies using passive transfer of the stem binding human mAb F16 which was similarly tested as a mouse IgG1 and IgG2a in the context of the mouse FcγR system. In this study, only mice that received F16-mouse-IgG2a showed 100% survival from lethal PR8 (H1N1) challenge whereas mice that received F16-mouse-IgG1 did not survive (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, further studies by the same group showed that the requirement for FcγR interactions and ADCC was dose dependent with the inference being that efficacy through passive transfer of high doses of FI6 was FcγR interaction independent (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We speculate, as we have been able to generate very high stable concentrations in serum using intramuscular AAV delivery of R1a-B6-mIgG2a and R1a-B6-mIgG1, that viral neutralization via inhibiting viral membrane fusion is sufficient to provide protection with no need for FcγR interactions. In addition, the observation of a protective effect of monovalent R1a-B6, albeit limited, is an unexpected finding and again suggests continual expression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> may to some extent offset the need for Fc effector functions.
