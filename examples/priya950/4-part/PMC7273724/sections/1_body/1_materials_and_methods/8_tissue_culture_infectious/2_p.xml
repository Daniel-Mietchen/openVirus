<p>For the MN assay, 100 μL of either nanobody-Fc (serially diluted two-fold from 256 nM to 128 pM) or heat-inactivated sera from mice treated with AAV encoding transgenes (diluted 1:25 to 1:3200) was added to 100 μL of 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL A/California/07/2009/(H1N1)pdm09. A positive control of ferret antiserum against A/California/07/2009/(H1N1)pdm09 was included. The assay was carried out and neutralization titer was obtained using HA readout; the MN titre was defined as the last well showing complete inhibition of hemagglutination.
