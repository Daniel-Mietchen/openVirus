<p>Forty female BALB/c 6-8-week-old mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were divided into five groups of eight. On Day 0, mice from groups 1-4 were injected intramuscularly (IM) with a 50 μL volume of 1 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg AAV-R1a-B6-mIgG1, AAV-R1a-B6-mIgG2a, AAV-R1a-B6, and AAV-cAb1-mIgG2a respectively. Mice from group five were given 50 μL PBS. Thirty-nine (

 <sub>50</sub> A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 or 10 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14ma. Weights and clinical observations were made twice daily for 14 days or until the endpoint of loss of 20% of initial body weight was observed, when lungs were harvested, and terminal bleeds were collected. For the H5N1 challenge experiment, an additional 3 mice per group, were added and culled 3-days post-challenge, to quantify residual influenza in the lungs and for histological analysis.
