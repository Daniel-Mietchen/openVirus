<p>Twenty-eight female BALB/c mice, 6–8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were divided into four groups of six for each of the AAV constructs. For every group, the following AAV concentrations in vector genomes (vg) of the rAAV-nanobody Fc: (i) 1.0 × 10
 <sup>10</sup>, (ii) 3.3 × 10
 <sup>10</sup>, and (iii) 1.0 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> were prepared. Each dose (in 50 μL volume) was given to 2 mice via intramuscular (IM) injection. A control group consisting of 4 mice was given 50 μL PBS. Mice were bled at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks post-AAV injection. At the end of 24 weeks, all mice were culled, and terminal bleeds collected.
