<p>All sera were treated with Receptor Destroying Enzyme (RDE) (Seiken) in a 1:4 dilution and incubated overnight at 37°C. Twenty-five microliters of mouse sera was aliquoted into duplicate wells and serially diluted two-fold in PBS before the addition of 4 HAU A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 or A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14ma. After 90 minutes incubation at room temperature, 50 μL 0.5% (v/v) T-RBCs was added to each well and HAI titer was determined via the HA readout as described above for the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay.
