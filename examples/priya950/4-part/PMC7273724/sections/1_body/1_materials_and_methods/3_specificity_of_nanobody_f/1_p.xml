<p>The nanobody-Fc constructs were tested against influenza antigen standards from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) as listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. Plates were coated overnight with 50 μL/well of 5 μg/mL influenza virus antigen standard diluted in PBS at 4°C. Serial two-fold dilutions ranging from 4 μg/mL to 1 ng/mL of purified R1a-B6-mIgG1, R1a-B6-mIgG2a, R1a-B6, and cAb1-mIgG2a were then added. Secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG (Fc Specific)-Peroxidase (Sigma A0168) at a 1:2000 dilution was used to detect nanobody-Fc; while monoclonal anti-polyHistidine-Peroxidase clone HIS-1 (Sigma A7058) at a 1:1000 dilution was used to detect R1a-B6. TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific 34029) was added to the plate and the reaction was stopped with 0.5 M HCl or 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO4. Plates were read on a SpectraMax M5 ELISA plate reader using SoftMax Pro software. Absorbance at 450 nm was taken.
