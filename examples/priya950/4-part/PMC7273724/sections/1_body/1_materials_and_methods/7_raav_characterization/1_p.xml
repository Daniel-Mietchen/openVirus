<p>Adeno-associated viral capsid particles were quantified using a discontinuous Laemmli SDS-PAGE setup using standards of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Pierce Biotechnology/Thermo Scientific 23209) as shown in Kohlbrenner et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Viral genome size and integrity was determined using alkaline gel electrophoresis (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Vector genomes were quantified by qPCR. rAAV genome sequences corresponding to a 129 bp fragment (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), of the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter from the transgene and a 62 bp portion of the Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) of the AAV vector were amplified.
