<p>We report the relative prophylactic efficacy of R1a-B6 delivered in different formats designed to investigate the importance of the Fc domain for half-life extension and effector function. Our findings are discussed in the context of designing the optimum transgene for AAV vector delivery of R1a-B6 to accomplish long term, safe, broad protection from pandemic influenza in vulnerable patient groups.</p>
