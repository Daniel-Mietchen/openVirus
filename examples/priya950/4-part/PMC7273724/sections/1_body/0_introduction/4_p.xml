<p>We have previously described R1a-B6 as a potent alpaca derived nanobody capable of cross subtype neutralization of pandemic A(H1N1)2009, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, H2N2 and H9N2 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). R1a-B6 neutralizes influenza through binding to a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem and blocking the low pH induced conformational change required for viral membrane fusion. Within this study we have evaluated if R1a-B6â€™s potent

 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy. As a single domain antibody fragment of approximately 15 kDa, R1a-B6 would be rapidly cleared from circulation in a matter of minutes, which would prohibit any activity

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). To achieve maximum protective levels in systemic circulation, additional strategies to enhance its pharmacokinetics are required, (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) such as fusion to an antibody Fc domain. The Fc domain is largely responsible for the extended serum persistence of mAbs by pH dependent interaction with FcRn and recycling through the kidneys (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In addition, the Fc domain mediates interactions with the effector arm of the immune system and recent reports have suggested antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is required for efficacy of human mAbs specific for the influenza HA stem (
