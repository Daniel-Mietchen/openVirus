<p>We also scored the level of inflammation in lung tissue via histological staining from the three mice we culled per group 3 days post-challenge. At 3-days post-challenge, lungs taken from mice expressing R1a-B6-mIgG1 and R1a-B6-mIgG2a (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) showed no signs of inflammation with clear bronchioles and air sacs which is consistent with them having no viral load (

 <italic>n</italic> = 9) demonstrated extensive infiltration of the bronchioles and air sacs, thickening of the perivascular wall, and lung ruptures as seen in the accumulation of red blood cells (RBCs) in the alveolar space (
