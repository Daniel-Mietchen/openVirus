<p>To further characterize the extent of protection against NIBRG-14ma (VN/04) we culled 3 mice per group 3-days post-challenge in addition to the 8 mice per group as they reached the mandated study endpoint to evaluate residual virus in the lungs. Mice given R1a-B6-mIgG1 and R1a-B6-mIgG2a have significantly lower TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/g of VN/04 than mice given R1a-B6, cAb1-mIgG2a and PBS (

In contrast to the CA/09 challenge study, we did not see any HAI activity against H5N1 either pre- or post-challenge in any of the groups (data not shown). We speculate that the absence of head specific antibodies, which would be a surrogate indication of a natural immune response to influenza, is due to mice needing to be culled earlier, 3–4 days post-infection, which is insufficient time for mice to mount an immune response. For mice receiving the R1a-B6-Fc fusions, we speculate that the virus was cleared before any immune response could be elicited, which is supported by the complete absence of detectable virus 3 days post challenge (
