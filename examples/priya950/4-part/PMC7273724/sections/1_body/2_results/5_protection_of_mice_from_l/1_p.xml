<p>To assess if the prophylactic efficacy of R1a-B6 can extend to a different influenza subtype, we tested in an H5N1 influenza challenge model. The study design was the same as that of the CA/09 challenge except that mice received 10 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of NIBRG-14ma (VN/04), a mouse-adapted strain of a re-assortant virus derived from A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1). Symptoms of influenza and rapid weight loss were observed 2-days post-challenge in mice given AAV encoding cAb1-mIgG2a, PBS and monovalent R1a-B6, which was earlier than those observed after the CA/09 challenge experiment (

 <italic>n</italic> = 16) did not show any symptoms of influenza or any appreciable weight loss for the 13 days of the study (

We were also unable to see any difference between the two different isotype variants of R1a-B6 as both provided complete protection. However, unlike the CA/09 challenge, we did not see any delay in the onset of infection in the group that received R1a-B6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) suggesting that the level of R1a-B6 sustained in mouse sera (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) was not sufficient to protect mice against this strain.
