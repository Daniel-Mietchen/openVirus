<p>To test the ability of AAV-mediated delivery to induce muscle specific expression of R1a-B6 transgenes and to determine the optimum AAV dose, a dose ranging study of a single IM injection of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg (vector genomes), 3.3 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vg and 1.0 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> vg of each AAV vector was given to BALB/c mice. We tested expression levels in mouse sera for a duration of 24 weeks while observing for any symptoms of stress or discomfort. Detectable levels of nanobody-Fc fusion were seen for all vector doses in mouse sera within 2 weeks of injection (

Nanobody-Fc levels increased, reaching a plateau during weeks 6–12, with concentrations being maintained at a stable level for the duration of the 24-week study with no evidence of reduction. Peak concentrations of ∼560 μg/mL for R1a-B6-mIgG1, ∼1100 μg/mL for R1a-B6-mIgG2a, and ∼600 μg/mL for cAb1-mIgG2a, were detected (

Monovalent R1a-B6 showed very low levels in serum compared to the Fc fusions, reaching a peak concentration of around 0.36 μg/mL by week 6 which remained for the duration of the study. In all cases, mice did not show any symptoms of distress or ill health that could be attributed to AAV or transgene expression for the full 24 weeks.
