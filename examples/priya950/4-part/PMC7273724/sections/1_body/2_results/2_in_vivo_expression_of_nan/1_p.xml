<p>Upon confirmation of the breadth of reactivity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> of reformatted R1a-B6, we inserted the corresponding transgenes for R1a-B6-mIgG1, R1a-B6-mIgG2a, R1a-B6, and cAb1-mIgG2a into a recombinant AAV2/8 vector. Transgenes were packaged into AAV using triple transfection (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and characterized by measuring the number of capsid particles, physical genomes, and gene products via qPCR (data not shown). Capsid and viral genome were found to be intact and of high purity. We then used our AAV viruses for a dose ranging study in mice as described below.
