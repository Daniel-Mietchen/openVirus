<p>We then determined if AAV mediated expression of R1a-B6 present in mouse sera would react with other influenza strains belonging to key influenza subtypes. We obtained mouse sera 6-weeks post AAV IM administration of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg of each R1a-B6 transgene (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8/group) and tested their cross-subtype specificity and neutralization activity. These mice were naïve and had not been exposed to influenza so immunoreactivity to heterologous strains can be attributed solely to R1a-B6 expressed from the AAV transgene 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and not to naturally produced antibodies. Sera from mice expressing R1a-B6-mIgG1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and R1a-B6-mIgG2a (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) were specific against all Group I Influenza A subtypes tested. Mice expressing monovalent R1a-B6 showed lower reactivity against the panel of whole influenza virus antigen standards (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was consistent with its very low serum levels compared to mice receiving the R1a-B6-Fc fusions. Mice expressing cAb1-mIgG2a and those given PBS did not show any reactivity against influenza virus (data not shown). In addition to cross-subtype specificity, R1a-B6-Fc in mouse sera also demonstrated potent cross-neutralizing ability against Group I Influenza A pseudotypes of subtypes H2, H5, and H9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results demonstrate that R1a-B6-Fc has retained its 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-subtype specificity and neutralizing activity when produced 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
