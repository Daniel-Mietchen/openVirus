<p>After confirmation of transgene expression in mouse sera, we proceeded with influenza challenge via intranasal delivery of 21 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> (mouse lethal dose) CA/09 42 days after AAV administration. Weight loss and clinical symptoms of influenza were observed for the 14-day study window or until mice exited the study. Animals expressing the control anti-lysozyme specific nanobody cAb1-mIgG2a and those given PBS showed symptoms of influenza including difficulty in breathing, pinched waists and sunken abdomen 3 days post-challenge. These mice lost 20% of weight and were culled by day 6 of the study (

 <italic>n</italic> = 7) from the monovalent R1a-B6 group eventually succumbed to infection and were culled on days 7â€“8 due to rapid weight loss. However, a single mouse (Mouse 3) from this group started gaining weight around day 9 and survived until the end of the study (
