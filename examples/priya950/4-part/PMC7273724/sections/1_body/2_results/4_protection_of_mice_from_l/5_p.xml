<p>We also compared the level of inflammation in terminal lung tissue. At the end of the study (14 days post-challenge), mice expressing R1a-B6-mIgG1 and R1a-B6-mIgG2a (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) showed clear bronchioles and air sacs with no signs of inflammation (

 <italic>n</italic> = 22) demonstrated infiltration of the bronchioles and air sacs with thickening of the perivascular wall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Two mice from the group given R1a-B6 (Mouse 3 and Mouse 8) did not show any signs of lung inflammation (
