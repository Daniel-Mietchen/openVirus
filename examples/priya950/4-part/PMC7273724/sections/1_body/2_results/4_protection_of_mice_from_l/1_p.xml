<p>To determine whether AAV delivery of R1a-B6 transgenes protects mice from lethal influenza infection, we injected 1 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg AAV encoding R1a-B6-mIgG1, R1a-B6-mIgG2a, R1a-B6, and control cAb1-mIgG2a intramuscularly into different groups of BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8/group). We also included a negative control group that was given PBS. Thirty-nine days post-AAV injection, we tested for transgene expression prior to lethal challenge with influenza. Mice given R1a-B6-mIgG1, R1a-B6-mIgG2a, and cAb1-mIgG2a have significantly higher concentration in serum than mice given vectors encoding R1a-B6 or PBS (
