<p>To compare anti-influenza immune response pre- and post-CA/09 challenge we used a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay on terminal mouse serum samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). HAI is a surrogate test for the presence of neutralizing antibodies which bind to the HA head domain and block the receptor binding site. As expected, pre-challenge samples did not show any HAI activity as the only anti-influenza antibody present was R1a-B6 which has previously been shown to be negative for HAI (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), as is also the case for other HA stem-binding antibodies. Post-H1N1 challenge, mice that received AAV encoding cAb1-mIgG2a and PBS, culled on days 4-6, showed similar HAI titers as groups given AAV encoding R1a-B6, R1a-B6-mIgG1, and R1a-B6-mIgG2a, the latter two groups being mice that survived the influenza challenge with no observable symptoms of infection. We concluded that after influenza challenge, both infection-induced anti-head HA antibodies and anti-stem R1a-B6 nanobodies were present in mouse sera (
