  <p>AAV dose ranging study of anti-influenza neutralizing nanobody R1a-B6 in mice. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Different R1a-B6 constructs and the control nanobody, cAb1, were given via AAV in vector genome (vg) doses of 1.0 × 10
   <sup>10</sup> vg (green series), 3.3 × 10
   <sup>10</sup> vg (blue series), and 1.0 × 10
   <sup>11</sup> vg (red series). Mice that were given PBS are indicated by the black series. Nanobodies in serum of BALB/c mice were measured from week 0 to 24. A mouse given 1.0 × 10
   <sup>10</sup> vg of R1a-B6-mIgG2a was culled before the end of the study due to reasons exclusive of AAV delivery. Each individual series corresponds to a single mouse. The dotted line represents the point (2 weeks) at which nanobody expression levels were first detected. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Neutralizing activity of sera taken from mice 24 weeks after they were injected with different doses of AAV encoding R1a-B6-mIgG1 and R1a-B6-mIgG2a was measured against 10
   <sup>3</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL of CA/09. The serum neutralizing titer is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which influenza infection is completely blocked. Mice given R1a-B6 (all doses) did not show any neutralizing activity (data not shown). For all plots, each point represents an individual mouse serum sample, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 mice/group.
