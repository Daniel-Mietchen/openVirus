<p id="Par24">We can find that all five cities implemented the LPMs closure measure with different areas and length of time during 5 epidemic waves. Three cities are around the Yangtze River Delta: 1) In Shanghai, all LPMs were closed from the beginning of the Spring Festive to the end of April in each wave; 2) In Suzhou, closed all the LPMs in the first 3 waves, since then, the closure measure only was implemented in urban area of city; 3) In Hangzhou, LPMs closure implemented partially in urban area during five waves. The other two cities are located in Pearl River Delta: 1) Shenzhen, partially closed the LPMs in urban area during first 3 waves, the rest waves adopted the permanently all closure in the whole city till today; 2) Guangzhou, adopted partial LPMs closure in urban area during five waves. In summary, only Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen (latest 2 waves) implemented the LPMs all closure, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Shenzhen (first 3 waves) adopted the partial closure; comparing the all closure days in 5 waves we can find, Shanghai&gt; Shenzhen&gt; Guangzhou (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Timelines with exposure dates of each case, and days before during and after intervention in three cities (in different background color) were drawn respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and the distribution of different periods lists in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Furthermore, general linear regression analysis shown a linear relationship in Shanghai between LPMs closure days (X) and epidemics interval days (Y) that is Y = 6.24X-224.37,
