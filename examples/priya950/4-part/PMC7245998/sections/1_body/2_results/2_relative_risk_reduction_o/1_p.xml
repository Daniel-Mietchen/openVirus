<p id="Par25">The relative risk (RR) of LPMs closure could be calculated from the period length of before, during and after intervention for each city (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Long-term LPMs closure in Shanghai induced a significant risk reduction of H7N9 cases infection (RR = 0.02, 95%CI = 0.008–0.068). Shenzhen adopted the partial LPMs closure was ineffective compared with all closure in the whole city (RR (95%CI) = 1.28 (0.64–2.54) vs. 0.38 (0.17–0.87)). For Guangzhou, however, implemented LPMs closure with a short time (2 weeks) period in the whole city, no significance for this measure (RR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.31–1.03). Overall, the LPMs closures for controlling H7N9 infection was significantly reduced 88% relative risk during the intervention period for five cities, with RR ranging from 0.07 and 0.20 (
