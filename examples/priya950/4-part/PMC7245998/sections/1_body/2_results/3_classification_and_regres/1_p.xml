<p id="Par26">We used CART analysis to detect the threshold for each factor with LPMs closure, temperature and relative humidity for H7N9 infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The tree of Shanghai showed the most significant and dominant factor was LPMs closure, which indicated that the daily incidence was 0.0142 when LPMs all closure, whereas daily incidence was 2.75 if LPMs no closure and temperature &lt; 10.2 °C, or daily incidence was 0.882 if temperature &gt; 10.2 °C and relative humidity &lt; 74%. In Shenzhen, there was an almost 0 of daily incidence if LPMs all closure and relative humidity&gt; = 83%, while daily incidence was 0.287 if LPMs no closure or partial closure, and relative humidity &lt; 87% and temperature &lt; 19.7 °C. The tree of Guangzhou indicated that LPMs closure was the last predict factor for H7N9 case infection, LPMs no closure with relative humidity from 72 to 86% and temperature &gt; 19.4 °C led to 0.316 of daily incidence of H7N9 infection.
