<p id="Par30">We adjusted the influence of meteorological factors in generalized linear regression, and added temperature and relative humidity as predictors in the regression tree because meteorological factors are also one of the factors that affect the incidence of H7N9. Previous studies have indicated that odds ratio of precipitation (49.19–115.60 mm), sunshine (22–9.25 h), temperature (&lt; 9.33 °C) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and wind speed (2.1–3.0 m/s or 6.3–7.1 m/s) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] was statistically significant for H7N9 incidence. Both daily minimum and daily maximum temperature contributed significantly to human infection with the influenza A H7N9 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the temperature range is similar to our study. Other study shown the risky windows of H7N9 infection were different in the northern and southern areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This point is consistent with our study. The temperature and humidity ranges that increase the risk of H7N9 vary from city to city.
