<p id="Par34">Our study has some limitations. As an ecologic study, our findings might be affected by other potential confounding (e.g., human movement etc.). If we were able to collect the samples from the environment around the live poultry markets to detect the positive rate of virus of LPMs in every city, it can be a piece of strong evidence to support our results. Despite poultry immunity has been controlled, it does not rule out that the evolutionary genes transmit into human beings or emerge other types of avian influenza. It is necessary to adopt long-term, large-scale LPMs closure or even permanent ban on the sale of live poultry and wild animal in high-risk area and densely populated cities.</p>
