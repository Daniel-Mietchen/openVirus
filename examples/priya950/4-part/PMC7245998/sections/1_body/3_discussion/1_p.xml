<p id="Par27">This is the first study compared the effectiveness of LPMs closure in cities that implemented the various scale and duration measure from first to fifth epidemics waves, for preventing human exposure to avian influenza H7N9 virus. Our study suggests that long-termed and fully closed such as Shanghai and Shenzhen (last two waves) have a most significant effect, while short-term closure has a limited effect such as Guangzhou, but partly closed even if long-termed closure was not significant such as Hangzhou and Suzhou. The results of classification tree analysis suggest that LPMs closure rather than environmental factors had the predominant role in reducing incidence for Shanghai and Shenzhen, which substantially controlled the H7N9 virus exposure to human.</p>
