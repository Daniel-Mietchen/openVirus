<p id="Par21">In this study, we used regression tree to determine dominant factors and the hierarchical relationship of LPMs closure implemented and meteorological factors and their thresholds for H7N9 transmission. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) are a non-parametric statistical method, which is a kind of machine learning method. The dependent variable can be a categorical (classification tree) or a continuous variable (regression tree [

In our analysis, the root of tree is daily cases number and to split the tree to produce two and more child nodes, aiming to find out the most dominant factors through maximize the homogeneity among outcomes classified in each child node and maximize the heterogeneity between these two nodes. There are three factors in this regression tree: LPMs closure, daily mean temperature (TEMP), relative humidity (RHU). The splitter with variable and threshold near the root indicates it has higher decisive for the outcomes [
