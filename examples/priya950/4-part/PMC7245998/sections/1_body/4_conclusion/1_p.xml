<p id="Par35">Our findings suggest that LPMs all closure in whole city can be a highly effective measure comparing with partial closure (i.e. only urban area closure, suburb and country remain open) for preventing human exposure to avian influenza H7N9 virus. To extend the closure duration and consider permanently closing the LPMs will help improve the control effect. The effect of LPMs closure is greater than the impact of meteorology on the H7N9 human cases infection.</p>
