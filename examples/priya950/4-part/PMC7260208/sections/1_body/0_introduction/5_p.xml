<p id="Par6">Here, we applied the 2D-pCF analysis to create high resolution maps of C protein diffusion dynamics and transport, allowing for the first time the determination of the spatial communication inside the imaging area. Our results reveal a highly heterogeneous motion of DENV C protein inside live-infected-cells.</p>
