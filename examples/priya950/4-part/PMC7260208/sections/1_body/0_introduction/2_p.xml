<p id="Par3">The DENV particle consists of a core formed by the nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing viral structural proteins (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The nucleocapsid contains the viral RNA genome, of positive polarity and single stranded, in complex with multiple copies of the C protein. The infection initiates by viral particle attachment to the host cell surface followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. After entry, the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane, releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm for translation of viral proteins. The infection induces a profound rearrangement of cellular membranes that originates the so called replication complexes, in which genome amplification takes place by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Viral particle assembly occurs on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where the C protein recruits the viral genome to form the nucleocapsid, which in turn buds into the ER gaining the membrane containing the viral envelope and membrane proteins. The newly formed viral particles travel through the secretory pathway to be released outside the cell by exocytosis

 </sup>. Although the primary function of the C protein in genome encapsidation takes place on the ER membranes, early after DENV infection the viral protein also accumulates in nucleoli and lipid droplets (LD), however, why and how capsid localizes in these compartments during infection remains unknown. In this context, fluorescence labeling of target viral proteins provides opportunities to visualize their intracellular distribution, dynamics and interactions.
