<p id="Par11">Live-cell confocal images were acquired in BHK cells during DENV C-mCherry replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When a C-mCherry positive fluorescent cell was found, we zoomed on the cell, selecting different regions of interest for RICS measurements as indicated by the two squares in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. To improve the signal to noise ratio, for each region of interest, a stack of 100 consecutive images of 256 × 256 pixels (12.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>m × 12.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) was processed and the RICS ACF was obtained by averaging the spatial correlation functions of each of them. During a RICS experiment, excessive photobleaching could generate artifacts in the correlation curve. To avoid these artifacts laser power was set below 10%, and intensity traces checked before the analysis. Experiments with a bleaching &gt;20% were excluded from this study. Because the sample is continuously imaged throughout the experiment, cell movement as well as the signal from fluorescent immobile objects were removed before performing the correlation (see Methods section). Finally, the 2D average spatial ACF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, top) is calculated as a function of the pixel shift (which is the inter-pixel distance in the horizontal direction and the inter-line distance in the vertical direction).
