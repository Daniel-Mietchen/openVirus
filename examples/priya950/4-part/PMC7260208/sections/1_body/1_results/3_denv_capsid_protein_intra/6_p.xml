<p id="Par23">To build the diffusion maps shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> the first step was to determine the anisotropy-threshold-value expected for random isotropic diffusion. To this end, we performed confocal raster-scanning measurements using a 10 nM solution of monomeric EGFP. 8192 images were taken and used to built the corresponding histogram of the anisotropy values. We applied the 2D-pCF analysis at each pixel of the image time series using 4 pixels distance (320 nm) and obtained the connectivity map and anisotropy histogram shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>. A mean value of 0.27 ± 0.13 was obtained for random motion in the absence of obstacles to diffusion. This is considered in our analysis as a reference value to identify regions of random motion during data visualization, meaning that the anisotropy values below this threshold will be kept out of the analysis for molecular flow visualization.
