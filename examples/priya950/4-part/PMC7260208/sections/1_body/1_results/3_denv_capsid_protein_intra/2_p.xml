 </sup> used a single plane illumination setup (light sheet) and a camera-based detection. In the present work, we have extended the implementation of the 2D-pCF approach to a commercially laser scanning microscope with a photomultiplier tube which is nowadays available in many biophysics labs. Although the temporal resolution is not as high as the one reached with a camera, the scanning is fast enough (32â€‰ms/frame) to detect molecular displacement between the pair of points.
