<p id="Par26">To obtain information about C protein dynamics during the course of infection, it was necessary to study its behavior as a function of time. We compared the diffusion connectivity maps obtained from the 2D-pCF analysis in the nucleus of different cells at 3, 6, 18 and 25 hours post genomic RNA transfection. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref> show average intensity images, and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e–h</xref> show the corresponding connectivity maps. Nucleoli can be identified as brighter regions inside the nucleus and are delineated with dashed white lines as reference. At 3 h post viral RNA transfection C-mCherry is diffusing in the nucleus and a few pixels of positive correlation can be identified inside nucleoli. At 6 h the movement of C-mCherry around nucleolus becomes evident, and at 18 and 25 h a circulation around nucleoli can be clearly observed.
