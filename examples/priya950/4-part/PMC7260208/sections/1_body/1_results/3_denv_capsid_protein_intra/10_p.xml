<p id="Par27">To avoid that many lines overcrowd the connectivity map, we built maps using only the pixels with anisotropy values above the threshold and thus, the lack of connectivity observed in any pixel, indicates that the values found in that region are below the threshold. This could occur for various reasons: because the molecules are immobile (zero correlation), because they permanently bind to intracellular compartments, or because their motion is described by isotropic diffusion, among others. In our case of study, it is reasonable to expect that as C protein accumulates in nucleoli, its motion will be more restricted. This lack of movement can be due to permanent binding of the C protein with nucleolar components such as RNA and/or proteins, or due to the compact structure of nucleoli.</p>
