<p id="Par18">The 2D pair Correlation Function approach creates a unique molecular flow map of the trajectory followed by C protein allowing to study intracellular communication in live cells. In the one-dimension version, the Pair Correlation Function method (pCF)

 </sup> measures the correlation between a pair of points that are located further apart (at a distance

 </sub>) in the scanned pattern over the sample (line or circle). The temporal correlation function can be calculated at different time delays and a maximum of the correlation function will appear at a time delay proportional to the average time a molecule takes to move between the two points. The pCF over a line, for example, has been used to determine molecular transport among cell compartments

 </sup>. In the recently presented 2D version of this technique

 </sup>, the correlation function is calculated between two points (or pixels) at different frames from a temporal stack of images. At each point in the image, the pCF is calculated in every direction, this is, between points at different angles. From the correlation function calculated in every direction, an angular pCF distribution is obtained for each point, and the anisotropy of this distribution tells about the probability that the molecules moved in a specific direction in that point (see Methods section). Thus, the average path followed by the molecules at each point of the image is obtained. The main advantage of this technique relies on the possibility of mapping the flow followed by single diffusing molecules and its resolution is not limited by the size of the imaged area. The pCF is sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity of the cellular compartment, which makes it suitable to detect obstacles to diffusion and see how molecules move around them.
