<p id="Par37">Baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-21) was cultured in minimum essential medium alpha (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Plasmids containing DENV WT and DENV C-mCherry full genomes were linearized with XbaI restriction enzyme. Viral capped RNA was in vitro transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7GpppA. RNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Opti-MEM medium (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fifty ng of viral RNA WT or C-mCherry were transfected into BHK-21 cells grown in 8-well chambered cover-glass plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The observations were performed immediately after adding transfection reagent. For the mCherry control experiments, 500 ng of pmCherry-C1 plasmid (Clontech) were transfected into BHK cells using the protocol described above</p>
