<p id="Par36">For constructing the recombinant full-length DENV containing the C-mCherry fusion, we modified a DENV reporter construct that we have previously described that includes a luciferase coding region

 </sup>. We replaced the SacII-SphI fragment of the reporter with a fragment containing mCherry coding sequence fused to the food and mouth disease virus 2A (FMDV2A) protein, in such a way to obtain the capsid fused to mCherry that would be released from the rest of the viral polyprotein by the FMDV2A cleavage. The fragment used to replace the SacII-SphI region was obtained by overlapping PCR. The new construct named DENV C-mCherry was sequenced and directly used for
