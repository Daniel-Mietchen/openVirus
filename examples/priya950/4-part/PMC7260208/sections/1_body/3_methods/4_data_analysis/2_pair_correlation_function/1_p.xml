<p id="Par44">The 2D-pair Correlation Function (2D-pCF) approach is intended to determine the average path for a molecule diffusing in the cell interior with statistical spatio-temporal significance. Analog to the line pCF, where the correlation function is computed between points at different lines
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, the 2D-pCF is computed between points from different images
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. This is opposite to RICS, where one image is enough to compute the correlation function.
