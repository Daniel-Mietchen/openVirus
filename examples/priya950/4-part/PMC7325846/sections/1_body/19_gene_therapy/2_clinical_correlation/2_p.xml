<p id="p0925">The first product designed for gene therapy was Gendicine, a medication produced by Shenzhen Sibiono Genetech, China. Gendicine is used for head and neck carcinoma treatment. The tumor 4 suppressing gene p53 in recombinant adenovirus expresses protein p53, which leads to tumor control and elimination. SBN-cel is a cell line that was subcloned from the human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293 and has been used for the production of Gendicine.</p>
