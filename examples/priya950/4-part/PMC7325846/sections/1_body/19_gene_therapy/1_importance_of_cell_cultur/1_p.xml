<p id="p0905">Gene therapy involves the insertion, removal, or alteration of a therapeutic or working gene copy to cure a disease or defect or to slow the progression of a disease, thereby improving the quality of life. The human genome map was the first major step toward a new way of addressing human health and illness. Gene therapy holds great promise, however, the task of transferring genetic material into the cell remains an enormous technical challenge and requires ex vivo cell cultivation and adaptation from the lab to a clinically relevant state. The development of animal cell culture technology is imperative for advances in gene therapy.</p>
