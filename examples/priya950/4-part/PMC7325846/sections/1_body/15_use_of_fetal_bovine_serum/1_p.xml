<p id="p0715">Fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented media are commonly used in animal cell cultures. In recent years, FBS production methods have come under scrutiny because of animal welfare concerns. FBS is harvested from bovine fetuses taken from pregnant cows during slaughter. The common method of harvesting the fetus is by cardiac puncture without any anesthesia. This practice of harvesting FBS is inhumane as it exposes the fetus to pain and/or discomfort. In addition to moral concerns, numerous scientific and technical problems exist with regard to the use of FBS in cell culture. Efforts are now being made to reduce the use of FBS and replace it with synthetic alternatives.</p>
