<p id="p0930">In recent years, biopesticides have gained importance due to increased concerns about agrochemicals and their residues in the environment and food. Biopesticides provide an effective means for the control of insects and plant disease, and they are environmentally safe. The biological control of insect pests by another living organism (in order to suppress the use of pesticides) is an age-old practice. Presently, a number of biological controls are being used as biopesticides. With the high cost of chemical-based pesticides and the development of resistance to multiple chemical pesticides, baculoviruses are one of the most promising biocontrols for insect pests and have been increasingly used effectively against caterpillars worldwide. However, the major impediment in the development of baculoviruses as biopesticides is the high cost and small volumes of in vitro methods. Development of an in vitro production process for large quantities of baculoviruses at comparable costs to chemical pesticides will help provide insect control that is safe, efficacious, cost-effective, and environmentally safe.</p>
