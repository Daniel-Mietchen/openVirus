<p id="p0970">The most commonly used cell lines in biopesticide production are the Sf21 and Sf9 cell lines, which are derived from ovarian tissues of the fall army worm (
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>). Sf9 cells show a faster growth rate and higher cell density than Sf21 cells and are preferred. High Five cell lines (designated BTI-Tn-5BI-4) established from 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> embryonic tissue are also being used.
