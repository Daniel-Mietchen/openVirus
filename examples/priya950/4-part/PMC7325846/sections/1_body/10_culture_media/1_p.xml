<p id="p0370">One of the most important factors in animal cell culture is the medium composition. In vitro growth and maintenance of animal cells require appropriate nutritional, hormonal, and stromal factors that resemble their milieu in vivo as closely as possible. Important environmental factors are the medium in which the cells are surrounded, the substratum upon which the cells grow, temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration, pH, and osmolality. In addition, the cell requires chemical substances that cannot be synthesized by the cells themselves. Any successful medium is composed of isotonic, low-molecular-weight compounds known as basal medium and provides inorganic salts, an energy source, amino acids, and various supplements.</p>
