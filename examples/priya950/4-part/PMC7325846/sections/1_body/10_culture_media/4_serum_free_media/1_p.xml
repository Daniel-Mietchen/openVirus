<p id="p0495">The use of serum in culture media presents a safety hazard and source of unwanted contamination for the production of biopharmaceuticals. As a number of cell lines can be grown in serum-free media supplemented with certain components of bovine fetal serum, the development of this type of medium with a defined composition has intensified in the last few decades. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Eagle (1959)</xref> developed a “minimal essential medium” composed of balanced salts, glucose, amino acids, and vitamins.
