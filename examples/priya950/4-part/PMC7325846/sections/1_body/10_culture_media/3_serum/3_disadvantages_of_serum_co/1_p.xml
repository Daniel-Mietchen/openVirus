   <p id="p0470">Expensive: Fetal calf serum is expensive and difficult to obtain in large quantities.</p>

   <p id="p0475">Variation: Batch-to-batch variation occurs in serum, and there is no uniformity in composition of serum. This can affect growth and yields and can give inconsistent results.</p>

   <p id="p0480">Contamination: Serum medium carries a high risk of contamination with virus, fungi, and mycoplasma. </p>

   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0485">Cytotoxic and inhibiting factors: The serum itself may be cytotoxic and may contain inhibiting factors, which in turn may inhibit cultured cell growth and proliferation. The enzyme polyamine oxidase in serum reacts with polyamines such as spermine and spermidine to form cytotoxic polyamino-aldehyde.</p>

   <p id="p0490">Downstream processing: The presence of serum in culture media may interfere with isolation and purification of culture products. Additional steps may be required to isolate cell culture products.</p>
