<p id="p0155">Cellâ€“cell interactions similar to tissue-like densities can be attained by the use of an appropriate ECM and soluble factors and by growing cell cultures to high cell densities. This can be achieved by (a) growing cells in a relatively large reservoir with adequate medium fitted with a filter where the cells are crowded; (b) growing the cells at high concentrations on agar or agarose or as stirred aggregates (spheroids); and (c) growing cells on the outer surface of hollow fibers where the cells are seeded on the outer surface and medium is pumped through the fibers from a reservoir.</p>
