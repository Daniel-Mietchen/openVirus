<p id="p0090">Whole organs from embryos or partial adult organs are used to initiate organ culture in vitro. These cells in the organ culture maintain their differentiated character, their functional activity, and also retain their in vivo architecture. They do not grow rapidly, and cell proliferation is limited to the periphery of the explant. As these cultures cannot be propagated for long periods, a fresh explanation is required for every experiment that leads to interexperimental variation in terms of reproducibility and homogeneity. Organ culture is useful for studying functional properties of cells (production of hormones) and for examining the effects of external agents (such as drugs and other micro or macro molecules) and products on other organs that are anatomically placed apart in vivo.</p>
