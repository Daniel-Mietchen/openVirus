<p id="p0080">Cells from a wide range of different tissues and organisms are now grown in the lab. Earlier, the major purpose of cell culture was to study the growth, the requirements for growth, the cell cycle, and the cell itself. At present, homogenous cultures obtained from primary cell cultures are useful tools to study the origin and biology of the cells. Organotypic and histotypic cultures that mimic the respective organs/tissues have been useful for the production of artificial tissues.</p>
