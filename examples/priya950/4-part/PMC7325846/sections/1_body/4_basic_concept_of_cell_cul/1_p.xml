<p id="p0075">Tissue culture is in vitro maintenance and propagation of isolated cells tissues or organs in an appropriate artificial environment. Many animal cells can be induced to grow outside of their organ or tissue of origin under defined conditions when supplemented with a medium containing nutrients and growth factors. For in vitro growth of cells, the culture conditions may not mimic in vivo conditions with respect to temperature, pH, CO
 <sub>2</sub>, O
 <sub>2</sub>, osmolality, and nutrition. In addition, the cultured cells require sterile conditions along with a steady supply of nutrients for growth and sophisticated incubation conditions. An important factor influencing the growth of cells in culture medium is the medium itself. At present, animal cells are cultured in natural media or artificial media depending on the needs of the experiment. The culture medium is the most important and essential step in animal tissue culture. This depends on the type of cells that need to be cultured for the purpose of cell growth differentiation or production of designed pharmaceutical products. In addition, serum-containing and serum-free media are now available that offer a varying degree of advantage to the cell culture. Sterile conditions are important in the development of cell lines.
