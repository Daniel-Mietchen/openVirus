<p id="p0570">The characterization of cell lines is important to ensure the quality of cell-derived biopharmaceutical products. It helps in determining the cell source with regard to its identity and the presence of other cell lines, molecular contaminants, and endogenous agents. The characterization of mammalian cell lines is species-specific and can vary depending on the history of the cell line and type of media components used for culturing.</p>
