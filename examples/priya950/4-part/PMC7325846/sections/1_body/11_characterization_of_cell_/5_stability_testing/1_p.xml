<p id="p0615">Characterization and testing of cell substrate (cell line derived from human or animal source) is one of the most important components in the control of biological products. It helps to confirm the identity, purity, and suitability of the cell substrate for manufacturing use. The substrate stability should be examined at a minimum of two time points during cultivation for production. In addition, genetic stability can be tested by genomic or transcript sequencing, restriction map analysis, and copy number determination (FDA guidelines, 2012).</p>
