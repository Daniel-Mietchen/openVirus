<p id="p0620">Virus testing of cell substrate should be designed to detect a spectrum of viruses. Appropriate screening tests should be carried out based on the cultivation history of cell lines. The development of characteristic cytopathogenic effect (CPE) provides an early indication of viral contamination. Some of the viruses of special concern in cell production work are human immunodeficiency virus, human papilloma virus, hepatitis virus, human herpes virus, hantavirus, simian virus, sendai virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. For detection of viruses causing immunodeficiency diseases and hepatitis, detection of sequences by PCR testing is adequate. Cells exposed to be serum or bovine serum albumin require a bovine virus test. Some of the viral testing assays are XC plaque assays, S+L-focus assay, reverse transcription assay. XC plaque assay is utilized to detect infectious ecotropic murine retroviruses. S+L-focus assay is used to test cells for the presence of infectious xenotropic and amphotropic murine retroviruses that are capable of interacting with both murine and nonmurine cells. Real-time (RT) assays such as real-time fluorescent product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (FPERT) assay and quantitative real-time for fluorescent product-enhanced reverse transcript (QPERT) assay detect the conversion of an RNA template to cDNA due to the presence of the RT template when retrovirus infection is present in the cell line.</p>
