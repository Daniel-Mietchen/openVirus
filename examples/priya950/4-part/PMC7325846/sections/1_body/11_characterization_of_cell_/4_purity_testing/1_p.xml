<p id="p0610">Bacterial and fungal contamination of cell lines occurs due to impure techniques and source material. The occurrence of contaminants can be tested by a direct inoculation method on two different media. Mycoplasma infection is the contamination of cell cultures/cell lines with mycoplasmas, and it represents a serious problem. Detection by microscopy is not adequate and requires additional testing by fluorescent staining PCR, ELISA assay, autoradiography, immune-staining, or microbiological assay.</p>
