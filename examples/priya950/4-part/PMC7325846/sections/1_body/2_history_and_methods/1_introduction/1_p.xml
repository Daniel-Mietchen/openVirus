<p id="p0020">Cell culture is the process by which human, animal, or insect cells are grown in a favorable artificial environment. The cells may be derived from multicellular eukaryotes, already established cell lines or established cell strains. In the mid-1900s, animal cell culture became a common laboratory technique, but the concept of maintaining live cell lines separated from their original tissue source was discovered in the 19th century. Animal cell culture is now one of the major tools used in the life sciences in areas of research that have a potential for economic value and commercialization. The development of basic culture media has enabled scientists to work with a wide variety of cells under controlled conditions; this has played an important role in advancing our understanding of cell growth and differentiation, identification of growth factors, and understanding of mechanisms underlying the normal functions of various cell types. New technologies have also been applied to investigate high cell density bioreactor and culture conditions.</p>
