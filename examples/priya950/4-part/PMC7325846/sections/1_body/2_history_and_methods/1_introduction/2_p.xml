<p id="p0025">Many products of biotechnology (such as viral vaccines) are fundamentally dependent on mass culturing of animal cell lines. Although many simpler proteins are being produced using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are glycosylated (carbohydrate-modified) currently have to be made in animal cells. At present, cell culture research is aimed at investigating the influence of culture conditions on viability, productivity, and the constancy of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are important for the biological activity of recombinant proteins. Biologicals produced by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in animal cell cultures include anticancer agents, enzymes, immunobiologicals [interleukins, lymphokines, monoclonal antibodies (mABs)], and hormones. </p>
