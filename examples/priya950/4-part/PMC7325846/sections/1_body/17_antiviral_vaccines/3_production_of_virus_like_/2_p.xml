<p id="p0785">VLPs resemble and mimic virus structure and are able to elicit a strong immune response without causing harm. The major advantage of VLPs is their simplicity and nonpathogenic nature. They are replication-deficient as they lack any viral genetic information, thus eliminating the need for inactivation of the virus. This is important as inactivation treatments lead to epitope modifications (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cruz et al., 2002</xref>). As the structural morphology of VLPs is similar to the virus, the conformational epitopes presented to the immune system are the same as for the native virus particles. The immune response/antibody reactivity in the case of VLPs is significantly improved as VLPs present conformation epitopes more similar to the native virus. VLPs also induce a strong B-cell response. For broader and more efficient protection, it is possible to adapt one or more antigens to the multimeric protein structure. Another advantage offered by VLPs is that they significantly reduce vaccine costs as these can elicit a protective response at lower doses of antigen.
