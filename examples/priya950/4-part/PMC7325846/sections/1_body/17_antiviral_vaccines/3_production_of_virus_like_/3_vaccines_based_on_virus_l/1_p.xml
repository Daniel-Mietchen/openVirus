To generate immunogenic VLPs, the S gene is cloned and expressed in a eukaryotic expression host such as yeast or mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cell line). The mammalian cell culture allows easy recovery because the cells are able to secrete the antigen HBsAg. The two companies producing CHO-based vaccines are the French-based Pasteur-Merieux Aventis (Gene Hevac B) and the Israeli-based SciGen (Sci-B-Vac). The Gene Hevac B vaccine contains the HBsAg S protein and M protein, whereas Sci-B-Vac contains the M and L proteins.
