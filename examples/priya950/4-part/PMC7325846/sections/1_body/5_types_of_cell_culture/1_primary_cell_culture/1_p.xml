<p id="p0165">These cells are obtained directly from tissues and organs by mechanical or chemical disintegration or by enzymatic digestion. These cells are induced to grow in suitable glass or plastic containers with complex media. These cultures usually have a low growth rate and are heterogeneous; however, they are still preferred over cell lines as these are more representative of the cell types in the tissues from which they are derived. The morphological structure of cells in culture is of various types: (1) epithelium type, which are polygonal in shape and appear flattened as they are attached to a substrate and form a continuous thin layer (i.e., monolayer on solid surfaces); (2) epitheloid type, which have a round outline and do not form sheets like epithelial cells and do not attach to the substrate; (3) fibroblast type, which are angular in shape and elongated and form an open network of cells rather than tightly packed cells, are bipolar or multipolar, and attach to the substrate; and (4) connective tissue type, which are derived from fibrous tissue, cartilage, and bone, and are characterized by a large amount of fibrous and amorphous extracellular materials.</p>
