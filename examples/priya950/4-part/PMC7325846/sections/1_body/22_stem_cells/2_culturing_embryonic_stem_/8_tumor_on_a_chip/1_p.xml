<p id="p1065">A significant challenge for cancer research is the early detection and development of in vitro strategies for studying the role of drug-carrier design in tumor transport and therapies for targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells while leaving normal, healthy cells untouched. The microfluidics tumor-on-a-chip platform can be used for detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood flow, which may lead to early diagnosis of cancer (

(2011)</xref> fabricated a microfluidic device with an active injection system that produced 64 of 100 combinations of different chemical solutions at various concentrations and stored them in isolated chambers. To optimize system parameters for varied types of cancer cells while requiring minute amounts of reagents and cells, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jedrych et al. (2011)</xref> generated a microfluidics system for photodynamic therapy-based measurements. This system allows light-induced photosensitizers to be delivered to the carcinoma cells, which—on reaction with oxygen—produce a chemical toxin that is lethal to tumor cells.
