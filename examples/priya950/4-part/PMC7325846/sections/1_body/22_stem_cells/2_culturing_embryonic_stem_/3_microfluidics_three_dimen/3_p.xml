<p id="p1035">Notably, microfluidic cell cultures are potential candidates for next generation cell analysis systems. Several 3D-based cell culture approaches have been created to provide a better biomimetic microenvironment for cells than those of 2D cultures. In addition, crucial liquid handling steps, including cell loading, nutrient supply, and waste removal—under physiologically relevant conditions—can be performed with real-time microscopy (

Numerous microfluidic devices have been developed to not only provide nutrients and oxygen continuously for cell proliferation but also to investigate several characteristics of a dynamic 3D cell culture, such as differences in concentration, temperature gradients, and shear force conditions on cell transport and cultivation. Numerous microfluidic platforms for 3D cell culturing have been developed and based on the substrates used for microdevice fabrication, including glass/silicon-based, polymer-based, and paper-based platforms. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microdevices are the predominant form of microfluidic 3D cell culture systems because they are economical and allow permeability of O2, which is vital in cell proliferation. To provide an in vivo-like environment that resembles living tissues, several natural polymers, such as collagen, fibrin, and agarose, have been used to fabricate microfluidic devices (
