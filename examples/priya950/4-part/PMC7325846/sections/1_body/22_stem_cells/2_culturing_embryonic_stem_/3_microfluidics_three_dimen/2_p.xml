<p id="p1030">The 3D cell culture system has provided a powerful tool that mimics a highly complex and dynamic in vivo environment, and it has gained greater momentum with the integration of microfluidic technology. Microfluidics is a technology characterized by the manipulation of fluids at the micron-scale for the improvement of diagnostics and cell culture research. It uses microfluidic devices to manipulate fluids in the small capillaries or microchannels. Microfluidics is a science of manipulating, mixing, monitoring, and analyzing minute volumes of fluids or gases on the surfaces of chips and microfluidic chips. This technology is ideal because it recreates the microenvironment of the vasculature and has become a powerful tool in cell culture research. It encompasses knowledge of the biological sciences, chemistry, physics, and engineering applications (

It not only mimics but also promotes several biologically relevant functions not seen in the 2D cell culture. Furthermore, it has been increasingly used to generate high-throughput cell culture models and has shown considerable promise for improving diagnostics and biological research (
