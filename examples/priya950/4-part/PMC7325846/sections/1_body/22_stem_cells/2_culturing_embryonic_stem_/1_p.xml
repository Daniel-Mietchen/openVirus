<p id="p1015">Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are grown on nutrient broth. These cells are traditionally cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers, which allows continuous growth in an undifferentiated stage. The mouse cells at the bottom of the culture dish provide a sticky surface to which the cells can attach. In addition, the feeder cells release nutrients into the culture medium. Researchers have now devised animal-free culture systems for hESCs and have used human embryonic fibroblasts and adult fallopian tube epithelial cells as feeder layers (in addition to serum-free mediums).</p>
