<p id="p1045">Scientists currently rely on in vitro cell culture platforms and in vivo animal models to study biological processes and develop therapeutic strategies, although informative have significant shortcomings (

An organ-on-a-chip is a microfluidic cell culture device comprising a microchip with continuously perfused chambers that are infused with living cells that are arranged to mimic the 3D tissue microenvironment and physiology (

The simplest functional unit of organ-on-a-chip devices consists of a single, perfused microfluidic chamber that is composed of a single type of cultured cell. These systems are utilized for studying organ-specific responses, chemical responses, such as drugs or toxins, and physical stimuli. In a complex system, two or more independently perfused parallel microchannels are connected by porous membranes to recreate interfaces between different tissues.
