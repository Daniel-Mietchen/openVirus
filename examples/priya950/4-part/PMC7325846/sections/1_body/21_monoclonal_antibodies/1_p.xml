 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk and Van de Winkle, 2001</xref>). Animal cells are preferred because they are capable of glycosylation and structural conformation, which is essential for a drug to be productive. Hybridoma technology has been the most widely used method for small- and large-scale production of mABs. However, these antibodies have limited therapeutic applications since they produce an adverse immune response on repeated use.
