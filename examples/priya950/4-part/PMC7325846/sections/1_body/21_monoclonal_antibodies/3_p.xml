<p id="p1005">A number of factors influence the production of mABs. For a high concentration of mAB production, the cell line should have high productivity. For high protein productivity, it is important that the selected cell line be productive in order to avoid large reaction volumes and the high cost of protein purification. Cell lines with the capacity to grow without anchorage offer an advantage in terms of scaling up the process; it is much simpler than with those designed for the growth culture of anchorage-dependent cells. Sp2/0 and NSO cell lines can grow naturally in suspension; other cells such as CHO and BHK can be easily adapted to this form of cultivation.</p>
