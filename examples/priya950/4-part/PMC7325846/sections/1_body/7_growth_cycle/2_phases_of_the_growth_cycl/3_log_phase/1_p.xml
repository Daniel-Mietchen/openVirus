<p id="p0265">This is a period of exponential increase in cell number and growth of the cell population due to continuous division. The length of the log phase depends on the initial seeding density, the growth rate of the cells, and the density at which cell proliferation is inhibited by density. This phase represents the most reproducible form of the culture as the growth fraction and viability is high (usually 90%â€“100%), and the population is at its most uniform. However, the cell culture may not be synchronized, and the cells can be randomly distributed in the cell cycle. </p>
