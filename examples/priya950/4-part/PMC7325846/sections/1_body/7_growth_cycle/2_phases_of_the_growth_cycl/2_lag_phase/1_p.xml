<p id="p0260">This is the initial growth phase of the subculture and re-seeding during which the cell population takes time to recover. The cell number remains relatively constant prior to rapid growth. During this phase, the cell replaces elements of the glycocalyx lost during trypsinization, attaches to the substrate, and spreads out. During the spreading process, the cytoskeleton reappears; its reappearance is probably an integral part of the process.</p>
