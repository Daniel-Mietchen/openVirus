 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stacey and Davis, 2007</xref>). Trypan blue and erythrosin B determine cell viability through the loss of cellular membrane integrity. Both these dyes are unable to penetrate the cell membrane when the membrane is intact, but are taken up and retained by dead cells (which lack an intact membrane). Erythrosin B stain is preferred over Trypan blue as it generates more accurate results with fewer false negatives and false positives.
