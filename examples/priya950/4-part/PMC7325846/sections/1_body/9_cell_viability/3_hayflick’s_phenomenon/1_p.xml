<p id="p0365">Hayflick limit or Hayflick’s phenomena is defined as the number of times a normal cell population divides before entering the senescence phase. Macfarlane Burnet coined the term “c limit” in 1974. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hayflick and Moorhead (1961)</xref> demonstrated that a population of normal human fetal cells divide in culture between 40 and 60 times before stopping. There appears to be a correlation between the maximum number of passages and aging. This phenomenon is related to telomere length. Repeated mitosis leads to shortening of the telomeres on the DNA of the cell. Telomere shortening in humans eventually makes cell division impossible, and correlates with aging. This explains the decrease in passaging of cells harvested from older individuals.
