<p id="p0355">The viable cells in culture have intact outer membranes. Loss of membrane integrity defines a “dead” cell. The dead cells can be detected by measuring the activity of marker enzymes that leak out of dead cells into the culture medium or by staining the cytoplasmic or nuclear content by vital dyes that can only enter dead cells. LDH is an enzyme that is present in all cell types. It catalyzes the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the presence of co-enzyme NAD
 <sup>+</sup>. In the damaged cells, LDH is rapidly released. The amount of released LDH is used to assess cell death (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14.2</xref> ). This assay is widely used but has limited sensitivity as half-life of LDH at 37 °C is 9 hours.
