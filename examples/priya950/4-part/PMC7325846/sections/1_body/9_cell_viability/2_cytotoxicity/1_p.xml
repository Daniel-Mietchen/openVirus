<p id="p0305">The toxic chemicals in the culture medium affect the basic functions of cells. The cytotoxicity effect can lead to the death of the cells or alterations in their metabolism. Methods to access viable cell number and cell proliferation rapidly and accurately is the important requirement in many experimental situations that involve in vitro and in vivo studies. The cell number determination can be useful for determining the growth factor activity, concentration of toxic compound, drug screening, duration of exposure, change in colony size, carcinogenic effects of chemical compounds, and effects of solvents (such as ethanol, propylene, etc.).</p>
