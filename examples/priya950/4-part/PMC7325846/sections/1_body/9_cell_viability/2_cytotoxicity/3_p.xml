<p id="p0330">The MTT assay allows simple, accurate, and reliable counting of metabolically active cells based on the conversion of pale yellow tetrazolium MTT. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in metabolically active viable cells reduces tetrazolium compounds into brightly colored formazan products or reduces resazurin into fluorescent resorufin (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14.1</xref> ). MTT and resazurin assays are widely used, as they are inexpensive and can be used with all cell types. The protease marker assay utilizes the cell-permeant protease substrate glycylphenylalanyl-aminofluorocoumarin (GF-AFC). The substrate, which lacks an aminoterminal blocking moiety, is processed by aminopeptidases within the cytoplasm to release AFC. The amount of AFC released is proportional to the viable cell number. This assay has better sensitivity than resuzurin and the cells remain viable; thus, multiplexing is possible. The ATP assay is the most sensitive cell viability assay. It is measured using the beetle luciferase reaction to generate light. The MTT assay and procedure is given in
