<p id="p0805">Proteins play a major role in carrying out biochemical reactions, transporting small molecules within a cell or from one organ to another, formation of receptors and channels in membranes, and providing frameworks for scaffolding. The number of functionally distinct proteins in humans far exceeds the number of genes as a result of post-translational modifications. These modifications include glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitrosylation, methylation, acetylation, and lipidation. The changes in protein structure as a result of mutation or other abnormalities often lead to a disease condition. Protein therapeutics offer tremendous opportunities for alleviating disease. The first therapeutic from recombinant mammalian cells was human tissue plasminogen, which obtained market approval in 1986. At present, 60%â€“70% of all the recombinant therapeutic proteins are produced in mammalian cells.</p>
