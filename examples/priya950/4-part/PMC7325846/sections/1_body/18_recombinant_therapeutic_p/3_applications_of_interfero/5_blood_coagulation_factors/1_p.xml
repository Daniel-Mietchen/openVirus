<p id="p0895">Hemophilia A is caused by the lack of blood-clotting factor VIII, hemophilia B is caused by deficiency of factor IX, and hemophilia C by lack of factor XI. Factor VIII and IX are proteins. The first recombinant factor VII products were Recombinate and Kogenate, which were expressed in CHO and BKH cells, respectively. Recombinant factor FIX is commercially sold as BeneFIX and is produced in recombinant CHO cells.</p>
