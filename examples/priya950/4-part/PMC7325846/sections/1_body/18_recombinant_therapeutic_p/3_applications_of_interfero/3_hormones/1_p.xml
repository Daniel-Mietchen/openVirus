<p id="p0880">Insulin, glucagon, gonadotropins, and growth hormones are the most well-known therapeutic hormones. The first biopharmaceuticals that obtained approval by regulatory agencies were insulin and recombinant human growth hormones. These were produced in microbial cells. The commercial recombinant forms of the gonadotropin family of hormones are Gonal-F, Luveris, Puregon, and Ovitrelle. All these are produced using CHO cells and are used for treating female infertility.</p>
