<p id="p0850">Most of the proteins have complex structures and undergo chemical modification to insure full biological activity. Protein post-translation modifications (PTM) can happen in several ways. The most widely recognized form of PTM is glycosylation, which involves extensive sequence processing and trimming in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Eukaryotic cells are capable of carrying out this type of modification and are thus preferred in biopharmaceutical processes. Hamster, baby hamster kidney (BHK), and CHO cells are often the host cells of choice as glycosylation patterns generated from these cells are more similar to human patterns.
