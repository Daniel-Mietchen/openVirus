<p id="p0215">Nowadays, for the production of biologically active substances on an industrial scale, a mammalian cell culture is a prerequisite. With advancements in animal cell culture technology, a number of cell lines have evolved and are used for vaccine production, therapeutic proteins, pharmaceutical agents, and anticancerous agents. For the production of cell lines, human, animal, or insect cells may be used. Cell lines that are able to grow in suspension are preferred as they have a faster growth rate. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) is the most commonly used mammalian cell line.</p>
