<p id="p0275">The animal cell culture can be grown for a wide variety of cell-based assays to investigate morphology, protein expression, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and toxicity in different environments. Product yields can be increased if monitoring of cell growth is managed properly. A number of factors affect the maximum growth of cells in a batch reactor. Regular observation of cells in culture helps monitor cell health and the stage of growth; small changes in pH, temperature, humidity, O
 <sub>2</sub>, CO
 <sub>2</sub>, dissolved nutrients, etc., could have an impact on cell growth. Monitoring the rate of growth continuously also provides a record that the cells have reached their maximum density within a given time frame.
