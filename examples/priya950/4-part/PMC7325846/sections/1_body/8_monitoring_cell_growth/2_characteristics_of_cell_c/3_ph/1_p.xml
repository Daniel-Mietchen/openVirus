<p id="p0290">pH of the culture medium can be controlled by adding alkali (NaOH, KOH) or acid (HCl) solution. Addition of CO
 <sub>2</sub> gas to the bioreactor, buffering with sodium bicarbonate, or use of naturally buffering solutes help maintain the pH of the culture. A silver chloride electrochemical-type pH electrode is the most commonly used electrode in the bioreactor.
