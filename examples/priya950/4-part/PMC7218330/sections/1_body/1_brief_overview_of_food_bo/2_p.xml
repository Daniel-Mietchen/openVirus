 </sup> Some of the common food-borne pathogens and types of food they affect are shown in 
 <xref rid="table1-1178630220913365" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The incidence/prevalence of food-borne diseases caused by different pathogens has changed in the last few decades. For example, in the United Kingdom, in 2010, 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> displaced 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> as the prime cause of food-borne disease while the incidence of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> rose between 2001 and 2009.

 </sup> Viruses are implicated in an increasing number of food-borne cases in the United Kingdom currently, while toxin-producing 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> such as 
 <italic>E coli</italic> 0157:H7 remain less common, but serious pathogens due to their clinical impact.

 </sup> In the next decades of years, new food-borne pathogens are likely to emerge globally driven by factors such as microbial evolution and changes in food production processes.

 </sup> In addition, food-borne infections due to existing pathogens can be expected to increase, especially in developing countries, partly because of environmental and demographic changes, as well as massive consumption of risky foods.
