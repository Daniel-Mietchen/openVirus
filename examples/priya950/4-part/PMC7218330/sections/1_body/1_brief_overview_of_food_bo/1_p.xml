 </sup> estimates that food-borne diseases cause about 600 million illness episodes, 420 000 deaths and 33 million healthy life years lost (disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) annually. Food-borne disease is most prevalent in Africa and South-East Asia, where more than a third of all food-borne illness occurs.

 </sup> Food-borne pathogens account for the vast majority of food-borne diseases, and diarrhoeal agents are responsible for more than half of the global burden of food-borne infections.

 </sup> Although all human beings are at risk, the impact of food-borne infections is most severe in very young and elderly people, as well as immune-compromised individuals. Food-borne illness is associated with huge economic costs. For example, in the United States, food-borne illnesses cost the economy between US$10 and US$83 billion.
