<p>Food-borne bacterial pathogens isolated from cockroaches include 
 <italic>Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhi, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus</italic>. It is important to note the several species of 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> that have been isolated from cockroaches, which probably indicates that cockroaches are an important reservoir for these bacteria.

 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. have a very low infective dose (10
 <sup>1</sup>-10
 <sup>2</sup> cells) and cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), a highly invasive intestinal infection characterized by fever, violent abdominal cramps, rectal urgencies, and complications such as intestinal perforations, septicaemia, and toxic megacolon.
