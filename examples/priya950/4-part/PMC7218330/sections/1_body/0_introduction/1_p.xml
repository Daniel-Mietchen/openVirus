<p>Food is an important vehicle for the transmission of infectious pathogens to humans. The high incidence of food-borne diseases coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of food-borne pathogens, have placed food safety high on the agenda of public health issues. Cockroaches appear to be suitable mechanical transmitters for a wide range of food-borne pathogenic microorganisms due to their filthy behaviour and occurrence in places where food is stored or handled.

 </sup> In this way, cockroaches can easily contaminate food when they come into contact with it. Although there exist about 4000 species of cockroaches, only 30 are associated with human habitations.

 </sup> Generally, the role of cockroaches in human infections is poorly understood and has been an issue of debate for several years. In the last 2 decades, there has been an accumulation of adequate research data that contributes significantly to our understanding of this subject.

 </sup> In this regard, the scientific community could benefit from a review of available research data that can provide a global understanding of the role of cockroaches in transmission of human infections. Therefore, in this review article, the author aims to elucidate the possible role of cockroaches in the transmission of food-borne pathogens by reviewing the relevant research publications.
