<p>About 2.9 billion people worldwide depend on biomass fuel, such as wood, charcoal, coal, animal dung, and crop residues, for their household cooking and heating [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, use of these fuel sources inside houses produces high levels of household air pollution (HAP), including particulate matter, methane, carbon monoxide, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds, which may penetrate into organs and tissue [

For example, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is working to reduce the use of fuel burning stoves and to increase the number of improved cook stoves in Guatemala [

Given the growing public health importance of arboviruses in the Americas, it is important to understand whether such interventions might have unintended consequences, such as increasing risks for mosquito-borne infectious diseases. This study focuses on firewood, which is the predominant energy source for cooking in Central America [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate associations between DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV infection and household air pollution (HAP) or specific characteristics of firewood cooking in the household. This study evaluates the associations of cooking with firewood, the location in the house where someone cooks with firewood, the type of stove used to cook with firewood, and the times per week cooking at home with firewood, with arboviral infections in Santa Rosa, Guatemala, where firewood cooking is the most common cooking method [
