<p>The protocol for the VICo surveillance project received approval from the institutional review boards of UVG (Guatemala City, Guatemala), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA), and the Guatemala Ministry of Public Health and Welfare. This study uses de-identified data from VICo and was determined to qualify for exemption from full Institutional Review Board review. Patients were asked for verbal consent for eligibility screening. If they satisfied the case definitions, they were asked for written, informed consent for participation in the study. We obtained verbal assent from minors &lt;18 years of age and written, informed consent from their parents or legal guardians.</p>
