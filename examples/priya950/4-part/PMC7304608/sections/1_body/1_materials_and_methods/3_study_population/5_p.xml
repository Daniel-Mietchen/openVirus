<p>A bulk stool specimen was collected from all consenting subjects enrolled with diarrhea. Rectal swabs were done on children &lt;5 years of age who were unable to provide a specimen. Stool culture was used to detect bacterial infections including 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> sp. ELISA IgM was used to detect rotavirus. RT-PCR was used to detect norovirus-1 and 2, sapovirus, and astrovirus. Conventional PCR was used to detect 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Due to relatively low sensitivity of fecal smear microscopy [

 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>) were excluded from analyses. Patients enrolled into the study with diarrheal symptoms were not tested for arboviruses due to the enrollment and testing procedures for the surveillance system (at enrollment into the study, patients were assigned to febrile or diarrheal groups based on their symptoms and laboratory tests were conducted accordingly).
