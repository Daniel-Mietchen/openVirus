<p>Cases were defined as those presenting AFI who tested positive for DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV infection based on RT-PCR or ELISA tests from 2011 (when the questions regarding cooking with firewood were added to the survey) to 2018. Controls were confirmed bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses during 2011â€“2018 (e.g., 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, rotavirus, norovirus-1 and 2, sapovirus, and astrovirus). We only included diarrheal controls with confirmed bacterial or viral infections because diarrhea may be a symptom of an arbovirus infection [
