<p>This study has several limitations. First, there is likely unmeasured confounding in this study, such as whether participants used mosquito prevention measures (e.g., mosquito nets, fumigating), the number of open water-holding containers around patients’ households, household sanitation, and arbovirus transmission site. It could be that cases were infected at work, school, or elsewhere away from the home where they were not exposed to firewood smoke. However, we do not expect other sources of smoke to be strong confounders, and our adjustment for community population density should help reduce biases associated with arbovirus transmission sites. Second, this was a case-control study, so we are unable to make causal inferences about the relationship between arboviral infection and firewood cooking, only associations. Third, this study included patients from a hospital and health center and is thus not representative of all of Santa Rosa Department or Guatemala. Fourth, although we only included diarrheal controls with confirmed bacterial or viral infections in an attempt to ensure controls were not cases, most diarrheal controls were not tested for arboviruses. Non-differential misclassification of the outcome may dilute the magnitude of the odds ratios (biased towards the null). Fifth, we do not know when arbovirus transmission occurred in relation to wood smoke exposure, but our questionnaire reflects the patients’ typical past exposures. Sixth, it is unknown whether hospital controls with diarrheal illnesses, like norovirus, influenced the susceptibility of the patients to arboviruses. Finally, it is unknown whether HAP exposure influences diarrheal controls’ susceptibility to a diarrheal infection and therefore, selection into this study (Berkson’s bias). However, one study in California demonstrated PM

 <sub>2</sub>, and O

 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. An attempt was made to minimize this risk by limiting the controls to confirmed bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses, and excluding respiratory infections and undiagnosed diarrheal illnesses. There were insufficient numbers of febrile illnesses of other infections (e.g.,
