<p>Results of our case-control study suggest that arboviral infections were inversely associated with exposure to higher levels of biomass smoke. We did not find associations between arboviral infections and lower levels of biomass smoke. These results were supported by analyses that treated HAP exposure as a composite score, which demonstrated inverse associations with the two highest HAP exposure levels.</p>
