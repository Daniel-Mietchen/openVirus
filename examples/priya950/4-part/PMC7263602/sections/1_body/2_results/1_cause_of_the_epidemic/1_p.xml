<p>The unit was under closed management from September 10, 2018, when the training began, until the beginning of the epidemic on October 27. None of the trainees and trainers went outside the camp, nor did they have contact with people outside. We speculate that the infection source of the epidemic was an individual with an asymptomatic infection. Due to a month of high-intensity training and poor adaptation to the boot camp’s cold and dry climate, that individual’s immunity became compromised, and he started shedding infectious virus. During the early stage of the epidemic, the unit health center failed to make a timely diagnosis and did not take effective isolation measures.</p>
