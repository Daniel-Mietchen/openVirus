<p>A calculation of the attack rate of the entire outbreak estimated that a patient transmitted the disease to an average of 5.1 (95% CI: 4.6 to 5.6) susceptible individuals (basic reproductive number) during the contagious period. The probability of a susceptible individual being infected by contacting a patient (dormitory transmission rate) was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18). In a dormitory with at least one adenovirus type 7 patient, the secondary attack rate was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.32).</p>
