<p>We estimated that the basic reproductive number during this epidemic was 5.1, which is higher than the basic reproductive number (1.2) of the swine flu outbreak in New Jersey, USA, in 1976 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the basic reproductive number (3.3) of the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in New York City in 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The dormitory transmission rate helped further elucidate the efficiency of virus transmission in the dormitory. The rate for this epidemic was 0.15, which was close to the family transmission rate (0.14) of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 but lower than that (0.32 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], 0.42 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) of interpandemic influenza A. These differences indicate that the dormitory transmission rate for this epidemic was relatively low. A possible reason for the relatively low dormitory transmission rate is that the patients were isolated promptly and, thus, did not contact susceptible individuals; another possible reason is that the concentration of the virus inside the dormitory was low after taking certain measures, such as window ventilation and air disinfection.
