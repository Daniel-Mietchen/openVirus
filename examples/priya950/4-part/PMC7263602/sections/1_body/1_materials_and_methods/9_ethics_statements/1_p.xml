<p>The Northern Theater CDC is responsible for investigating and controlling public health emergencies. The investigation of the adenovirus type 7 epidemic was a public health concern and, therefore, did not require review by the institutional review board or written informed consent. Respondentsâ€™ responses during the investigation were voluntary. Information on patients includes age, class, date of onset, date of treatment, and clinical symptoms. All data were fully anonymized before access.</p>
