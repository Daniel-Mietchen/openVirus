<p>Investigators randomly collected throat swabs from 40 patients and then used an adenovirus nucleic acid detection kit (JC10117, Bioperfectus Technologies, Jiangsu, China) and influenza type A and type B kits (JC10103 and JC10104, Bioperfectus Technologies) for a real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR). After adenovirus nucleic acid was detected and influenza virus infection was ruled out, we then used typing detection kits to concurrently assess for the presence of adenovirus types 3, 4, 7, 14, and 55. (Typing primer sets were ordered from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, according to the primer sets sequences of the above adenovirus types provided by our research group. The primer sets sequences are listed in

 <sup>TM</sup> life science, Beijing Hooseen biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Eventually, positive results were obtained for adenovirus type 7 for all of the samples, whereas adenovirus types 3, 4, 14, and 55 were not detected.
