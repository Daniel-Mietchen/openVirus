<p>All exposed individuals who did not develop disease symptoms participated in normal training, and their body temperature was monitored four times a day. Doctors made several rounds of visits to ensure that individuals with a high fever were promptly identified and sent to the fever clinic. The three districts had different dining times, and disinfection of the dining and kitchen utensils was strengthened. The supermarket in the camp was closed to prevent cross-infection. Preventive disinfection of the unit health center, dining hall, dormitories, restrooms, and vehicles specifically allocated for patient transportation was performed daily. Adenovirus prevention and treatment leaflets were produced and issued to all trainees.</p>
