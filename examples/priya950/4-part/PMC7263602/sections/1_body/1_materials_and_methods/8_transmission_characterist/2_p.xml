<p>In addition to training outdoors, the trainees spent most of their time in the dormitory resting and studying. To determine the virus transmission efficiency in the dormitory, we estimated the secondary attack rate in the dormitory; this rate was calculated by dividing the number of next-generation patients in a dormitory with at least one patient by the total number of exposed individuals in the same dormitory. Additionally, we also estimated the dormitory transmission rate by using the Reed-Frost method, which refers to the probability of a susceptible individual in the dormitory being infected by exposure to a patient.</p>
