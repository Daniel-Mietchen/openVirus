<p>The generation time refers to the duration between successive onsets of symptoms in a pair with a transmission relationship. Here, following a previous study, we used the Weibull distribution as the probability distribution of the generation time [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We determined the disease onset intervals of the infector and the infectee by using the same transmission chain used for calculating the incubation period. Similarly, we randomly sampled from the two intervals by using the bootstrap method and calculated two parameters for the probability density function according to the maximum likelihood method.
