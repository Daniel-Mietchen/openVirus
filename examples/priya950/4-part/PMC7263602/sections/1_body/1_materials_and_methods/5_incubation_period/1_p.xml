<p>The incubation period refers to the duration between infection and the appearance of symptoms. Previous studies have shown that the incubation period of most respiratory infections follows a lognormal distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. First, we searched for infector-infectee pairs and investigated the intervals between the infection and the onset. Then, 1000 samples were randomly selected from the two intervals by using the bootstrap method. For each sample, we calculated two parameters for the probability density function according to the maximum likelihood method. A point estimate was acquired by calculating the median of the two parameters.
