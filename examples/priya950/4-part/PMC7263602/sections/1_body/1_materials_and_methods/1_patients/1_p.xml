<p>On September 10, 2018, new recruits at a boot camp in Jilin Province, Northeast China, began closed military training. All the trainees and trainers were men. The ages of the trainees ranged mainly between 18 and 22 years, whereas the trainers were older, mostly between 20 and 26 years of age. All of the trainees remained within a closed camp for training, eating, resting, and shopping, and there were no other soldiers, except for the trainees, in the camp. On October 27, individuals presented with symptoms, including high fever, fatigue, systemic pain, and sore throat, and some patients presented with diarrhea. The unit health center sent trainees with a persistent high fever and severe symptoms to a large local hospital for treatment. On November 10, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the Northern Theater Command (Northern Theater CDC) systematically carried out epidemiological investigations and preventive and control measures. These investigations showed that this unit had recruited 835 trainees. In addition, the unit had almost 135 trainers, who were primarily responsible for providing training and performing daily management. All trainees were divided into three districts, each containing 24â€“27 classes, and each district lived separately in dormitory buildings. Each class, which consisted of 10 trainees, were assigned to a separate dormitory. All trainees dined together in one dining hall.</p>
