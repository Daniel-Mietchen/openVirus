  <p>Evolved fitness of VSV lineages after 10 passages at 40°C on BHK cells. Fitness measured via plaque assay as viral growth after 24 hr at 40°C starting with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 particles/cell. Circles are the 37°C lineages and squares the random lineages. Each symbol indicates the mean fitness of a single virus lineage with the 95% CI shown. Fitness of the ancestral strains under the same conditions is indicated by outlined symbols, evolved populations by filled symbols. The random treatment group evolved higher grand mean fitness than the 37°C group (t = −4.8036,
