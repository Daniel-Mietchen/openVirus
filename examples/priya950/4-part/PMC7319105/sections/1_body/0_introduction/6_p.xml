<p>Here, we used the two sets of viruses generated by Alto et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) to test whether prior adaptation versus maladaptation was consequential for the rate of fitness improvement in a novel temperature for host‐cell infection: 40°C. We confirmed that the virus lineages previously passaged under stochastic temperatures harbored relatively greater genetic variation, but that both sets of populations were equally of low fitness in the novel environment. We then created a gene pool (mixture) of variants drawn from populations evolved at constant 37°C and similarly for viruses that previously experienced a random temperature environment. These two gene pools were each used to found five replicate lineages that were passaged for an additional 10 days (40 generations) of virus evolution at 40°C. We determined whether historical contingency (prior adaptation vs. maladaptation) led to differing rates of evolvability in the evolutionary time allowed by the current experiment. In addition, we conducted whole‐genome sequencing of evolved viruses to infer which mutations may be responsible for fitness improvement at 40°C and to discern whether populations showed identical (parallel) versus unique mutational solutions to the common selective problem: improved host‐cell infection at 40°C.
