<p>Prior to initiation of the current experimental evolution, we used replicated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) fitness assays to test whether the ancestral pools (constant, random) differed in growth performance in the 40°C environment intended to impose virus selection. Results showed that the constant ancestral pool had a mean absolute fitness of 9.64 ± 0.21 s.d.m. log10 PFU/ml, and the ancestral random pool had a mean absolute fitness of 9.57 ± 0.29 s.d.m. log10 PFU/ml; outlined symbols in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Comparison of these data revealed that the two ancestral pools did not statistically differ in mean fitness (t = 0.3345, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 7.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .74). We concluded that neither ancestral mixture was advantaged in fitness performance in the 40°C selective environment, prior to initiation of the current experimental evolution.
