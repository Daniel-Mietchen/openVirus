<p>To test the main hypothesis that historical contingency should cause viruses evolved under constant 37°C temperature versus random temperatures to generally differ in adaptability at 40°C, we compared the grand mean fitness improvement for the two sets of evolved populations. Results (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) showed that the grand mean log10 fitness of the random populations was numerically greater than that of the constant lineages: LS means ± SE: 10.28 ± 0.06 versus 9.67 ± 0.06 PFU/ml. Furthermore, a statistical analysis showed that these two values significantly differed (linear mixed model: F

 <italic>p</italic> = .0001; t = −4.8036, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 4.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .0068). We concluded from the data and analysis that the prior selection under random temperatures led to an adaptive advantage, on average, in fitness gained at 40°C, relative to viruses evolved under prior constant 37°C selection.
