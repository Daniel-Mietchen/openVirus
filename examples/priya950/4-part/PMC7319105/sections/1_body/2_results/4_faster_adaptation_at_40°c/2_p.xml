<p>We hypothesized that prior selection at constant 37°C temperature versus at random temperatures ranging between 29°C and 37°C would impact further ability for RNA viruses to adapt to constant elevated temperature of 40°C (i.e., effect of historical contingency). To do so, we used each ancestral gene pool to create five new lineages that underwent 10 passages (40 virus generations) of selection at 40°C (Figure
