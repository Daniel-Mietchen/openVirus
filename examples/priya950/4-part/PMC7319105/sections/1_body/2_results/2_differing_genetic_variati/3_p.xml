<p>Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) offers a more powerful approach than Sanger sequencing, to identify rare alleles present at low frequencies in a population. In the current study, we obtained NGS data for the five populations evolved previously at 37°C and for those evolved under random temperatures, to determine whether they differed in average genetic diversity. Consensus sequences derived from NGS confirmed that there are more variable sites across the VSV genomes of lineages in the random treatment (

 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), the frequency spectrum of the MAFVs in the random lineages was shifted toward higher frequencies compared with those from the 37°C treatment, with an average MAFV

 <italic>p</italic> = .0025; Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). We concluded that the lineages evolved previously under random temperatures contained greater average allelic diversity than those evolved at strictly 37°C.
