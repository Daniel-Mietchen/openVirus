<p>We then sought to confirm that the sampling of the sets of evolved populations to create the two ancestral gene pools (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) was successful in maintaining the observed difference in mean genetic variation described above. To do so, we generated consensus sequences and conducted variant analysis on NGS data for each of the two ancestral pools created for the current study. Results confirmed that the diversity difference remained after the sets of lineages were combined to create the ancestral pools; the constant ancestral pool showed 71 variable sites, whereas the random ancestral pool presented 100 variable sites (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material"> S4</xref>). We concluded that the random ancestral pool was more genetically variable than the constant ancestral pool.
