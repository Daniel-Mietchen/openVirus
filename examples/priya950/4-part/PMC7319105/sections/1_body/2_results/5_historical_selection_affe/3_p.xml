<p>We observed that consensus sequences of the terminal (passage 10; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) populations showed different amounts of variation across the two treatment groups. Variant analysis on the NGS data confirmed more variable sites (frequency &gt; 1%) (broader mutational spectrum) in the random lineages (
 <italic>N</italic> = 123), relative to the 37°C lineages (
 <italic>N</italic> = 96), although the difference was not significant (t = 1.88, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 6.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .1082; Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 </xref>and
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material"> S6</xref>). Interestingly, of the 33 mutations depicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, only 11 were detectable (frequency &gt; 1%) in the respective ancestral gene pools, or detected when inspecting the individual NGS data for the five original lineages that were used to create each of the ancestral gene pools (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, File 
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 </xref>and
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material"> S4</xref>). These results suggest that the majority of mutations relevant for adaptation to the 40°C environment appeared de novo via spontaneous mutation in the current study, after the populations had entered the new selective environment.
