<p>For Sanger sequencing of evolved populations, the resulting PCR fragments were purified using a mixture of 1ul of Exonuclease I (
 <italic>Exo1</italic>; NEB), 1ul Alkaline phosphatase (NEB), and 1ul of Alkaline phosphatase buffer (NEB) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min followed by 80°C for an additional 20 min. Sequencing was performed via dye termination (Sanger) at the Yale University DNA Analysis Facility at Science Hill using primers listed in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36287-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. Sequence processing and genome assembly were performed in Geneious 11.1.4 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>), and polymorphic sites were confirmed by visual inspection of chromatograms. The resulting sequence represented the population consensus genome. Variable sites within a sample were identified as secondary peaks. However, minority variants were likely missed by this approach, since only high frequency variants were detectable (Remold et al.,
