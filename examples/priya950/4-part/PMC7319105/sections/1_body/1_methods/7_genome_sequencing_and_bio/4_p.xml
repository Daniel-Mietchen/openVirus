<p>Ion Torrent‐sequencing libraries were constructed from the two ancestral pools (constant, random) and samples from passage 10, for each of the evolved lineages (
 <italic>N</italic> = 12). Amplified genomes were purified using SPRI beads (Rohland &amp; Reich, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and sheared to an average size of 400bp using a Covaris E210 fragmentation (Covaris). Viral fragments belonging to the same sample were then combined in equimolar concentrations. Barcoded libraries were prepared from each sample pool with the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies). Samples were sequenced at the Yale University DNA Analysis Facility at Science Hill, using an Ion PGM
 <sup>TM</sup> System (Life Technologies).
