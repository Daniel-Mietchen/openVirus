<p>For library preparation and deep sequencing of ancestral populations, Illumina‐sequencing libraries were constructed from the 10 lineages from Alto et al., (
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) that were used to generate the two ancestral pools. For these samples, each step from reverse transcription through sequencing was completed in duplicate, resulting in two technical replicates of each sample. Amplified genome fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and the eight fragments from each virus population were combined to create an equimolar mixture. Libraries were prepared from the pooled viral amplicons using the Nextera XT Kit (Illumina Inc.) and the Nextera Index Kit (Illumina Inc.). Samples were sequenced via paired‐end, 75bp‐read Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc.) at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Quality control of reads was conducted using FastQC (Andrews, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) with a minimum quality score of 20 and a minimum length of 30bp.
