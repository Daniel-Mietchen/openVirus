<p>Absolute fitness is defined as the observed mean capacity (titer reported as log10 PFU per mL) for a test virus to produce infectious virus particles when grown on cells at MOI = 0.01, where direct virus–virus interactions within coinfected cells are minimized (Wasik, Muñoz‐Rojas, Okamoto, Miller‐Jensen, &amp; Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Absolute fitness was measured by allowing a test virus to infect BHK cells under the above‐described culture conditions, followed by plaque assays of serially diluted aliquots to estimate titer. Aliquots grown on BHK cells were plated under DMEM with 10% heat‐inactivated fetal bovine serum and solidified with 1% low‐melt agarose and incubated for 24 hr at 37°C. After incubation, agarose was removed and cells were stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. Each plaque was assumed to have originated from a single infecting virus.
