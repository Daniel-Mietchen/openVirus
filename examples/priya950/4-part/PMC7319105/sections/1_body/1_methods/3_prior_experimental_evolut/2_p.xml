<p>All viruses in the current study came from a prior evolution experiment (Alto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Briefly, an ancestral clone of VSV was used to found five replicate populations (lineages) in each of two treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The high temperature treatment imposed constant selection at 37°C. The random treatment imposed a randomly chosen temperature on each passage day, within the interval ranging between 29°C and 37°C (i.e., exposure to 1 of 9 possible temperatures each day with median = 33.2°C; see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> of Alto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). To initiate each treatment population, a cell monolayer was infected with ancestral VSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 viruses per cell. After one hour incubation at 37°C, the infected monolayer was incubated for an additional 23 hr according to the treatment regime; the common 37°C adsorption step avoided potential confounding effects of temperature‐dependent differences in virus attachment. After 24 hr, each population was diluted 10
 <sup>5</sup>‐fold to begin the subsequent passage. This process was repeated for 25 passages total (i.e., ~100 generations of VSV evolution; Miralles, Moya, &amp; Elena, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). At each passage, aliquots of supernatant containing the virus progeny were sampled from each lineage and stored at −80°C for future analysis.
