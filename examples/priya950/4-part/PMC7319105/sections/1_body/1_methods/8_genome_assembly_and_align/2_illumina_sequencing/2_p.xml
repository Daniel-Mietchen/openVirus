<p>Illumina sequences were mapped to the publicly available VSV genome (GI:9627229) using BWA v0.7.12 (Li &amp; Durbin, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) with default parameters. Consensus sequences and minority‐variant tables were generated using the QUASR pipeline (Watson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) with a minimum variant frequency cutoff of 0.01. Only polymorphisms detected in both technical sequencing replicates of each sample were retained to reduce false‐positive results arising during the sequencing process.
