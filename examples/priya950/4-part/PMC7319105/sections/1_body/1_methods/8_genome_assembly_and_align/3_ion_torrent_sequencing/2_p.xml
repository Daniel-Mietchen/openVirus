<p>Quality of the Ion Torrent runs was inspected using FastQC v.0.11.5 (Andrews, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Reads were quality (‐t 27 –l 30) and size‐filtered (30‐ 250bp) using the FASTX‐Toolkit v.0.0.14 (

 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Average genome coverage was 2123.7X ± 1131.3 (49.2X‐4061.9X), with population B from the random treatment failing to yield reads. Consensus sequences and pileup files were generated with SAMtools v.1.5 (Li and Durbin,

 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>,). Variable sites were identified using VarScan2 v.2.4.3 (Koboldt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>); only variants present at frequencies above 1% (0.01) were considered and indels were excluded. Variants at frequencies above 90% were also excluded, since they referred to 107 sites confirmed to have been fixed between the VSV reference genome (GI:9627229) and the ancestral populations from Alto et al., (
