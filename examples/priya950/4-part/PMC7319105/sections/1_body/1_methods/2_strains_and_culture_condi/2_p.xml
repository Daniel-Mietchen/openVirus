<p>Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were obtained from the laboratory of Esteban Domingo (University of Madrid) and were used as hosts for virus infection. Cells were grown in 6‐well tissue culture plates under Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 95% relative humidity, and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to achieve confluent monolayers of ~1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Viruses were originally derived from the Mudd Summer strain of VSV Indiana serotype.
