<p>Foremost, it is clear that predictions of RNA virus emergence pose important and difficult challenges in biomedicine and public health, and we believe that the results of our study are both relevant and useful for refining emergence predictions. In particular, certain bat species are known to serve as animal reservoirs of RNA viruses that emerge as zoonotic disease agents in humans and other mammals (Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, &amp; Schountz, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Bats in the family 
 <italic>Pteropodidae</italic> (commonly known as “flying foxes”) can harbor henipaviruses, such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus, with high case‐fatality rates when these viruses spillover into hosts such as horses and humans. It is unclear whether particular physiological and behavioral traits can best explain why some bat species tend to serve as RNA‐virus reservoirs. The fluctuating body temperatures of bats offer one key possibility: the body temperatures of bats can be very low when daily roosting and during extended hibernation, whereas these temperatures can be greatly elevated when bats are actively flying and foraging for food (Calisher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Because viremias in apparently healthy bats are observed to be unaffected by these temperature extremes, the immunobiology of bats has received attention to explain why these mammals can harbor diverse communities of viruses without succumbing to illness (e.g., Xie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Regardless of the explanatory mechanism, our study suggests a related phenomenon that may merit attention. Our observed results support the concept that RNA viruses with greater access to genetic variation enhanced evolvability compared to RNA viruses with less genetic variation when encountering novel environments distinct from the prior habitat. The apparent persistence of RNA virus populations and communities within individual bats might create diverse variant pools that fail to reach high titers (i.e., viremias within bats are constant but do not reach the high loads expected when a virus overwhelms the host immune system). The relatively diverse viruses evolved in stochastic (random) temperatures in the Alto et al., (
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) study could be viewed as analogous to those within a bat reservoir. By further analogy, the observed evolvability advantage of these viruses in a constant new environment (40°C) might be similar to the success of viruses that spillover from bats into novel hosts, such as humans and horses, with constant and higher body temperatures than those experienced in the bat reservoirs. For this reason, it might be useful to test how the genetic variance of important emerging RNA viruses is affected when cultured in the laboratory under constant versus fluctuating temperatures, and whether this history impacts performance and evolution at novel temperatures seen in endpoint (emergence) hosts.
