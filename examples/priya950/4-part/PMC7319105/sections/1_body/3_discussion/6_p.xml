<p>Our observed findings that some previously selected RNA virus populations (random populations) have improved performance at the thermal niche limits may be applicable to another real‐life example relevant to public health. Cold‐adapted genotypes of Influenza A virus may have a selective advantage in terms of increased survival outside of the preferred niche, potentially contributing to additional cases and flu epidemics (Hatta et al.,
