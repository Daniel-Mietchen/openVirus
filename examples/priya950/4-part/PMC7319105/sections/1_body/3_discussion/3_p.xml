<p>Experimental evolution studies offer useful “proving grounds” to test how biological populations adapt to new environmental challenges, and to gauge whether theory accurately predicts how current performance relates to future evolution (Garland &amp; Rose, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Here, we showed that virus population adaptation and maladaptation in a selective environment were consequential for fitness improvements in a novel environment. Specifically, RNA virus populations evolved in a constant high temperature (37°C) were disadvantaged in evolvability at the thermal niche edge (40°C), compared to their counterparts with a history of evolution in stochastic (random) temperatures. Furthermore, we found that virus populations previously evolved in stochastic temperatures contained greater genetic variation coupled with their greater adaptability than virus populations evolved in constant high temperature (37°C). Our empirical studies support the notion that RNA viruses maladapted to a previous environment (i.e., random populations) may have a fitness advantage in novel environments, in part, through access to conditionally beneficial alleles which may influence their adaptive potential (McBride &amp; Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; evolutionary revolutions, Lenormand, Roze, &amp; Rousset, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Theory predicts and empirical observations support the notion that fluctuating thermal environments should enhance tolerance at thermal extremes (Duncan, Fellous, Quillery, &amp; Kaltz, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Levins, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1968</xref>; Lynch &amp; Gabriel, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>). Thus, historical contingency may facilitate preadaptation and the emergence of organisms (pathogens) in novel environments (Arnold, Jackson, Waterfield, &amp; Mansfield, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Ketola et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Lee &amp; Gelembiuk, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). On the one hand, the repeatability of this outcome suggests it might be helpful for the overall goal of refining our power to make evolutionary predictions: Lineages that perform relatively worse in their current environment can still be potentiated to “leapfrog” in evolvability over counterpart lineages historically evolved near the new selective target. On the other hand, it is unknown whether the result would be repeatable if the new environment was slightly different, such as adaptation to cellular infection at 38°C or 39°C or adaptation to another type of stressful environment (pH, salinity). For example, populations of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> selected for increased desiccation resistance showed correlated responses to resistance to other stressors including heat shock and starvation (Hoffman &amp; Parsons, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1989a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0021" ref-type="ref"> b</xref>). Other experiments on viral adaptation to novel hosts have tested whether host‐selection regimes result in positive or negative correlated performance in either the original or unselected (novel) hosts, and multiple outcomes have been observed (Cooper &amp; Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Greene et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Novella, Hershey, Escarmis, Domingo, &amp; Holland, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Turner &amp; Elena, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Weaver, Brault, Kang, &amp; Holland, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Zárate &amp; Novella, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This dichotomy is precisely the reason why historical contingency and evolvability studies are intriguing and vital areas for future work. If underlying patterns truly exist, it may be plausible (albeit dismaying) to conceive that advancements may only come from increased sheer effort: use more attempts to examine effects of historical contingency on evolvability in empirical studies across various biological systems, and observe whether patterns emerge. Notably, differences in the current study design might have unknown effects on the observed outcome. We created gene pools for the 37°C and random temperature evolved populations and sub‐sampled from each pool to establish the replicate populations challenged to evolve at 40°C; this design emphasized the effect of relatively low (37°C evolved) versus high (random evolved) genetic variation on 40°C adaptation, when initial diversity of replicate populations is sampled from the same source pool. Alternatively, each population from the prior study could have served as an independent replicate in the current experiment, emphasizing the role of low versus high diversity on adaptation, when founding pools differ by a greater extent. Likewise, different outcomes may have resulted from imposed alternative randomly changing temperature regimes each experimental passage, or if the period between temperature switches had been modified. A possible future study could examine these alternative designs, to test whether it changes the observed outcome.
