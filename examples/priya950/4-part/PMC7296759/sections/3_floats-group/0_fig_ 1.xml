  <p>Vector age at time of infection acquisition determines transmission opportunity. Uninfected mosquitoes (black, left) acquire an infection at Age
   <sub>acquisition</sub> (black vertical lines) and after a certain EIP (black dashed lines), a proportion will become infectious (red, right), but for a certain period of time (red horizontal lines) that is dependent on Age
   <sub>acquisition</sub>
