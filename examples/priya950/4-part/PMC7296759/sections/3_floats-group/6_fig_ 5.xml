  <p>Vectorial capacity calculations using VC
   <sub>age</sub>. VC
   <sub>age</sub> values (y-axis) depend on the age at acquisition (x-axis). Each curve calculated based on pre-determined bite rates of 2 (yellow line), 1 (blue line), and 0.5 (black line) for (left) EIP
   <sub>max</sub> of the YOUNG group, = 45% at 23 dpi, and (right) EIP
   <sub>min</sub> of the YOUNG group = 15% at 11 dpi. The dotted line represents the lower limit of VC where below this threshold, R
   <sub>0</sub> is less than 1
