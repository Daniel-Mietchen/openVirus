<p id="Par13">VC uses an average daily probability of survival to calculate the probability of a mosquito living through the EIP (p
 <sup>N</sup>) and p
 <sup>N</sup>/(− ln(p) represents the expected infectious days given N and p [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is intuitive how mortality could impact transmission, but most studies address mortality based on a constant age at which the mosquito acquires the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mathematical modeling studies have addressed age structure with respect to EIP or bite-structure, but no studies have empirically investigated all three processes simultaneously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, herein, we experimentally test the hypothesis that transmission dynamics of arboviruses are as or more affected by time as a function of age 
 <italic>versus</italic> time as a function of days post-infection. We further develop an age-structured vectorial capacity equation (VC
 <sub>age</sub>) to quantify these potential effects.
