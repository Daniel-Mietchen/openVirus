<p id="Par10">The transmission dynamics of arboviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) are evaluated over several characteristics, namely vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the primary vector of ZIKV and several studies have evaluated its competence to transmit the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Vector competence is the ability of a mosquito to acquire and ultimately transmit a virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The time it takes for this process to occur is referred to as the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Vector competence and EIP are interrelated measures of the proportion of vectors that become infectious given exposure and the time it takes for a vector to become infectious given exposure, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, EIP can be described as the temporality of vector competence and has been used to evaluate the relative fitness of arbovirus systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, EIP and vector competence are influenced by many parameters including vector species, mosquito-immune system, microbiota fauna, discrete populations within species, and environmental factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
