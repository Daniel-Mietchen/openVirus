<p id="Par47">A study by Althouse et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] also found that the temporality of transmission from non-human primates was sometimes more impactful than the magnitude of the viremia leading to transmission to the mosquito. They proposed a “tortoise-and-the-hare” (TatH) model to describe this relationship between arboviral viremia profiles in non-human primates and the predicted transmission success to vectors, showing that the strategy of “slow and steady” viremia, i.e. lower levels for longer periods, resulted in higher predicted transmission success of arboviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This same TatH model recently described macro-transmission dynamics in Colombia, where it was demonstrated that slow burn-in epidemics actually resulted in cumulatively more cases and higher R
 <sub>0</sub> values than in initially explosive outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Vector competence is a continuous process over time, and as such, EIP
 <sub>min</sub> and EIP
 <sub>max</sub> are not independent measures. Thus, vector competence profiles with higher transmission rates at earlier times (“hare strategy”) will always be more fit than lower proportions at the same EIP. However, this study demonstrates that in systems where the maximum measured vector competence is low, but the time to minimum transmission is short (“tortoise strategy”) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], there is still a good chance the system will succeed. VC
 <sub>age</sub> also suggests that how arbovirus phenotypes are compared and ranked, and perhaps even how the field identifies ‘highly’ or ‘negligibly’ competent vectors, may need adjustment in the context of mosquito age.
