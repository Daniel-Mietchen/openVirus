<p id="Par45">The methodologies in this study highlight the need to understand the quantitative interaction between vector competence, mosquito mortality, and age at time of infection acquisition. Thus, we anticipate that this methodology could be used to explore other important modifiers of vector competence and mosquito mortality and the interaction of the two, such as innate mosquito immunity response to infection, adult and larval microbiome, as well as other extrinsic factors known to affect these traits [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This means that transmission is ultimately impacted by the interactions of all of these temporally dependent processes, and future studies should consider the age structure when assessing these impacts. Studies have also shown the impact of vector species, in particular the difference between field-derived and laboratory strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Here, we used a laboratory strain of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, which has been shown to vary in its competence when compared to a field-derived strain. Future use of VC
