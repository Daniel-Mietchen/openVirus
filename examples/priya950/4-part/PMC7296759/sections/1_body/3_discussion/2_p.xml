<p id="Par43">Our study, which focused upon the age at the time of infectious blood meal, showed no significant impacts on the vector competence of colony 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for ZIKV. While a recent study did show there were significant effects of multiple blood meals on vector competence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], we delivered the second blood meal at a much longer interval (7 days 
 <italic>versus</italic> 3 dpi in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]), which likely plays a role in this disparate finding and indicates that there may be age-dependence in this phenomenon as well. However, this hypothesis is outside the scope of the present study. In our mortality study, we did observe a modest difference in TTD. We also observed a very short TTD in mosquitoes only given sugar with no blood meal. We chose not to pursue these effects, as the differences in TTD were modest and the impacts of no blood meal have been previously observed.
