<p id="Par44">The technology for determining the age structure of natural mosquito populations in the field is currently still in development. For example, a study using near-infrared spectroscopy was able to predict the age of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> ± 2 days, indicating that determining the age structure of a mosquito population is possible, and that such technology could be refined for field studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Further, mid-infrared spectroscopy had varying, but some promising results in determining the age structure of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. As these technologies are pursued and refined, there will be a need for ways to understand and quantify age-dependent interactions among vector competence, EIP, mosquito lifespan, and biting behavior [
