<p id="Par46">Our results demonstrate the importance of age structure when evaluating the fitness of a mosquito-virus system and indicate that R
 <sub>0</sub> may be overestimated when it is not considered. This framework further shows that how within-mosquito arbovirus fitness is measured, often by comparing proportions of transmitting mosquitoes at arbitrary time points, is not sufficient. Here, when the Age
 <sub>acquisition</sub> was advanced, the difference in hypothetical EIPs necessary for the system to succeed was not very different. For example, in the OLDER and S.OLDER groups, there was only one day difference between the EIP
 <sub>min</sub> and EIP
 <sub>max</sub> needed for success at biting rates of 2 and 1, though these quantities represented a difference of 40% in the proportion of mosquitoes transmitting. The same trend was demonstrated in the YOUNG group where EIP
 <sub>min</sub> resulted in longer windows of opportunity compared to EIP
 <sub>max</sub>. Additionally, when the minimum time to transmission is shorter, a larger portion of the mosquito population contributes to transmission, because VC
 <sub>age</sub> implicates older mosquitoes in this scenario given no significant reduction in mortality due to extrinsic factors [

 <sub>age</sub> reveals that the temporality of the within-mosquito arbovirus dynamics is more impactful than the ultimate magnitude of this widely used fitness measure. More investigations into the earlier and minimal transmission rates, such as at earlier time points that we did not consider, may be warranted to quantify fully the contribution of lower but faster dissemination profiles in arbovirus systems.
