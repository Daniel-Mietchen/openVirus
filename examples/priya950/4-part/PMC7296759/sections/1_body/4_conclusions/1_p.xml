<p id="Par48">We demonstrate that mosquito age may not affect experimentally determined infection, dissemination, or transmission rates when assessed in the traditional days post-infection manner. However, when we consider mosquito mortality, EIP, and vector competence in the context of a more holistic measure of transmission potential, vectorial capacity, and further adjust VC for the effect of age at the time of mosquito infection, we demonstrate that age can be an important factor, and that how some arbovirus fitness measures are assessed may need reconsideration.</p>
