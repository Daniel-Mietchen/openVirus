<p id="Par36">Pairwise comparisons of the ZIKV-exposed treatments determined that group YOUNG had a significantly longer average time to death (TTD) when compared to groups OLDER and S.OLDER, though this difference was modest (0.6 and 1.4 days, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The TTD for the YOUNG group was 25.9 days, 25.3 days for the OLDER group, and 24.5 days for the S.OLDER group. This corresponds to average daily survival probabilities of 0.962, 0.961 and 0.960 for the YOUNG, OLDER and S.OLDER groups, respectively. Predicted daily survival rates were generated for the YOUNG group using a non-linear fit and a linear model was fit to the OLDER and S.OLDER groups. The parameters of these models and goodness-of-fit assessments are given in Additional file
