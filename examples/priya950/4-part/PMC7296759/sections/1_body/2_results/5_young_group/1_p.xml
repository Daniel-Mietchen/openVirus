<p id="Par39">To achieve an R
 <sub>0</sub> of 1, the vectorial capacity needed to be at or above 0.256. When parameterized with EIP
 <sub>max</sub>, the VC
 <sub>age</sub> at a biting rate of 0.5 (once every 2 days) did not achieve this minimal value, but at biting rates of once or twice per day, VC
 <sub>age</sub> was sufficient to push R
 <sub>0</sub> over the threshold of one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We next determined the window of opportunity, which encompasses the days post-emergence when a mosquito acquires an infection and which results in VC
 <sub>age</sub> values where R
 <sub>0</sub> would be greater than one. The window of opportunity when we parameterized VC
 <sub>age</sub> with EIP
 <sub>max</sub> indicated that a virus must be acquired within the first 2 days post-emergence when the bite rate was twice or once per day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, when parameterized with EIP
 <sub>min</sub>, all bite rates reached sufficient VC
 <sub>age</sub> values. The window of opportunity was 14 days post-emergence for a bite rate of twice a day, 12 days post-emergence for a bite rate of once a day, and 7 days post-emergence for a bite rate of once every 2 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Even at its highest, VC
 <sub>age</sub> indicates that traditional VC calculations are likely overestimates.
