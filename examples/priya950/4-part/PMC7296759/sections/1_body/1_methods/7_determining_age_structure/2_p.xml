<p id="Par24">Ten to twelve mosquitoes per each ZIKV-infected treatment (YOUNG, OLDER and S.OLDER) were placed in individual, clear plastic canisters (Bioquip, Rancho Dominquez, CA, USA) 24 h before being provided a blood meal 
 <italic>via</italic> a membrane feeder using 1 ml discs with 800 μl of blood (Hemotek, Blackburn, UK). This was done at the same dpi schedule as the vector competence studies above. Willingness to bite was assessed using a two-tiered approach by a single observer to control for observation bias. First, mosquitoes were observed through the clear canister for their general position in the canister and secondly, the disc was removed to determine if they were on or near the mesh at the top of the canister. In all cases, these two methods of observation matched. That is, if a mosquito was observed to be at the blood meal prior to disc removal (looking through the canister), it did not move to the bottom of the canister upon disc removal.
