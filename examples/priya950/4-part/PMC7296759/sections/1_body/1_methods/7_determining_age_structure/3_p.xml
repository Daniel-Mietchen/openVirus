<p id="Par25">This observation was performed at 1, 20 and 45 min post-placement of the disc and the disc was replaced between observation time points. Thus, a mosquito was assessed as “landed” and recorded as “1” if the female was at the top of the canister at any of the observation times. The female was otherwise classified as “not landed” and coded as “0” if she was at the bottom of the canister for all three observation times. We then calculated the probability of biting (Z) as a function of age. Z(age) was determined by fitting the proportion of mosquitoes that landed or fed at least once a day using a self-starting non-linear least squares regression:
