<p id="Par23">One of the most influential parameters for determining transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens is the biting rate (because it impacts vector-host transmission in both directions). Biting rate is sometimes parameterized as the reciprocal of the number of days between feeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This assumes that the waiting time between bites is exponentially distributed, and we make this assumption for three biting rates: 0.5 (once every two days); 1 (once a day); and 2 (twice a day) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, we wanted to determine if the willingness of the mosquito to probe was affected by (i) timing of infectious blood meal and/or (ii) age of the mosquito [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While mosquito biting is a function of many factors, it has been shown that heat cues are sufficient to initiate host-seeking behaviors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We use this to determine the willingness or probability of a mosquito probing, which can lead to transmission [
