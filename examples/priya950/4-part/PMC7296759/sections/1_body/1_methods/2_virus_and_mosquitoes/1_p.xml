<p id="Par15">ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (Asian lineage), originally isolated from a human patient in Puerto Rico in 2015, was provided by Dr Barbara Johnson at the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (GenBank: KU501215). The viral stock was passaged three times in Vero cells before passage on Vero cells for mosquito exposure. Supernatant was collected 3 days post-inoculation and titer determined as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The titer of ZIKV was verified by qRT-PCR at approximately 8 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> plaque forming units (pfu)/ml, matched across all exposure experiments. Virus used for mosquito exposure was never frozen, as this has been shown to negatively affect vector competence when compared to freshly cultured virus [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller) were provided by Dr Daniel Swale of the LSU Entomology Department, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. To isolate the effect(s) of age, mosquitoes were maintained at constant conditions with 16:8 h light:dark periods, approximately 80% humidity (monitored using a digital RH monitor), and at 28 °C constant temperature. Mosquitoes were supplied with a 10% sucrose water solution after emergence
