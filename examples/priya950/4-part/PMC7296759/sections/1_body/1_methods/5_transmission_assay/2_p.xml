<p id="Par19">Mosquitoes from the two OLDER groups were sampled at 5, 8 and 11 dpi, as well as 16 dpi to represent the end of the mortality study (28 dpe). In order to characterize the EIP across the mosquito’s lifetime, mosquitoes in group YOUNG were sampled at 5, 8 and 11 dpi, as well as additional days post-infection in order to match the age at which the older groups were sampled. Thus, by adding 7 to the time points in the older groups, we additionally sampled the YOUNG group at 12, 15 and 18 dpi, as well as 23 dpi which corresponds to the oldest time point of 28 days old. Samples were tested for the presence of viral RNA in saliva using the techniques described above [
