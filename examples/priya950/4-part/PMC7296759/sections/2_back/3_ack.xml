 <p>We would like to thank Dr. Barbara Johnson for providing our viral strain, as well as Dr. Daniel Swale for providing us with mosquito eggs. We would like to thank all our laboratory colleagues for putting up with the hogging of freezer space to hold all of the samples generated for this study. And last but not least, weâ€™d like to thank Aesop for his apparently ubiquitously applicable fable.</p>
