<p>Despite the identification of some of these potential risk factors, accurate prediction of human illness cases from WNV remains elusive at the local scale, especially as it is related to dynamic weather and mosquito infection status. Using long-term data on human WNV illness and intensive mosquito surveillance for the Chicago region, we can identify the fine scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability of human WNV epidemic in an urban environment. The overall goal of this study is to determine factors affecting the spatiotemporal variability of clinical WNV incidence in people through identification of the fine scale drivers of WNV transmission in an urban area with a repeated history of WNV outbreaks. These potential drivers include dynamic mosquito infection and weather. Our specific objectives in this study are to (i) describe the fine-scale temporal and spatial patterns of human WNV illness in the Chicago region, (ii) evaluate the temporal relationships between mosquito infection and human WNV illness, and (iii) determine the fine-scale dynamic effects of weather, land cover, mosquito infection, and demographic factors on the presence of human West Nile virus illness across time and space.</p>
