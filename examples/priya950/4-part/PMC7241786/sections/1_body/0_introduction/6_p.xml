<p>Different spatial scales have been used in geographical analyses to identify the drivers of human risk from WNV infections. The most commonly used spatial scale in the United States is counties [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], census tracts or Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], census block groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Each of these spatial scales has its own inherent biases, as these political boundaries do not necessarily correspond to the ecological processes of the disease in question [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Alternatively, dividing the area into equal spaces, such as rectangular bins or hexagons, has been used to reduce some of these biases (e.g. [
