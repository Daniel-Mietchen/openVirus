<p>West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease, was first identified in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York City [

 <italic>Culex</italic> species are the primary enzootic and bridge vectors for the transmission of WNV, and several bird species are known to contribute in the amplification of the virus [

 <italic>Culex</italic> vector mosquitoes and avian populations and rapidly spread throughout the conterminous United States [

The first major WNV outbreak in the United States was observed in 2002, when more than 4,150 human cases and 284 deaths attributable to WNV infection were reported to the CDC from 40 states compared to only 149 cases and 19 deaths from 10 states cumulatively during the three years from 1999 to 2001 [
