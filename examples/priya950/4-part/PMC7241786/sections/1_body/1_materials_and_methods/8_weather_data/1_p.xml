<p>Spatial weather data on daily mean temperature and precipitation from 2005 to 2016 were obtained from the PRISM Climate Group (PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prism.oregonstate.edu" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://prism.oregonstate.edu</ext-link>). The PRISM daily data are available as spatial grids of 4 km resolution, which are calculated through interpolation and statistical techniques using point data from weather monitoring networks across the country combined with topographic data. These daily data were used to calculate the weekly temperature and precipitation. For our analysis, the weekly mean temperature was calculated by taking the average of the seven daily averages for that week, and the weekly precipitation was calculated as a sum of the daily precipitation for that week. Finally, the weekly temperature and precipitation for each year and week for each hexagon was calculated by using the zonal statistics as table function in ArcGIS 10.1. We also calculated average January temperature for each hexagon for each year from the daily data as a proxy for the winter temperature.
