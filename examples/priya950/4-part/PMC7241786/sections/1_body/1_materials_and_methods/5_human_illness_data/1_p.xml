<p>Records of human WNV cases in Illinois were obtained from the IDPH through a user agreement. All confirmed and probable cases of WNV reported to the IDPH by medical and public health personnel for the study area were included in this study; the state of Illinois mandates reporting of WNV to local public health departments, which then report all cases to IDPH. Probable cases are those that meet clinical criteria during the season when transmission is likely to occur and meet laboratory criteria for West Nile virus by serology (IgM capture ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction, while confirmed cases are those with confirmatory test results from the IDPH or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All the human WNV cases in Cook and DuPage counties reported from 2005 to 2016 were geocoded and aggregated by hexagons for each week and year. The data were converted into the binary form of presence or absence of a WNV case in a given hexagon and week.</p>
