<p>To assess the temporal relationship between human illness and MIR, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation between the weekly MIR of 1–6 weeks lag and human cases. We repeated this analysis on the subsets of years with high numbers of WNV cases (more than 100 human cases; 2005, 2006, 2012 and 2016) and those with low numbers of WNV cases (less than 100 cases; 2007–2009, 2010, 2011, 2013–2015) to examine if the relationship between MIR and human cases varies in high and low years. We further examined the ability of the early summer (weeks 22–27) and mid-summer (weeks 28–33) average MIR to explain and predict the seasonal annual total WNV cases by using linear regression analysis. In addition, we assessed the ability of the cumulative positive mosquito pools up to week 28 and thereafter, added to each week’s data, to find a threshold that could best explain the annual total human WNV cases. In both of these calculations, data from 2005 to 2014 were used to create a regression equation, and data from 2015 and 2016 was used to test the model.</p>
