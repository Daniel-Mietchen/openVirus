<p>The two Illinois counties of Cook and DuPage, comprising Chicago and its suburbs, were included in this study. The total area covered by these two counties is nearly 5,100 square kilometers, and the total population in 2010 was 6.1 million. These areas were selected because of the relatively high incidence of human West Nile virus illness reported from these two counties and the long-term intensive mosquito surveillance data available for this region. The temporal window included in this study was the 24-week time period from late May to late October (weeks 22 to 45), which corresponds to the timing of mosquito activity and human WNV illness, with data for the years from 2005 to 2016. The years from 2002 to 2004, during which Illinois had its first invasion from WNV, were excluded in this analysis because of the absence of mosquito testing data. Data on avian and equid surveillance were not included as these programs were not consistently applied across the time period.</p>
