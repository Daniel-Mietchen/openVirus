<p>The results of the mixed-effects regression analysis showed that temperature, precipitation, land cover, mosquito infection, and demographic characteristics are all associated with the probability of an area having a case of WNV human illness. The AIC criteria used to compare the 10 best competing models showed that a model consisting of 15 variables that included temperature, MIR, land cover, and demographic characteristics was the best model (

The final multivariable model indicated that higher temperatures two, three, and four weeks earlier and warmer average January temperature were associated with a higher probability of a hexagon being positive for human WNV case (

Among the land cover variables, the proportion of open water, grassland, and deciduous forests were negatively associated with the probability of a WNV case while the proportion of low intensity developed areas was positively associated (
