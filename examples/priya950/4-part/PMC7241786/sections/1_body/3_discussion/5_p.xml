<p>In this study, through multilevel modeling, we identified several dynamic factors that are possibly driving the fine scale spatiotemporal variation in the human WNV cases occurrence in the Chicago region. We found that the higher temperature in the previous weeks increases the probability of an area being positive for a WNV case. The association between higher temperature and WNV human illness has also been observed in other studies conducted at different spatial scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is possibly due to the dynamic effect of higher temperature on mosquito breeding and virus replication [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The unique feature of our study is that by considering the dynamic nature of weather, we allowed the temperature and precipitation to vary both temporally and spatially to capture the better role of weather in the spatiotemporal variability of human WNV cases. The precipitation of earlier weeks was not as important as the temperature of the preceding weeks but still was moderately important. The negative association of precipitation observed indicated that dry and hot weather conditions would increase the probability of an area being positive for a WNV case. Some other studies have also indicated that hot dry weather conditions are conducive for WNV transmission [
