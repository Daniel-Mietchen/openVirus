<p>The temporal models we developed using mid-summer average MIR and cumulative mosquito positive pools were both able to explain more than 90% of the variability in the annual number of human cases. This similarity of the results was not surprising, as positive mosquito pools are used to calculate the MIR. However, the cumulative positive pools up to week 31 better predicted the annual human cases compared to mid-summer average MIR for 2015 and 2016. The difference observed between the two approaches may reflect the variability of the MIR calculation depending on the mosquito pool size [

Taking the most extreme possibility, when there was only one mosquito in a pool and it tested positive, this would yield a MIR of 1000 in contrast to MIR of 20 when a pool with 50 mosquitoes was tested positive. In Ontario, Canada, the cumulative number of positive mosquito pools up to week 34 was suggested as an action threshold potential to estimate the total annual human cases [
