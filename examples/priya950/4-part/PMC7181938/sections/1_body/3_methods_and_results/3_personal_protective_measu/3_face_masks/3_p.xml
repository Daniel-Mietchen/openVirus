<p>We did not consider the use of respirators in the community. Respirators are tight-fitting masks that can protect the wearer from fine particles (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>) and should provide better protection against influenza virus exposures when properly worn because of higher filtration efficiency. However, respirators, such as N95 and P2 masks, work best when they are fit-tested, and these masks will be in limited supply during the next pandemic. These specialist devices should be reserved for use in healthcare settings or in special subpopulations such as immunocompromised persons in the community, first responders, and those performing other critical community functions, as supplies permit.
