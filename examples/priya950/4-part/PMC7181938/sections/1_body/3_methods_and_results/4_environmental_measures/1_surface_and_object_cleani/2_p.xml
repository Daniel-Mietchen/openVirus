<p>Given that influenza virus can survive on some surfaces for prolonged periods (

 </xref>), and that cleaning or disinfection procedures can effectively reduce or inactivate influenza virus from surfaces and objects in experimental studies (
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>44</italic>
 </xref>), there is a theoretical basis to believe that environmental cleaning could reduce influenza transmission. As an illustration of this proposal, a modeling study estimated that cleaning of extensively touched surfaces could reduce influenza A infection by 2% (

  <italic>45</italic>
 </xref>). However, most studies of influenza virus in the environment are based on detection of virus RNA by PCR, and few studies reported detection of viable virus.
