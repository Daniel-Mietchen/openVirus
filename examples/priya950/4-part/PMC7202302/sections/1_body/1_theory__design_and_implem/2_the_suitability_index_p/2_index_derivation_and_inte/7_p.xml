<p>Quantification of R0 (and Re) requires an estimation of the number of adult female mosquitoes per human (M). It is rarely the case that adequate estimations of M exist for regions or mosquito species of interest. Given that the mosquito population size fluctuates in and out of season, M is expected to present oscillatory behaviour. Thus, the R0 (and Re) of a mosquito‐borne virus, dependent on M, also presents seasonal oscillations. However, such oscillations are only partially driven by M, and are also determined by

 </math>'s contribution to this oscillatory behaviour stems from the four climate‐driven parameters: the life span of adult mosquitoes, the extrinsic incubation period, the daily biting rate and the probability of transmission from infected mosquito to human per bite.
