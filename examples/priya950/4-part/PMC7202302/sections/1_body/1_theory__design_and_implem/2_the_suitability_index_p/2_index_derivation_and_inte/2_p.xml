<p>The transmission potential of a pathogen can be summarized through the basic (R0) and effective (Re) reproduction numbers. The R0 of a pathogen is the number of secondary cases generated, on average, by a single infected host in a totally susceptible population. In the case of mosquito‐borne viruses, R0 can also be interpreted as the sum of the reproductive potential (transmission) of each adult female mosquito,
