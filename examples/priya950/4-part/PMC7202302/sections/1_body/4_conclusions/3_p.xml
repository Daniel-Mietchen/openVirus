<p>We believe that both MVSE and the index P are unique in the current literature. Other suitability approaches exist and have been widely used, but are generally based on complex computations, dependent on many variables from various data sources (not necessarily available), with little direct biological interpretation on the measured scale, and critically, for which no freely available (estimation) software tools exist. In contrast, index P is simply based on the R0 expression of a mosquito‚Äêborne dynamic model and two climate variables, has a direct biological interpretation, and is easily calculated and explored through MVSE, a complete and freely available software tool.</p>
