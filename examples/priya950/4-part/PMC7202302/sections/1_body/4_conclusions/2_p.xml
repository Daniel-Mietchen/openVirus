<p>In this manuscript, we have introduced in detail a mosquito‐borne viral suitability measure which we named index P. We apply and exemplify the capacities of the index P to estimate transmission potential and characterize it in space and time using real world examples. We also introduce and provide MVSE, an R‐package that implements various functionalities allowing to estimate and analyse the index P in regions for which humidity and temperature time series are available.</p>
