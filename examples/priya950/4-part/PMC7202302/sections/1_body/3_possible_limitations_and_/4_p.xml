<p>In the main results, we have focused on mosquito‐borne viruses which are typically maintained in a human–mosquito transmission cycle. This is because the expressions of R0 and index P (equations 1 and 3) are derived from a dynamic model which considers only one main host (here parameterized as a human host). This single‐host formulation has implications when applying the index P to other viruses whose epidemiology critically depends on multiple hosts—for example, WNV and YFV for which birds and primates (respectively) are necessary hosts. For these particular examples, human infections are mainly spill over events from the zoonotic cycle (e.g. for YFV see [Faria et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>]). Thus, while the single‐host formulation should be minded, a potential use of the index P is to parameterize suitability to the reservoir–host and reservoir–mosquito species, and interpret P as a proxy for risk of spill over to human populations.
