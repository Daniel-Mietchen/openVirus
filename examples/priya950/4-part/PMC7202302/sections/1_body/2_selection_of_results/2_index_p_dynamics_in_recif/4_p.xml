<p>These key differences in index P are in accordance to what is known about the transmission potential of mosquito‐borne viruses in the two cities. For instance, the stabler seasonality patterns and higher index P in Recife suggests year‐round potential for single adult mosquitoes to contribute to epidemic expansion, and can thus help explain why dengue incidence in Recife can be one order of magnitude higher than in São Paulo. Concurrently, the substantial troughs of index P estimated in São Paulo suggest very low transmission potential off‐season, which may partially explain why persistence of mosquito‐borne viral lineages between seasons is rarely observed in the city.</p>
