<p>We further identify the month of peak suitability for each region (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b). This discretization highlights a seasonal gradient in the month of maximal suitability across Brazil. In the southern regions, peak suitability is during the early summer months, and moving north along the eastern and then northern coasts shifts peak suitability further into regional autumn. Notably, no region of Brazil is seen to experience peak suitability during the core winter months (July–September, darker blue).
