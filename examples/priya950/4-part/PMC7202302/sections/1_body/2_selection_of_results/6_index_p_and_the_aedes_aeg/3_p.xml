<p>The suitability measure commonly known as the

AaS includes a myriad of variables that are known to affect entomological and viral factors but which are not included in the formulation of the index P—for instance, precipitation, vegetation levels, urbanization levels and geo‐occurrence (reports of) adult or aquatic forms of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Kraemer et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015b</xref>). The implementation of AaS is explicitly spatial, with temporal and spatial resolutions restricted by the underlying WorldClim dataset used (maximum resolution of 12 months and spatial resolution from 1 to 340
