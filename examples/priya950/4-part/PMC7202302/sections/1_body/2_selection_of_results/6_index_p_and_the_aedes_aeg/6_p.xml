<p>We next compared the correlations of both the index P and AaS with incidence patterns for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV at the city level (Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c1‐c3). The two suitability measures performed equally well for CHIKV, whereas AaS performed better for ZIKV, and index P better for DENV.
