<p>We have previously developed a mechanistic climate‐driven transmission model, which incorporates mathematical formulations of climate–trait relationships into key model parameters. This model has been successfully used to study the entomological and epidemiological determinants of the 2012 DENV1 outbreak in the island of Madeira (Portugal) (Louren¸co et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), the 2014 DENV4 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) (Faria et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2017a</xref>) and the 2015–2017 ZIKV outbreak in Feira de Santana (Brazil) (Lourenço et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In these case studies, the model was fit to notified epidemic curves using Markov chain Monte Carlo, allowing the estimation of epidemiological parameters such as R0. Following a similar rationale to previous work based on vectorial capacity measures (Brady et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Gething et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Hamlet et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2018a</xref>; Mordecai et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), we have recently shown that a mosquito‐borne viral suitability measure called the 
 <italic>index</italic> P can be derived from the R0′s expression of our modelling framework (Perez‐Guzman et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In theory, this index is a proxy for timing and scale of mosquito‐borne viral transmission potential, without the need to fit epidemic curves. In the context of Myanmar, we have recently shown that the index P is highly correlated with both city‐level mosquito infestation and dengue notifications (Perez‐Guzman et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
