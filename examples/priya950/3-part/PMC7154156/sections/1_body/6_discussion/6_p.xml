<p>The third element, monitoring of progress, is based on the feasibility of the classification of herds, and the frequency of the testing. There is a need for herd-level diagnostic tools that accurately classify the herds in a cost-efficient manner. Serological investigations will result in an overestimation of prevalence, as earlier discussed. In the Norwegian test-regime the small average herd size might cause few first-parity cows or calves to be available, consequently reducing the herd-sensitivity. The within-herd prevalence is to some degree unknown and probably variable between herds, and within groups in the herds, which further complicates the matter. In the control program, the test-result is valid for a full year. The probability of virus introduction after classification is considerable, particularly in herds that purchase animals. An updated herd-classification based on the combination of bulk milk tank testing, herd size, information on animal movements and geographical location has been shown to provide a more accurate estimate of herd status (
