<p>The first element, biosecurity, is the primary focus in the control program. The aim is to reduce risk of introduction of virus both through live animals, people and fomites. A critical point is the efficacy of the recommended protective measures. This may differ according to management system and herd structure. For example, large herds have been shown to have more visitors and thereby more indirect contacts compared to smaller herds (
