<p>All producers automatically receive free material for collection of samples. Untested herds and herds with inconclusive results are classified as positive in the program. A negative status is valid for 1 year, and the producers are automatically reminded when new testing is recommended. Purchase of animals from positive herds automatically leads to positive status.</p>
