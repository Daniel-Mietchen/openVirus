<p>The use of vaccines to reduce the impact of BRD in dairy and beef cattle is common practice worldwide, although the practice lacks convincing scientific support. The development of effective vaccine programmes has been challenging (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The short duration of immunity provided by vaccines against mucosal viral infections and the need to vaccinate immunologically immature calves in the presence of maternal antibodies have led to suboptimal effect of vaccines and challenge the cost-benefit of its use (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The effect of vaccination on herd immunity depends on the efficacy of the vaccine, but also on vaccine management such as the proportion of animals vaccinated and the timing of vaccination (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of commercially available BRD vaccines showed no significant difference in the risk of BRD in vaccinated calves, compared to controls (
