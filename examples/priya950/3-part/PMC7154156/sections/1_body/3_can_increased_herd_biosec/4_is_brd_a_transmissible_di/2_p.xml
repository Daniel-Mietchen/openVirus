<p>Variations in the potential for between-herd-transmission between bacterial and viral pathogens affects how effective herd biosecurity is at reducing risk of introduction. The effect of increased biosecurity will therefore vary depending upon which pathogens are present in the area of interest, and their relative contribution to BRD development. The effect of increased biosecurity on the risk of introduction is likely larger for virus than bacterial components of BRD.</p>
