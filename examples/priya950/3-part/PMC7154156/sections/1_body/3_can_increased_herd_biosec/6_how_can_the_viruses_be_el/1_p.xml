<p>If introduction of BRSV and BCoV to herds can be avoided, the next question is; what happens with the already infected herds? When BRSV and BCoV cause acute infections in individual animals, the viruses replicate locally in the respiratory epithelial cells and are shed in exhaled air and nasal secretions (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). BCoV also infects enterocytes and is excreted in feces (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Experimental studies have shown shedding of BRSV from day three to nine post infection (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and from day two to ten for BCoV (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Viral RNA can be detected for an extended period (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), but might not represent infective virus. Both infections give short-lived immunity (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Introduction of virus to a herd usually results in rapid spread and high within-herd prevalence. This is particularly seen during the winter season (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Depending on factors such as herd size, management and the immunity of the herd, viruses may continue to circulate due to subclinical infections in naïve animals and/or reinfections with viral shedding in seropositive animals (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>).
