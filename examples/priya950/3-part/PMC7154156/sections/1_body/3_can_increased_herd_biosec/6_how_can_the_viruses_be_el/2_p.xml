<p>Some data indicate that persistence of BRSV and BCoV in individual animals is possible. Infective BRSV has been isolated from lymph nodes 71 days post infection (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). BCoV persistence has been demonstrated in cell culture (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Long-term PCR positivity in calves has been shown in one experimental study, but transmission potential was not confirmed by virus isolation/sentinel trials nor was sequencing of virus done to exclude new infection (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). The epidemiological role of such persistence in individual animals is somewhat unclear, but transmission of reactivated virus to susceptible animals has never been shown.
