<p>A recent study from Belgium identified both BRD in general, and especially BRSV infection, as main adult cattle diseases where biosecurity measures should be prioritized (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Toftaker et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) showed that the odds of being positive for one virus were approximately five times larger if a herd was positive for the other virus, indicating some common risk factors for BRSV and BCoV. Ohlson et al. (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) found a clear association between higher herd biosecurity levels and lower prevalence of herd infection. Implementation of external herd biosecurity routines, such as control sluices, and measures for safe trade are likely to reduce transmission between herds. It would reduce the risk of introduction to the herd where it is implemented, but also the risk of further spread from that herd.
