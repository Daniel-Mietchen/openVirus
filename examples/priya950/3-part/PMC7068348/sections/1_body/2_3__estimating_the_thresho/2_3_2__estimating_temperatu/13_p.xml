<p>According to the results of the nationwide model, a single threshold effect F
 <sub>1</sub> was statistically significant at about the 5% level (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.06), while the tests for a double F
 <sub>2</sub> and a triple threshold F
 <sub>3</sub> were not significant. This indicated that a single temperature threshold exists at the nationwide level. Based on the results of the Southern model, a single threshold F
 <sub>1</sub> was statistically significant at the 1% level and a double threshold F
 <sub>2</sub> was also statistically significant at the 1% level, while the test result of triple thresholds F
 <sub>3</sub> was not significant. We concluded that there are two temperature thresholds in the southern region of Taiwan. The estimates of the temperature thresholds are reported in
