 <italic>Dengue case surveillance data:</italic> In Taiwan, dengue fever is classified as a notifiable infectious disease and suspected cases must be reported to a clinic for diagnosis within 24 hours. Probable cases are defined as patients with body temperature above 38 Â°C and with least two of the following dengue-related clinical symptoms: rash, retro-orbital pain, leukopenia, myalgia, arthralgia, and hemorrhagic manifestations. In Taiwan, the dengue case surveillance system includes active surveillance (e.g., fever infrared thermal screening at airports) and passive surveillance (e.g., hospital-based reporting systems) for the comprehensive and effective surveillance of dengue infection. Epidemiological surveys of confirmed cases are conducted by local primary health centers. Suspected cases are confirmed by detecting dengue virus and differentiating virus serotypes using laboratory diagnosis. Nucleic acid identification of the dengue virus is identified by reverse-transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCM) (one-step real-time RT-PCR), serological testing on single or paired serum samples by dengue-specific envelope and membrane specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (with the exclusion of Japanese encephalitis virus infection), or virus isolation [
