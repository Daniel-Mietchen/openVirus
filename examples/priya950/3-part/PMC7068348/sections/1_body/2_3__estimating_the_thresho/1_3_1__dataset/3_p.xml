 <italic>Entomological surveillance data</italic>: Since the 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> indices are considered one of the most important measurements for the monitoring of dengue vector populations [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we used the Breteau index (BI), which is the number of containers positive for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae and pupae per 100 houses, as the dependent variable in our model. Surveillance of dengue-fever-carrying mosquito populations has been set up since the dengue outbreak in the southern counties of Taiwan in 1988. For all counties and cities, vector surveillance activities including mosquito species distinction, mosquito habitat recognition, and vector sampling are conducted by trained staff following the guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Each community is considered a surveying unit (e.g., one unit in Kaohsiung County including 50â€“100 households was randomly selected for inspection [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). Based on the household density and the average number of households positive for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (from historical entomological data), the risk level of each surveying unit is determined. Furthermore, larval, pupae, and adult vector surveys for monitoring vector density, distribution, and breeding habitats are conducted for both indoor and outdoor areas. Depending on whether the surveying unit is classified as a high-, medium-, or low-risk area, the according inspection frequency will be weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, respectively. The relevant surveillance data were retrieved from Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System, Centers for Disease Control [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As the inspection date and time varied across cities and townships in Taiwan, the data extracted included a huge combination of daily average BI values. We reorganized the county-level BI dataset and converted daily data into weekly data to ensure the consistency of start-day and end-day of each week in the dengue surveillance data.
