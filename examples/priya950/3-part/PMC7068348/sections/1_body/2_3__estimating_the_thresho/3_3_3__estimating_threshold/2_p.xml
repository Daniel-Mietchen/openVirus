<p>The LR test performs a test of the null hypothesis that the parameter vector of a statistical model satisfies some smooth constraints. To conduct the test, both the unrestricted and the restricted models must be fit using the maximum likelihood. Let L
 <sub>0</sub> and L
 <sub>1</sub> be the log-likelihood values associated with the full (NB) and constrained (Poisson) models, respectively. The test statistic of the likelihood ratio test is LR = −2(L
 <sub>1</sub> -L
 <sub>0</sub>). If the constrained model is true, LR is approximately χ
 <sup>2</sup> distributed with

 <italic>d
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> and

  <sub>1</sub>
