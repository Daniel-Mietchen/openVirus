<p>After estimation of the temperature thresholds of the BI, this study went one step further to examine the threshold effects of weather factors on the dengue vector index. In this stage, count data regression models were employed because the dependent variable (
 <italic>BI
  <sub>it</sub>)
 </italic> was a non-negative integer random variable. Most previous studies have applied Poisson regression models to estimate the relationship between ecological factors and dengue. However, the Poisson model has a strong restriction in that the variance and mean are equal, an assumption which is often violated in real datasets. When the conditional variance exceeds the conditional mean, the count data are over-dispersed. As a consequence, hypotheses on the Poisson regression parameters may be rejected more often than they should be [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], since the estimation also includes underestimated standard errors of parameter estimates. To resolve this issue, we first described dengue cases by the corresponding BI, so the means of dengue cases within each level of BI were lower than the variances within each level. In other words, the conditional means were lower than the conditional variances. We then fit two regression models specifically developed for count outcomes, Poisson and negative binomial (NB), and then compared these two models using the likelihood ratio (LR) test.
