<p>It is widely recognized that there exists a positive correlation between the increase of vector indices and the increasing occurrence of dengue epidemics [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we not only obtained consistent findings in quantifying the relationship between entomological index (BI) and dengue incidence, but also estimated the non-linear effects of climate factors on an entomological index (BI) under different threshold regimes of temperature.
