<p>In this study, we found one temperature threshold (27.21 °C) at the nationwide level and two temperature thresholds (27.27 °C and 30.17 °C) in the southern region of Taiwan. Our estimation result is consistent with previous findings regarding the ideal climate conditions for mosquito growth dynamics. Specifically, female mosquitoes will survive better than the male mosquitoes when the temperature rises to 25 °C [

 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also examined the non-linear effect of temperature on dengue incidence and identified a single temperature at 28 °C. All the temperature thresholds found in this study also fell within the range of optimal temperature for the mosquito egg to survive (22–34°C) [
