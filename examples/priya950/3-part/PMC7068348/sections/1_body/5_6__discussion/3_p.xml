<p>In addition to estimating the threshold effect of temperature on a dengue vector index (BI), we also investigated the relationship between BI and dengue incidence. For every additional BI increase with 4 weeks lagged time, the number of confirmed dengue cases was found to increase correspondingly, with a roughly equivalent degree of the effects at the national level and the southern regional level. The coefficient estimates of BI were positive and significant at both national and southern regional levels. Therefore, our findings were consistent with previous studies and can provide evidence to support using this vector index to predict the risk of dengue in practice [
