<p>The projections for the temperature change associated with the four RCP scenarios are shown in the first row of 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-01392-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. Projected temperatures are equal to these projected temperature changes plus the weekly average temperature in 2012–2019. Depending on whether the projected average temperature exceeded the threshold values (27.21 °C for the nationwide and 27.27 °C and 30.17 °C for the southern region) or not, we calculated the potential effects of the changes in temperature on the expected value of BI by multiplying the projected changes in temperature with the corresponding estimated marginal effects of temperature on BI. The percentage changes of BI were also computed by multiplying the change in expected value of BI by 100 and then dividing by the average BI.
