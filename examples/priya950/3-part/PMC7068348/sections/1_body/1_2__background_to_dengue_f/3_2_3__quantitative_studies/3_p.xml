<p>Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] used a generalized additive model (GAM) which allowed Poisson regression to be fitted as a sum of a nonparametric smooth function of predictor variables to estimate the linear relationship between precipitation and dengue fever in Taiwan during the 1994â€“2008 period. They found that time-lagged effects following precipitation up to 350 mm were significantly correlated with increased risk of dengue.
