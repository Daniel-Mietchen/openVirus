 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] studied how meteorological variables, Breteau index, and reported cases of dengue fever were related in Taiwan from January 2000 to February 2006. They tried to investigate how climate conditions influence mosquito density level at the 1st stage, and then estimated the relationship between dengue fever cases and density level in the 2nd stage. They found that climate conditions have significant impacts on dengue. For instance, when the temperature increased by 1%, the number of dengue patients in Kaohsiung and Pingtung increased by 5.75 and 11.83%, respectively.
