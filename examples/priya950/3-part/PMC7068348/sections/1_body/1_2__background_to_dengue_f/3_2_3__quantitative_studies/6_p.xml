<p>Some recent studies have also included spatial component in modeling climate-related spread of dengue. For example, Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] proposed a spatiotemporal dengue fever prediction approach based on Bayesian maximum entropy analysis to estimate the climatic effects on dengue distribution in southern Taiwan. Applying a space–time Poisson process based on the surveillance data obtained for the 2002–2006 period, they found significant positive correlations between rainfall, minimum temperature, and dengue incidence. The predicted spatiotemporal dengue fever distribution was also very close to the actual distribution of dengue cases reported for the year 2007.
