<p>Xiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] examined the temperature–dengue relationship in Guangzhou, China during the 2005–2014 period by using a piecewise linear spline function. The study found that the optimal temperature for transmission of dengue fever is 21.6–32.9 °C. Dengue cases started to increase when the temperature exceeded 21.6 °C, and then dropped dramatically when the temperature exceeded 32.9 °C. They also found that relative humidity was negatively correlated with dengue transmission when the daily relative humidity exceeded 79%.
