<p>Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] conducted a meta-analysis of 33 qualified articles to access the dengue risk associated with temperature change at a global level. Multiple linear regression and multivariate Poisson models were used in the study. Their results indicated that there is a positive correlation between the temperature and dengue. They concluded that the dengue incidence will increase by 35% per 1 °C increase while the average temperature is between 23.2 and 27.7 °C.
