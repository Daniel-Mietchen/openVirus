<p>In general, different analytical approaches are applied depending on the distributional assumptions (e.g., Poisson, normal) and the spatial and/or temporal dynamics of the response. While many previous studies have assumed that the relationship between climate conditions and dengue transmission is linear in their models, a few studies, including Wu et al. [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], concluded that the relationship between climate and dengue should be non-linear. Therefore, we also took non-linear relationships between climate and dengue into account when estimating the potential threshold effects of climate factors on dengue vector index. Our findings can provide important policy implications for the implementation of public health measures and risk prediction to prevent and control dengue fever in the future [
