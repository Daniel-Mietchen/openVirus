<p>Climate change is likely to expand the geographical distribution of several vector-borne human infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The risk of dengue transmission is increased by warming climates, as the growth and development of mosquitoes are significantly influenced by temperature and humidity [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Focks et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found that mosquito egg survival rate varied significantly when temperature is within the range of 22 to 34 °C. In another study conducted by Rowley and Graham [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females were found to be sustainably able to fly between 15 and 32 °C. The optimal flight temperature, in terms of duration and distance flown, was found to be 21 °C, while the maximum flight speed (34.1 m/min) was recorded at 32 °C and 50% humidity. In addition to general activity and host-seeking behavior, favorable conditions for mosquitoes to initiate probing and blood-feeding have also been studied based on the difference between average environment temperature and host temperature (37 °C). Bishop and Gilchrist [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported a relatively high percentage of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females imbibing blood at 42 °C, when the difference between average temperature of the environment and the blood meal was 14 °C (71%), than when the temperature of the blood and the environment were the same. The lower temperature limit at which 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been found to cease biting is 15 °C and temperature at which they are the most active is 28 °C [
