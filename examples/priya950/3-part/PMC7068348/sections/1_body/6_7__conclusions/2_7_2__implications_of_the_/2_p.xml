<p>In Taiwan, the major prevention strategies for the control of dengue fever are devised to eliminate vector (mosquito) breeding sources and lower vector density. The identification of specific temperature thresholds could be utilized to effectively support these dengue prevention measures. In particular, identification of temperature thresholds is important to construct a reliable alert system not only for disease prevention personnel but also for every resident. When average temperature is close to the threshold value, household and surrounding environment sanitation should be strengthened to eliminate all potential vector breeding sources. When temperature continues to increase and exceeds the threshold value, integrated strategies and practices for dengue prevention and control (e.g., environmental approaches to eliminate container habitats; chemical, biological, and genetic approaches; and personal actions regarding dengue prevention interventions) are urgently needed, especially in high-risk communities/regions like the southern region of Taiwan.</p>
