<p>According to the estimation results, we concluded that dengue fever infection rates in regions with warmer temperatures will be much more sensitive to climate change. Compared with the entire nation, such a difference in regional climate sensitivity was reflected in the double thresholds of temperature found in the southern region. The effects of other climatic factors, including precipitation and relative humidity, on BI also became stronger when the temperature exceeded these thresholds. This further emphasizes the importance of finding potential temperature thresholds in the implementation of public health measures and risk prediction to prevent and control dengue fever.</p>
