<p>Although the interactions between climate factors, dengue vector indices, and dengue cases have been extensively studied, the potential threshold effects of climate factors on dengue vector indices had not previously been estimated in Taiwan. Our empirical results indicated that the effects of temperature on dengue vector index (BI) will differ depending on the temperature levels. At the national level, when the weekly average temperature was less than 27.21 °C, an increase of 1 °C in temperature caused a 0.09 unit increase in the expected value of BI. The effect became stronger when the temperature exceeded 27.21 °C, with the expected value of BI increasing by 0.26 units when the temperature increased by 1 °C. Additionally, the effects of temperature on dengue vector index in the southern region of Taiwan were found to be stronger than those at the national level. As the temperature increased by 1 °C, the expected value of BI increased by 0.29, 0.63, and 1.49 units when the average temperature was less than 27.27 °C, between 27.27 and 30.17 °C, and higher than 30.17 °C, respectively.</p>
