<p>The six shortlisted epitopes out of seven were docked with the alleles found common for them for MHCI and MHCII molecules. The alleles used for the docking of the MHCI molecules were HLA-A*35:01 and HLA-DRB0101 for MHCII molecules. One peptide ‘IKYAVSKKG’ was not docked due to the unavailability of the tertiary structure of HLA-DRB0806. All the epitopes were found to have a very good interaction with their respective alleles and exhibit high binding energies (
