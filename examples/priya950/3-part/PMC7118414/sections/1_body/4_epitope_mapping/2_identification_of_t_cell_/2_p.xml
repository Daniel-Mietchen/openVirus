<p>The potential epitopes for MHC-II in the E1 protein of CHIKV were initially predicted in IEDB peptide binding to MHC-II molecules. A total of 45 potential epitopes for HLA-DRB1 were further investigated in PREDIVAC online tool. On the basis of high predivac score and IEDB analysis, four peptides were predicted to be the potential epitopes (VHSMTNAVT, WLKERGASL, IKYAVSKKG and YKTLVNRPG) and the details of scores and associated alleles are summarised in Supplementary Table S5.</p>
