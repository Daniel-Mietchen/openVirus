<p>The evidence of CHIKV occurrence in different geographical regions was reported as early as in the 1770s that was suggested by Carey in 1971 [

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The origin of the ECSA genotype was reported to be around 114 years ago (1903). Initially, this genotype was confined to the central, East and South African regions. Later on, the CHIKV diverged from these initial strains and were transmitted to other geographical regions that constituted the West African and Asian genotypes. The West African genotype originated from the Central African region around 61 years ago (1956). Whereas, the Asian strains descended 68 years ago (1949). The substitution rate was found to be 2.78 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> for the partial E1 gene compatible with other studies reporting 2.3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 4.6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> for the complete E1 gene [
