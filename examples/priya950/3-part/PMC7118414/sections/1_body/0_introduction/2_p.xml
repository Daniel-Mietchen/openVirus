<p>CHIKV has now been recognised as a global pathogen due to its presence in a wide geographical range [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increased global travel from CHIKV endemic regions has been the major cause of dispersal of the virus to non-endemic regions of the Americas and Europe. CHIKV has succeeded to maintain its mosquito–human life cycle causing outbreaks of autochthonous cases in many geographical regions including the American continents. The virus has caused some autochthonous transmissions in a few parts of the USA during 2014–15 [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As the situation stands today, there is no local transmission of CHIKV in the USA currently. The virus has adapted itself to both 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> providing itself an alternate vector and introduction of the disease to previously unexposed populations [

The re-emergence of this virus is probably due to mutational changes, increased efficiency of vector transmission, immunologically naive populations, enhanced global dissemination, inadequate public health infrastructure, unforeseen environmental and social factors [
