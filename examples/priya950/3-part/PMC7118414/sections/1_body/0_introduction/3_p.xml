<p>Characterisation of the circulating strains is envisaged to be useful for the control and prevention of the infection. We undertook global distribution and evolutionary analysis of CHIKV using phylogenetic, networking and Bayesian methods. This also included mutational analysis of the E1 gene, its variable sites and epitope mapping. We also desired to assess if there is a set pattern of the emergence of Chikungunya fever in different geographical regions. This information can be useful for the prevention and control of CHIKV outbreaks globally. Transmission and evolutionary analysis of the virus will help elucidate hostâ€“pathogen dynamics during the course of CHIKV infections in humans.</p>
