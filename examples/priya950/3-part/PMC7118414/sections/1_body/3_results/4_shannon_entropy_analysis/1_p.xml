<p>The Shannon entropy analysis of the sequences showed variable sites among the unique global sequences (Supplementary Fig. S3). The entropy value above the threshold of 0.2 is indicative of variations at these sites. A total of 12 variable sites were selected at the amino acid positions 211, 225, 226, 269, 276, 284, 304, 321, 343, 344, 397 and 404 with entropy values higher than 0.2. The positions numbers 211, 226, 269 and 284 had high entropy values (â‰¥0.8).</p>
