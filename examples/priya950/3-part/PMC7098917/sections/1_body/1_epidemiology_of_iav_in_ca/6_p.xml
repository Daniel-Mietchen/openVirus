<p>In Italy, 2009, a pandemic H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] outbreak occurred in a colony of 90 caged stray cats (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Half of the animal colony had signs of severe acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Serum samples and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 38 of the 65 surviving cats, and more than half (55%) of the tested cats were seropositive for the presence of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies and two swabs were positive for the presence of A(H1N1)pdm09 by PCR, highlighting cat-to-cat transmission of the virus (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In the latter cases, the most likely source of infection was found to be people in the household. Indeed, as owners of infected cats also had a history of severe respiratory disease, with prior infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus confirmed (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). More, seroprevalence of antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 was three times more prevalent in pet cats than free-roaming cats (
