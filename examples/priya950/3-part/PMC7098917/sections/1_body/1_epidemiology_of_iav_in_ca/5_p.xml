<p>HPAIV H5N1 subtype initially originated in China in 1996 and it has spread since then into many areas in the world, causing infections in birds of many species (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Dogs and cats have been infected by direct contact with affected birds, especially by eating raw poultry (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Of particular concern, severe symptoms, not limited to respiratory organs but also hepatic and gastrointestinal were reported, and in many cases systemic infection was evidenced. Subclinical infection of cats with H5N1 was also reported after contact with infected birds or their excrement (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), thus indicating that cats may serve as a potential asymptomatic H5N1 reservoir. Nevertheless, low prevalence of H5N1 antibodies was reported in cats sera, even in areas in which birds infected with HPAIV H5N1 had been documented (
