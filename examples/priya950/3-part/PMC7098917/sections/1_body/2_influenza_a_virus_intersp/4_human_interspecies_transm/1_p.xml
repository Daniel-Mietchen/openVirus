<p>To date, serological evidence suggest that cats and dogs could be infected worldwide with human seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 strains probably by direct transmission from their owners (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Several points support this hypothesis: (i) in most cases reported so far, animal caretakers or owners had themselves history of flu-like illness and for some of them confirmed by PCR; (ii) susceptibility of cats and dogs correlated well with influenza prevalence in the human population and even followed a seasonality pattern as in humans, and (iii) virus isolation and sequence analysis of all eight genes of the canine isolates showed high nucleotide similarity thus suggesting that human viruses could therefore jump into dogs and cats, without prior adaptation. However, details about molecular determinants potentially related to transmission have not been unraveled so far.
