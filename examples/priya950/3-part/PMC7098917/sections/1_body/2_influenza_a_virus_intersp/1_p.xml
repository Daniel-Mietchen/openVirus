<p>Successful interspecies transmission of IAV is dependent on both host and virus genetic factors, and subsequent spread within the new host population requires a period of adaptation of the virus to the new host (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Critical host and viral determinants involved in virus specificity and further mechanisms in the adaptation to cats and dogs are described.
