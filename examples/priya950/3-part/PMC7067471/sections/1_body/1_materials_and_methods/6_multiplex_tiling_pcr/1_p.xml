<p>The extracted RNAs that were positive for DENV-1 and ZIKV were submitted to whole-genome amplification using a tiling, multiplex PCR approach that has been previously developed [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Briefly, the sample was converted to cDNA using random hexamers (Invitrogen; Carlsbad CA, USA) and ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England BioLabs; Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was then amplified with a multiplex PCR assay designed from Primal Scheme using as input the “ZikaAsian” scheme for ZIKV (

 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. An 80% consensus generated from a reference alignment of DENV-1 sequences was used as input to Primal Scheme. PCR was performed using the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). PCR products were cleaned-up using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and quantified using fluorimetry with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay on the Qubit 3.0 instrument (Life Technologies).
