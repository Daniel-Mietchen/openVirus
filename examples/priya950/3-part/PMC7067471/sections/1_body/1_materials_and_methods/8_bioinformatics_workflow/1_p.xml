<p>Raw files were basecalled using Guppy software version 2.2.7 GPU basecaller (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), then demultiplexed and trimmed by Porechop version 0.2.4 (

Demultiplexed fastQ files were then inputted in CLC Genomics Workbench 6 (CLC Bio, Qiagen). First, the reads were trimmed to remove short (below 50) and low-quality reads (default parameter). Using a DENV-1 genome sampled in Brazil as reference (GenBank ID KP188543), reads were assembled using the following parameters: mismatch cost = 1, indels cost = 2, length fraction that must match reference = 0.8 and similarity fraction = 0.8. A total of 83.8% of reads were correctly mapped to the DENV-1 reference genome, and a consensus sequence of 8413 nucleotides was generated.
