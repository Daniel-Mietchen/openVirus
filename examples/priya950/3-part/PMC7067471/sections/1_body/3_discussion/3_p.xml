<p>The DENV-1 genotype V found in the infected 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was also detected in previous Brazilian studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The strain from the study setting is closely related to viruses that have circulated previously in large urban centers of three different regions in Brazil (Southeast, Northeast, and Midwest), showing the capacity of the virus dispersion from urban to rural areas. In addition, it demonstrates that the strain found in the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was not new in Brazil, being involved previously in epidemics related to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, suggesting the potential to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in transmitting viruses already circulating in the Brazilian population.
