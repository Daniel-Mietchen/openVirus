<p>The DENV-1 found in the study had a different origin from a strain identified in 2000 in Espírito Santo state, evidencing multiple introductions of this virus into the state. The clade that contains the strain identified in the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> clustered with a virus from Réunion, an island from the Indian Ocean, while the DENV-1 virus circulating in 2000 clustered with viruses from other South American countries. Besides these two clades, the results suggest another clade of DENV-1 in Brazil, closely related to strains from Caribbean countries. It corroborates a most recent study on the phylogenetic evaluation of DENV-1 in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which suggests at least three clades of this virus in the Brazilian territory.
