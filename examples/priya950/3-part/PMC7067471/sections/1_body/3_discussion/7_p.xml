<p>This study presents some limitations: it was not possible to identify if the mosquitoes positive for DENV and ZIKV were collected in intradomicile, peridomicile, or in the cocoa and rubber tree plantation, and no inference could be made on it. The insect sampling, restricted to daytime, excluded mosquitoes with nighttime behavior that could be competent vectors for arboviruses, such as 
 <italic>Culex</italic>. In addition, it was not possible to evaluate the origin of the infection of the mosquitoes or the similarity of the virus found in the study with those from the confirmed human infections. The study presents two concomitant events—humans and mosquitoes infected—that might be connected, but it cannot affirm with total certainly the involvement of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in the transmission. Therefore, additional investigations involving the human hosts affected by this outbreak need to be conducted. Nevertheless, the study findings are relevant to the adoption of actions for prevention and control. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> must be considered in areas with arbovirus risk transmission and should be included in public health programs, especially with a focus on epidemiological and entomological surveillance, inclusive in rural areas.
