    "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that causes hallmark debilitating polyarthralgia, fever, and rash in patients. T cell-mediated immunity, especially CD4+ T cells, are known to participate in the pathogenic role of CHIKV immunopathology. The other T cell subsets, notably CD8+, NKT, and gamma-delta (γδ) T cells, can also contribute to protective immunity, but their effect is not actuated during the natural course of infection. This review serves to consolidate and discuss the multifaceted roles of these T cell subsets during acute and chronic phases of CHIKV infection, and highlight gaps in the current literature. Importantly, the unique characteristics of skin-resident memory T cells are outlined to propose novel prophylactic strategies that utilize their properties to provide adequate, lasting protection."
