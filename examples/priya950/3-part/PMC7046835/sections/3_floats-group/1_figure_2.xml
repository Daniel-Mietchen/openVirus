  <p>Summary of the roles each T cell subset play during acute CHIKV infection. (1) When CHIKV-infected mosquitoes transmit the virus to its human host (or experimental infection in mice), CHIKV infects the surrounding cells and creates pro-inflammatory milleu in the joints. (2) This serves to attract monocytes and NKT cells to the joints, which exacerbates the inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby potentiating the chemoattraction of other immune cells to the infection site. (3) The APCs that engulfs CHIKV antigens travel to lymphoid organs, present CHIKV epitopes to CD4 and CD8 T cells and activate them. Activated CD4 T cells then trigger CHIKV-specific B cells to develop antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Treg cells may also interact with APCs that ultimately lead to anergy in CHIKV-specific CD4 T cells. (4) Proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cells migrate to the swollen joints and contribute to the inflammation through IFN-Î³ secretion. Although not directly demonstrated, CHIKV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells may recognize infected endothelial cells at the site of infection, leading to disruption of the barrier and worsens joint swelling.</p>
