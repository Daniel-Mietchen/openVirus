<p>Among the heterogeneous CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population, regulatory T cells (Tregs) can also contribute to the protection against CHIKV. Tregs are able to interact with APCs in the peripheral lymph nodes and bring about downregulation of costimulatory molecules in the latter (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Thus, when the APCs present CHIKV epitopes to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, they become anergic instead and do not proliferate or migrate to the infected joints to cause joint swelling. However, the viral load in virus-infected mice was not affected by Tregs (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Patients with acute and chronic CHIKV infections were shown to have lower levels of Treg, while recovered patients display Treg levels that are comparable to healthy controls (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). This finding concurs with the data from murine models, suggesting that Tregs prevent hyperactivation of pathogenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby controlling joint pathology.
