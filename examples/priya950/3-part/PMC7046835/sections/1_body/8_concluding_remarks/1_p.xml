<p>The re-emergence of CHIKV underscores the need for effective vaccine strategies to prevent further global CHIKV dissemination. In immunological na√Øve individuals, CHIKV infection puts them at risk of having their immune system manipulated toward CHIKV pathology and virus persistence. An optimal vaccine against CHIKV invokes not only humoral response, but more importantly, localized CHIKV-specific, cell-mediated immunity at the skin, and yet avoids the induction of CHIKV-mediated immunopathology that is associated with pathogenic CD4 T cells. By inducing anti-CHIKV TRMs at the skin before infection strikes, they can rapidly clear the virus before it disseminates and triggers the associated immunopathology. Besides, anti-CHIKV TRMs have the potential to react to more conserved CHIKV epitopes (which may also be conserved in closely related alphaviruses) and the immunity buildup increases with each natural infection, providing a robust, potent immunity against CHIKV, and possibly other alphaviruses.</p>
