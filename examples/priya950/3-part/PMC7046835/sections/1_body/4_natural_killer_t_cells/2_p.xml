<p>In mice, levels of IFN-γ-expressing NKT cell remain unchanged in CHIKV-infected mice, as compared to healthy controls (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). However, these cells accumulate in the spleens of mice that are co-infected with CHIKV and malaria parasites (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). This event is due to the increased expression of chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the spleens, which attract and retain lymphocytes that express cognate chemokine receptors. Since mouse and human NKT cells express CXCR3 (which recognizes CXCL9 and CXCL10), these cells are likely to be trapped in the spleen, preventing them from migrating to the peripheral joints (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Although this strategy of lymphocyte sequestration leads to decreased CHIKV immunopathology (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), it is not clear how much does NKT cells contribute to this amelioration.
