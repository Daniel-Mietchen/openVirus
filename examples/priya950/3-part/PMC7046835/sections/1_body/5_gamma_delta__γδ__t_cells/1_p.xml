<p>Gamma-delta T cells are reported to play a protective role against CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). These cells do not affect CHIKV virus replication in the joints. Instead, their absence is associated with increased joint swelling and tissue damage in the infected mice. The absence of γδ T cells were also linked to increased monocyte infiltration to the joints and increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators CCL2, CXCL9, and IFN-γ (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Hence, the resulting pro-inflammatory milleu leads to more inflammatory cell infiltration and result in tissue damage that is observed during CHIKV infection. However, there is no information on the role of γδ T cells in CHIKV patients. Thus, the extent of protection these cells offer in human settings remains unclear.
