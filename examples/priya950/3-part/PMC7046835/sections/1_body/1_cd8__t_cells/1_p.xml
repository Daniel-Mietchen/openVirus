<p>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have contrasting effects on alphavirus infection. In humans, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells express CD69, CD107a, granzyme B, and perforin during acute CHIKV infection (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), markers associated with T cell activation. Studies have identified putative CD8 epitopes within the CHIKV genome in mice and humans (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Among these antigenic determinants, the non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) contain a multitude of epitopes that can induce a robust immunological response. Only HLA-A24, B7, and B15 were predicted to express CD8 epitopes hidden within the capsid, E1 and E2 proteins (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Despite the apparent abundance, only three HLA-A
 <sup>*</sup>0201 CD8 epitopes in CHIKV 6K protein were experimentally validated to trigger CD8 T cell response (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The paucity of epitope validation highlights the inaccuracy of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> modeling to predict epitope immunogenicity. Nevertheless, predicted epitopes require further testing to validate the sequences that are presented by different MHCs. Importantly, it remains unclear whether the recognition of CHIKV epitopes by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells has a role to play in eliminating virus-infected cells. This knowledge gap is worth investigating and will open up avenues to employ them as mediators in future CHIKV vaccines.
