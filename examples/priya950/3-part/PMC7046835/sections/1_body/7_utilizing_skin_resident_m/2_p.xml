<p>Establishment of TRMs in the skin begins when clonally expanded T cells migrate from lymphoid organs to the skin. Some of these skin-homing T cells remain in place and develop into skin TRMs (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Vaccination leads to the widespread establishment of TRMs throughout the body, not only at the vaccination site (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Thus, it is highly plausible that one can generate CHIKV-specific skin TRMs through vaccination at the skin. Interestingly, effector T cells were reported to migrate to all parts of the skin instead of accumulating only at the site of the infection or vaccination (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This phenomenon occurs due to the presence of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and other chemokines that are expressed by post-capillary venules at low levels throughout the skin (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Hence, the resulting skin TRMs generated can protect against CHIKV infection from anywhere, regardless of where the virus-infected mosquitoes choose to probe and release the virus into the host.
