<p>The notion of inducing CHIKV-specific memory T cells as mediators of protection is attractive as T cell epitopes are generally better conserved than B cell antigens, mitigating the risk of immune escape through antigenic variations (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Of the memory T cells, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) are a unique subset of cells that is distinct from conventional memory T cells, in that the former dwell at the peripheral organs (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The latter either reside in the lymphoid organs (central memory T cells) or recirculate in the body (effector memory T cells) (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Thus, TRMs could function as adaptive immune cells that act as first-line responders at the site of infection (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Putative CHIKV-specific skin TRMs can be well-positioned to react to CHIKV-infected cells at the feeding site by virus-infected mosquitos during a blood meal.
