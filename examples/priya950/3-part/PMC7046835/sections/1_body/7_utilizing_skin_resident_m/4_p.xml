<p>The geographical range of mosquitoes that transmit the alphaviruses is projected to increase in the future due to climate change (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Moreover, CHIKV shares some homology with other alphaviruses with the potential to cause unprecedented outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). This shift may ultimately lead to the spread of CHIKV and other alphaviruses and cause future epidemics. However, as depicted by Roundy et al. (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) and Powers et al. (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), the close homology between CHIKV and other viruses within the family of alphaviruses suggest that they may share conserved epitopes that can induce T cell responses. Hence, some of the CHIKV-specific memory T cells can have the potential to target other alphaviruses and eliminate them. This knowledge may lead to the development of pan-alphavirus vaccines that are effective in preventing sudden alphavirus outbreaks, such as the spike in deaths from Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis Virus (EEEV) in the United States in 2019, which is becoming endemic in the United States (
