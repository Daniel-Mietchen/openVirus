<p id="par0035">The study population included patients who were diagnosed with febrile seizure and included in the HIRA database from 2008 to 2016. Our initial request for data did not include children aged ≥6 years, according to the diagnostic criteria of febrile seizures. The diagnoses were coded using the 5th, 6th and 7th Korean Classifications of Diseases (KCD-5 from 2008 to 2010; KCD-6 from 2011 to 2015; and KCD-7 in 2016). KCD-5, KCD-6, and KCD-7 are classification systems modified from the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). We extracted medical records coded with a main or sub-diagnosis of febrile seizure (KCD-5, KCD-6, and KCD-7 code R560). A total of 666,136 records were selected from 2008 to 2016. Medical records in the HIRA database are classified by ages of &lt;1 month, 1 month to 1 year, and ≥1 year. We excluded records with ages of &lt;1 month according to the definition of febrile seizure

Finally, a total of 558,130 medical records with a diagnosis of febrile seizure were selected for this study.
