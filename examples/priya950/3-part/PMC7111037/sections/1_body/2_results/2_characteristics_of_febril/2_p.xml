<p id="par0055">A total of 558,130 records with a diagnosis of febrile seizures were included in the HIRA database from 2009 to 2016. These records corresponded to physician billing data associated with hospital visits; accordingly, a single patient could have multiple records. We did not exclude these records because multiple febrile seizure events could occur in a single patient. The records included 315,774 (56.6%) male children and 242,356 (43.4%) female children with a ratio of 1.30: 1, indicating a male predominance. The mean age of the patients was 2.31 ± 1.31 years. The highest number of cases was recorded among patients aged 1 year (210,403, 37.7%), followed by 137,093 (24.5%) among those aged 2 years. Patients older than 2 years exhibited a gradually decreasing trend beginning at 3 years of age, and the lowest frequency was observed at 5 years (25,754, 4.6%) (
