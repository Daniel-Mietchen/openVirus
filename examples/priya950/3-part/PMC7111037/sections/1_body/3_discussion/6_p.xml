<p id="par0105">Our study had some limitations. First, the HIRA dataset lacked clinical information about febrile seizures. Therefore, we could not assess these events using detailed criteria (e.g., simple febrile seizure, complex febrile seizure and febrile status epilepticus). Second, the diagnoses of febrile seizure and viral infection were based on the codes in medical records, due to a limitation of the HIRA database. In reality, however, discrepancies between diagnostic codes and actual disease might occur in patients with febrile seizure. Third, in Korea, physicians commonly apply viral diagnostic methods such as PCR of stool samples and nasal swabs to hospitalized patients. In Korea, however, influenza virus is prevalent in winter, and a rapid enzyme immunoassay-based influenza diagnostic test was used frequently in local clinics and emergency rooms. Therefore, the high number of influenza virus infections may be due to diagnostic bias. However, our study provides a reliable assessment of the seasonal distribution of febrile seizures and the relationship of febrile seizure with viral infection at the national level, as the analysis was based on a database that covered almost the entire South Korean population.</p>
