<p id="par0085">Our study describes the monthly and seasonal distributions of febrile seizures and the relationship of this disorder with associated respiratory and gastrointestinal viral infections in South Korea, based on an analysis of HIRA data. Many studies have investigated the seasonal distribution of febrile seizure. Most studies reported frequent febrile seizures in winter, but differed with respect to events in summer. According to a study conducted in Japan, febrile seizure was predominant during both the winter (from November to January) and summer (from June to August). This result was attributed to the prevalence of respiratory virus infection in winter and gastrointestinal virus infection in summer

In a study of febrile seizure distribution and associated viral infection in in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the distributions of febrile seizure from spring to winter were similar, and no statistically significant association with virus infection was observed
