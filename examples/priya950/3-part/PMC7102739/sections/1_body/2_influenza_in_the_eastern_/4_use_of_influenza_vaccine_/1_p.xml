<p id="par0335">The current policies, vaccination coverage and attitudes to influenza vaccination in the Region were assessed through a systematic review of studies published in English between 2006 and 2016 and a survey of ministries of health. Most studies reported low vaccination coverage in the general population and high-risk groups, mainly because of misconceptions about vaccine safety, efficacy and recommendations. Desirable coverage for some at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and pilgrims, was achieved in few countries. Analysis of the number of vaccine doses distributed in the countries confirmed the low vaccination coverage rates.</p>
