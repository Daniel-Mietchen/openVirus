<p id="par0360">The progress in influenza surveillance and response in the Region has been hampered by the fragility of the health systems as a result of protracted humanitarian crises and civil war. From the viewpoint of influenza surveillance programme of WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, a number of issues were highlighted in the plenary discussions as challenges which hampers to improvement of influenza surveillance and response system in the Region. A summary of these challenges identified in the plenary discussions are shown in 
 <xref rid="tb0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref> . Because of the constant evolution of influenza viruses, and the limitations in knowledge and control measures, two essential elements of surveillance and response to influenza are collecting good quality data year round and testing samples using a systematic sampling strategy. Timely sharing and reporting of data are also critical in order to achieve optimal disease control.

     <p id="par0015">The virological and epidemiological components are often not integrated into the SARI/ILI surveillance system and are not part of the national routine disease surveillance and reporting system (often the SARI/ILI surveillance system is considered a stand-alone vertical system which is fund-driven).</p>

     <p id="par0020">There is a tendency to collect too many non-essential data which can overwhelm the system. Efforts should be directed to collecting minimum essential data from sentinel sites in accordance with the nationally defined objectives of the SARI/ILI surveillance system.</p>

     <p id="par0030">SARI/ILI surveillance data are not used enough to provide alerts and epidemic thresholds and assess the severity of influenza in a given influenza season. This leads to either late detection or no detection at all of a seasonal surge or an influenza outbreak.</p>

     <p id="par0035">Countries do not have a consistent or systematic sampling strategy for collecting clinical samples from SARI and ILI cases and testing for influenza virus. As a result, influenza cases and the disease burden associated with influenza are underestimated in many countries.</p>

     <p id="par0040">A lag time often exists between data collection and influenza testing, or influenza testing and sharing of the test results for public reporting, as well as sharing influenza virus specimens for vaccine strain selection. This results in poor understanding of the types of influenza virus circulating in real time and also increases the probability of vaccine mismatch specific to the Region.</p>

     <p id="par0045">A standard protocol is lacking, including a validated algorithm for testing and diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses using multiplex respiratory assays where specimens are tested both for influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses. The absence or inadequacy of appropriate diagnostic facilities to define the viral etiology of severe pneumonia is a problem and means that many acute lower respiratory infections are undiagnosed and hence that viral pneumonia incidence rates are underestimated.</p>
