<p id="par0390">Seven panel discussions were held on a broad range of topics. Panellists comprised ministry of health officials managing the influenza programme in their countries, academia, scientists and WHO staff who discussed ways to sustain the influenza programmes, the value of improving the system to better manage other health security threats, and how to improve the use of surveillance data for influenza control strategies and monitor the effectiveness of control intervention (

    <list-item id="lsti0120">
     <label>•</label>
     <p id="par0135">Surveillance data should be used regularly to assess the severity of seasonal, epidemic and pandemic influenza; data should always be linked to its use in public health actions, especially to develop policies for influenza control.</p>

    <list-item id="lsti0125">
     <label>•</label>
     <p id="par0140">Greater collaboration should be established between the ministries of health, academia and the private sector so as to translate research findings into optimal strategies, policies and practices for influenza control.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item id="lsti0130">
     <label>•</label>
     <p id="par0145">Surveillance data should also be used to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or interventions in reducing deaths and disabilities from influenza and influenza-associated illness. Collaboration between scientific communities, academia and the public sector on the use of such data for informed decision-making would contribute to capacity building.</p>

     <p id="par0175">Vaccination against seasonal influenza should be recognized as part of pandemic influenza preparedness. In countries with low vaccine uptake and in general, a case should be developed for economic investment in seasonal influenza vaccination highlighting the saving in healthcare cost that can be made as a result of the substantial decrease in influenza incidence through yearly vaccination.</p>

     <p id="par0185">In countries where the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is low or fragmented in the general population, seasonal influenza vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered an incremental gain. Of the high-risk groups, healthcare workers should be targeted for voluntary or mandatory vaccination backed up with policies and strong advocacy and awareness campaigns on the introduction of the vaccination and monitoring of coverage and uptake.</p>
