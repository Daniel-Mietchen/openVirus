<p id="par0370">In recent years, new respiratory infections of zoonotic origin, including avian influenza and Middle East respiratory virus coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have emerged which could not have been predicted and this demonstrates the gaps in knowledge in predicting pandemic threat. As we cannot predict influenza pandemics and new infectious disease threats such as MERS, effective respiratory disease surveillance for early warning, together with strong preparedness measures, are essential. The foundation for this exists in the influenza surveillance systems. Building on these systems will require an enhanced capability to collect and coordinate data across national borders and identify the pathogens in real time (or near real time), and agreement on triggers for appropriate response activities.</p>
