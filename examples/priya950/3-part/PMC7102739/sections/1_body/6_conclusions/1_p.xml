<p id="par0395">Each year, influenza illness causes a substantial disease and economic burden throughout the world. This is being increasingly recognized even in tropical and subtropical areas like the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. Improving influenza surveillance is the key to better understanding the effect of influenza epidemics and pandemics and the measures used to limit or prevent them. The emergence of MERS-CoV in the Region in 2012 is a reminder that new respiratory viruses will continue to appear and are risks to national, regional and global health security. The continued circulation of MERS-CoV and avian influenza highlight the need to further improve the surveillance system for severe acute respiratory infection in order to track, detect, identify and monitor viruses which continue to evolve and change.</p>
