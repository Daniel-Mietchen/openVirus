<p id="par0265">Acute respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide and are responsible for an estimated 1.4 million deaths in children under five years of age [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which represents 18.3% of the total deaths reported in this age group [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A substantial proportion of the global burden of acute lower respiratory infections is attributable to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus especially in children and the elderly. However, limited information is available on the burden of acute respiratory infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization (WHO).
