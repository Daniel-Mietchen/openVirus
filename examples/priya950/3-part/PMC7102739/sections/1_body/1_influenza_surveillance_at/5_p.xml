<p id="par0310">In 2011, the World Health Assembly adopted the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to put virus sharing and benefit sharing on an equal footing. The PIP Framework for sharing influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits is an international arrangement to improve global pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Framework establishes a PIP benefit-sharing system that includes an annual partnership contribution to WHO from manufacturers of influenza vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals that use the GISRS. WHOâ€™s global influenza surveillance programme remains critical to: improving global preparedness for influenza; having a better understanding of the influenza burden in high-risk populations; developing tools for rapid assessment of severity; making use of data for vaccine introduction and timing; and monitoring population-based vaccine uptake.
