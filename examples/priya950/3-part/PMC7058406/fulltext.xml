Polyclonal antibody repertoire in plasma following EBOV infection in survivors was compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost human vaccination.

Surprisingly, a predominant IgM response was generated after prime-boost vaccination, whereas survivors demonstrated IgG-dominant antibody response. EBOV infection induced more diverse antibody epitope repertoire compared with vaccination. A strong binding to antigenic sites in the fusion peptide and another in the highly conserved GP2-HR2 domain was preferentially recognized by EBOV survivors than vaccinated individuals that correlated strongly with EBOV neutralization titers.

The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has resulted in more than 3,393 human cases and 2,235 deaths (case fatality rate&#x000a0;= c. 67%) as of 9 January, 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019" id="intref0010">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019</ext-link>). This follows the devastating 2014 EBOV epidemic in Western Africa that resulted in more than 28,652 human cases and 11,325 deaths and outbreaks in DRC in 2014 and 2017. Moreover, since the virus might persist in some survivors (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mate et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), it is feared that EBOV epidemics could continue to recur, resulting in severe epidemics. Therefore, development of an effective vaccine against Ebola is a high priority (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kanapathipillai et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Multiple vaccine candidates are being evaluated in humans in clinical trials, with the rVSV-EBOV vaccine now being licensed in the United States and Europe (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ewer et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Henao-Restrepo et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Krause, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Marzi et&#x000a0;al., 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Marzi et&#x000a0;al., 2015b</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Milligan et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rampling et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Regules et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tapia et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Both T&#x000a0;cell and B cell immunity plays an important role in providing protection against Ebola virus disease (EVD) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ruibal et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Since passive transfer of antibodies in animal models have shown to protect the NHPs against lethal EBOV challenge, several antibody-based therapeutics are also in clinical trials (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dye et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Holtsberg et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Marzi et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). It is postulated that immune responses generated following EBOV infection in survivors may provide life-long protection against EBOV (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Crook et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Primarily ELISA and EBOV-neutralization tests have been used to analyze the anti-EBOV antibodies, but these assays provide limited insight into the diversity and quality of polyclonal antibody response generated following EBOV infection and how they compared with those generated following vaccination in humans (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blaney et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Matassov et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wong et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Previously, we described the antigenic fingerprint generated following homologous prime-boost vaccination with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP) from the Kikwit 1995 strain (rVSV&#x00394;G-ZEBOV-GP). The effectiveness of this vaccine was demonstrated in a ring vaccination study in Guinea during an outbreak in 2015 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Henao-Restrepo et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). This rVSV&#x00394;G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is being used extensively in the ongoing outbreak in DRC and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years and older.</p><p id="p0030">In this study, we performed comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response following EBOV infection in survivors and following prime-boost vaccination with live ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccine in healthy adult volunteers (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ewer et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). ChAd3-MVA is a monovalent formulation of the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3)-vectored vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein of EBOV/Mayinga and boosted with the same ebolavirus gene in a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccine that also contains genes encoding Sudan ebolavirus and Marburgvirus glycoprotein and Tai Forest nucleoprotein. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of polyclonal plasma were performed to elucidate antibody epitope repertoires using gene fragment-phage display libraries (GFPDL) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology to measure real-time antibody binding kinetics, antibody cross-reactivity, immunoglobulin isotypes, affinity, and antibody specificity to each of the antigenic sites identified using GFPDL. Technically, since antibodies are bivalent, the proper term for their binding to multivalent antigens like viruses is avidity, but here we use the term affinity throughout since we do not describe any monovalent interactions. The focus was to identify the overall global pattern of antibody epitope diversity generated following human EBOV infection versus vaccination rather than fine antibody specificities in each individual. Previously, GFPDL spanning the entire genome of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Respiratory syncytial virus was used to map the antibody repertoires of convalescent sera from infected individuals and pandemic influenza vaccinations, which revealed several diagnostic and protective targets (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2011b</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Real-Time Antibody Binding Kinetics of Post-EBOV Infection Plasma and Vaccination Plasma to EBOV GP</title><p id="p0035">A high-titer and a low-titer pool (samples #58 and #64, respectively) of human plasma from individuals primed with ChAd3-vectored EBOV/Mayinga GP and boosted with MVA-vectored EBOV/Mayinga GP, SUDV GP, MARV GP, and TAFV nucleoprotein were obtained as a part of a WHO collaborative study (originally from Oxford, UK vaccine trial). Individual plasma from three survivors from the 2014 Western Africa EBOV outbreak were obtained at 2 (sample #43), 3 (sample #79), or 6 (sample #28) months post-EBOV infection (pi), and a pooled convalescent plasma (sample #92) was obtained from six Sierra Leone patients who recovered from EVD and did not receive any experimental treatment (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Since no individual vaccinated serum was tested in this study, all antibody comparisons between vaccination versus EBOV infection reflects individual/pooled EVD survivor samples with pooled ChAd3-MVA vaccinee samples. The samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against a wild-type EBOV strain in a BSL4 laboratory and against a VSV virus expressing the EBOV GP in a pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assay (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">We performed quantitative and qualitative SPR analyses for several dilutions of post-vaccination and post-infection polyclonal plasma using a recombinant full-length GP corresponding to the Makona EBOV strain produced in a mammalian system, representing mature GP1 and GP2 domains observed in virions or infected cells (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Transparent Methods</xref>).

GP-binding antibodies were not detected in negative control plasma (#36). Post ChAd3-MVA vaccination plasma showed lower binding to GP (mean RU&#x000a0;= 17 for #64 and 104 for #58 at 10-fold dilution) relative to all four EBOV survivor plasma samples (mean RU&#x000a0;= 437 for #43, 2&#x000a0;months pi, 684 for #79, 3&#x000a0;months pi, and 1,040 for #92 at 10-fold dilution, respectively).

The main focus of this study was to identify the overall global pattern of antibody epitope fingerprint and antibody qualitative profile generated following human EBOV infection in survivor's versus vaccination. Since in this study the vaccinated sera were pooled from multiple individuals, all comparisons between vaccination versus EBOV infection reflect individual/pooled survivor samples with pooled ChAd3-MVA vaccinee samples.</p><p id="p0100">EBOV infection in survivors generated a higher anti-GP-binding antibody titer compared with ChAd3-MVA prime boost-vaccination. The observed differences in neutralization between EVD survivor samples with low (#28 &#x00026; #43) and high (#79 &#x00026; #92) titer suggest that EVD survivors may generate a variable immune response following EBOV infection. The difference in neutralization antibody titers and/or potency may correlate with antibody affinity and specificity for higher frequency of antibody binding to the fusion peptides and base of the stalk in samples #79 and #92 compared with #28 and #43, as observed with MAbs from survivors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bornholdt et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Real-time antibody kinetics of post-vaccination antibodies by SPR revealed limited antibody class switching and modest antibody affinity even after prime-boost vaccination compared with post-infection antibodies in EBOV survivors even with a similar timescale following vaccination/infection. The ChAd3-MVA (replication-defective) vaccination-induced antibody class switching and affinity was similar to that generated by rVSV-EBOV-GP (a replication competent virus) vaccination in our previous study (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the GP-binding antibodies induced by EBOV infection were long-lasting responses, lasting up to 6&#x000a0;months post-infection, in contrast to the rVSV-EBOV GP prime-boost vaccination study that demonstrated a short-lived antibody response, which declined to pre-vaccination levels by 6&#x000a0;months post-vaccination (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the presence of GP-bound IgG4 in most survivor plasma suggests a persistent infection or long-term exposure to antigen following EBOV infection. Since IgG2 response is mostly driven by polysaccharide antigens, an IgG2 response of 8.3% GP-binding antibodies in sample #92 obtained from six EVD survivors in Sierra Leone (who did not receive any experimental treatment) is speculated to be due to a possible polysaccharide antigen-induced class switching to IgG2 by highly glycosylated GP following infection.</p><p id="p0105">Although the numbers of captured GFPDL phages following ChAd3-MVA vaccination were comparable with those generated following infection, the antibody epitope repertoire generated following EBOV infection in survivors showed greater diversity compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination-induced antibody response. It is possible that the more focused response to vector-GP vaccination is due to the limited (one round) vector replication that only produces GP once inside a cell compared with productive EBOV infection that can stimulate the immune system over a prolonged period. Importantly, both high- (#58) and low- (#64) titer post-vaccination samples (based on the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> neutralization data) recognized similar antibody epitope diversity that was skewed toward the glycan cap and MLD of GP1, whereas the post-infection plasma samples demonstrated strong antibody binding to C-terminal parts of GP1 and GP2. This ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination-induced antibody response contrasts with the replication competent rVSV-EBOV GP vaccine, which showed a more diverse antibody repertoire with antibody binding to GP2 as previously reported (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that ChAd3-MVA prime boost vaccination should be further optimized to generate a more diverse antibody repertoire.</p><p id="p0110">Three of the four EVD survivors who donated plasma for the current study received immunological treatments such as ZMapp (#43) or convalescent plasma (# 28 and #79), and it is possible that the antibody composition in their blood could have been influenced by the antibody treatments, despite the time interval between the onset of disease and donation of the plasma (2&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months post-infection). Antibodies to viral proteins in addition to GP were observed in immunoblots indicating that antibodies resulting from EBOV infection were present in these survivor's plasma (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Plasma pool #92 obtained from six Sierra Leone survivors who did not receive any experimental treatment showed an overall similar epitope repertoire as other survivors; however, it recognized antigenic sites V.5 (GP 436&#x02013;491), V.11 (GP 439&#x02013;465), and VII (GP 603&#x02013;624) at a higher frequency compared with other survivor plasma samples (#28, #43, and #79). It is possible that antibody treatment (ZMapp or convalescent plasma) of patients (#28, #43, and #79) may have altered some specific epitopes in #28, #43, and #79 that were recognized by the Sierra Leone patients (#92) who did not receive any Ebola-specific antibody treatment, even though patients' immune systems would have seen virus for a number of days before the patients were treated. GFPDL identified several overlapping antigenic sites like sites V.6 and V.7 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Site V.6 shows high frequency in #28 and minimally in other survivor samples including those sampled at earlier time points (#43 and #79), whereas site V.7 is preferentially recognized by antibodies in sample #43 but not by sample #28. However, peptides representing both antigenic sites show good antibody binding with all survivor samples in SPR indicating antibodies recognizing epitopes in these overlapping antigenic sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). Survivor sample #43 (2&#x000a0;months post-infection) who received ZMapp treatment (and not convalescent plasma) demonstrated a diverse antibody epitope repertoire similar to that of samples #28 and #79 who received convalescent plasma treatment. Moreover, ZMapp MAb cocktail does not contain antibodies that recognize sites VI in the C terminus of GP2, which was preferentially recognized by all post-infection survivor samples. However, this finding for preferential binding of antibodies to the C terminus of GP2 following EBOV infection needs to be further evaluated in a larger number of Ebola patients.</p><p id="p0115">A possible limitation of GFPDL-based assessments is that they are unlikely to detect rare quaternary epitopes that cross GP protomers or epitopes with post-translational modification. However, in earlier studies, GFPDL was used to identify conformation-dependent epitopes of neutralizing and protective MAbs. Moreover, &#x0223c;90% of anti-GP antibodies from high-titer post-infection survivor plasma were removed by adsorption with our EBOV GP GFPDL, supporting the use of the EBOV GP GFPDL for analyses of human antibody repertoire, as was also observed previously with other viral antigens including different Influenza strains, RSV-F, and heavily glycosylated RSV-G (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et&#x000a0;al., 2011b</xref>). Use of SPR with the glycosylated EBOV GP overcomes these limitations and provides additional insight into the anti-GP polyclonal antibody response following vaccination or infection. The SPR approach is species independent and captures all antibody classes including IgM, IgA, and IgG and is also more appropriate for maintaining the native structure of the EBOV GP and preservation of conformational epitopes. The antigenic fingerprinting provides an overall global pattern of antibody epitope specificities generated following Ebola vaccination versus infection in humans. This study should be expanded to additional samples from vaccinees and EBOV-infected individuals from ongoing and previous Ebola outbreaks in different populations to evaluate the contribution of MHC haplotype and so epitope reactivity for individual samples to make firm conclusions.</p><p id="p0120">Antibody binding of human plasma samples to the three antigenic site peptides (GP 469&#x02013;498 at the C terminus of GP1, GP 520&#x02013;547 in the fusion peptide, and GP 617&#x02013;645 in the GP2-HR2 domain) that showed a strong correlation with neutralization titers possibly indicates an important role of antibodies to these sites in protection against EBOV infection and disease <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>.
