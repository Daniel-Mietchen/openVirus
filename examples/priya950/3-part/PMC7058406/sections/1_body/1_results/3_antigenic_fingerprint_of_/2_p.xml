<p id="p0060">To compare the polyclonal antibody epitope repertoire generated following ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination with that generated following EBOV infection in survivors, individual plasma specimens from survivors (#28, #43, and #79), pooled EVD Sierra Leone survivor plasma (#92), and pooled plasma from vaccinated individuals with either high (#58) or low (#64) EBOV neutralization titer were used for EBOV-GFPDL analysis (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The idea was to identify the overall average global pattern of antigenic fingerprint generated following EBOV infection versus vaccination rather than fine specificities of antibodies in each individual. Previous study with rVSV-EBOV GP vaccination in humans showed that the antibody epitope profile in pooled post-vaccination sera was overall similar to the epitope fingerprint determined for individual post-vaccination sera (
