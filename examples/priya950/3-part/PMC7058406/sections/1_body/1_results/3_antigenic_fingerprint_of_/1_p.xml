<p id="p0055">To analyze the epitope repertoire recognized by polyclonal antibodies in plasma from ChAd-MVA-vaccinated and EBOV-exposed subjects, GFPDL containing fragments of the 
 <italic>GP</italic> gene from EBOV/Makona (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>), ranging from 50–1,000 bp in length were generated with &gt;10
 <sup>7.1</sup> unique phage clones (see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Transparent Methods</xref>). The EBOV-GP-GFPDL displayed both linear and conformational epitopes with random distribution of size and sequence of inserts that spanned the entire GP (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). The GP sequence of EBOV/Makona differs from that of EBOV/Mayinga, used in the vaccine, by 20 amino acids (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>). We have previously shown that this GFPDL represents both linear and conformational epitopes, as determined by mapping a panel of conformation-dependent EBOV neutralizing/protective MAbs. Furthermore, the EBOV-GFPDL adsorbed most EBOV-GP-specific antibodies in the post-vaccination polyclonal human sera (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>). To further confirm, in this study ∼90% of antibodies from high-titer post-infection survivor plasma sample #79 binding specific to GP were removed by adsorption with the EBOV-GP GFPDL (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). Together, the epitope mapping of MAbs and adsorption studies using post-vaccination polyclonal sera previously (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>) and post-infection plasma herein provided support for using the EBOV-GP GFPDL to dissect the polyclonal antibody repertoires in human plasma.
