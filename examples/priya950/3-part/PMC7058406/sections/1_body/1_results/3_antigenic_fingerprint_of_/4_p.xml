<p id="p0070">The ChAd3-MVA vaccination generated antibodies focused to epitopes within the glycan cap and MLD of GP1, while lower binding to the fusion peptide and the C terminus of GP2 was observed for post-vaccination samples that were preferentially recognized by post-infection antibodies (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C versus 2B). In addition, antibodies from the survivors recognized small epitopes in the N-terminal half of Makona GP, and there were more antibodies binding between the RBR and the glycan cap domain compared with the vaccinated plasma pools (
