<p id="p0040">We performed quantitative and qualitative SPR analyses for several dilutions of post-vaccination and post-infection polyclonal plasma using a recombinant full-length GP corresponding to the Makona EBOV strain produced in a mammalian system, representing mature GP1 and GP2 domains observed in virions or infected cells (see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Transparent Methods</xref>). The protein density on the chip was optimized such as to measure only monovalent interactions so that they are independent of the antibody isotype (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). GP-binding antibodies were not detected in negative control plasma (#36). Post ChAd3-MVA vaccination plasma showed lower binding to GP (mean RU = 17 for #64 and 104 for #58 at 10-fold dilution) relative to all four EBOV survivor plasma samples (mean RU = 437 for #43, 2 months pi, 684 for #79, 3 months pi, and 1,040 for #92 at 10-fold dilution, respectively). The RU of the fourth EBOV survivor plasma sample (#28, at 6 months pi) was 14-fold greater than that of ChAd3-MVA plasma sample #64 (219 versus 17), whereas the difference in RU was 2-fold between sample #28 and ChAd3-MVA plasma sample #58 (219 versus 104). Similar antibody binding patterns were observed for these plasma samples to complete EBOV-GP bearing pseudovirion particles. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the
