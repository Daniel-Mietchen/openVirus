<p id="p0025">Ebola virus causes severe and often fatal disease in humans and is considered a global public health priority. The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has resulted in more than 3,393 human cases and 2,235 deaths (case fatality rate = c. 67%) as of 9 January, 2020 (

This follows the devastating 2014 EBOV epidemic in Western Africa that resulted in more than 28,652 human cases and 11,325 deaths and outbreaks in DRC in 2014 and 2017. Moreover, since the virus might persist in some survivors (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mate et al., 2015</xref>), it is feared that EBOV epidemics could continue to recur, resulting in severe epidemics. Therefore, development of an effective vaccine against Ebola is a high priority (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ruibal et al., 2016</xref>). Since passive transfer of antibodies in animal models have shown to protect the NHPs against lethal EBOV challenge, several antibody-based therapeutics are also in clinical trials (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Holtsberg et al., 2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Marzi et al., 2013</xref>). It is postulated that immune responses generated following EBOV infection in survivors may provide life-long protection against EBOV (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Crook et al., 2017</xref>). Primarily ELISA and EBOV-neutralization tests have been used to analyze the anti-EBOV antibodies, but these assays provide limited insight into the diversity and quality of polyclonal antibody response generated following EBOV infection and how they compared with those generated following vaccination in humans (

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Previously, we described the antigenic fingerprint generated following homologous prime-boost vaccination with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP) from the Kikwit 1995 strain (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP). The effectiveness of this vaccine was demonstrated in a ring vaccination study in Guinea during an outbreak in 2015 (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>). This rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is being used extensively in the ongoing outbreak in DRC and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years and older.
