<p id="p0105">Although the numbers of captured GFPDL phages following ChAd3-MVA vaccination were comparable with those generated following infection, the antibody epitope repertoire generated following EBOV infection in survivors showed greater diversity compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination-induced antibody response. It is possible that the more focused response to vector-GP vaccination is due to the limited (one round) vector replication that only produces GP once inside a cell compared with productive EBOV infection that can stimulate the immune system over a prolonged period. Importantly, both high- (#58) and low- (#64) titer post-vaccination samples (based on the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization data) recognized similar antibody epitope diversity that was skewed toward the glycan cap and MLD of GP1, whereas the post-infection plasma samples demonstrated strong antibody binding to C-terminal parts of GP1 and GP2. This ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination-induced antibody response contrasts with the replication competent rVSV-EBOV GP vaccine, which showed a more diverse antibody repertoire with antibody binding to GP2 as previously reported (
