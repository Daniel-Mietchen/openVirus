<p id="p0125">Altogether, our study demonstrated a different antigenic fingerprint following EBOV infection in survivors compared with a live ChAd3-MVA non-replication vector-based vaccine in terms of antibody epitope repertoire diversity, antibody isotype class switching, and antibody affinity. This contributes to a better understanding of quantitative and qualitative aspects of immune responses that could aid development and evaluation of effective EBOV therapeutics and vaccines.</p>
