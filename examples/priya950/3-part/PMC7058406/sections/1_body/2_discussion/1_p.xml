<p id="p0095">A comprehensive understanding of the humoral immune response following EBOV infection and vaccination is required to identify immune markers that can provide protection to facilitate development and evaluation of effective vaccine candidates against lethal EVD. The main focus of this study was to identify the overall global pattern of antibody epitope fingerprint and antibody qualitative profile generated following human EBOV infection in survivor's versus vaccination. Since in this study the vaccinated sera were pooled from multiple individuals, all comparisons between vaccination versus EBOV infection reflect individual/pooled survivor samples with pooled ChAd3-MVA vaccinee samples.</p>
