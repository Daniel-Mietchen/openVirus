<p id="p0110">Three of the four EVD survivors who donated plasma for the current study received immunological treatments such as ZMapp (#43) or convalescent plasma (# 28 and #79), and it is possible that the antibody composition in their blood could have been influenced by the antibody treatments, despite the time interval between the onset of disease and donation of the plasma (2–6 months post-infection). Antibodies to viral proteins in addition to GP were observed in immunoblots indicating that antibodies resulting from EBOV infection were present in these survivor's plasma (

Plasma pool #92 obtained from six Sierra Leone survivors who did not receive any experimental treatment showed an overall similar epitope repertoire as other survivors; however, it recognized antigenic sites V.5 (GP 436–491), V.11 (GP 439–465), and VII (GP 603–624) at a higher frequency compared with other survivor plasma samples (#28, #43, and #79). It is possible that antibody treatment (ZMapp or convalescent plasma) of patients (#28, #43, and #79) may have altered some specific epitopes in #28, #43, and #79 that were recognized by the Sierra Leone patients (#92) who did not receive any Ebola-specific antibody treatment, even though patients' immune systems would have seen virus for a number of days before the patients were treated. GFPDL identified several overlapping antigenic sites like sites V.6 and V.7 (

Site V.6 shows high frequency in #28 and minimally in other survivor samples including those sampled at earlier time points (#43 and #79), whereas site V.7 is preferentially recognized by antibodies in sample #43 but not by sample #28. However, peptides representing both antigenic sites show good antibody binding with all survivor samples in SPR indicating antibodies recognizing epitopes in these overlapping antigenic sites (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Survivor sample #43 (2 months post-infection) who received ZMapp treatment (and not convalescent plasma) demonstrated a diverse antibody epitope repertoire similar to that of samples #28 and #79 who received convalescent plasma treatment. Moreover, ZMapp MAb cocktail does not contain antibodies that recognize sites VI in the C terminus of GP2, which was preferentially recognized by all post-infection survivor samples. However, this finding for preferential binding of antibodies to the C terminus of GP2 following EBOV infection needs to be further evaluated in a larger number of Ebola patients.
