<p id="p0115">A possible limitation of GFPDL-based assessments is that they are unlikely to detect rare quaternary epitopes that cross GP protomers or epitopes with post-translational modification. However, in earlier studies, GFPDL was used to identify conformation-dependent epitopes of neutralizing and protective MAbs. Moreover, ∼90% of anti-GP antibodies from high-titer post-infection survivor plasma were removed by adsorption with our EBOV GP GFPDL, supporting the use of the EBOV GP GFPDL for analyses of human antibody repertoire, as was also observed previously with other viral antigens including different Influenza strains, RSV-F, and heavily glycosylated RSV-G (

Use of SPR with the glycosylated EBOV GP overcomes these limitations and provides additional insight into the anti-GP polyclonal antibody response following vaccination or infection. The SPR approach is species independent and captures all antibody classes including IgM, IgA, and IgG and is also more appropriate for maintaining the native structure of the EBOV GP and preservation of conformational epitopes. The antigenic fingerprinting provides an overall global pattern of antibody epitope specificities generated following Ebola vaccination versus infection in humans. This study should be expanded to additional samples from vaccinees and EBOV-infected individuals from ongoing and previous Ebola outbreaks in different populations to evaluate the contribution of MHC haplotype and so epitope reactivity for individual samples to make firm conclusions.
