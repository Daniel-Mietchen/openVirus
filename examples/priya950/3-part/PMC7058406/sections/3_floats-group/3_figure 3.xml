  <p>Elucidation of Antibody Epitope Profile against the EBOV Glycoprotein following ChAd3-MVA Vaccination or EBOV Infection in Survivors</p>
  <p>(A) Antigenic sites within the EBOV-GP recognized by plasma antibodies following EBOV infection in survivors (based on data presented in 
   <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The amino acid designation is based on the GP protein sequence encoded by the complete EBOV-GP gene (
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). Previously described MAb epitopes in clinical trials are shown above the GP schematic. Critical residues for binding of MAbs in anti-EBOV cocktails, ZMapp (13C6, blue asterisks and 2G4 and 4G7, pink asterisks) and MAb 114, are depicted. The antigenic regions/sites discovered in this study using the post-infection and post-vaccination plasma antibodies are depicted below the GP schematic and are color coded.

  <p>(B and C) Distribution and frequency of phage clones expressing inserts spanning each of the key GP antigenic sites following EBOV infection (#28, black; #43, blue; #79, red; and #92, purple) in survivors (B) or vaccination (C) with ChAd3-MVA vaccine (#58, pink and #64, green). The number of clones that encoded for each antigenic site was divided by the total number of EBOV-GFPDL selected clones for each plasma and is represented as a percentage for two independent experiments.</p>
