  <p>Antibody Repertoires Elicited following ChAd3-MVA Vaccination or EBOV Infection in Survivors</p>
  <p>(A) Number of captured phage clones isolated using EBOV-GFPDL affinity selection with plasma obtained from EBOV-infected survivors or following ChAd3-MVA vaccination.</p>
  <p>(B and C) Schematic alignment of the peptides recognized by the three EBOV-infected survivors' plasma (B) or high-neutralization-titer (#58) and low-neutralization-titter (#64) plasma (C) from ChAd3-MVA vaccinated adults, identified by panning with EBOV-GFPDL. The amino acid designation is based on the GP protein sequence encoded by the complete 
   <italic>EBOV-GP</italic> gene of EBOV/Makona (
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). The GP receptor-binding region (RBR) is depicted as yellow, MLD is shown in light green, the fusion peptide is shown in orange, and the heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) are shown in cyan. Graphical distribution of representative clones with a frequency of ≥2, obtained after affinity selection, is shown. The horizontal position and the length of the bars indicate the peptide sequence displayed on the selected phage clone to its homologous sequence in the EBOV-GP sequence on alignment. The thickness of each bar represents the frequency of repetitively isolated phage, with the scale shown in the black triangle below the alignment (70 was the highest frequency of a phage clone in this analysis). The dashed lines running vertically refers to the GP amino acid residues 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600.
