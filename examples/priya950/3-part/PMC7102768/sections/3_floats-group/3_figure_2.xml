  <p>A framework for evaluating parallel evolution in virus sequences. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> An alignment is estimated for a set of viral sequences. Polymorphic sites associated with a given phenotype or environment are identified. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> A phylogeny is estimated, and the lineages in which the phenotype of interest is observed are identified (orange). 
   <bold>(c)</bold> Ancestral states (here, S or V) are reconstructed for each of the polymorphic sites identified in step A. 
   <bold>(d)</bold> Branches upon which a genetic change (red cross) is associated with the trait of interest are tested for positive selection. 
   <bold>(e)</bold> Sites that exhibit evidence of molecular adaptation are mapped into a structure of the protein in question to determine possible functional effects.
