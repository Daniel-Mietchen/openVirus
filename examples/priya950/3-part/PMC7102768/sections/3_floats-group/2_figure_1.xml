  <p>Different evolutionary scenarios underlying the same apparent association between virus mutation and phenotype. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> An apparently perfect association between the presence/absence of a mutation (blue/red dots) and a specific phenotype/environment (shading) can arise from a single evolutionary change (red cross). This association is typically represented and tested using a contingency table (bottom). However, each virus sequence state is 
   <italic>not</italic> an independent observation due to this evolutionary history. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> The same apparent association can arise through multiple independent mutations (red crosses) linked to change in phenotype/environment. This latter scenario is less likely to occur by chance and provides evidence for parallel adaptation. 
   <bold>(c)</bold> Experimental evolution studies are often designed to observe changes (red crosses) in variants from a known ancestral strain (blue dot, centre) that is introduced to different environments (shading).
