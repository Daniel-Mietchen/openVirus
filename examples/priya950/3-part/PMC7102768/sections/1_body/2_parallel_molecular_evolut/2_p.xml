<p id="par0060">Perhaps the best described example of virus parallel evolution is the development of anti-viral drug resistance by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV exhibits all the features of rapid adaptation listed above [

 </xref>]; consequently, many HIV drug resistance mutations have been identified, which independently and repeatedly arise during chronic infection in different HIV patients [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, even within a genome as constrained as HIV’s, different mutations can confer resistance to specific drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. HIV also displays rapid and repeatable evolution to host immune responses, as demonstrated by the parallel evolution in different patients of escape mutations to HLA-restricted T-cell responses [
