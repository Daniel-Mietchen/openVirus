<p id="par0065">Viruses that register frequent cross-species transmission events might also exhibit parallel evolution as a result of adaptation to new host environments [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Barriers to virus replication in a new host may include (i) lack suitable receptors for virus cell entry, (ii) innate and adaptive immune responses, (iii) reduced replication efficacy in specific cell types, and (iv) mechanisms of virion release from infected cells [

Following spillover, these groups independently acquired a Met → Arg amino acid change in the retroviral Gag protein [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Under experimental conditions, this mutation increases SIV replication in human lymphoid tissue [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rabies virus (RABV) offers another example: the RABV lineage that infects dogs has changed host species on multiple occasions, causing outbreaks in other 
 <italic>Carnivora</italic> species. Amongst these events, parallel amino acid changes were observed in two separate RABV zoonoses from dogs to ferret-badgers (a Leu → Ser mutation in the RABV nucleoprotein and a Lys → Arg change in the polymerase) [
