<p id="par0105">Other functional constraints, beyond those imposed by protein structure, could also play a role in parallel molecular evolution during emergence or zoonosis. Non-coding viral genetic elements, such as untranslated regions (UTRs) [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], or noncoding RNAs [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], can be functionally important for virus replication and infection. Flaviviruses provide many examples of the importance of RNA structures for viral replication [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and host adaptation [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], some of which are proposed to have arisen through parallel evolution [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; different functional roles have been inferred for RNA structures in other viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Evaluating the effects of natural selection on RNA genome regions encoding for secondary structures represents an additional challenge because (i) our understanding of how such structures evolve is poor, and (ii) it is difficult to define neutrally evolving sites in such regions [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which limits the use of

 </italic> estimation methods, and our limited knowledge of the degree to which non-coding elements are structurally constrained. Various approaches have been developed to test for selection on non-coding regions [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], but to date their use has been limited in evolutionary analyses of viruses. Further development of these methods could improve our understanding of the role that RNA structures play in virus evolution [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
