<p id="par0115">Current challenges for inferring parallel molecular evolution are twofold. First, to better understand and predict parallel adaptation, and apply it to the specific scenario of virus emergence, we need a model that describes how the phenomenon depends on factors such as mutation rates, population sizes, selection coefficients and genome evolvability. Second, improvements in statistical methods and software are needed to make it easier to test parallel evolution hypotheses in the correct way. Advances have been made in testing specific phenomena associated with parallel evolution, such as coevolution [

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, an integrated inference framework that maximises the accuracy of site identification, and is robust to confounding processes such as recombination and genetic hitchhiking is still required. New high throughput experimental approaches, such as deep mutational scanning, have been applied to virus pathogens and will provide more comprehensive information on the mutability of virus proteins [
