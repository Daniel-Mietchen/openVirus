<p id="par0050">Parallel evolution in viruses may arise from adaptation to new host species [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or different host demographic structures [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], evasion of host immune responses [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or to circumvent anti-viral drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These situations involve changes to the virusâ€™ environment that generate strong selective pressures, favouring the recurrent evolution of certain genotypes. Here, we summarise the theoretical concepts behind parallel molecular evolution in viruses, and explore some of the methods that can be used to identify such phenomena. We highlight the importance of phylogenetic methods to detect recurring evolutionary patterns generated by natural selection.
