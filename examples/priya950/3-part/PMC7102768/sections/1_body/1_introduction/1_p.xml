<p id="par0040">The processes that drive the cross-species transmission and emergence of viruses in natural systems are diverse and involve a range of ecological, evolutionary, and genetic factors. Amongst the evolutionary mechanisms, molecular adaptation by natural selection is a key phenomenon that entails the generation and spread of beneficial mutations that increase virus fitness in a specific environment. If rapidly evolving virus populations repeatedly experience comparable environmental changes and similar selective pressures, then viruses may exhibit what is known as parallel evolution.</p>
