<p id="par0045">The concept of parallel evolution is applied to organisms across the tree of life and can refer to all manners of phenotypes and traits at different levels of biological organisation [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Parallel evolution manifests itself in a variety of ways, from the repeated fixation of single point mutations or larger genetic changes (e.g. indels or genome rearrangements) [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], to the evolution of structural, functional or behavioural phenotypes. The terms ‘parallel’ and ‘convergent’ evolution are sometimes given distinct definitions: convergent evolution refers to the independent evolution of similar traits from different ancestral starting points [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], whereas parallel evolution describes the independent emergence of similar traits from the same state [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Here, we use ‘parallel’ to refer to both situations. Further, we use ‘adaptation’ to refer to evolutionary change through positive natural selection, and ‘evolution’ to encompass change via any process (e.g. by random genetic drift).
