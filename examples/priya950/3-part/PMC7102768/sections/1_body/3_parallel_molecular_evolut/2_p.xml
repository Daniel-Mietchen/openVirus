<p id="par0080">It is commonly hypothesised that natural selection is the key process involved in parallel molecular evolution. Negative selection eliminates many mutations from viral populations because strong functional constraints render most genetic changes disadvantageous. In contrast, positive selection favours the accumulation of mutations that are beneficial to virus replication and transmission. Determining whether a given site or genomic region has evolved under natural selection can be achieved by comparing the relative rates of synonymous (
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic>) and non-synonymous (
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>) changes, quantified as a 
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> ratio [

 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> amongst sites and amongst virus lineages. Several methods are available to undertake such calculations [

 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. If 
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> &gt; 1 for a specific codon, then multiple amino acid changes have likely occurred at that codon, and the codon is a candidate for the detection of parallel evolution (see below). However, 
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> methods have limitations and may fail to detect instances of sites under selection [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In particular, some studies report that 
 <italic>d
  <sub>N</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>d
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic> tests have failed to identify sites that appear to have undergone parallel adaptation [
