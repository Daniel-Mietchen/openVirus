<p id="par0095">It is useful to place virus experimental evolution studies in the same phylogenetic context (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c). Experimental evolution was, for example, used to identify adaptive mutations that increase viral fitness in vesicular stomatitis virus [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Such studies often initiate independent virus populations from the same source inoculum. The replicate populations are passaged in different environments and later scanned for shared evolutionary changes. This experimental design is, thus, equivalent to a star-shaped phylogeny with a known ancestor (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c). Since the replicate populations are not correlated by shared ancestry, differences amongst them are independent and can be tested using standard statistics.
