<p id="par0085">The robust identification of parallel evolution and adaptation can be broken down into four steps: (
 <italic>i</italic>) detection of parallel changes (usually amino acid changes), (
 <italic>ii</italic>) association of those changes with a phenotype or environmental change of interest, (
 <italic>iii</italic>) characterisation of the evolutionary forces behind the repeated occurrence of such changes, and (
 <italic>iv</italic>) evaluation of the functional effects of mutations in the context of hostâ€“pathogen biology. A powerful method for detecting repeated, independent evolution is comparative phylogenetics, which infers the evolutionary history of a given trait (including reconstruction of ancestral states) using parsimony or other phylogenetic models [
