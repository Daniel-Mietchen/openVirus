<p>Two different sewage treatment protocols were used during the 9-year surveillance; wastewater samples collected in 2011–2016 were analyzed, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An aliquot of 20 mL of untreated wastewater (collected at the inlet collector, before treatment) were treated with 2 mL of 2.5 M glycine (pH 9.5), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The solution was then treated with 2.2 mL chloroform and centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered and measured. From 2017 onwards, with the start of the new project “Hepatitis E, an emerging problem in food safety: ‘One Health’ approach for risk assessment,” virus concentration was performed using the two-phase separation method (polyethylene glycol, (PEG)–dextran) according to the WHO guidelines for poliovirus environmental surveillance [

 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was stored at 4 °C for the subsequent steps. The recovered supernatant, instead, was treated with 17 mL of 5 M sodium chloride, 142 mL of 29% polyethylene glycol 6000, and 20 mL of 22% dextran, and the mixture was transferred into a separation funnel and left overnight at 4 °C. After phase separation, about 10 mL of the lower phase, which included the interphase, was collected drop by drop into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and was mixed with the previously saved pellet. Then, a 20% volume of chloroform was added to the recovered volume, thoroughly mixed by vortexing, and then centrifuged at 1000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then recovered, and sample volumes recorded.
