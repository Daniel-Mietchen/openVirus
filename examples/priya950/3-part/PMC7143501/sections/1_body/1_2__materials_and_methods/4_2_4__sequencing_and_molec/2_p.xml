<p>Phylogenetic relationships were studied by a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree calculated on the maximum composite likelihood distances. Tree reliability was assessed through bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) and considered significant linkage values &gt;70%. The tree included the representative sequences belonging to genotypes 1 and 3 obtained from human and animal strains. All entries were reported with accession number, followed by host suffix (Sw, swine; Hu, human; WTP, wastewater treatment plant). Still unpublished sequences from clinical cases provided by the Italian National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for human Viral Hepatitis were reported as sample ID, followed by the year of isolation and administrative region origin.</p>
