<p>Real-time RT-qPCR analysis was conducted as previously described [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] on samples that were positive according to nested RT-PCR. Amplifications were carried out with the RNA UltraSense one-step qRT-PCR system (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), using 1.25 μL of UltraSense enzyme mix and the following concentrations for primers and probe: 500 nM for forward primer JVHEVF (5′-GGTGGTTTCTGGGGTGAC-3′), 900 nM for reverse primer JVHEVR (5′-AGGGGTTGGTTGGATGAA-3′), and 250 nM for probe JVHEVP-MGB (5′-FAM-TGATTCTCAGCCCTTCGC-MGB-3′) [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The thermal profile was as follows: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 60 min, inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 65 °C. Analyses were performed in duplicate reactions (5 μL of RNA each) on a Quant Studio 12K flex (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the average concentration of the two replicate reactions was used for quantification. Two negative PCR controls were included in each run. PCR inhibition was ruled out using an external amplification control (in vitro synthesized RNA) and amplifications were considered acceptable if inhibition was ≤50%. A linearized plasmid containing the target sequence was used to generate the standard curve (dynamic range 1 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> – 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/μL); curves with a slope lying between −3.1 and −3.6, and a R
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.98 were used for quantification. Quantitative values in raw sewage (expressed in genome copies, g.c./L) were calculated based on the fraction of the sample subjected to RNA extraction compared to its total volume after sample concentration.
