<p>A phylogenetic tree of the Mtase-ORF1 fragment obtained from the HEV strains detected in this study is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-02059-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B. The tree includes, in addition to the study sequences, clinical, environmental, and animal (swine) sequences previously detected in Italy. According to the sequencing results, the phylogenetic analyses showed that the strains were grouped into two main clusters, related to HEV G1 and G3. HEV G3 strains showed high sequence identity with human sequences detected in autochthonous cases (no travel history) and swine in Italy, and most of the G1 strains showed 100% nt identity with Italian strains detected in patients traveling in endemic areas.
