<p>An attempt to further characterize the positive samples was performed using broad-range primers targeting the ORF2 gene, but only 2 of these samples provided amplification in this region (ID sample 2222 and 2275, both collected from WTPs in Rome, in 2014 and 2015, respectively), and were characterized as subtype 3f by Sanger sequencing. NGS performed on pooled PCR amplicons collected in years 2017â€“2019 detected another G3f sequence. </p>
