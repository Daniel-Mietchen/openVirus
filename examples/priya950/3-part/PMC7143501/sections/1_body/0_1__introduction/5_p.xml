<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence and diversity of HEV in the Italian population through molecular analysis of urban sewage samples collected at wastewater treatment plants (WTPs). Environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems has been demonstrated as a useful auxiliary tool in the study of the epidemiology of viral pathogens, and an essential component of early warning systems. Indeed, a number of studies on the occurrence of HEV in urban sewages have been conducted in European countries, like Norway, Portugal, France, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Greece, and Italy [

In the present study, however, a significant effort to provide a robust estimate of HEV circulation at a country level was undertaken through the application of a large-scale sampling scheme (approximately 1400 samples), over an extended temporal (nine years, from 2011 to 2019), and spatial scale (48 wastewater treatment plants distributed over the 20 regions of the country).
