<p>HEV is a member of the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic>, which is classified into four species: 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> Aâ€“D [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All the human HEV genotypes (G1 to G4) belong to 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> A, along with other genotypes (G5 and G6) that were isolated from wild boar [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and G7 HEV isolated from camelids and a patient with chronic hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Genotypes 1 (G1) and 2 (G2) are mainly restricted to humans, while genotypes 3 (G3) and 4 (G4) are isolated in both humans and animals (pig, deer, wild boar, rabbit) in developing and industrialized countries. Genotypes 1 (detected in Asia and Africa), and 2 (detected in Mexico and Africa), include strains from areas where the virus is endemic. G3 strain isolation occurs mostly in North America, Europe, South America, and Japan [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Genotype 4 has mainly been identified in China, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam, but a few cases have also been reported in Europe, including Italy [
