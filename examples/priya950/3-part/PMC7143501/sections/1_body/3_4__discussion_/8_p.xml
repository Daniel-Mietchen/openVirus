<p>Geographically, HEV identification occurred in 13 Italian Regions out of 20. In the seven regions where the virus has not been identified, we cannot be sure whether such an outcome relates to the number of samples that could be collected. However, it should also be considered that the high variability of HEV occurrence in sewage, besides the kind of influent the WTP is fed with, strictly depends on the sampling volumes and the time of collection [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Indeed, due to the long surveillance period, few WTPs provided samples continuously over the nine years, while the vast majority provided samples in limited periods within this time, resulting in an unequal number of samples by WTP and by administrative region. Therefore, a detailed comparative analysis of the distribution of positive samples by WTP and administrative region was not feasible. Generally speaking, higher percentages of positive samples were detected in Central Italy (a difference found to be statistically significant) and, in particular, in Latium, Marche, and Abruzzo. These data were in line with clinical data; indeed, according to data from the Italian NRL for human viral hepatitis (ISS, Rome), 67% of the confirmed cases (IgM+ and/or HEV RNA +) of HEV in Italy are from Latium and Abruzzo (unpublished data).
