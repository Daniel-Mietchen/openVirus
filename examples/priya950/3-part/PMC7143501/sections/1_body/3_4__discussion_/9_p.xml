<p>Serological data fosters the marked heterogeneity of seroprevalence in the different Italian geographic areas. As a matter of fact, rates in the general population range from 0.12% to 17.8% [

 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The different sensitivity of the anti-HEV detection systems used in different studies (the older ones using kits with lower sensitivity) partially accounts for the observed heterogeneity. However, recent testing on 10,011 blood donors throughout Italy, using the same highly sensitive detection kit, showed that a true geographical prevalence heterogeneity exists, with very high rates of infection in some areas of Central Italy [

 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Abruzzo and Latium can be therefore considered hot spot regions for HEV circulation. It may be relevant that these administrative regions have traditional dishes based on raw/undercooked pork products, in particular liver sausages that, both raw and dried, may contain HEV [
