<p>HEV RNA detection in sewage occurred throughout the years 2011–2019 (mean detection frequency 5.3%) with higher occurrence in 2014 (13.3%). In a study conducted following an HEV outbreak on a small French island, Miura et al. estimated that if 1–4% of inhabitants connected to a WTP were infected with HEV, the virus would be detectable in urban wastewater [

While it is not possible to directly infer these conclusions to WTPs of different capacities and size, our results on the occurrence of HEV in sewage suggests the considerable circulation of the virus in the Italian population, despite the relatively small number of notified cases. During the period from 2011 to the first semester of 2019 only 323 cases of acute viral hepatitis were reported in the Italian integrated epidemiological system for acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA) managed by the Italian Institute of Health (ISS) (

The discordance between the relatively constant HEV detection in Italian sewages and the low incidence of HEV infection in humans may be associated with nondetection of mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic cases, which, however, shed virus into local sewage systems and contributed to virus circulation. This phenomenon is recognized as the “surveillance pyramid” [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; because of under and misdiagnoses, clinical surveillance is likely to only capture the tip of the iceberg of viral diseases, generally corresponding to the hospitalized or laboratory diagnosed cases, while the full extent of disease can only be captured through studies addressing incidence and etiology at a community level. In this sense, the monitoring of urban wastewaters provides a powerful tool for indirect assessment of the community health status.
