<p>Also, economic issues can limiting the broad commercialization of nano-based formulations (Ventola,

In comparison to conventional therapies, the production of a nano-based formulations required higher initial investments that will only be worth it from a business perspective if brings good opportunities for the pharmaceutical company, justifying their investment of R&amp;D sector and reduce substantially health care costs (Benelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Hua et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Future research should explore the possibility of (i) determine the mechanism of action of nano-based formulations; (ii) understand the behavior and interaction of nanomaterial in complex biological matrix, such as human body; (iii) evaluate the possible toxicity and residual effects of nanomaterials in both target and non-target organisms; (iv) development of a international legislation; (v) create a standard definition of nanotechnology and nanomaterials, and (vi) standardized methods for establishing the risk-benefit of nanomaterials, in order to create large scale production of nanodevices to fight against of arboviruses as suggested in literature (Parisi et al.,
