<p>The potential application of nano-based formulations in the field of arboviruses management was investigated by analyzing the number of publications in the last ten years. The results revealed that around 1000 articles were published worldwide, which an exponential trend in publication numbers after 2016, mainly for researches related to zika and chikungunya. Overall, many publications have shown that nanotechnology has led to rapid advancements in the development of pesticides, repellents, drug delivery system and diagnostic devices for arboviruses management. However, the clinical translational of nano-based formulations has some bottlenecks that hinders the broad acceptance and commercialization of these products (Hua et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Soares et al., 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Also, it's already known, that nanomaterials, independently of their composition and method of production, have new properties, which are not observed by their bulk materials (Laux et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). These novel properties have brought innovative solutions due their flexibleness, responsiveness and possibility of functionalization, the last one, which is very useful for drug targeting delivery (Jeevanandam et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, the behavior, fate, bioavailability nanomaterials in the environment and toxicity of non-target organisms should be better understood the possible environmental impacts (Dinda,
