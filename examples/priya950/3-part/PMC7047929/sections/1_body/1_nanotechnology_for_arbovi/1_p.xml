<p>Several strategies have been applied to prevent proliferation of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species using physical, biological, and chemical control approaches. Other methods under research and development, are also being studied, including the use of nanotechnology to produce repellent and larvicidal formulations that are more efficacious and less toxic. The development of nanotechnology-based sensors for rapid viral detection has also attracted the attention of scientific community (
