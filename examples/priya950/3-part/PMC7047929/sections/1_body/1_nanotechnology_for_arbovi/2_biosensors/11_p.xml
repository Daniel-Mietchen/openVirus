<p>The Ulisse Biomed SRL product portfolio includes a biosensor for the determination of an infection, and possible associated infections, caused by several viral pathogens, including zika, dengue, and chikungunya. The biosensor designed by Braga et al. provides a method for obtaining qualitative and quantitative data related to viral infections. This specific biosensor consists of an antigen (biologically active responsive element) bound covalently to the surface of one or more carbon nanotubes and/or metal nanoparticles present on part of a microelectrode surface, together with an electrically conducting part where a transduction system (sensor) converts the biochemical response into an electric signal (Braga et al.,
