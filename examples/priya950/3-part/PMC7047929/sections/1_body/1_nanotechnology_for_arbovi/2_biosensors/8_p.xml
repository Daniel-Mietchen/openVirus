<p>Vinayagam et al. (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported the recognition of serotype-specific DENV employing multicolor triangular silver nanoparticles (TAg), which has the potential to be a powerful diagnosis technique that is able to differentiate between various serotypes. The color responses were established on the interaction of a TAg-DNA probe with a specific strand, resulting in the creation of a network association between the DNA probe and the dengue virus RNA, according to serotype. This was the first report of DNA conjugated to triangular silver nanoparticles, based on the pH reduction method. This biosensor has not yet been tested using real samples from infected patients, although the proposed technology appears to be very promising for use in clinical POC diagnostic testing (Vinayagam et al.,
