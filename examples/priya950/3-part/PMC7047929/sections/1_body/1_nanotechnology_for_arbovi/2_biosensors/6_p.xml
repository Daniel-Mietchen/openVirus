<p>Nawaz et al. (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported a novel method for the detection, classification, and antibody screening of dengue virus, based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), involving protein recognition by means of a self-assembly process based on polymer matrix composites. However, as mentioned previously, it is very important to be able to achieve early detection of arbovirus infection but the biosensors had generally been designed to detect NS-type proteins that are only produced from the fifth day of infection onwards (Nawaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Omar et al. (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) overcame this limitation by designing an optical sensor based on the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon, which was applied to the diagnosis of dengue virus structural E-protein that forms the coat of the host virus itself. This protein can be detected earlier, at the start of the immune system response to the infection (Omar et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
