<p>Rapid diagnosis of important arboviruses-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, and yellow fever is essential in order to reduce and avoid further dissemination of the infections within the general population (Patterson et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The WHO has emphasized the importance of developing point-of-care (POC) tests that are ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Robust and rapid, Equipment-free, and Deliverable) (Pashchenko et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). An ideal technique for the on-site detection of arboviruses should have these characteristics and enable early detection of the disease. Fast and timely diagnosis is crucial for the confirmation of viral infection so that it can be followed by clinical treatment, and necessary measures can be put in place for monitoring and protection of public health (Rashid and Yusof, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Currently, diagnosis of the infections caused by arboviruses in the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) is often late, ineffective, and dependent on the clinical symptoms. The final decision on the infection generally requires a long waiting time, collection of samples from suspected patients (blood, urine, or saliva), transportation and preservation, and laboratory procedures by trained health staff.
