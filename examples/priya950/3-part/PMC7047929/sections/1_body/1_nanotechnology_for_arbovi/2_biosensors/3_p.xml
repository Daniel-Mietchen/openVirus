<p>The great advantage of a biosensor is that the bioreceptor interacts specifically with an analyte molecule. The specific interaction causes one or more physicochemical changes (production of ions, colored moieties, electrons, gases, heat, mass, or light) (Sethi, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). These responses can then be amplified and transformed into easily interpretable results. For the control and diagnosis of an endemic disease, an ideal biosensor device should be able to detect the arbovirus during all stages of infection, so the device must be designed to carry more than just one bio-receptor (multiplex sensing). Such features can be achieved using lateral-flow assays (LFAs) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA).
