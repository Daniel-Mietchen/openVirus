<p>The recent increase in the cases of epidemic infections worldwide (Nicolini et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>) has also been matched by an increase in the available commercial biosensing devices and diagnostic methodologies. An excellent example is the invention designed by Kaushik and Nair (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The device is based on a modeling and electrochemical immunosensing approach for the detection of zika virus and offers an extremely low detection limit (picomolar). The biosensor is shaped to be worn on an individual's skin for infection screening. It matches the analyte measurement to the baseline in order to determine if an infection is present. After signal interpretation, the result is transmitted as an alert message. The device can be classified as a point-of-care biosensor, since it complies with the ASSURED features as proposed by the WHO.
