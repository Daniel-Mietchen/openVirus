<p>The advancement of technology can show how to improve the ways to detect arboviruses with nano based-tools. However, just a few publications on the use of nano-tools has been clearly demonstrated. Nanosensors have the potential to be allies in the early detection of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-borne diseases by offering novel approaches to achieve sensitive, specific, and stable recognition in complex matrices in quick or real-time diagnostics. Although some variations in synthesis protocols can still be tested to improve the productivity and efficiency of nanomaterials for diagnostic applications, more research on the way lab-to-practical nanodiagnostics is needed. Not only more research must be done on nanosensors for 
 <italic>A. aegypit</italic>-borne diseases, but the upscale of the applicability is urgently necessary, as shown by the few patents filed for this purpose (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). One of the ways for this accomplishment is to narrow the scientific boundaries between disciplines such as chemistry, sociology, bio, and nanotechnology and information technology. A good example that results from this new multidisciplinary approach is the smartphones-based POC devices, as previously cited. They are a real and promising novel tool for flaviviruses detection without complex instruments, since, in a simple way, the blood sample can be analyzed under 40 min (Priye et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Rong et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Despite the advances, still, there is an urgent need for proper and precise use of nanosensors in hospitals, field, and to prevent these potential health risk diseases.
