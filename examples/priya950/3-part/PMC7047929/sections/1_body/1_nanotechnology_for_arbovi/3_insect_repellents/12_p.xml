<p>It is in this scenario of innovation and search for new solutions that nanotechnology applies. It is becoming increasingly necessary to develop formulations that increase the repellent's longevity by controlling delivery and evaporation rate. In addition, the different applications forms such as sprays, creams, lotions, aerosols, oils, adhesives, protective clothing, treated nets, among others, is very important in order to ensure options for people living in endemic areas (Tavares et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Agnihotri et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Thus, encapsulation in micro/nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, micelles, hydrogels among others constitutes an approach to modify the physicochemical properties of encapsulated repellents. When applied in topical formulations or in personal protective clothes, for example, they have been shown to be more effective in increasing repellency time and also in reducing dermal absorption, improving the safety profiles of these products (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Osanloo et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Innovative nanotechnology-based formulations should be followed by safety and efficacy studies, as this will increase consumer confidence in this new formulations (Hameed et al.,
