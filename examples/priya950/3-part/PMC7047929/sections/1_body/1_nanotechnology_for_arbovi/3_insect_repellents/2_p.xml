<p>Gomes et al. encapsulated DEET in polymeric nanospheres, resulting in particles with an average diameter of 114 Â± 37 nm, low polydispersion index, and stability as a function of time. The sustained release of nanoencapsulated DEET provided repellency for over 9 h, which was longer than obtained using free DEET. The results showed that the release mechanism was temperature dependent, which the authors highlighted as having great potential, since the release rate could be adjusted by alteration of temperature (Gomes et al.,
