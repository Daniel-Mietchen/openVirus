<p>Silva et al. studied the encapsulation of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Piper aduncum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Piper hispidinervum</italic> C. in gelatin nanoparticles, with evaluation of the biological effects against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The encapsulation efficiencies exceeded 80%, and the particles were spherical, monodispersed, and smaller than 100 nm in size. Both of the encapsulated essential oils provided lethal effects within 24 h of exposure, with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mortality greater than 80% (Silva et al.,
