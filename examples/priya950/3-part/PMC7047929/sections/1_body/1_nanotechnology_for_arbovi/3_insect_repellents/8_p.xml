<p>The patent 
 <bold>WO2017143421A1</bold> describes the invention of cosmetic formulations for use as topical insect repellents, employing polymeric micelles, nanoemulsions, and solid lipid nanoparticles containing active repellent substances. Nanoencapsulation techniques were used to produce systems consisting of nanostructures with stable hydrophobic and hydrophilic chains. The formulations presented sustained release of the active substances, consequently providing long duration of action of the repellents, together with greater safety (Paula et al.,
