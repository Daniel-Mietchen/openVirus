<p>It should be noted that the search for new formulations has also led to patenting. For example, patent 
 <bold>BR1020180168665</bold> describes the preparation and characterization of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and nanoemulsions containing citronella and neem oil, for the control of insects such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The results showed that both the nanoemulsions and the NLCs loaded with the essential oils caused 100% mortality of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> larvae during the first day of exposure, while the NLCs without essential oil induced 100% mortality after 10 days of exposure. Both carriers showed satisfactory efficacy in the control of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> larvae (Fraceto et al.,
