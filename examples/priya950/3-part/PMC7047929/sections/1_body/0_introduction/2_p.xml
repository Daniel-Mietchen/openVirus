<p>Control of arboviruses is difficult due to many factors, such as lack of effective vaccines for most of the arboviruses, lack of antiviral drugs, insecticide resistance in the vectors such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species and failure of vector control strategies that would decrease human-vector contact (Batool et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this scenario, development of new approaches to rapidly detect, and control dissemination of arboviruses are a priority and a public health imperative. In this regard, the importance of nanobiotechnology has been gradually realized as an emerging technology of the future due to exceptional new benefits (Suganya et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In the vector control applications, nanoparticles could be applied for: (a) the development of new drugs, with higher activity, decreased toxicity and sustained release; (b) development of new repellent formulations based on natural or synthetic compounds; (c) control of vectors by the use of nanoparticles with repellent, insecticidal or larvicidal activities (Magro et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>); and (d) development of biosensors that can rapidly detect and diagnose the mosquito transmitted viral diseases (Durán et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Benelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Nicolini et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>). Due to the lack of specific drugs for viral diseases, nanobiotechnology has appeared as an important new breakthrough, which could be potentially used for treatment of patients infected with arboviruses. VivaGel® is a poly-L-lysine dendrimer-based formulation, which has shown efficient antiviral activity against zika virus (ZIKV) (Starpharma, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Recently, a number of reviews have been published on the contribution of nanotechnology to control arboviruses epidemics.
