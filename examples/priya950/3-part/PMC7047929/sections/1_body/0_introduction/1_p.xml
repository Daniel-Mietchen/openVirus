<p>Rampant growth of human population has led to major challenges of sustainable food production and disease control in the twenty-first century (Roni et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Arthropods are vectors of some deadly diseases, which can lead to epidemics or pandemics (Murugan et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). On top of the list are mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) that are a cause of a major concern around the world because they can act as vectors of a variety of harmful pathogens and parasites (Benelli, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Benelli and Mehlhorn, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Arboviruses have long been treated as neglected diseases around the world. However, in recent years there have been a number of epidemics caused by arboviruses - such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and unprecedented zika (Wilder-Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The main factors contributing to these outbreaks have been considered to be urbanization, modernization and increased international mobility of the general population (Tavares et al.,
