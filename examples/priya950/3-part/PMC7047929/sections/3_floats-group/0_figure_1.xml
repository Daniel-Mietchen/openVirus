  <p>Summary of the main applications of nanotechnology in the control of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti-</italic>borne diseases. There are four main areas where nanotechnolgy can be connected: (i) 
   <italic>Early stage vector control</italic>—The nanodevices for the control of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> can be developed in order to control this pest in its different stages of life. Many studies have developed nanodevices to control the early stages of mosquitoes, i.e., products that exhibit ovicidal and/or larvicidal activity; (ii) 
   <italic>Adult vector control—</italic>adult insect control is also highly studied form of control through the development of nanoformulations that exhibit larvicidal and/or repellent activity; (iii) 
   <italic>Human protection—</italic>following the recent epidemic of arboviruses transmitted by 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, many studies have focused on the development of forms of immunization of humans through the development of nanovaccines, and (iv) 
   <italic>Diagnosis—</italic>the development of nanobiosensors that quickly detect the presence of arboviruses in the host, thus expediting the decision for the most effective treatment.
