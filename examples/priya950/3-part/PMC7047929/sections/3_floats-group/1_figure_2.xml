  <p>Major constituents of a biosensor for arboviruses detection and control. Different kinds of samples (blood, urine, saliva) can be used to detect analytes such as NS1 antigen and IgM antidengue, zika, and/or chikungunya antibodies. The analytes can interact with bioreceptors (aptamers, gold nanoparticles, glycan, fluorophores, enzymes, viral antigens, nucleic acids, and polyclonal antibodies for instance) that are connected to transducers and the signal converted and amplified in order to monitor the arboviruses.</p>
