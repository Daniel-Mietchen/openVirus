This interspecies passage facilitates the genetic exchange of virulent species and generates emergence and reemergence conditions for new highly pathogenic variants (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Webby et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rivailler et al., 2013</xref>). The diversity of host species in regard to emerging and reemerging viral zoonotic diseases means that all preventive actions must be based on updated and concerted approaches with all actors in the health system at global, regional, and local zoonoses.</p><p id="p0040">With acute respiratory signs [highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1, H7N9, H7N7, and H9N2)], Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has periodically led to international panic and has forced WHO to take the health measures to control outbreaks (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Alraddadi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Vector-borne viral diseases (West Nile, Chikungunya, Zika, Dengue fever, Rift Valley fever, etc.) generate approximately 1 million deaths annually; their distribution depends on environmental and social factors. The phenomenon of climate change, the diversity of mosquito vector species, the precariousness of lifestyle, the international movement, and transport are undoubtedly determining factors for the emergence of these diseases, or even their expansion to newly recognized geographical free areas (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kuno and Chang, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Bat-borne zoonotic diseases add a supplementary challenge to the global health community and their role has been demonstrated in the emergence and reemergence of many serious and highly publicized viral infectious diseases [Ebola and Marburg virus (reemergence in 2014), Hendra virus (emergence since 1994), Nipah virus (emergence since 1997)] (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allocati et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bidaisee and Macpherson, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cipolla et al., 2015</xref>).
</p><p id="p0055">In the hospital, the emergence and reemergence of nosocomial viral diseases (HIV, hepatitis A, B, C, etc.) and the emergence of new resistant forms of bacteria (tuberculosis, legionella, salmonella, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, etc.) are also reported. This phenomenon is attributed to the anarchic and disproportionate use of antibiotics, which is one of the major challenges in which control strategies are taken place. The typical example is that of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which represents a real problem in public health and requires a concerted response from health professionals (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aitken and Jeffries, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cipolla et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jacob, 1995</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">Food zoonosis can be viral, bacterial or parasitic diseases is of particular interest. Indeed, waterborne viruses (Rotavirus, norovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus (poliovirus), Norwalk (Calicivirus), Coxsackievirus A and B, hepatitis A and E viruses), and pathogenic waterborne bacteria (endogenous or exogenous) (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria, Brucella, etc.), parasitic infestations [Echinococcus (hydatidosis)], Trichinella are examples of the lack of the application of hygiene and sanitary rules. Adoption of health insurance system at all stages of food production can help in the production of healthy and harmless food and prevent food and waterborne illness (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Koopmans, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0065">Zoonoses that are caused by livestock, living with animals, and domestic poultry also occupy a preponderant place in terms of health threat. Rabies, influenza, diarrheal diseases, MERS, Leptospirosis, Leishmaniasis, and Piroplasmosis are the best known examples. Defective prophylactic measures at the human&#x02013;animal interface can defuse the contagion (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cipolla et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">It appears that the three elements of the human&#x02013;animal&#x02013;environment triad are always present and any efficient prophylactic strategy must always take into account the interactions established between these three components. Most recently, important measures have been agreed and implemented globally, and their proper application is conditional on the full participation of national authorities. These measures were enacted as a globalized approach, concretized and institutionalized by the international community through the &#x0201c;One Health, One World&#x0201d; standard (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carlton, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0075">This chapter is an update of a number of concepts that arise following the emergence and reemergence of new zoonotic diseases.

</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Historical Overview</title><p id="p0085">From antiquity, the humanity had undergone a multitude of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of variable fatalities. The epidemic context related to biological causative agents, and the essential element of diseases the notion of interspecies transmission (human&#x02013;animal) were unknown. Nevertheless, some authors noticed that shortly before the outbreak of epidemics, domestic animals, such as horses, dogs, and chickens, experienced clinical signs at least similar to those found in humans (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ozanam, 1835</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gubian, 1837</xref>). The correlation between the pathogenic effect (clinical sign) and the specific causative agent (virus, bacteria, fungi, etc.) was ignored. In 1848, the German researcher Rudolf Virchow, in his efforts to fight against the typhus epidemic, has studied the interaction between human and his environment (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Rieger, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cipolla et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">Many authors agreed that the words &#x0201c;emergence and reemergence&#x0201d; correspond to the birth of modern microbiology in the 19th century following the studies carried out by the German researchers R. Koch and F. Loeffler.</p><p id="p0095">Loeffler, a German bacteriologist (1852&#x02013;1915), defined and founded the scientific approach of infectious diseases, as we know it today. The researchers demonstrated the causality between the pathogenic effect and the presence of an infectious agent that meets the four criteria of microbial theory (filterability, transmissibility, reproducibility, and specificity) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Flint et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mainil, 2005</xref>). This theory has made it possible to orient the reflection toward important innovations, such as the good practices of the hygiene rules and the invention of antibiotics and vaccines. At this time, it was described as a transition in which primitive scientific concepts quickly became obsolete in favor of nascent scientific ideas that gained more importance (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jacob, 1995</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">The relationship established between pathogens and the human&#x02013;animal&#x02013;environment puzzles elements would gradually be revealed through the development of promising new biological techniques (serological techniques, isolation of pathogens in the first place on laboratory animals and then on cell culture, crystallization, development of photonic and electronic microscopy, etc.) and also the acquisition of new scientific knowledge in genetic molecular biology, microbiology, epidemiology, entomology, ecology, and phylogeny.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Universal Concepts</title><sec id="s0030"><title>Environment</title><p id="p0105">The environmental issue and its relationship with the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic diseases have a universal and institutional dimension and its preservation was one of the three pillars of sustainable development and the seventh of the eight Millennium Development Goals during the UNESCO Congress in 1977 [Tbilisi (Georgia, former USSR)] (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Unesco-PNUE, 1977</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">The meaning of the word environment has evolved over time. In the old literature, the word &#x0201c;environ&#x000e9;menz&#x0201d; designates circle, circuit, or contour, then it expressed an action of surrounding &#x0201c;environment&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bontoux, 2011</xref>). Nowadays, the word environment has become a polysemy, meaning &#x0201c;action of surrounding&#x0201d; and it can make sense of context, of the neighborhood, notably in linguistics. The most recent definition considers the environment as the set of physical, chemical, or biological elements, natural and artificial, that surrounds a human being, an animal or a plant, or simply a species. This definition is often criticized by the fact that human occupies the epicenter and that all development policies are moving toward this goal.</p><p id="p0115">The basic element of the environment is the ecosystem, which is the entire system of biotic (species richness, composition, and interactions) and abiotic (temperature, rainfall, soil) components that interact in some place (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Loreau, 2010</xref>). All ecosystems are associated with the atmosphere from the biosphere. Macrosystems spread over vast geographical areas under a particular climate and include a natural diversity, plant formations (equatorial forests, savannahs, etc.), and wildlife. The environment is a mosaic of interlocking, interdependent, and fragile equilibrium ecosystems (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Norris, 2012</xref>) and is delighted by a dynamic equilibrium, evolving over time in self-regulating oscillations without exogenous intervention (e.g., predator relationship). This multiparametric dynamic equilibrium determines the state of good health of the ecosystems (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lerner and Berg, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0120">Currently, most of the planet&#x02019;s natural ecosystems, to variable degrees, are the footprint of human activities. Artificially modified ecosystems are maintained by humans to satisfy their food needs or feed the various food production chains. These agro-systems are recognized as fragile because they are devoid of species diversity, which is an essential element for maintaining dynamic equilibrium and is often characterized by natural ecosystems (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Norris, 2012</xref>). In 1989, Croatian researcher Mirko D. Gmerk introduced the term &#x0201c;pathocenosis&#x0201d; to refer to the imbalance in the relationship between infectious diseases and the environment (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Grmek, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Human&#x02013;Animal Interface</title><p id="p0125">In prehistoric times, animals played multiple and determining roles for human, nutritional by maintaining physical and bodily well-being, clothing (wool, cooking, fur, etc.), and a means of transport for the movements and the conquest of new inhospitable spaces.</p><p id="p0130">The survival of human and the strength he had to move or work on the land were mainly through animal feed. More than 200 million animals are used in developing countries, generating economic incomes and reducing the state of poverty for rural populations. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the use of animals is a crucial step in getting out of poverty.</p><p id="p0135">The animal is accused of certain nuisances: metabolic, infectious, and environmental. Nevertheless, the health threats associated with new emerging and reemerging zoonoses are much greater in a globalized world. So the recent epidemics (Ebola virus diseases, Rift Valley fever, H5N1/H7N9 avian flu, etc.) are examples of this. Moreover, the rabies health control programs are still strongly present in the world and rife in two-thirds of the world&#x02019;s countries. Also, hydatid disease is a significant problem medically, socially, and economically (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 2017</xref>). Globally, the socioeconomic impact of these diseases has convinced the most skeptical about the need for collaboration between the human, animal, and environmental health sectors to provide more effective synergistic responses to the threats of zoonotic epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>One Health, One World</title><p id="p0140">The existence of historically zoonotic diseases (influenza, plague, tuberculosis, HIV, etc.), and the periodic appearance of new animal origin transmissible diseases to humans with or without a vector, undeniably recalls the place that occupies animals in the dissemination and spread of pathogens (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Calistri et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">In addition, the improvement of public health is a concern of several awareness and fight programs and is continually implementing various means (financial and technical) that add to the state budgets, while this improvement depends imperatively on animals and the surrounding environment. Therefore it is logical that both veterinary and human medicines federate their actions and work together to ensure a safer and more secure health balance for both humans and animals (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulosa and Wilmer, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carlton, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0150">The One Medicine approach was first proposed in 1984 by Calvin Schwabe in his book titled <italic>Veterinary Medicine and Human Health</italic>, in which the author advocates a concerted and complementary response to zoonoses by determining the roles and responsibilities of the different actors in human and veterinary medicine (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lerner and Berg, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0155">Current threats from outbreaks of emerging and reemerging diseases have led to the return of the principles of the &#x0201c;One Medicine&#x0201d; concept and their evolution to the &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; approach, with the integration of ecosystem health into the equation: animal health+human health+ecosystem health=one health (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Craddock and Hinchliffe, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 27.1</xref>

The low rate of literacy among the population was behind the failure of health programs due to difficulty to assimilate the good hygienic practices (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Zinsstag et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Environmental Changes</title><p id="p0235">The aggression of the environment by the human is not a recent issue, it goes back further in the history of the humanity. However, the aggression became complex and globalized, following the emergence and reemergence of industrial civilization, the main consumers of natural capital and generators of the devastating and polluting industries of the environment. This leads to an imbalance whose gap widens more over time, the term &#x0201c;pathocenosis&#x0201d; is used to describe the disease state of the ecosystems of the environment.</p><p id="p0240">
<italic>Deforestation</italic> is a result of the development of intensive monocultures and the extension of urbanization, which leads to a decreased vegetation cover across the planet. The reduction of wild areas is a factor often cited by experts as a leading factor for the emergence of diseases, the fragmentation of forests directly affects the natural biodiversity; likewise, the destruction of predators unbalances the food chain in favor of certain vectors carrying certain transmissible agents (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gottwalt, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0245">
<italic>The demographic explosion</italic> induces multiple domestic effluents (domestic waste, water waste, etc.), and the lack of management will encourage the proliferation of rodents and insect vectors (mosquitoes, flies, etc.). Even more, the lack of general hygiene and precarious facilities or overflow aggravated the situation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Howard and Fletcher, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0250">
<italic>Industrial pollution</italic> is impacting the state of environmental health: the increase of greenhouse gas production incriminated in global warming, the destruction of the ozone layer, the release of harmful chemical substances of various origins into the nature (nitrates, phosphors, heavy metals, etc.), nonbiodegradable materials anarchically released in nature, and industrial petroleum waste from the pressure of exploitation of energy resources (oil, natural gas, coal, etc.) are few aspects of industrial pollution that provoked an international controversy and many cooperation agreements between the industrialized countries and the specialized international organizations were done.</p><p id="p0255">The marine and freshwater environments (rivers and lakes) constitute the destination of all kinds of pollutants and affect the natural resources.</p><p id="p0260">
<italic>Rapid urbanization</italic> offers conditions conducive to the emergence of new diseases: Overcrowding promotes easy human-to-human transmission of disease. The modification of traditional mapping and contact between humans and ecosystems has greatly facilitated the cross-species passage of pathogens (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Neiderud, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0265">Construction of dams to meet the increased need for drinking water and global warming is fueling the proliferation of vectors including mosquitoes that are gaining new territories and recently has become vulnerable to infection after being declared free (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed Hassan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0270">
<italic>Climate change</italic> increases in the severity of extreme weather events, declining air quality, and destabilizing natural systems due to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. The direct and indirect health results of such a global imbalance include excessive heat-related illnesses, increased vector- and waterborne diseases, increased exposure to environmental toxins, exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases due to declining air quality, and mental health stress among others (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Luber and Prudent, 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Prevention Strategy and Constraints</title><p id="p0275">The diversity of infectious agents both in the environment and in the animal kingdom, intentional human activities, and the globalization of trade and tourism make the formulation of relevant and multidimensional solutions indispensable. The scientific experts, who meet regularly, insist on the adoption of action plans for interorganizational and intergovernmental transversal coordination, complemented downstream in the field, by collaboration between professionals of the human health and veterinary health, actors of associations, educators, and social, economic, and environmental stakeholders.</p><p id="p0280">Moreover, following the exceptional passage of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to the human in 2003, the scientific community has not stopped alerting the world population to the imminent threat of an influenza pandemic of bird origin. Unlike its expectations, the latter did not see the arrival of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus responsible for the 2009 Mexican pandemic, where the responsible virus was emerging following the triple reassortment of three influenza A viruses from three different lineages (human, swine, and avian). This highlights the fact that the forecasting progress made to date remains insufficient and that humanity would have a long way to unveil the mechanisms of emergence of new highly pathogenic viral agents. The determinism of emergence and reemergence is an evolutionary process, the success of emergence and reemergence is acquired only after having exceeded the threshold of fitness compensation. Only a holistic and concerted approach will make it possible to better understand these mechanisms by establishing monitoring of specific parameters of emergence factors. It is noteworthy to point out the divergence between policies with economic aims and the need to preserve environmental capital imposes a burden and additional overload hindering development. The dichotomous zone between economic growth strategies and the protection of the environment is currently the basis of all sustainable development. The development of scientific and technical capacities for problems related to the modernization and efficient integration of environmental education into the academia can sustain the balance of global health.
