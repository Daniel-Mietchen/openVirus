<p id="p0035">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases have a potential to cross animalâ€“human interface. This interspecies passage facilitates the genetic exchange of virulent species and generates emergence and reemergence conditions for new highly pathogenic variants (

The diversity of host species in regard to emerging and reemerging viral zoonotic diseases means that all preventive actions must be based on updated and concerted approaches with all actors in the health system at global, regional, and local zoonoses.
