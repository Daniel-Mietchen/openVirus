<p id="p0205">The genetic dynamism of pathogens, particularly viruses, is materialized by the accumulation of genetic and antigenic mutations, which maintains the virulence of pathogenic agents. Two distinct types of antigenic variation are known: “antigenic drift” and “antigenic shift” (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Donatelli et al., 2013</xref>). Variations of the “antigenic drift” type constantly bring minor and progressive changes in the structure of the viral proteins. Variations such as “antigenic shift” or reassortment or antigenic breakage cause sudden and complete changes in the genome and result in emerging of new agents that have different antigens in nonimmunized population (
