Macrosystems spread over vast geographical areas under a particular climate and include a natural diversity, plant formations (equatorial forests, savannahs, etc.), and wildlife. The environment is a mosaic of interlocking, interdependent, and fragile equilibrium ecosystems (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Norris, 2012</xref>) and is delighted by a dynamic equilibrium, evolving over time in self-regulating oscillations without exogenous intervention (e.g., predator relationship). This multiparametric dynamic equilibrium determines the state of good health of the ecosystems (
