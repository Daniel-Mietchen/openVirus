  <p>Ability of MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV PA-X and NS1 proteins to block host gene expression in combination: Human 293T cells (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup>, 12-well plates, triplicates) were transiently co-transfected, using LPF2000, with pCAGGS GFP and pCAGGS Gluc plasmids together with the indicated combination of the pDZ plasmids encoding WT
   <sup>+</sup> or MT
   <sup>−</sup> PA and NS1 proteins; or empty (
   <bold>E</bold>) plasmid as control. At 24 h p.t., cells were analyzed for GFP expression under a fluorescent microscope (
   <bold>A</bold>) and for Gluc activity in the TCS using a luminometer (
   <bold>B</bold>). Representative images are shown. Scale bar = 100 μm. Results represent the means and SDs of triplicate values. Protein expression from cell lysates was evaluated by Western blot using specific antibodies for PA and NS1 proteins (
   <bold>C</bold>). Actin was used as the loading control. Molecular markers are noted on the left. Western blots were quantified by densitometry using the software ImageJ. Relative band intensities (as described in Materials and Methods) are indicated.
