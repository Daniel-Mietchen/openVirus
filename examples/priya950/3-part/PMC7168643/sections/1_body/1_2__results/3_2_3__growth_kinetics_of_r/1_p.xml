<p>Next, we sought to determine how the recombinant WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV and the mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs with altered ability to inhibit host gene expression affected viral replication in vitro (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f004">Figure 4</xref>). To this end, we rescued five recombinant viruses: WT A/AA/6/60, MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (PA

 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>), and three mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs (PA

 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>, and PA

 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), all of which express the HA and NA from pH1N1. In MDCK cells infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001), we observed that, compared to WT A/AA/6/60, the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV showed no growth at 39 °C and has reduced viral fitness at 37 °C, while maintaining robust growth at 33 °C, indicating that our reverse genetic system successfully rescued a functional

 <sup>+</sup>), and the three mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs (PA

 <sup>−</sup>) in MDCK and human A549 cells at 33 °C. In MDCK cells, all four viruses grow to similar titers but with different peaks of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, in A549 cells, the viruses lacking PA-X were significantly impaired in viral replication at later time points as compared to the two viruses encoding PA-X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Moreover, when we examined the plaque morphology of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (PA

 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) and the three mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs (PA

 <sup>−</sup>, PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>, and PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), we saw that the viruses that do not express PA-X (PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) had plaques that were smaller compared to the two viruses encoding a WT PA-X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). In comparison, viruses which had a mutant NS1 and a functional PA-X (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) had no change in plaque morphology as compared to the MDV A/AA6/60 LAIV (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>). These data suggest that PA-X is necessary for proper viral replication of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV in vitro in both MDCK and A549 cells.
