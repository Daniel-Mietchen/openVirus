<p>Since both PA-X and NS1 are expressed together during viral infection, we next evaluated the inhibitory effects of PA-X and NS1 from MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV in combination as well as the inhibitory effect if one or both had mutations that knocked out their function (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The combination of both WT PA and NS1 proteins was the most effective at inhibiting host gene expression, while having one functional protein was still effective in significantly lowering reporter gene expression. Removing the functions of both viral proteins led to full expression of the reporter genes. Taken together these results demonstrate that we can tune the amount of inhibition of host cell protein synthesis in the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV by altering the ability of PA-X and NS1 proteins to inhibit host gene expression.
