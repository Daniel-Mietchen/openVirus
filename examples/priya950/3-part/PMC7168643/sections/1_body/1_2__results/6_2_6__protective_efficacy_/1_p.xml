<p>Finally, we determined the protective efficacy of the three mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>, and PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) as compared to the WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>). To that end, mice were vaccinated with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs and challenged 21 days p.i. with 1000X the mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of pH1N1 [
 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and monitored for changes in body weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) and survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>B) for 14 days. We also evaluated the presence of the pH1N1 virus challenge in the lungs of infected animals at Days 2 and 4 post-challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). None of the vaccinated mice lost weight (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) and all survived (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>B) the lethal challenge with pH1N1, contrary to the situation of the mock (PBS)-vaccinated mice that all succumbed to viral infection. Mice that were vaccinated with the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV that had both mutant PA and NS1 (PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) showed significantly higher viral titers at Days 2 and 4 post-challenge compared to the mice vaccinated with the WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>C), but significantly less than the PBS-treated control group, indicating that while there was a protective immune response (no mice died) it was not as robust, in agreement with the previous results showing reduced HAI antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). The WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) and the two mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs containing only one mutant protein (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>/NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) showed a significant reduction in viral titers on both days as compared to the PBS control treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). Taken together these results indicate that altering the ability of the WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV to inhibit host protein synthesis does not abolish protective efficacy while improving its safety profile.
