<p>To assess virus growth kinetics in vitro, confluent monolayers of MDCK or A549 cells (4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, 12-well plate format, triplicates) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 (MDCK) or 0.025 (A549). After 1 h of virus adsorption at room temperature, cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.3% BSA, 1% P-S-G, and TPCK-treated trypsin (1 μg/mL for MDCK cells and 0.25 μg/mL for A549 cells) and incubated at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C for WT vs. LAIV and at 33 °C for the PA and NS1 mutants. At the indicated times post-infection, p.i. (24, 48, 72, and 96 h), TCS were collected and viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/mL) as previously described [

 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, confluent wells of MDCK cells (10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, 96-well plate format, triplicates) were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of TCS. At 12 h p.i., cells were fixed and permeabilized (4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in blocking solution (2.5% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the influenza virus NP mAb HB-65 (ATCC) [

 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Dako) for 1 h at 37 °C. NP-expressing positive cells were enumerated to determine the virus titer (FFU/mL). The mean value and SDs were calculated using Microsoft Excel software.
