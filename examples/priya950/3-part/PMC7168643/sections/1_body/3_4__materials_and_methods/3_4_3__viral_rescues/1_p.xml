<p>Virus rescues were performed as we described previously [

 <sup>−</sup>) using Lipofectamine 2000 (LPF2000, Invitrogen). At 12 h post-transfection (p.t.), the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% P-S-G, and 0.5 μg/mL of N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma). At 3–4 days p.t., tissue culture supernatants (TCS) were collected, clarified, and used to infect fresh MDCK cells. At 3 to 4 days post-infection (p.i.), recombinant viruses were plaque purified and scaled up in MDCK cells. Stocks were titrated by immunofocus assay (Fluorescence Focus Units (FFU)/mL)) on MDCK cells [
