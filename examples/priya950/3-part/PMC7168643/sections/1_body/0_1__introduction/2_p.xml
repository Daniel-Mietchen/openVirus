<p>Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), which induce limited T cell-mediated immune responses [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], have limited protection efficacy when the seasonal vaccine does not match the circulating strains [
 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) usually induce more robust adaptive B- and T-cell immune responses associated with better protection against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the multiple advantages of LAIVs, the current LAIV remains restricted for use in healthy children older than two and non-pregnant adults [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to develop safer LAIVs that can be used more broadly in the human population, while maintaining their immunogenic properties. Current LAIVs for the treatment of human IAV infections contain the internal genes (

 <italic>PB1</italic>, 
 <italic>PA</italic>, 
 <italic>NP</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>, and 
 <italic>NS</italic>) of a master donor virus (MDV) and the surface HA and NA segments from the seasonal virus strains (H1N1 and H3N2) [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The MDV in use in the United States (US) is the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 (A/AA/6/60), which was generated after several passages under suboptimal low temperatures [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV has a temperature sensitive (
 <italic>ts</italic>), cold adapted (
 <italic>ca</italic>), and attenuated (
 <italic>att</italic>) phenotype associated with the ability of the virus to replicate in the upper respiratory track (lower temperature) but not in the lower respiratory tract (higher temperatures) [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The 
 <italic>ca</italic>, 
 <italic>ts</italic>, and 
 <italic>att</italic> signature of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV is conferred by five mutations in three internal viral genes: the polymerase basic 2 (PB2; N265S) and 1 (PB1; K391E, D581G, and A661T) proteins and the viral nucleoprotein (NP; D34G) [
