 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] show that modifying the functions of the PA-X and NS1 proteins is a viable way to fine tune the attenuation of vaccine candidates. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of influenza and reduce the global health burden. However, in recent years the vaccine efficacy has been reported to be less than 50% leading to a large effort to find alternative vaccines that work better. This work demonstrates one method of increasing the safety profile of the current IAV LAIV without losing any of its protective efficacy that could be implemented with new universal vaccines strategies that are being currently developed for the treatment of influenza viral infections.
