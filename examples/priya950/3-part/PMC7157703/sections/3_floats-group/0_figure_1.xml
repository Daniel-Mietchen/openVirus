  <p>Development of human immune system mice. Schematic illustration displaying the different human immune system mice (HIS mice) developed since 1988. Models are classified into four categories that are color-coded: baseline strains (blue), primary models (blue-green), second generation models (green), and recent/emerging models (green-orange). Models are organized from top to bottom according to their level of humanization and the time when they were first developed. The year where each model was first developed (gray area), as well as the reference numbers (# under bracket) connecting to the literature that described such model, are indicated. Each second generation and emerging model is displayed in a colored box that indicates the nature of the enhancement (transgenic expression, tissue engraftment, loss-of-function (LOF), knock-in or transgenic expression+LOF).
