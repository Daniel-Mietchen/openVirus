<p>HIS mice have been intensively used to investigate the HIV-1 infectious cycle in vivo and immune responses [

One study reported a HIV-1 strain (HIV-rTA) for which the TAT-Tar mechanism required for virus replication and transcription was inactivated and the viral protein Nef was replaced by a doxycycline-dependent transcription system [
 <xref rid="B318-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. Authors showed that HIV-rTA could lead to production infection in doxycycline-fed BRG-HIS mice without CD4+ T cell depletion. Importantly, the virus was not found to escape doxycycline control over time and revert toward a wild type TAT-tar mechanism [
