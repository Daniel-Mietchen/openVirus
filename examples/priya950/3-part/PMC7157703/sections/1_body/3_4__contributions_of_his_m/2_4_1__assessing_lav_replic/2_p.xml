 </italic> (NOJ) mice have been shown to be susceptible to MV-LAV infection [
 <xref rid="B320-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. This is especially evident in studies where MV-LAV could be significantly detected in the blood, spleen and bone marrow of the humanized NOJ, but not in non-humanized NOJ [
 <xref rid="B320-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. HIS miceâ€™s susceptibility to MV-LAV has been used to evaluate vaccine reversion and stability over time. Specifically, CB17-SCID-hu mice were employed to investigate whether long-term passages of an avirulent measles vaccine strain (Moraten strain) could cause enhanced virulence and thymic tissue adaptation over time [
 <xref rid="B321-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. Interestingly, the Moraten strain, collected 90 days post vaccination from the thymus of CB17-SCID-hu mice, showed high virulence in thymus implants in comparison to the original Moraten strain. These works demonstrate that HIS mice can represent a valuable resource to evaluate vaccine safety.
