<p>NSG-HIS mice have been reported to mimic clinical features of human tuberculosis infection [
 <xref rid="B325-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">325</xref>]. Following aerosol infection, pulmonary lesions and necrotic granulomas displaying similarities with those observed in patients could be observed. Authors also demonstrated the relevance of such an infection model to evaluate drug regimens against M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in vivo. In another study, NRG-HIS mice were immunized subcutaneously with the BCG vaccine and then challenged four weeks later with M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> via the respiratory route. BCG was able to partially protect NRG-HIS mice against M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis infection</italic>, as demonstrated by a reduced bacterial load and granulomatous lesions in the lungs. The authors therefore concluded that HIS mice can represent a relevant platform to evaluate novel vaccinal strategies against M.

 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, as well as BCG vaccination prior to M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="B327-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">327</xref>]. These authors found evidence of potential T-cell activation upon M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> challenge in the lungs, and further suggested that BCG vaccination affects the distribution of T-cell activation phenotypes in the same tissue upon subsequent M. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection. However, unlike the previous study, authors did not find that BCG could confer any level of protection against M.

 <xref rid="B327-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">327</xref>]. Altogether, these studies highlight that HIS mice have potential in uncovering the molecular basis of BCG-induced immunity. However, they also underscore the need for more advanced HIS mouse models able to more accurately and reproducibly recapitulate human BCG-induced immunity.
