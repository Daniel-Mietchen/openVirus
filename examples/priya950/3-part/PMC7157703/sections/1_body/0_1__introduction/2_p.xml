<p>A primary limitation in developing innovative vaccines against today and tomorrowâ€™s challenging infectious diseases is our inability to understand the molecular basis of current LAV attenuation and immunogenicity. This is mainly because of the empiric nature of their development [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Traditionally, LAV attenuation has been achieved either through the serial passage of a virulent pathogen or the isolation of a closely related virus or bacterium that produces mild disease in humans, such as cowpox for smallpox vaccines [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This means that the existence of a LAV directly correlates with the capacity of its parental or common ancestor strain to evolve and adapt to a novel host or environment. Therefore, LAV attenuation is tied to the stochasticity of evolution. The story of the generation of the yellow fever vaccine strain 17D strongly supports such reasoning. 17D was isolated by serially passaging a virulent yellow fever virus (YFV) strain in mouse and chicken embryo tissues [
