<p>This review will encompass the past, current and future applications of HIS mice for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing LAV attenuation and immunogenicity. First, we will discuss the empiric development of several historically important LAVs and how they have positively impacted global human health, and review some of the molecular mechanisms suspected to underly their attenuation. Next, we will provide an overview of the past and current HIS mouse models and explore the contributions of HIS mice to our understanding of LAV attenuation and immunogenicity. Finally, we will identify the shortcomings associated with these models and describe how current and future efforts in refining HIS mice models will open avenues for a better understanding of LAV-induced immunity. </p>
