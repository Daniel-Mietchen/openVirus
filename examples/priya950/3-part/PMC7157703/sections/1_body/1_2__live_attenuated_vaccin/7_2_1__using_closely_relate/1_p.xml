<p>Smallpox was a deadly disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years until its eventual eradication in 1980 [

 <xref rid="B48-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The disease was caused by the virus variola from the 
 <italic>Orthopovirus</italic> genus and poxvirus family, and had a case fatality rate of 30% [

While it was commonly known that those who contracted cowpox (a zoonotic poxvirus closely related to variola that only induced mild disease in humans) did not contract smallpox, deliberate inoculation with the virus was not popularized until the experiments of Edward Jenner were published in 1798. Jenner’s findings summoned a wave of enthusiasm for what would eventually be termed ‘vaccination’ but issues with using cowpox as a LAV, which included bacterial contamination and unmeasured potency, caused vaccination support to wane. Early vaccines were made of lymph from infected calves or were propagated between vaccinees, but arm-to-arm transfer was considered unsafe because of the spread of bloodborne diseases [
 <xref rid="B49-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A virus closely related to cowpox and variola known as vaccinia took the place of cowpox as the source of smallpox LAVs by 1900 through what may have also been contamination or the result of varied methods of virus passage [
