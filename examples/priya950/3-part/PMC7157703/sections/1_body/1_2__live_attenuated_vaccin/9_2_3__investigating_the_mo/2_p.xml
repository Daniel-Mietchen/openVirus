<p>Direct genetic comparisons between LAV strains with their virulent counterparts have been used to hypothesize correlates of attenuation and immunogenicity. For example, cases of vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and increased neurovirulence are associated with mutations in the 5â€™ noncoding region of all three OPV strains after passage in the human gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B126-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Interestingly, besides vaccinia virus-derived smallpox LAV and deliberately reassortant LAIV, LAVs tend to show high genetic similarity to the pathogen they were derived from. YFV-17D and YFV-Asibi only diverge by 68 nucleotides (about 0.6% of the genome) and 32 amino acid changes that are scattered throughout the genome [

In addition to the 9.5 kb RD1 deletion, further attenuated BCG LAV strains can have additional deletions, namely RD2 (10.7 kb) and/or RD3 (9.3 kb) [
