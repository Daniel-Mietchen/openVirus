<p>The methods by which established LAVs have been generated (use of related pathogens, attenuation of related pathogens, and attenuation of the causative agent of a disease), are all empiric and were conducted without any knowledge of the immunological mechanisms that are at play during LAV infection. Specific mutations in viral or bacterial genomes, which likely translate into differential host–pathogen interactions, have been clearly associated with pathogen attenuation. However, the nature of these specific host–LAV interactions, and how they trigger a potent immune response, remain mostly unknown. The emergence of new infectious diseases, minimization of adverse reactions to LAV and reversion to wild-type strains, short-tracking of vaccine production methods, and provision of immunization options for immunocompromised individuals, are only a few of the reasons why researching the mechanisms governing LAV attenuation still remain of critical importance today. Despite the development of potentially promising LAV candidates over the past two decades to fight many challenging infectious diseases (see examples above), a very limited number of them have actually been licensed so far, suggesting that novel rational approaches are needed to design more potent and/or safer LAVs in the future. To do so, the currently established LAVs represent a formidable source of information. In this first section, we will review the historical development and global impact of established LAVs, and discuss some of the attenuation mechanisms that have been identified for these vaccines. </p>
