<p>Yellow fever (YF) is a serious hemorrhagic fever endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America [
 <xref rid="B79-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It is recognized as one of the most devastating infectious diseases of the 17th and 18th century, capable of killing thousands at a time [

 <xref rid="B81-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. YF is caused by yellow fever virus (YFV), a positive-sense RNA flavivirus, and is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes, Haemogogus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> mosquito species [

 <xref rid="B84-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The isolation from Mayali was used by the Pasteur Institute to develop the French Neurotropic Vaccine strain (FNV), but was discontinued in 1982 due to a number of encephalitic reactions to the vaccine [

The YFV-Asibi strain was isolated and passaged by Max Theiler of the Rockefeller Institute, and was successfully attenuated in 1927 after 235â€“240 passages in mouse embryonic tissue, minced whole-chick embryo, and minced chick embryo with brain and spinal cord removed [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This LAV caused mild disease in macaques and human cohorts and conferred protective immunity against YFV [
 <xref rid="B85-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This strain is known as YFV-17D and is the basis of all YFV vaccines used today [
