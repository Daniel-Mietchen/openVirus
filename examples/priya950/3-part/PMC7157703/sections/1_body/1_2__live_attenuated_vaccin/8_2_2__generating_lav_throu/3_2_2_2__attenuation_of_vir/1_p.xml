<p>Calmette and Guérin’s use of serial passage to develop an LAV opened new doors in vaccine production. The majority of LAVs have since been made using this method, including vaccines against yellow fever [

The effect these LAVs have had on disease prevention has been profound. In 1951, Max Theiler was awarded a Nobel Prize for his creation of the yellow fever LAV [

 <xref rid="B78-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. We will summarize the history of some of the most well-known LAVs of this category, including yellow fever, measles, polio, and influenza vaccines.
