 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was first identified by Robert Koch in 1882 [
 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], although the bacterium used in the BCG LAV is 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, a pathogen responsible for bovine tuberculosis, and one that is equally virulent in humans. The attenuation of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> was achieved by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin of the Institut Pasteur, who subcultured an isolation of 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> in media containing potato, glycerol, and beef bile for 13 years and a total of 231 serial passages [
 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The attenuated BCG vaccine was successfully used on an infant in 1921 [

 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> contamination that resulted in the Lübeck disaster in 1930, which killed 72 infants and infected an additional 135 of 250 infants vaccinated [
 <xref rid="B71-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], BCG administration became widespread without ill effect, and multiple strains were thus developed [
