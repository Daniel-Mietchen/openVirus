<p>Although TIVs are most frequently used for seasonal influenza vaccination [
 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], immunity from subunit TIVs relies on HA and NA proteins of a specific influenza strain. In contrast, the inclusion of six viral proteins of cold-adapted donor influenza strains enables LAIV to exhibit heterosubtypic protection, or to improve the viral clearance of different sub-strains of influenza than the one vaccinated for [
