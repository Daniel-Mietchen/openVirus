<p>The introduction of OPVs decreased the incidence of polio by 99%, improving upon the 95% reduction achieved with inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) developed by Salk in 1955 and that were immediately used in mass vaccination campaigns [

 <xref rid="B107-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The OPV has played a critical role in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative that began in 1988, decreasing the global burden of wild-type polio from more than 350,000 annual cases to just 33 cases in 2018 [

 <xref rid="B109-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Wild-type 2 poliovirus was last seen in 1999 and declared eradicated in 2015 [

On rare occasions, OPV can revert to a neurovirulent phenotype and induce vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, and virus excretion following vaccination can lead to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While cVDPVs can be controlled by consistent vaccination, long-term virus excretion by hypogammaglobulinemic vaccinees, known as immunodeficient vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) is more difficult to manage [
