<p>The story of HIS mice began with the development of immunodeficient mouse strains. In 1983, a mouse harboring the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mutation, a mutation in the 
 <italic>Prkdc</italic> gene, was reported to lack functional B and T cells through defective V(D)J recombination [

 <italic>RAG1</italic> and 
 <italic>RAG2,</italic> were also reported to display no functional T and B cells through a similar mechanism [

 <xref rid="B232-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>] or peripheral blood leukocytes, led to the differentiation of human T and B cells in vivo [
 <xref rid="B233-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Human HSC engraftment of bg/mu/xid mice was also reported at the same period. These animals were athymic and had lower levels of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). Intravenous inoculation of human bone-marrow-derived cells into adult irradiated bg/mu/xid mice led to the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs into macrophage progenitors in vivo [
 <xref rid="B234-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. Engraftment in these animals led to a higher number of progenitors than in SCID mice, likely due to the absence of NK and LAK activity in bg/mu/xid mice.
