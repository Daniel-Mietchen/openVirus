<p>A initial approach has been to generate HIS mice expressing transgenic MHC molecules to educate human T cells in the mouse thymus and to track human antigen-specific T cells upon microbial challenge [

 <xref rid="B274-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. However, a more elaborate strategy has involved the construction of HIS mice engrafted with human primary lymphoid tissue in order to more physiologically model human hematopoiesis and lymphocyte education. In 1990, an introductory study reported that the co-engraftment of small fragments of the fetal liver and thymus into adult SCID mice (also referred as the SCID-hu model) led to the long-term maintenance of several human hematopoietic progenitors and to sustained human T lymphopoiesis [

 <xref rid="B278-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. In these studies, BLT-HIS mice were shown to display enhanced lymphopoiesis and T-cell selection on human MHC molecules. BLT-HIS mice have notably constituted a model of choice to investigate the infectious cycle of HIV-1 in vivo, as mucosal infection, persistent viremia and cellular responses—albeit limited—could be recapitulated in this model [

 <xref rid="B287-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>]. BLT-HIS mice have also been a useful system to investigate the replication dynamics of the Dengue virus (DENV) in vivo, as well as anti-DENV adaptive immunity [

 <xref rid="B292-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>]. However, a major limitation of the BLT model is its absolute reliance on fetal tissues. Therefore, alternative approaches involving the engraftment of immunodeficient mouse strains with embryonic stem cell-derived, thymic epithelial progenitors [
 <xref rid="B293-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>], or with neonatal thymus [
