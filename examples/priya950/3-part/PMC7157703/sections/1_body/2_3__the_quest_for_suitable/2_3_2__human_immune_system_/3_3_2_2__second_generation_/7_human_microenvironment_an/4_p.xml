<p>Another major caveat in immunodeficient mouse strains is their lack of functional draining lymph nodes (LN).

 </italic> immunodeficient mice are defective for IL-7-mediated signaling, which results into the absence of lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTi) during development [

 <xref rid="B306-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. Interestingly, the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) shares a structural and functional homology with IL-7 but signals through a receptor that is IL2Rγ independent. It has been recently shown that TSLP overexpression compensates for the lack of IL-7 signaling and promotes robust LN development in BRG-

 <xref rid="B307-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. They provided a suitable niche for human T- and B- cell priming after immunization, leading to enhanced human antigen-specific responses. An alternative approach for restoring mouse LN has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B308-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>]. NOG mice harboring a transgene coding for murine IL2Rγ under the control of the endogenous promoter of RORγt were generated (NOG-pRORγt-γc), allowing the selective re-expression of IL2Rγ in a specific LTi lineage [
