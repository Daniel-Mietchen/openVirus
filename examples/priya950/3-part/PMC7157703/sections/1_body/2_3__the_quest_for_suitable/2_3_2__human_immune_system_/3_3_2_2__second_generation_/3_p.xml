<p>One approach to enhance HIS mice has notably consisted of generating xenorecipient strains expressing human cytokines. A large numbers of mouse cytokines do not cross-react with human receptors, and the absence of cytokine-mediated signaling has been hypothesized to affect many arms of the immune system in HIS mice, such as myeloid and NK cell development, T cell education and B cell maturation. Consistently, many groups have reported the development of BRG (with transgenic expression of human Sirpa or not), NSG and NOG mice expressing one or several human cytokines through transgenic or knock-in approaches, such as human thrombopoietin (TPO), IL-3, IL-15, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF) and/or macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) [
