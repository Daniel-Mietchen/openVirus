<p>Major insights into anti-LAV immunity have been obtained from cohorts of human vaccinees. For instance, studies have identified specific cellular, transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures defining LAV immunogenicity in the blood of human vaccinees [

 <xref rid="B228-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>], providing unique insights into how the immune response is mobilized upon LAV vaccination in humans. However, these studies fall short of probing fundamental mechanisms that govern LAV attenuation and immunogenicity for several reasons. First, human cohort studies are often restricted to the analysis of the peripheral immune response. The upstream immunological events that occur at the site of vaccination and in draining lymph nodes, and with them the critical pathogensâ€“host interactions that prime the immune system toward a specific direction, remain inaccessible in human vaccinees. Second, capturing key immunological mechanisms and regulations that define immunogenicity require the performance of a back-to-back comparison of the immune responses induced by a given LAV and the virulent strain it is derived from or related to. However, for obvious ethical reasons, this is not possible in a cohort of human patients. Finally, more and more studies have provided evidence that age, immunological history and microbiota status can influence immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. Therefore, identifying the immunological regulations that define a specific immune response to an LAV, independently of inter-individual variations that may impact such responses, remains a very complex task.
