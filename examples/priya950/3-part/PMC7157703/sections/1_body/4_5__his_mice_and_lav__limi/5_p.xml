<p>Given the importance of the myeloid and NK compartment in priming adaptive immune responses, one area of improvement relies upon enhancing the human cytokine environment of the most recent models through the combined knock-in of multiple cytokines such as IL-6, IL-15, Flt3LG, TPO, IL-3, GM-CSF and M-CSF [

The co-engraftment of novel cytokine-enhanced HIS mice with human HSC, human thymus and/or ossicles would provide an optimal environment for lymphocyte education, maturation and priming and would be highly relevant for LAV research. Models combining superior myeloid engraftment (via human cytokine knock-in), mouse MHC knock-out and the transgenic expression of a large panel of human MHC class I and II could also represent a suitable alternative (
