<p>Finally, more and more evidence points to the role of the microbiota in regulating immune responses to vaccines [
 <xref rid="B338-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">338</xref>]. A recent study conducted in human vaccinees notably found that antibiotic treatment impairs IgA and IgG responses to H1N1 following influenza vaccination [

HIS mice present a significant advantage over humans for the study of the microbiota as their microbiome can be easily tracked and manipulated throughout the animalâ€™s life. Protocols have been recently developed to generate HIS mice engrafted with human microbiota [

 <xref rid="B341-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">341</xref>]. As we approach the role of the microbiota in regulating human health, the development of innovative HIS mouse models able to mount superior adaptive responses and co-engrafted with human microbiota would open notable opportunities to investigate LAV-induced immunity in a more relevant physiological context and to better understand microbiota-mediated regulation of immune priming (
