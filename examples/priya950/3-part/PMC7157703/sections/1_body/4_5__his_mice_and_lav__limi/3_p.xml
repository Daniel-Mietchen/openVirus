<p>While HIS mice are still a work in progress and will likely always be, models that have been emerging over the past five years represent a promising step forward in the development of better HIS mice for LAV research. For instance, models with enhanced myeloid and NK engraftment, such as the MISTRG [

 <xref rid="B332-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">332</xref>] or NFA2-HIS [
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], have been reported to display superior T and/or B cell activity upon microbial challenges than conventional models. Specifically, the NFA2-HIS mice provided a demonstration that enhancement of the human myeloid and NK compartment could promote a superior innate and adaptive immune response to an LAV in HIS mice [
