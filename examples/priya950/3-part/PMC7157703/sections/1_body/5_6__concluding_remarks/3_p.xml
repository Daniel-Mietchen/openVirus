<p>Although HIS mice will never be able to perfectly mimic human immune responses, recent model improvements have demonstrated that creating HIS mice able to mount more potent responses to LAV is possible. In the future, efforts will have to be directed toward the generation of HIS mice that can mount potent polyfunctional immune responses tightly regulated by different arms of the innate and adaptive immune system. The design and objective evaluation of models combining functional lymphoid structures with enhanced human cytokine environments, erythro-myeloid physiological engraftment and additional human-specific immunoregulators (such as the liver or microbiota) could be central to this endeavor.</p>
