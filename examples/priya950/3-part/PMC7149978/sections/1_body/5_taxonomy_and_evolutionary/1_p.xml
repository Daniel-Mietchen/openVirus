<p id="p0355">The flaviviruses form a well-defined genus based on shared antigenic and genetic properties. Many flaviviruses are important human pathogens, and most of these are zoonotic; in addition to dengue (DENV), the genus contains YF virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus is classified in the family Flaviviridae, which it shares with two other recognized genera, 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, and a newly proposed genus consisting of G Barker Virus (GBV) isolates. The family is defined by similar morphology, genome organization, and replication, although each genus is distinct in antigenic and other biological properties. The genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> is officially divided by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) into 14 serogroups, consisting of 53 formally recognized species but up to 74 reported viruses (

 <xref rid="bib346" ref-type="bibr">Wylie et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the dengue serotypes 1â€“4 are considered a single species even though they are genetically and antigenically quite distinct, because they have similar geographic distributions, host/vector associations, and disease syndromes.
