<p id="p0345">Another technology that might prove to be more effective is a human dengue vaccine. Immunization was the most cost-effective at US$2435 per DALY averted, compared to US$3368 per DALY averted for vector control of adult 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, and US$6883 per DALY for immunization, case management, and environmental controlâ€”all costs (

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a dengue vaccine in Southeast Asia, estimated at US$62.47 per DALY saved (in 2011 US$), is comparable to most favorable public health programs for children, which cost on average &lt;US$100 per DALY saved (in 2011 US$) (

The economic burden of dengue in the absence of any effective vaccine for the cohort was US$123.70 per 1000 population per year, of which 67% is due to DHF. The situation with the highest incidence of DHF and lower vaccine price in the public sector makes the vaccine the most cost-effective (
