<p id="p0305">Dengue represents a substantial economic and disease burden to communities and health systems in endemic countries, with a 30-fold increase in reported cases since the early 1960s. Factors that contribute to the increased incidence of dengue include the following: a rise in global commerce and tourism, population growth and rapid urbanization, inadequate water, sewer, and waste management systems, and inadequate vector control policies (

Economic burden estimation of dengue is critical to provide policymakers, researchers, developers, and drug and vaccine manufacturers, and donors with reliable and comparable measures to inform decisions about health policy, research, and health service priorities. Disease burden refers to the impact of a disease on mortality and morbidity in a population and is represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a nonmonetary index that estimates a personâ€™s years of life lost due to premature mortality.
