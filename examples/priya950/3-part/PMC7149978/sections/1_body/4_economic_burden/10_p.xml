<p id="p0350">A drug that would help reduce symptoms and possible mortality would be a valuable and complementary tool for reducing the health and economic burden of dengue. Researchers have been testing several antiviral drugs. While the latest published results—like earlier ones—have proved disappointing, there have been notable advances in recent years. Although the need for such therapeutic agents would be reduced if effective preventive measures (vaccination and vector control) are developed and implemented, the remaining need and demand are still substantial. This quantification of the economic burden will contribute toward better decisions about the current, and promising new preventive and curative approaches to reduce the burden of dengue (
