<p id="p0340">Vector control is currently the only intervention against dengue. However, ineffective vector control programs allowed the spread of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species and with it dengue illness. Community-based dengue control programs alone or in combination with other control activities can enhance the effectiveness of dengue control programs (
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">Heintze et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, insecticide resistance is a challenge that can lead to failure of dengue control programs and complicates the control activities further by increasing the magnitude of future dengue epidemics. Economic analysis of other dengue control technologies under development, such as genetics-based sterile insect methods, infection of mosquitoes with Wolbachia, and vaccination, are important to guide investment for these technologies, policy formulation, adaptation, and adoption of these technologies, and thereby mitigate the economic and burden of dengue illness in the future (
