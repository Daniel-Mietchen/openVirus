<p id="p0405">Mature DENV particles have a diameter of ~500 Å with an electron-dense core surrounded by a lipid bilayer, in which two transmembrane viral proteins are inserted forming a glycoprotein shell. The core contains the nucleocapsid formed by the viral RNA genome in complex with multiple copies of the capsid protein. The glycoprotein shell is well defined and consists of 180 copies of the envelope (E) and membrane protein (prM/M). The E protein is found as 90 head-to-tail homodimers that lie flat on the viral surface forming a smooth protein shell (
 <xref rid="bib186" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2002</xref>). The M protein is a small proteolytic fragment of its precursor prM that after cleavage of “pr” peptide during viral maturation remains as a transmembrane protein beneath the E protein shell. Inside the lipid bilayer, there is a low-density gap of ~12 Å followed by the density contributed by the capsid protein with the viral genome.
