<p id="p0985">There is little to no effective vector control in many dengue-endemic countries. Even where robust programs are implemented, the disease remains an ongoing risk (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Elder and Ballenger-Browning, 2009</xref>). Vector control tools are limited in number and not as efficacious as needed. The logistical challenges associated with insecticide applications (adulticides and larvicides), the primary tools used for vector control, result from the need for these agents to come in direct contact with the target vector. In large urban settings the scale and timing of applications are impractical, especially where resources are limited. Furthermore, many protocols show no benefit to disease control. The ineffectiveness of these efforts is due in part to insufficient monitoring and a lack of well-designed programs but is exacerbated by the rise in the level of insecticide resistance.
