 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ashour et al., 2009</xref>). DENV RNA synthesis requires specific interaction of NS5 with the SLA structure present at the 5′ end of the viral genome. Both the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the RNA were necessary for polymerase activity. NS5 also has terminal transferase activity, which can interfere with in vitro studies to analyze the ability of the NS5 protein to copy RNA from a template. Specificity for NS5 RNA synthesis was provided by viral sequences present at the 5′ end of the genome, and that 3′ UTR elements were not necessary to promote RNA synthesis in vitro (
