 <xref rid="bib234" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2012</xref>) is found to interact with virus-induced vesicles inside the cell, secreted to the cell surface, or released into the bloodstream of infected individuals (

 <xref rid="bib341" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et al., 1988</xref>). It is thought to play an important role in virus replication because it is shown to colocalize with the viral RNA RC. Secreted NS1 (sNS1) is highly immunogenic and is involved in stimulating protective response against DENV (
 <xref rid="bib214" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie et al., 1996</xref>). It has been implicated in the early stages of flavivirus RNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">Lindenbach and Rice, 1997</xref>). This protein exists in multiple oligomeric forms and is found in different cellular locations. It can be associated with vesicular compartments, found in the cell surface or secreted and colocalizes with the RCs together with dsRNA, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 in VPs (
