 <italic>NS5</italic> is the viral enzyme responsible for RNA capping and RNA synthesis of positive and negative RNA strands (

 <xref rid="bib350" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2007</xref>). It is the largest and the most conserved of the viral proteins and contains an N-terminal

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 2002</xref>) NS5 specifically copies the viral RNA. This specificity depends on a viral RNA structure that acts as a promoter present at the 5′ end of the viral genome, known as SLA (
