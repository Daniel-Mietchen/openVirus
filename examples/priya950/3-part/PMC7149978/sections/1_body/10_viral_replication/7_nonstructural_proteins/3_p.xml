 <italic>NS2A</italic> (~22 kDa) is a small hydrophobic integral membrane protein that has been implicated in viral RNA synthesis, viral particle assembly (
 <xref rid="bib347" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). NS2A is an essential component of the replicase and also an inhibitor of interferon (IFN) production. Two forms of this protein (NS2A and NS2Aa) are observed as a result of an internal cleavage by the viral NS2B–NS3 protease. This suggests a physical interaction between NS2A and NS3. Interactions between NS2A and NS5 and with RNA transcripts of the 3′ UTR have also been suggested (
