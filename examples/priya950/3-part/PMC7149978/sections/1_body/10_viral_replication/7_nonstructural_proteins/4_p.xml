 <italic>NS2B</italic> protein has 130 residues produced by posttranslational cleavage of the NS2B–NS3 protease at its terminal ends. NS2B is predicted to comprise three hydrophobic regions that span the membrane. In addition, a short and highly conserved hydrophilic stretch of residues (amino acids 49–95) is involved in the catalytic activation of the NS3 protease by acting as a cofactor (
