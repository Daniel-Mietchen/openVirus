<p id="p0965">Detect early plasma leakage and volume replacement is indicated. The principle of volume replacement in DHF/DSS patients is to give the minimal amount to maintain effective circulation (intravascular volume). Intravenous fluid has to be similar to the plasma that has been lost into the pleural and peritoneal spaces, for example, normal saline solution (NSS), lactate ringer solution, acetate ringer. The total volume replacement during the critical period is about maintenance (M)+5% deficit (D) (~4.6 L in adult), and the estimated total duration is ~36–60 hours. Intravenous fluid is to be given only in those patients who enter the critical period (
