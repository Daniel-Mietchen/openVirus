<p id="p1120">Given the complexity of dengue disease pathogenesis, it is critical to establish a set of characteristics that an ideal drug for treatment of DF should possess. Briefly, an effective drug must be active against all four dengue serotypes. It should be an oral drug, because it is the least expensive form to manufacture and distribution, an important consideration for a disease endemic in developing countries. The drug ideally would be effective with once a day dosing, but for acute dengue, a dosing frequency as often as three times a day, if needed to maintain drug levels above a minimally effective concentration, would be acceptable.</p>
