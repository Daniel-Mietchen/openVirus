Similarly, peptide-based inhibitors that target the stem region of the E protein or therapeutic antibodies that bind to E domain III (DIII) or other parts of the E ectodomain can neutralize the virus in cell-based infections assays. mAbs against E protein domain III that potently neutralized dengue infection that are either serotype-specific or cross-reactive (
