<p id="p1060">Protection of water storage containers will eliminate the breeding source and reliable water supply should eliminate the need to store water, but in many communities, storage is a cultural habit, reinforced by failures of the piped supply. Intermittent use of stored water will enhance mosquito production if vessels accumulate leaves and other litter as sources of larval nutrition. Personal protection should be maintained using screens, bed nets, mosquito repellents, and antimosquito sound devices.</p>
