<p id="p1050">Control of adults is being achieved using residual insecticides. Insecticides that are chemically stable can be applied as a residue to surfaces onto which mosquitoes alight. Transient contact with these residues may be sufficient to kill susceptible insects. “Fogging” and other aerosol treatments are used where insecticidal aerosols are widely used for mosquito control. It is generally accepted that the mosquito must be in flight to collide with enough particles to kill it. For this reason, such aerosols are only effective while the particles are airborne for a short time period (
