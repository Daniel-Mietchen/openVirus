<p id="p1075">Some strategies are designed to be resilient to the immigration of wild mosquitoes originating temporally and spatially. Others have the potential to lower population densities below the transmission threshold of one or more vector-borne pathogens. These genetic-based tools offer access to mosquito breeding sites that would otherwise be inaccessible or cryptic using conventional tools. Genetic approaches in principle should be safer than vector control strategies employing insecticides. Strains can be designed to lower or minimize vector competence for all known pathogens transmitted by the targeted species and increase insecticide susceptibility (
