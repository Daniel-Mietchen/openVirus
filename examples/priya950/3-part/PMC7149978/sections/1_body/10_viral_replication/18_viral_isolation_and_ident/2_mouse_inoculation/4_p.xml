 <italic>Mosquito cell culture</italic>: Mosquito cell lines developed in the 1970s and 1980s provide sensitive systems for DENV isolation. Three cell lines have commonly been used: AP-61 from 
 <italic>Aedes pseudoscutellaris</italic>, C6/36 from 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> and TRA-284 from 
 <italic>T. amboinensis</italic>. Although TRA-284 is the most sensitive cell line, C6/36 is more widely used. Identification can also be done by plaque reduction neutralisation assay (PRNT) and RT/PCR. Viruses may also be identified using serotype-specific mAbs in an indirect immunofluorescence test. An antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used in the absence of a fluorescence microscope. More recently, flow cytometry as well as NS1 detection have been employed for DENV identification (
