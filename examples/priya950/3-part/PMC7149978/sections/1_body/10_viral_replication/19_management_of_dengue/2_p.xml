<p id="p0925">Management of patients in the febrile phase is mostly symptomatic and supportive treatment. Dengue patients usually have high sustained fever ranging from 2 to 7 days, mean duration 4â€“5 days. Common signs and symptoms are severe headache, retro-orbital pain, body ache (myalgia), arthralgia/joint pain, and minor bleeding manifestations, such as petechiae, epistaxis, gum bleeding, and coffee-ground vomiting. Hematemesis and melena are commonly found. Hemoglobinuria is not uncommon, especially in thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy or G-6-PD deficiency patients.
