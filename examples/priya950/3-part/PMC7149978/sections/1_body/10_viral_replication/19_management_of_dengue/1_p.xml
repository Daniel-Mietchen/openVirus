<p id="p0920">Management of suspected dengue patients depends on the clinical illness, of which there are three phases: febrile, critical (leakage), and convalescence. The convalescent phase can be further divided into early (&gt;24–36 hours after shock or &gt;48–60 hours after leakage) and late convalescence (&gt;36 hours after shock or 60 hours after leakage). The three latter disease manifestations, DHF (DHF grades I and II), DSS (DHF grades III and IV), and expanded dengue syndrome, are considered severe because they may lead to complications and death if there is not appropriate and timely management. DHF and DSS patients are different from DF patients in that they have plasma leakage during the critical phase (

The percentage of DHF/DSS patients is also minimal compared to viral-like illness and DF patients, but it is very important that clinician/healthcare personnel diagnose and properly manage these patients in order to prevent shock, severe illness, complications, and death.
