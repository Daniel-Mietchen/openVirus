 <italic>Capsid</italic> (12 kDa) is a highly charged basic protein. It is detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (

The disordered N-terminal end and α1 are highly positively charged. This is followed by hydrophobic helices a2 and a3, and the amphipathic α4. The highly charged N-terminal end and α4 could be important for RNA binding (
