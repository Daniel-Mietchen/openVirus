<p id="p1135">Following entry into the cell the dengue viral mRNA is recognized by the host translational machinery to produce the polyprotein that is processed into mature structural and NS proteins by the action of host proteases resident in the ER lumen and the viral NS2B/NS3 protease in the cytoplasm. Active site–directed tetrapeptide and tripeptide inhibitors were synthesized to probe the dynamics of the DENV protease active site with different functional groups that compete with the substrate. These active site serine-trap inhibitors contained either boronic acid, trifluoromethylketone, or aldehyde as the electrophilic warhead (
 <xref rid="bib277" ref-type="bibr">Schuller et al., 2011</xref>) and showed potent protease inhibitor activity against DENV-1–4 NS2B/NS3 protease as well as other flaviviral proteases, thus demonstrating that pan-dengue or pan-flaviviral protease inhibitors can be developed (

Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers that specifically inhibit viral RNA translation or viral RNA synthesis by mimicking the 5′ SL or 3′SL, respectively, have been investigated (
