<p id="p0700">DENV has been shown to trigger complement activation in vitro and in vivo (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Avirutnan et al., 2006</xref>). Complement likely functions to limit DENV infection by stimulating adaptive immune responses and by neutralizing infection. FcÎ³R engagement by antibodies in vitro and in vivo can paradoxically enhance replication of DENV (
