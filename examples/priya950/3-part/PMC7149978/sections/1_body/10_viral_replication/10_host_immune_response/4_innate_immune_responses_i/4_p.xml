<p id="p0710">Type I IFN production cascade is triggered after virus infection, because the sensors for this cascade, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and cytoplasmic receptors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG I) and MDA5, or RIG I–like receptors (RLRs) can detect virus-specific elements (PAMPs) and initiate the cascade (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ashour et al., 2010</xref>). The activation of this cascade results in the production of IFNα and IFNβ (type I IFNs) by cells and the subsequent secretion of these antiviral cytokines that can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner by binding to the IFNαβ receptors and triggering the IFN signaling cascade; this culminates in the activation of ISGs-containing IFN-stimulated response elements that have antiviral activity (

 <xref rid="bib236" ref-type="bibr">Nasirudeen et al., 2011</xref>). Several DENV proteins had been identified as inhibitors of type I IFN signaling. By inhibiting both the detection and effector arms of this important pathway, the virus can stop the production of type I IFNs that would trigger the induction of hundreds of ISGs. Also DENV can inhibit the production of type I IFN in infected primary human cells, such as monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages. This inhibition is mediated by an active protease complex (NS2B3) which targets a key host factor, STING (also named MITA) (
 <xref rid="bib233" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2012</xref>). STING is an adaptor molecule for type I IFN production that mediates the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3, which then translocates to the nucleus and participates in the activation of the IFNβ promoter. In addition to the direct effects on viral replication, by inhibiting type I IFN production in human DCs, DENV may affect the quality of the adaptive immune response generated after infection.
