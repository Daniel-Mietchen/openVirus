<p id="p0665">There are a number of ways in which antibodies can protect from viral infection; in simple terms, antibodies may block adhesion to a cellular receptor, block fusion with host cell membranes, or alternatively destroy virus or virus-infected cells via complement or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, antibody may opsonize virus and direct it for disposal via Fc receptorâ€“mediated uptake.</p>
