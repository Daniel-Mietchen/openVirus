<p id="p0660">ADE is therefore a phenomenon of failed neutralization where the density of antibody binding is insufficient to cause neutralization but large enough to pass the threshold required to direct opsonized virions to Fc receptor–mediated internalization. ADE has been demonstrated to increase virus replication in primate models following passive transfer of polyclonal human serum or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (

Anti-prM antibodies show poor neutralization and typically, even at high concentrations, neutralization plateaus at 30%–50%. The reason for this is likely to do with virus maturation; fully mature virus particles do not contain prM and are thus not neutralized, whereas many partially mature virus particles contain enough prM to bind antibody and drive ADE but do not have enough prM epitopes to allow sufficient antibody density for neutralization. Furthermore, virions with high levels of prM are not infectious but can be driven to infect cells by ADE with anti-prM antibodies (
