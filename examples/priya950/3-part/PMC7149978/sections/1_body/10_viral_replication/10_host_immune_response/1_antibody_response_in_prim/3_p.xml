<p id="p0655">ADE was proposed by Halstead and O’Rourke to explain the increase in severity seen in secondary dengue infections. This proposes that due to the large sequence diversity in DENVs, antibody made to the primary infecting virus will not be of sufficient avidity or titer to neutralize a secondary infecting virus. Instead these low avidity cross-reactive antibodies may opsonize the virus and lead to its targeting FcR bearing cells such as macrophage/monocytes, leading to internalization and increased virus replication. Fc-RIa and Fc-RIIa have been shown to promote ADE and cytoplasmic domains that contain immuno-tyrosine activation motifs are essential for this function by promoting endocytosis of immune complexes (
