<p id="p0690">Many of the T cells induced in the secondary infection showed poor responses to secondary infecting virus and T cells in DHF produced more cytokines and showed less degranulation than in DF, where T cells showed much higher levels of degranulation in the absence of cytokine production (

High levels of TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, TGF-b1, MCP-1, MIF, soluble TNFR-I, soluble TNFR-II, CXCL-9, CXCL-10, CXCL-11, and RANTES have been recorded, and many of these can be the products of activated T cells (

Immunopathology is being increasingly recognized in a number of viral diseases where the protective antiviral response, although capable of controlling a virus, may cause considerable inflammation and tissue damage that can in some instances be fatal (
