<p id="p0670">How an antibody blocks viral entry is being explained by a number of theories of which the two being prominent are the single-hit model and multiple-hit model. The single-hit model proposes that interaction of antibody with a single or small number of critical epitopes may lock the virus into a conformation that prevents infection (

The multiple-hit model conversely proposes that rather than there being critical epitopes, neutralization is achieved when a proportion of the virion surface is occluded by antibody, thus interfering with viral attachment and/or fusion (
