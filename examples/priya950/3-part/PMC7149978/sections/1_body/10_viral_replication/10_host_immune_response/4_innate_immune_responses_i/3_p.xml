<p id="p0705">Antibody and complement-dependent opsonization may augment DENV infection in myeloid cells. In early clinical studies, reduced levels of C3, C4, and factor B, and increased catabolic rates of C3 and C1q were observed, particularly in patients with severe DENV disease during secondary infection (

DENV-infected cells may display sufficient amounts of DENV antigens (prM, E, or NS1 proteins) on their surface to facilitate immune complex formation and complement deposition. Indeed, DENV-infected endothelial cells activate human complement in the presence of antibodies resulting in C5b-9 deposition (
