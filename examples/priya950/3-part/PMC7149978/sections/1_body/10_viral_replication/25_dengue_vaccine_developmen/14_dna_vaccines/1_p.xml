<p id="p1235">DNA vaccines consist of a plasmid or plasmids containing dengue genes reproduced to high copy number in bacteria such as

 <xref rid="bib335" ref-type="bibr">Whalen, 1996</xref>). The plasmid contains a eukaryotic promoter and termination sequence to drive transcription in the vaccine recipient. The transcribed RNA is translated to produce proteins to be processed and presented to the immune system in the context of MHC molecules. Additional genes such as intracellular trafficking and immunostimulatory sequences can be added to the plasmid. The target organismâ€™s immune system recognizes the expressed antigen, and generates antibodies and/or cell-mediated immune responses. DNA-based vaccine constructs can be modified without the need for subsequent viability as required when working with infectious clones. DNA vaccines afford numerous advantages over conventional vaccines, including ease of production, stability, and transport at room temperature, and they provide a possibility to immunize against multiple pathogens with a single vaccine. Workers at the US Naval Medical Research Institute evaluated two eukaryotic plasmid expression vectors (pkCMVint-Polyli and pVR1012,) expressing the PrM protein and 92% of the E protein for DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain). Both constructs induced neutralizing antibody in all mice (
