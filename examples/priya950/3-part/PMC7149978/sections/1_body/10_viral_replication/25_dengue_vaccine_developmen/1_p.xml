<p id="p1150">The potential use of safe and effective dengue vaccines is a very attractive dengue control in addition to vector control. Even if only partially effective, the use of dengue vaccines could be highly beneficial in blunting dengue epidemics, and for increasing population-level immunity to the level where vector control could be more effective (
 <xref rid="bib134" ref-type="bibr">Halstead and Deen, 2002</xref>). Dengue vaccines could have beneficial individual-level effects by reducing the probability of infection given exposure to an infected mosquito, that is, vaccine efficacy (VE) for susceptibility to infection, reducing the probability of clinical disease given infection or the probability of severe disease, that is, VE for disease progression, or reducing the probability that an infected vaccinated person will transmit virus to a mosquito that bites him or her, that is, VE for direct transmission.
