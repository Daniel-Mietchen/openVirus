<p id="p1180">They developed vaccines that contained molecularly attenuated viruses, a DENV-4 mutant (DENV-4 2AD30), transcribed from recombinant cDNA, with a 30-nucleotide deletion in the 3′ UTR (10,478–10,507), produced lower viremia and slightly decreased neutralizing antibody responses compared with wild-type DENV-4 (

To make recombinant (r) DENV-2/4 D30(ME), the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine rDENV-4 D30 were those of DENV-2 NGC. Yet another approach uses a capsid-deleted WNV vector to produce DENV pseudoinfectious derivatives (
