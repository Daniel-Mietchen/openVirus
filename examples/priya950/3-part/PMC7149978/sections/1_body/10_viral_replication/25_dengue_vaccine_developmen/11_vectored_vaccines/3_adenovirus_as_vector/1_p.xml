<p id="p1215">At least two laboratories have developed second-generation adenovirus complex vectors to express and present dengue antigen. Two constructs were developed, one with prM and E genes of DENV-1 and -2, and the other with the same genes of DENV-3 and -4. These vaccines were mixed and given to a large group of rhesus monkeys. Twenty percent of animals raised tetravalent-neutralizing antibodies following one dose, but 100% developed high-titered neutralizing antibodies when boosted with a second dose 3 months later. When challenged with live DENV-1–4 at 1 or 6 months, all animals were protected against DENV-1–3, with moderate protection to DENV-4 challenge (
