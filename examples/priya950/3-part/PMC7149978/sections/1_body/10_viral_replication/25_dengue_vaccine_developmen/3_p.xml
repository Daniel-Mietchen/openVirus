<p id="p1160">A potential vaccine must provide a delicate balance between the level of immunogenicity it evokes and the attenuation of DENV pathogenicity. The immunogenicity induced by the vaccine should be such that the level of neutralizing antibodies produced is high enough to provide complete protection against all four serotypes, but also sufficiently attenuated so as not to cause unacceptable pathogenicity (underattenuation) or fail to induce an effective immune response (overattenuation) (
