<p id="p0585">Halstead proposed that DENVs share common immunodominant epitopes due to their amino acid identity which may be 60%–70% between the four serotypes which was termed as “sequential infection” (

Genetic changes in certain viral strains confers in them greater virulence compared to others and is probably the reason for variation in severity of dengue epidemics as per then-proposed alternate hypothesis called the “virus virulence” hypothesis (
 <xref rid="bib266" ref-type="bibr">Rosen, 1977</xref>) and is supported by the several studies. DENV virulence is often tightly linked to host immune status, and it is particularly difficult to separate the role of viral versus host factors, including host genetics (
