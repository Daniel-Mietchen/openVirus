<p id="p0620">Host genetics play a vital role in susceptibility to DENV infection and studies show that people with an African ancestry have a reduced risk of developing severe disease as compared to those with European ancestry (

Highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been proposed to have an association with either disease susceptibility or protection (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Coffey et al., 2009</xref>). HLA-A*0203 was associated with less severe disease irrespective of the infecting serotype, whereas HLA-A*0207 was associated with more severe disease only in patients with secondary DENV-1 and DENV-2. In contrast, HLA-A*B51 was associated with more severe disease irrespective of serotype, and HLA-A*B52 was associated with a less severe disease phenotype in secondary infections with DENV-1 and DENV-2. In addition, various HLA-B alleles (B44, B62, B76, and B77) appeared to protect against the development of clinical disease from secondary DENV infection (
