<p id="p0635">Host immune response is considered to contribute to many of the clinical complications associated with severe dengue. Capillary permeability develops at a time when the viral burden is in sharp decline, arguing against a direct virus mediated effect on the vascular endothelium. Further, the most severe complication of capillary permeability, DSS, manifests when many patients have low or undetectable viremia levels and are already or very nearly afebrile (

A second line of evidence in support of the immune pathogenesis model of severe dengue lies in the observation that the vast majority of severe dengue complications occur in patients with immunological evidence of a previous history of DENV exposure or, in the case of infants, those with maternally acquired anti-DENV antibody.
