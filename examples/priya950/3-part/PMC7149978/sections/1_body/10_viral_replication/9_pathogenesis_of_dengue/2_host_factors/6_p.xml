<p id="p0640">Production of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells during the course of infection is a key mechanistic process of capillary permeability and that the vasodilatory potential of some cytokines that occur in elevated concentrations during acute dengue and are linked to endothelial cell dysfunction. This hypothesis of a “cytokine storm”-mediating capillary permeability supports the ADE hypothesis (greater virus burden) with the concept of immune activation of memory, cross-reactive T cells in secondary infection.</p>
