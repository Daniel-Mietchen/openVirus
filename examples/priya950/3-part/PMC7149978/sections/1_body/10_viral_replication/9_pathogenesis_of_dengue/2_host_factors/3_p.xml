<p id="p0625">Several other gene polymorphisms are also associated with DENV infection few such are tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-308A allele and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of DENV infection (

 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>) and increased frequency of the transforming growth factor - beta 1 (TGF-β1) 509 CC genotype in cases of DHF, as compared to the milder DF (

 <xref rid="bib209" ref-type="bibr">Loke et al., 2002</xref>). They also showed that homozygotes for the arginine variant at position 131 of the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) II gene appeared to be protected from the development of severe DENV infection. Viral binding to platelets via human platelet antigens may result in the thrombocytopenia observed in severe infection. The G allele of DC-SIGN1-336 appears to protect against milder DENV infection, DF, but not against more serious disease (
