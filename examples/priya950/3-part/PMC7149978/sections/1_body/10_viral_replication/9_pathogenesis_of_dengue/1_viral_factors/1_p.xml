<p id="p0580">Viral virulence is influenced by viral genetics (which is “intrinsic” to the virus) and by host factors such as preexisting immunity and host genetics (factors that are “extrinsic” to the virus). Certain DENV strains demonstrate greater epidemic potential, as they replicate better either in humans or in the mosquito vector and, therefore, have the potential to displace strains with lower relative replicative ability in either host. Enhanced replication in mosquitoes may contribute to global spread and success of a strain due to faster dissemination in the mosquito and a shorter extrinsic incubation period (

Also cross-reactive immune responses in human populations may also confer a selective advantage to particular clades or genotypes of DENV, such that strains capable of evading host adaptive immune responses are able to outcompete other strains in the population (
