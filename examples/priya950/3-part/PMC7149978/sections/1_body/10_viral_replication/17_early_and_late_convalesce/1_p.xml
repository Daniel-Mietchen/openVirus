<p id="p0865">Dengue viremia correlates with fever onset, with peak levels at 2â€“3 days of fever. After this period, viremia as well as sNS1 diminishes, coinciding with antibody development. Serology is the method of choice for late and acute convalescent diagnosis. Specific IgM detection as well as high levels of specific IgG in a monoserum allows confirmation of a probable and recent infection, while IgM and/or IgG seroconversion or fourfold increase of IgG titers in paired sera allow infection confirmation (
