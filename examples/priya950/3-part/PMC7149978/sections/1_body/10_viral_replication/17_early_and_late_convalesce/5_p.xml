<p id="p0885">IgG seroconversion (a fourfold increase in titer) is a criterion for dengue diagnosis. Innis et al. applied IgM and IgG capture ELISA to detect both immunoglobulins, defining a primary case by optical density ratios of IgM/IgG 3 1.78 and a secondary dengue infection by ratios &lt;1.78. Kuno et al. using an indirect ELISA, reported IgM/IgG ratios &gt;1.4 as primary infection and &lt;1.4 as secondary infection.</p>
