Diagnostic markers to be studied during a dengue infection depend on the time of the infection, the immune response, and the methods and techniques to be used. During the early stages of illness, virus isolation, antigen, and nucleic acid detection can be used to diagnose the infection. Serology is the method of choice for diagnosis at the end of the acute phase of illness. Once an individual is bitten by an infected mosquito, an incubation period of 4–10 days ensues. Viremia is observed 2–3 days before fever onset to 5–6 days after onset. During the viremic period, virus can be isolated and RNA and sNS1 protein can be detected.
