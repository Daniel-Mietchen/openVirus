<p id="p0825">Depending on the number of infections, the individual develops a primary, secondary, tertiary, or a quaternary response to infection. Antidengue IgM antibodies are detected in most of cases 5–6 days after onset of fever and usually for 60–90 days, but sometimes up to 6 months (
 <xref rid="bib190" ref-type="bibr">Kuno et al., 1998</xref>). In primary infections, IgG antibody begins to appear a few days after the IgM antibody, usually at days 7–9 of fever. Antibody titers continue to rise slowly over a period of weeks and remain detectable probably for a lifetime. In secondary infections, IgG antibody rapidly rises almost immediately after fever onset, with high levels in most patients IgM antibody as well as a high titer of IgG in a single serum are used as markers of a recent dengue infection. The detection of a fourfold IgG or IgM increase or antibody seroconversion in paired sera is considered to be confirmatory for infection. Depending on the time of collection, they can be tested for virus/RNA/antigen detection or for serological studies.
