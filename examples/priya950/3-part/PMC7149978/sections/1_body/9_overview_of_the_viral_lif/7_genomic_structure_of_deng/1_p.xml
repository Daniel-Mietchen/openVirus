<p id="p0445">The DENV genome consists of a single, positive-strand RNA of ~11 kb. A type I cap is present at the 5′ end, followed by the conserved dinucleotide 5′-AG-3′ (

 <xref rid="bib332" ref-type="bibr">Wengler and Wengler, 1981</xref>). The genome encodes a single ORF flanked by highly structured 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The 5′and 3′ terminal RNA sequences of the genome form large stem loop structures known as stem loop A (SLA) and 3′ stem loop (3′ SL), respectively, both essential for viral replication. The 5′ UTR sequences of the four DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) are between 95 to 101 nucleotides long, while the 3′ UTRs range from 470 nucleotides in the case of DENV-1 to ~385 nucleotides in DENV-4. An important feature of DENV and other flavivirus genomes is the presence of inverted complementary sequences (CSs) at the ends of the RNA. These sequences mediate long-range RNA–RNA interactions and cyclization of the viral genome (
