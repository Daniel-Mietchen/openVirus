<p id="p0450">Inverted CSs have been suggested to allow the ends of the genome to associate through base pairing, leading to circular conformations of the RNA. DENV-5′ CS element was found within the coding sequence of capsid, and its CS 3′ CS was identified within the 3′ UTR, just upstream of the conserved 3′ SL. Additional inverted complementary nucleotides, besides the original 5′–3′ CS, were noticed using folding prediction algorithms (

A sequence located just upstream of the translation initiator AUG at the 5′ UTR of DENV was found to be complementary to a region present within the stem of the 3′ SL. This pair of CSs was named cyclization sequence 5′–3′ UAR (the name stands for upstream AUG region) (
