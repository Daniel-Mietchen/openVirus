<p id="p0415">DENV enters host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which involves binding of E to cellular receptors. DENV must recognize a ubiquitous cell surface molecule or utilize multiple receptors for cell entry. The interaction of E with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate, at the cell surface and also several other surface proteins is implicated in the process of internalization such as heat-shock proteins 90 and 70, GRP78 (BiP) (
