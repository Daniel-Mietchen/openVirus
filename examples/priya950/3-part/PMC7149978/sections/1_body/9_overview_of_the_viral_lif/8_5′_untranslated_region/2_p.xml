<p id="p0465">The 5′ CS is 11 nucleotides long (134-UCAAUAUGCUG) and is absolutely conserved among the four DENV serotypes. This region mediates long-range RNA–RNA interactions between the ends of the genome and is essential for viral RNA replication. The cHP was originally described as an element that regulates the start codon selection during protein synthesis. RNA structures located within the protein coding sequence were found to play a regulatory role in DENV replication (
