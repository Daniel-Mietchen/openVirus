<p id="p0460">Alignment of the 5′ UTRs from different DENV serotypes shows high sequence conservation. RNA-folding predictions of these sequences indicate the formation of a large 5′ terminal SLA followed by a smaller stem loop structure [stem loop B (SLB)]. SLB ends in the translation initiation AUG codon and contains the CS 5′ UAR. These two stem loop structures are separated by a short oligo(U) sequence. SLA portion of DENV genome shows three helical regions (S1, S2, and S3), a side stem loop (SSL) and a top loop (TL), and these structures play important role in viral replication. Between the SLA and the SLB structures, there is an oligo(U) track conserved in DENV and other flavivirus genomes that functions as spacer that enhances viral RNA synthesis (

This region, which is ~100 nucleotides long, contains three important RNA elements: (1) the highly conserved 5′ CS, which is complementary to the 3′ CS present at the viral 3′ UTR; (2) a stable hairpin known as capsid region hairpin (cHP); and (3) an RNA element that modulates DENV replication in mosquito and mammalian cells (
