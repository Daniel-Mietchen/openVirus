<p id="p0435">The process of replication begins with the synthesis of a complementary negative-strand RNA, which serves as template for the amplification of additional positive-strand genomic RNA. The enzymatic reaction is catalyzed by NS5, in association with NS3, other viral NS proteins, and presumably host factors. The newly synthesized genomes can be used for translation of more viral proteins or associate with capsid to generate new viral particles. Capsid distributes between ER membranes, nucleus, and the surface of lipid droplets (
