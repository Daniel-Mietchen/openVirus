<p id="p0475">In DENV the 3′ SL contains a total of 93 nucleotides. The long stem is interrupted by mismatches in conserved locations, a six-nucleotide bulge is predicted near the top, and the loop contains seven nucleotides. Between serotypes there are few nucleotide variations in this region. Specific nucleotides of the 3′ SL interact with other RNA elements of the viral genome to provide the correct conformation for initiation of RNA synthesis. It is also possible that the 3′SL provides a recognition site for protein binding during assembly of the RNA RC (
