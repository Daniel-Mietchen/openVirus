<p id="p0440">Once formed, the nucleocapsid buds into the ER lumen acquiring the lipid bilayer, together with the viral E and prM proteins. The newly produced particles travel through the secretory pathway. Furin-mediated proteolysis of prM in the trans-Golgi network triggers rearrangement, homodimerization of E, and formation of mature viral particles (
