<p id="p0420">DENV particles diffuse along the cell surface toward a preexisting clathrin-coated pit. With the aid of dynamin, the clathrin-coated pit evolves to a clathrin-coated vesicle, and this virus-containing vesicle is delivered to early endosomes, which subsequently mature into late endosomes. Upon internalization and acidification of the endosome, fusion of viral and vesicular membranes mediated by conformational changes in the E protein (
