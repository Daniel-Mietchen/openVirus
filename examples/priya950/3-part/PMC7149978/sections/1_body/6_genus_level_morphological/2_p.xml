<p id="p0365">Flavivirus genomic RNA serves as the only viral messenger RNA. Translation of the complete polyprotein begins at the first or a second AUG codon of the ORF. The polyprotein is cleaved at conserved sites by either the viral serine protease (NS2B/NS3), a host-derived signalase, except for pr/M, which is cleaved after assembly by host-derived furin or a furin-like protease.</p>
