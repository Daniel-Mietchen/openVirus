<p id="p0360">All the Flaviviridae are spherical enveloped viruses with single-protein capsids, two to three membrane proteins (two in the flaviviruses, envelope and membrane), and single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) genomes lacking poly A tails at the 3′ end. The Flaviviridae genome has single open reading frame (ORF) which is translated single complete polyprotein, with RNA helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The ORF is flanked by two noncoding regions. The flavivirus genome is ~11 kb in length. The coding region of flaviviruses includes, in the following order of three structural genes encoding for the proteins capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM, cleaved to membrane protein M during maturation) and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural (NS) genes encoding for NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. NS2B and NS3 form the protease, and NS3 also has helicase and RNA triphosphatase activity; NS5 is the RdRp and also has methyltransferase activity (
