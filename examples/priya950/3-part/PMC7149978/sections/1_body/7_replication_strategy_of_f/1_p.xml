<p id="p0370">Flavivirus replication ensues in the cytoplasm on host endoplasmic reticular (ER) membranes that are modified into vesicular packets where replication probably occurs. Full-length complementary negative-sense RNA strands are produced that serve as templates for the positive-sense genome copies. Flavivirus assembly into virus particles probably occurs on the rough ER (RER), where they acquire their membranes. Virus particles mature as they pass through the host secretory system and exocytosis pathway by the cleavage of prM to M, eventually budding off the host cell. Interestingly, virions may be released that are coated with a mixture of both mature (cleaved) and immature (uncleaved) M/prM proteins.</p>
