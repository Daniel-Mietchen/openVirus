<p id="p0385">Most flaviviruses are zoonotic, transmitted to humans from animals via vectors such as ticks or mosquitoes, suggesting that they retain the evolutionary capacity to host-switch in spite of phylogenetic patterns (
 <xref rid="bib213" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie and Williams, 2009</xref>). Genome observations for the different flaviviral groups further support host- and/or vector-specific adaptations. Within the TBFV, viruses cluster according to antigenic groups and host associations, which are tightly correlated. Associated more closely with the TBFV than the MBFV is the lineage of flaviviruses restricted to vertebrates or with NKV. Within the MBFV, viruses are phylogenetically subdivided largely in keeping with their antigenic groups.
