 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is most likely of African origin for the following reasons. First, there are no closely related 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> species in the Americas, whereas there are numerous such species of the same subgenus in both the Ethiopian and Oriental regions. Second, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> occurs in Africa as a widespread feral species, breeding in the forest, independent of humans. It is primarily an urban species in both of these regions and only rarely occurs in the absence of man. Current thinking is that 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> had an African origin and had adapted to the peridomestic environment, breeding in water storage containers in West African villages prior to the slave trade, which provided the mechanism for the species to be introduced to the New World. By 1800, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> had already become established in many large tropical cites around the world, especially in port cities in Asia and the New World. 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> did not become the predominant 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> species in many noncoastal cities until during and after the Second World War (
