<p id="p0275">The current global pandemic of DF/DHF began in the Asia during the Second World War, when both the viruses and the mosquito vector, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, were spread widely throughout the regions (
 <xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 1992</xref>). During the war, existing water systems were destroyed, and water was stored for domestic use as well as for fire control. Military equipment and junk were left behind, making ideal larval habitats for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. The movement of equipment and other war activities resulted in the transport of mosquitoes and their eggs to new geographic areas (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., 2010</xref>). The result was a greatly expanded geographic distribution and increased densities of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and increased epidemic dengue activity (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia et al., 2013</xref>). The economic expansion was the driving force of unprecedented urban growth that continues today (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira, 2012</xref>). Housing, water, sewer, and waste management were inadequate. The vector population thus increased dramatically in the crowded, unhygienic cities of Asia, as mosquito control measures was not effective. The economic expansion also led to increased movement of people (along with them the viruses also moved among cities and countries in the region). Those countries that did not already have hyperendemic rapidly became hyperendemic (
