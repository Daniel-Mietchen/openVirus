<p id="p0285">The first reports of DF in Australia were in the late 1800s and, from 1880 to 1955. Although 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> was probably never eradicated from Northern Queensland, a combination of improved water systems and control programs reduced the populations to very low levels during the 1960s and 1970s, when dengue transmission was not reported. After an absence of 26 years, dengue reappeared in Northern Queensland in 1981/82 with DENV-1 causing an outbreak in several cities (

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> eradication program by Pan America Health Organization which was aimed at reducing the YF outbreaks (
 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 2014</xref>). The eradication program was discontinued in the early 1970s because urban epidemics of dengue and YF were no longer a problem. Failure to eradicate 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> from the whole region, however, resulted in repeated reinvasions by this mosquito into those countries that had achieved eradication. During the 1970s, support for mosquito surveillance and control programs waned, and by the end of the decade, many countries had been reinfested with 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 1989a</xref>). In 2012 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> had a distribution similar to that in the 1940s, before eradication was initiated; only Bermuda and Chile remain free of this mosquito. A characteristic of dengue in the Americas from 1963 through the early 1980s was hypoendemicity, that is, only a single serotype was present at any one time in most countries (
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 1989b</xref>). Thus reinvasion of Central and South America by 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> in the 1970s and 1980s, combined with increased urbanization and movement of people, and with them DENVs and mosquito vectors, which spread via commerce, resulted in most countries evolving from nonendemicity (no viruses present) or hypoendemicity (one virus present) to hyperendemicity (multiple virus serotypes present) (
