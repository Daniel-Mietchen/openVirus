<p>VLPs display epitopes in a form close to that of natural viruses, thus rendering them not only highly immunogenic but also easily acquirable by specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs), i.e., dendritic cells (DCs) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). VLPs can bind to Ig receptors on B lymphocytes, which activates them and leads to the recruitment of DCs via increased co-stimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Upon being processed, VLPs are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, thereby stimulating CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells; VLPs are recognized and presented to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells by MHC class I molecules via cross-presentation.
