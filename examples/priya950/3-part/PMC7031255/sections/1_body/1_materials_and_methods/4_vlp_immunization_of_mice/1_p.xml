<p>A wide host range can be experimentally infected with RVFV, but as mice can be infected by various means, they are a good animal model for studying the pathogenesis of RVFV infection in large mammals. In this experiment, mice were immunized with the purified RVFV VLPs. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups of 10, with the first group being the PBS group, the second group being the Freund's adjuvant group, the third group being the VLP group and the fourth group being the VLP + Freund's adjuvant group. Freund's complete adjuvant and Freund's incomplete adjuvant were used for the first and second immunization, respectively, with an immunization dose of 100 μl/mouse via hind limb intramuscular injection. Group one was intramuscularly injected with PBS, group two with Freund's adjuvant (PBS and Freund were mixed at an equal volume ratio of 1:1), group three with VLPs (15 μg VLPs/mouse) and group four with VLPs + Freund's adjuvant (15 μg VLPs/mouse). Blood was collected from the mice at 2 weeks after the second immunization, and immunity-related indexes were determined. The design of the immunization protocol is shown in
