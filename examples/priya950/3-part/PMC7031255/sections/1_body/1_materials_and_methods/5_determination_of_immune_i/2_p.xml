<p>A serum neutralization test was carried out as follows. A previously, constructed RVFV pseudovirus (with an EGFP marker) and neutralization assay (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) was used to determine antibody-neutralizing activity in serum from immunized mice that was collected at day 14 after the second immunization. Antibody-neutralizing activity was calculated using the following formula: antibody-neutralizing activity = [(number of green fluorescent cells in the control group—number of green fluorescent cells in the test group)/number of green fluorescent cells in the control group ×100%] (
