<p>VLPs have a polyprotein structure that mimics that of their natural virus in morphology and structure and is free of viral genetic material, thus making them safe and expensive candidate vaccines. At present, VLP-based commercially available preventive vaccines have been developed worldwide (

In the veterinary field, a vaccine for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) developed using VLPs has been approved for marketing (Intervet International Ltd., the Netherlands) (
