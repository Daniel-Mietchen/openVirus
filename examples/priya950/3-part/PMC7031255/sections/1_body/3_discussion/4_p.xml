<p>RVFV VLPs have been generated by several other researchers (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and the animal model experiments confirmed its effectiveness in the induction of virus neutralizing antibody (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the cellular immune response induced by the RVFV VLPs has not been studied. In this study, a cellular immune response was triggered by the RVFV VLPs in the RVFV VLPs immunized mice. Result showed that the VLPs significantly increased/stimulated the secretion of high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ; they also significantly increased the proportion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes secreting IL-4 and IFN-γ in the mouse spleen cells. IFN-γ is a Th1-type cytokine, and IL-4 a Th2-type cytokine, indicating that the VLPs alone can induce a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response in mice. Hence, the prepared RVFV VLPs could induce a strong immune response in small animals. This study showed that VLP-based experimental vaccines (strains) have good immunogenicity in mouse models and can induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies even in the absence of adjuvants.
