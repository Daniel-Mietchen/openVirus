<p>However, many tasks must be completed to prepare a vaccine with RVFV VLPs using the Bac-to-Bac system. The immunogenicity of the VLPs would be further improved and the production costs would be reduced, thereby laying the foundation for the development of vaccines using RVFV VLPs. In addition, there are some limitations in this study. For example, the virus challenge experiment after vaccine immunization is lacking due to the limited experiment conditions. Further studies are needed for evaluating the vaccine efficiency using animal models.</p>
