<p>In this study, a previously constructed recombinant baculovirus (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), rBac-N-G, which contains the RVFV Gn, Gc, and N proteins, was used to infect Sf9 insect cells to express RVFV VLPs. Although the virion cannot replicate, it can be adsorbed to cell receptors, in a manner similar to that of cells infected with RVFV. VLPs have certain advantages compared with soluble proteins, including adequate antigen stability and immunogenicity. VLPs are first adsorbed to cellular receptors, after which the virion envelope proteins are digested by lysosomes and the antigen is presented by MHC (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The rBac-N-G recombinant baculovirus was used to infect the Sf9 insect cells, which were cultured at large scale. The RVFV VLPs were concentrated and purified and then used to immunize mice. The experimental results showed that the RVFV VLPs induced mice to produce high-specificity immunoglobulins and neutralizing antibodies.
