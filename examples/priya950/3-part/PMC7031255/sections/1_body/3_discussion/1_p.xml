Currently, the primary means of preventing RVFV is vaccination. There are three main vaccine types: recombinant live vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines. These vaccines each have their own shortcomings, limiting their application and effectiveness during RVFV outbreaks.
