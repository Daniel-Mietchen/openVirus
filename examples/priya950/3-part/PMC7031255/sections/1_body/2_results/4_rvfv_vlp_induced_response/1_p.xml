<p>To effectively assess the intensity of the cellular immune response and to further evaluate the activation of T lymphocytes induced by the RVFV VLPs in mice, spleen cells were isolated at 2 weeks after the booster immunization (week 4), and ICS was used to analyze the synthesis and secretion of IFN-Î³ and IL-4 in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. The difference between the percentage of cells that were both cytokine-positive and lymphocyte-positive when Gn protein was added and that of cells that were both cytokine-positive and lymphocyte-positive in the absence of Gn protein were graphed for each cytokine, and the results are shown in
