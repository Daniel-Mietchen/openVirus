<p>Since T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) play an important role in the fight against viral infection, ICS was used to assess IL-4 and IFN-γ cytokine production in T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C,D</xref>). IFN-γ cytokine production by spleen T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) from mice in the fourth group (the VLPs + Freund's adjuvant group) was significantly higher than that in the other three groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Moreover, for lymphocytes from mice in the third group (the VLP group) in which the adjuvant was absent, secreted IFN-γ cytokine production by T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) was also high. IL-4 secretion by T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) was similar to that of IFN-γ. The secretion of IL-4 and IFN-γ by T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>) from mice in the first group (the PBS group) and second group (the Freund's adjuvant group) was extremely low.
