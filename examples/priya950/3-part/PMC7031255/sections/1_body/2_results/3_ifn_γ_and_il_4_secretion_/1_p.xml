<p>To determine whether the RVFV VLPs can induce cytokine production in lymphocytes, spleen lymphocytes were isolated at 2 weeks after the booster immunization (week 4). Subsequently, the spot-forming cells (SFCs) produced by the lymphocytes with partial Gn protein stimulation were detected to analyze the ability of the lymphocytes to produce cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-4. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Under stimulation with purified Gn protein, lymphocytes from mice in the fourth group (the VLPs + Freund's adjuvant group) produced the highest levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 compared to those in the other three groups. Lymphocytes from mice in the third group (the VLP group) also produced high levels of cytokines in the absence of Freund's adjuvant. These results showed that the RVFV VLPs induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses in the mice.
