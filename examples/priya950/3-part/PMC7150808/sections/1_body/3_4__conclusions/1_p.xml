<p>The ever-advancing spread of PPR has made clear the negative economic impact of the disease, and consequently the benefits of its eradication, protecting the livelihoods of the world’s poorest populations, in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The need for coordinated global action is now becoming stronger than ever. Given the similarities with the rinderpest control programme, the PPR GCES shows early promise and should yield early successes. Specific lessons learnt from PPR GCES in its first 5 years include: (i) PPR monitoring and assessment tools should learn from rinderpest eradication rather than Food and Mouth Disease (FMD); (ii) vaccination should be applied after careful identification of at-risk areas through participatory epidemiology; (iii) vaccination should be followed by an assessment of protection rates so that follow-up vaccination can be planned; (iv) regional/epizone campaigns are needed based on lessons from rinderpest eradication and; (v) more advocacy is needed for fundraising and awareness at grassroots level. PPR is a killer disease, threatening more than 68% of the world’s small ruminant population, and any control programme should quickly gain the approval, agreement and participation of livestock owners in endemic areas. With only one serotype in circulation and a vaccine that provides lifelong protection, an international campaign to eradicate this disease is certain to succeed.
