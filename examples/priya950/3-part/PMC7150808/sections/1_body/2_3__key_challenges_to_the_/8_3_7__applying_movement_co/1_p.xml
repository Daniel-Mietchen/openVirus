<p>The control of animal movement, including the imposition of quarantine and other sanitary measures, are integral to most infectious disease control and eradication programmes. However, strict movement control can be counter-productive because it can actually stimulate unnecessary or illegal movement of animals in order to bypass quarantines and restriction orders. To this end, movement controls must be tempered by the experience of local animal health teams who are better equipped to judge the behaviour of local owners when faced with such restrictions.</p>
