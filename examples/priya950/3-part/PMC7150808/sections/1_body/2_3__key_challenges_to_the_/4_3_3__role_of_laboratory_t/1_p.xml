<p>An extensive battery of tests exists for diagnosing PPR and identifying the causative agent, PPR virus (PPRV) [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Basic tests include agar gel immunodiffusion assays while more sensitive and sophisticated assays such as immunocapture ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) are also available. It is understood that diagnostic tools are inevitable components of the four-stages of the PPR global strategy, from assessment to the post-eradication phase. However, these tools may not be suitable for all stages of PPR control and eradication. For instance, diagnostics such as ELISA could be used for mass screening of clinical and serum samples, whereas immuno-chromatographic tests can be used at the field level (i.e., pen-side tests). Work to define minimal performance characteristics of these diagnostic assays and to establish bench marking procedures for diagnostic networks is needed. Standardization of tools should include tests for confirming outbreaks, tracking molecular epidemiology, supporting diagnostics for use in the field (pen-side test) and serological monitoring of vaccinated flocks. Assays with higher sensitivity, such as competitive ELISA, qRT-PCR and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) are clearly important for early diagnosis of PPR and also, theoretically, during the late stages of eradication or when sampling atypical hosts, e.g., wildlife with suspected infection [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Defining when and how to implement an appropriate range of diagnostic tests remains a multifactorial challenge, dependent on assay availability, training needs and deficits, various cost-benefit analyses and the correct validation of the assays involved. More detailed genetic analysis could also be used as a tool to identify linkages between foci of circulating virus, especially which populations are acting as incubators and sustaining infection in their regions. All laboratories should be linked through national, regional or global networks to allow information sharing and technology transfer.
