<p>At a smaller scale, rinderpest eradication highlighted the importance of local stakeholder involvement, e.g., directly involving livestock keepers in the process of tracing disease, as being critically important in disease monitoring. To this end pen-side test kits are being developed that will allow sick animals to be tested for PPR in the field, allowing much more rapid disease identification and therefore more rapid responses to outbreaks. The requirement for this local, and international approach was highlighted by Taylor and others in Oman [

The implementation of these local networks, combined with a continued global appreciation of PPRV epidemiology will be key to the long-term sustainability of the PPR eradication campaign.
