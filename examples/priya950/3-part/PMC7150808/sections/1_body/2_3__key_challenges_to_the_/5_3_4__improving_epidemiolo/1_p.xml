<p>Epidemiological research is required to better understand the PPR transmission dynamics, in particular its spread and infectivity and the different roles of wildlife and livestock species, production systems, ecosystems and viral lineages in this process. The overall goal is to identify critical control points, and optimal methods for intervention at these points, to support effective management of eradication. One example is a need to support the evaluation of R
 <sub>0</sub> values, in relation to the various lineages of PPR and the various ecosystems it affects. Along these lines, focus on targeted short-term studies and appraisals complemented by evidence of a fully functional disease reporting system (in order to properly quantify the effectiveness of vaccination) or a prolonged period of field work in one or more infected countries may help to generate some of the basic longitudinal data required for computer simulations. The expert opinion and experience of professionals working in infected areas and with local knowledge can also be used to inform computer modelling. The results of these epidemiological studies will likely be the main driver for decisions about what levels of control might practically be achieved, as well as the feasibility or otherwise, of timely eradication according to the stepwise approach described above.
