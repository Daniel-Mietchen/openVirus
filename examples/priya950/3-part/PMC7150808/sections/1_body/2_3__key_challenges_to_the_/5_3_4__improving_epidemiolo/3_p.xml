<p>As discussed above, when surveillance has detected PPR foci, genetic approaches could identify the linkages among these foci. Examples of recent successes in this area include the global monitoring of PPRV epidemiology. Sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis tools have allowed researchers to genetically define PPRV into four lineages; three historically centered in Africa and a single lineage, lineage IV, confined to Asia. However, data collected over the last decade has illustrated the wide incursion of lineage IV from the Middle East into North Africa, as well as the Sudan and some neighboring countries including the Central African Republic and Cameroon.</p>
