<p>Although there are many parameters available to facilitate the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of a disease, there are several drawbacks to applying these, e.g., they can be subject specific or handle only one major factor at a time, therefore lacking the ability to estimate the cumulative impact of a disease on the economy. Nevertheless, these economy-wide considerations are crucial in implementing and funding control and eradication strategies for emerging diseases. For PPR a well-planned cost-benefit analysis of PPR, comparing policies and responses that include both the direct and indirect impacts associated with PPR are needed to better understand the impact of PPR in all settings [

That being said, the annual global impact of PPR has been estimated at between USD 1.4 billion and USD 2.1 billion; with cost-benefit studies also carried out in different countries; identifying losses which clearly justify both national and global PPR eradication programmes being pursued [
