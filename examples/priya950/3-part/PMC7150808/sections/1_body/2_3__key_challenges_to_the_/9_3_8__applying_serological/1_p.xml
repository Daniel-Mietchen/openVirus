<p>According to the objective of the surveillance, it would be useful to use serological monitoring to investigate the levels of recruitment and to develop a proposed methodology for risk-based surveillance, which could be translated into useful actions such as targeted re-vaccination. There are wider calls for serological monitoring to be used to assess the success rates of vaccination campaigns or to invigilate the effectiveness of individual vaccination teams. However, in reality this may only be useful if immediate revaccination can be carried out, which is not often possible. Whilst it is important to identify technical or administrative errors or indeed administrator negligence and address them as the implementation of penalties is very difficult in several countries. Ultimately, the case for detailed serological monitoring may have to be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on a cost-benefit analysis and whether the resultant data can realistically contribute to improve long-term planning. In at risk area that have never declare the disease or when country has stop the vaccination for few years, serology could be carried out to demonstrate the absence of PPRV. In the absence of DIVA and the current situation in several countries, the challenge is the interpretation of positive samples. Careful surveillance strategy taking in to account the vaccination history should be considered.</p>
