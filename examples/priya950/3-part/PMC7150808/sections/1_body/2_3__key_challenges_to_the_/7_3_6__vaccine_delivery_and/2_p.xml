<p>Moving forward, we must also admit that although the standard PPR vaccines are cheap and effective, there is a need, especially in developing countries, for vaccines that support broader sustainability in small ruminant production. To this end, there have been significant advances in designing multivalent small ruminant virus vaccines that can also contribute to PPR eradication. Additional field application of these multivalent vaccines to control common small ruminant pathogens, including PPR, would indeed help to enhance poverty alleviation. Considering the enormous benefits of multivalent vaccines, several vaccines are available or currently being developed, e.g., sheep/goat pox and PPR [
