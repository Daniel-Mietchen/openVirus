<p>Whilst risk-based vaccination of sheep and goats in endemic countries might be a pragmatic approach to control PPR in the first phase of disease eradication, the development of a marker vaccine with a robust companion test may help with serological surveillance in the future. Other possibilities include the development of a vaccine capable of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Emphasis in this area should also be placed on deployment models for these vaccines, as well as their applicability in various hosts (small ruminant and wildlife), to ensure they are utilised to their maximum potential.</p>
