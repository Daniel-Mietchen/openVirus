<p>Each country will start with an epidemiological assessment to identify the risk areas (stage 1). The PPR-GCES envisage that risk-based, targeted mass vaccination (stage 2) of assumed, high-risk populations will be progressively replaced by focused vaccination (stage 3) as more concrete epidemiological information becomes available (indeed some countries may be in position to follow a focused approach from the start). Vaccination campaigns will be accompanied by regular and constant surveillance for clinical disease, including routine passive reports, active disease searches, disease investigations and follow-ups. The collected and analysed data will be a critical indicator of the relative success of the campaign in reducing disease incidence and mortality. The success of the strategy shall depend on the implementation of vaccination campaigns, accounting for husbandry practices, mobility and the periodicity of small ruminants’ population renewal. A study conducted in Mauritania [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that the PPR global strategy prevented the largest number of deaths (9.2 million vs. 6.2 for a random strategy) and provided one of the highest economic returns among all strategies (Benefit-Cost Ratio around 16 vs. 7 for the random strategy). According to its current cost, identification would be a viable investment that could reduce the number of vaccine doses required by 20–60%. Whilst the implementation of the identification system is crucial for PPR control, its success depends also on a coordinated approach at the regional level based on epizone or ecosystem approaches. The identification tool (ear-notched instead of painting horn or skin) should be harmonized, as was the case with rinderpest. Other factors to be considered in the vaccination campaign include logistical (fuel for vehicles, maintenance of the cold chain etc.), personnel (time and missions to vaccinate animals) and vaccine wastage (doses given to already vaccinated animals). The logistics and manpower could have a large impact on the vaccination campaign, accounting for, in some cases, up to 70% of the total campaign costs.
