<p>PPR GCES was subsequently turned into the PPR Global Eradication Programme (PPR GEP). A FAO/OIE Secretariat was established in March 2016 in FAO-Rome, the body responsible for the preparation and overall coordination of the PPR GEP. In October 2016, FAO and OIE launched the first five-years (2017–2021) of PPR GEP, developed through an inclusive and peer-reviewed drafting process. The main role of the Secretariat is to provide overall strategic coordinated direction, as well as to develop cost-effective control methodologies, tools, guidelines, training materials and networks. The Secretariat is supported by an Advisory Committee (AC) which provides strategic guidance and oversight on the execution of the programme while also playing an important advocacy role with policy makers, donors, national veterinary services and livestock owners. The Global Research and Expertise Network (PPR GREN) was launched in April 2018 during a meeting hosted by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture in Vienna. PPR GREN was established as a forum for scientific and technical consultations to foster a science-based and innovative debate on PPR. The United Nations (UN) Rome Based Agencies Permanent Representatives “Friends of PPR GEP” was established in 2018 to: i) advocate for the importance of PPR GEP as a global challenge which can contribute to the UN sustainable development goals by 2030, ii) support the Secretariat in fundraising, and, iii) advocate during statutory meetings of FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and World Food Programme (WFP). These four groups (Secretariat, AC, GREN and Friend of PPR GEP) formed the governance of the programme. Independently, national and regional programmes to control PPR are also being developed in alignment with the PPR GCES. In this context the FAO and OIE are playing a leading role in identifying and harmonizing potential global, regional, sub-regional and country partners (reference centers, research institutions, regional economic communities, civil society organisations, countries and farmers, amongst others); pinpointing the most appropriate roles for these partners; and helping to develop the mechanisms for their interaction and co-ordination. The other bodies likely to become involved include those with wide-ranging technical, political and/or economic interests in PPR eradication [
