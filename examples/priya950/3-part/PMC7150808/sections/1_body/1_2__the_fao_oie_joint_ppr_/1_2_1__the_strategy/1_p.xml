<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), adopted at the 2015 international conference in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, the PPR- Global Control and Eradication Strategy (GCES). The PPR- GCES, is built off of the strong scientific, economic and social case for PPR control and eradication combined with these Organizations’ success story of a related morbillivirus of cattle, rinderpest virus (RPV) eradication. This was also possible thanks to the strong partnerships with Africa Union Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), International Atomic Energy Atomic (IAEA), national governments, Non Governmental Organisations(Veterinaires sans frontiere Suisse in Sudan, Terra Nuova in Somalia among others), research institutes and universities. These partners are involved in GCES’s formulation and implementation. Rinderpest eradication showed the importance of risk-based vaccination as well as extensive and continued surveillance to ensure the continued absence of disease through well planned disease management and the preparation of proper contingency plans for re-emergence or re-introduction of the virus. These factors and their understanding have been built into the FAO/OIE PPR GCES. For rinderpest, it was also considered of critical importance that the programme was time-limited, which put pressure on countries to establish clearly that they were free of disease. In a broader context, more focus will now be placed on communication including large-scale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, and synchronizing education and entertainment [
