<p>The PPR GCES promotes a stepwise approach to eradication based on four stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00313-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which also provide an overview of how the programme will operate. These stages correspond to a combination of decreasing levels of epidemiological risk and increasing levels of prevention and control, and comprise a multi-stage, multi-country process involving assessment, control, eradication and maintenance of PPRV-free status. This ranges from stage 1 (where the epidemiological situation is being assessed), to stage 4 (when the country can provide evidence that there is no virus circulation either at a zonal or national level, and is ready to apply for OIE-official PPR-free status). Control activities, including vaccination, are implemented in stage 2 while stage 3 corresponds directly to PPR eradication. Of note, to enter stage 4 vaccination must be suspended in order to facilitate epidemiological monitoring of disease. Implementation requires the concerted delivery of preparedness plans, capacity building, improved stakeholder awareness and engagement; as well as the establishment of appropriate legal frameworks [
