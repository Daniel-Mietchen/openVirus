  <title>Stochastic modelling of access period assays with molecular diagnostics, acquisition response curve.</title>
  <p>Note that the use of molecular diagnostics to assess insect infection affects only the acquisition access component of access period assays, see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g002">Fig 2B</xref> for corresponding inoculation response curve. Gray curves indicate the 2.5th-97.5th percentile range of simulations (i.e., demarcating 95% of simulations with darker shades of gray for percentile bands near the median). Solid ruby curve indicates the mean of simulations. The black dotted curve shows the mathematical solution (i.e., 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e004">Eq 3</xref>). In addition, black dotted curves indicate the mathematical solution +/- the derived standard deviation (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007724.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for derivation of variance). Figure inset shows the correspondence between computer simulations and the mathematical solution. For details of the simulation procedure see caption of 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g002">Fig 2</xref>.
