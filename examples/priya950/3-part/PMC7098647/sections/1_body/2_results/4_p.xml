<p>Using CBSV parameter estimates (i.e.,

 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>f</italic>) from the access period experiment of Maruthi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as the basis of dynamic stochastic simulations, we generated a 2.5

 </sup> percentile range (i.e., demarcating the 95% credible region of response curves) as a function of acquisition period and inoculation period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, gray dashed curves). We found that the datapoints [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] fell comfortably within the predicted range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, black circles). In addition to the basic access period experiment, we also implemented dynamic simulation of two additional experiments. In the first of these, a ‘transmission’ experiment, the number of insect vectors used in the basic access period setup is varied. The dynamic simulations generated a 2.5

 </sup> percentile range for the two cohort sizes studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, gray intervals) and we found that the datapoints [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] fell within the range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, black circles). In the second experiment, designed to measure ‘persistence’ of the pathogen in the vector, the duration of an intermediate access period on a dummy plant was varied in our simulations. The dynamic simulations generated a 2.5

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] exactly matched the predicted ranges (
