<p>In this section we begin by examining the response curves that result from both computer simulation and mathematical analysis. In addition, the results of applying the formulae, which were derived from the mathematical analysis, to the data from the computer simulations are presented. We then present epidemiological parameter estimates that follow from the application of the method to CBSV data. Finally, making use once again of computer simulations, the results of preliminary testing of the CBSV estimates are presented.</p>
