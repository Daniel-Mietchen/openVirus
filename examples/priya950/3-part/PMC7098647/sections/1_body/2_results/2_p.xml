<p>The mathematical equations (Eqs

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e006">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e007">6</xref>) for the access period response curves closely match the overall mean of the stochastic simulations (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g003">3</xref>, dotted black vs solid ruby curves). This is the case when molecular diagnostics were not used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and when they were used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The correspondence between the theoretical and simulation results demonstrates the accuracy of the mathematical solutions. The mathematical solutions for the access period response curves were distilled in to formulae for curve gradients, forming a set of simultaneous equations for the unknown epidemiological parameters when equated to the empirical gradients. We found that for acquisition response curves the gradients in which the epidemiological parameters were expressed most simply were initial slope and the ratio of initial acceleration to initial slope (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), while for inoculation response curves they were expressed most simply in terms of the initial slope and the asymptote (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Solving the system of simultaneous equations results in the epidemiological parameter estimates. Comparing these estimates with their true values for the simulated data, we find that the estimates for acquisition period, inoculation period and retention period are very accurate (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This was the case both when we reproduced the situation in which no molecular diagnostics were available (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, no diagnostics), and when we reproduced the situation in which molecular diagnostics were used (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, with diagnostics). The estimates were marginally more precise when molecular diagnostics were used than when they were not used (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, with diagnostics).
