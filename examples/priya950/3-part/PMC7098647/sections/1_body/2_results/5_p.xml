<p>It may be the case that conventional expectations of CBSV retention period governed the choice of the intermediate feeding duration studied in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Taken together, the zero datapoints in the Maruthi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. experiment [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], i.e., zero plants infected after 24
 <italic>h</italic> and 48
 <italic>h</italic> feeding on an intermediate dummy plant, and the retention period estimate of 1.6
 <italic>h</italic> that is presented here, show that the chosen intermediate period was long relative to the duration of persistence. In order to propose a more plausible range of intermediate periods, and to provide a means of empirically testing our findings, we produced credible 95% intervals for all values of the intermediate period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We labeled several key points on the mean response curve, i.e., critical intermediate durations at which the persistence response was 25%, 50% and 75% of the case when no intermediate period was used (see caption of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g005">Fig 5</xref> for exact values).
