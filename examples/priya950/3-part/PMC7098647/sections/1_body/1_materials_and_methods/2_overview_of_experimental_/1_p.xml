<p>The virus acquisition assay procedure [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] involves confining a cohort of virus-free insects to an infected plant. After a fixed period of access to the infected plant (acquisition access period) the insects are removed and assessed for infection using a direct or indirect diagnostic test. In the direct test, the proportion of infected vectors is calculated using a molecular diagnostic test such as RT-PCR. In the indirect test, the proportion of infected vectors is calculated by transferring the cohort of insects to a healthy plant for a fixed ‘test’ IAP. The process is performed for a fixed acquisition access period with 
 <italic>n</italic> repetitions, for each of a range of acquisition access periods. In the case of the indirect test, acquisition success corresponds to the proportion of plants from the ‘test’ IAPs that develop symptoms, or, are ELISA-positive (usually after a fixed number of days to allow systemic infection).
