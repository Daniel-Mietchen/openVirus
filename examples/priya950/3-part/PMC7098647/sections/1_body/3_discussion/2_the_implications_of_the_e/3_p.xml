<p>In this paper we have introduced a method of matching gradients in order to estimate epidemiological parameters from conventional access period experiments. The method can be used for a wide range of plant viruses using data available in published experiments. Viruses like CBSV do not have a latent period in their vector and are restricted to the phloem of the host plant (i.e., ‘semi-persistent’ viruses [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), and hence are acquired and inoculated during feeding from phloem (as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Eqs 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e002">2</xref>). The method can also be applied to phloem-restricted viruses that are associated with periods of latency in the insect vector, by extending Eqs 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e002">2</xref> to account for latency (such viruses include ‘persistently transmitted’ viruses like cassava mosaic virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Viruses that are acquired and inoculated from the host plant’s epidermal cells by aphid vectors, however, require a different set of equations for plant infection that take account of the central role of aphid probing in acquisition and inoculation (i.e., non-persistently transmitted viruses; see Donnelly 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for a model that could be adapted for this purpose). In order to provide a means of testing the parameter estimates it may be useful to generate secondary predictions using dynamic simulation. In this paper we used the estimates to predict the relationship between the probability of plant infection and the duration of feeding on a dummy plant intermediate to a 48 
 <italic>hour</italic> acquisition period and a 48 
 <italic>hour</italic> inoculation period. Accordingly, by identifying the intermediate period at which plant infection was 25%, 50%, and 75% of that of no intermediate period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we provided a predicted range that can be empirically tested.
