 <sub>0</sub> in sub-Saharan Africa will be explicitly investigated in future work using an epidemiological model for CBSV transmission within fields of cassava plants. By expressing

 <sub>0</sub> in terms of the epidemiological parameter estimates presented here, the role of each factor in CBSVâ€™s transition from sub- to super-threshold spread (i.e., from 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1) can be assessed. In particular, the critical abundance of the whitefly vector that is needed for epidemics to occur can be quantified. Ultimately, such studies will help identify those aspects of CBSV epidemiology that are most critical to epidemic spread, and will lead to management recommendations for containing the geographic range of CBSV.
