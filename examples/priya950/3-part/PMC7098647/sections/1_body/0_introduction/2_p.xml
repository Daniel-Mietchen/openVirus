<p>Access period experiments have been conducted for numerous plant viruses across a range of genera, from

 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to the recently discovered 
 <italic>Torradovirus</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In access period experiments, insect-borne pathogen transmission is reproduced in controlled laboratory settings, and the transmission success is recorded as the duration of exposure to the pathogen is varied. Two broad types of experiment are conducted: in the first, the experimenter varies the duration of access given to pathogen-free vectors on pathogen infected source plants (acquisition access period, AAP) to produce access period response curves (i.e., curves showing the probability of transmission as a function of AAP) (see definitions in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007724.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the second experiment, the experimenter varies the duration of access given to pathogen-bearing vectors on pathogen free source plants (inoculation access period, IAP) to produce inoculation response curves. Varying these durations in this way can also produce plausible ranges for epidemiological parameters such as pathogen retention period. For example, Maruthi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] used access period experiments to conclude that CBSV is effectively acquired within 1 hour (the basis for this conclusion was that no significant differences were found in transmission success for acquisition periods beyond 1 hour) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, Maruthi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that CBSV has a retention period of less than 48 hours.
