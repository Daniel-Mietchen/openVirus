<p>Estimation of pathogenic life-history values such as retention period for a virus in an insect vector, is of particular importance for understanding and managing plant disease for a range of arthropod-transmitted plant pathogens [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Knowledge of parameter values such as retention period are conventionally derived from a set of standard plant pathology experiments, which we refer to here as access period experiments. These experiments yield empirical response curves for success in virus transmission as a function of the duration of time that vectors are given access to individual host plants. Since long distance carriage of insect vectors occurs within atmospheric air flows, the duration that the vector retains the pathogen (i.e., retention period) indirectly limits the distance of virus dispersal [

There is a pressing need for methods that can infer epidemiological parameters from the limited data that access period experiments produce. Recently,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this paper, we outline a method for extracting estimates for epidemiological parameters such as retention period, and we apply the method to derive estimates for CBSV.
