<p>A central goal in plant disease epidemiology is the prediction of epidemic risk, and, beyond this, of the prospects for control. The goals are achieved through analyses at the landscape scale, for which estimates of epidemiological parameters are essential, for emerging viral threats such as CBSV. In this paper, we introduce a method for the estimation of epidemiological parameters from access period data. The method consists of first deriving equations for vector infection dynamics as they occur in access period experiments. Solving the equations leads to algebraic expressions for AAP and IAP curves, in which the probability of successful transmission is related to durations of exposure of vectors to a target plant. The algebraic expressions are then matched to empirical curves to estimate the required parameters. We use the method to generate epidemiological parameter estimates for CBSV from a recent access period experiment [
