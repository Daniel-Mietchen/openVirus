<p>The study has some limitations. The participants selected were cases reported to SIVIGILA; therefore, the experiences of women not recorded in the public surveillance system were not included in this study. Moreover, from the 12 cases identified in the surveillance system, we were only able to interview six women because there was erroneous or missing contact information. This reflects the need to improve the quality of reporting undertaken by healthcare professionals through the notification sheets. The possible consequences of not including the entire eligible population include the risk of leaving out different experiences than those reported in the study, and consequently variation in the overall results.</p>
