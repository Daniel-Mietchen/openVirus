<p>Women reported delayed access to prenatal laboratory testing and ultrasounds, including test results, owing to administrative reasons such as delayed authorization from their EAPB. Another factor identified in the interviews was the fragmentation of the public health system in which a lack of coordination between stakeholders influences how services are provided.
