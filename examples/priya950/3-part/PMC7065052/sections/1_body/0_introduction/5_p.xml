<p>In response to the 2015 epidemic, WHO raised a call to action for local governments to develop public health interventions that would aim to prevent the consequences of Zika virus infection, particularly in pregnant women and women of childbearing age. Following these recommendations, the Colombian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) developed a series of guidelines and protocols to mitigate the effects of the outbreak.
