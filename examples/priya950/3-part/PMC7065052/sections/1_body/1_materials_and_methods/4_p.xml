<p>Study participants were purposely selected from the National Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) and the municipality's records. A total of 12 cases of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection in the mother during the perinatal period were identified and selected as the study population. Of these 12 cases, five had incomplete identification and contact information, wrong phone numbers, or did not answer phone calls despite several attempts, which excluded them from the study. One participant was excluded because she had moved to another city. The authors contacted the remaining six eligible participants via telephone to provide a general description of the project including background, objectives, and methods.</p>
