<p>In addition to the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of action of influenza proteins, the characterization of host tropism of influenza virus needs also to be addressed with the aim of predicting the viral strains with higher probability of successful zoonotic transmission. Regarding host tropism, the importance of NS1 has also been highlighted and shown to directly influence the host range through its action on interferon response [
