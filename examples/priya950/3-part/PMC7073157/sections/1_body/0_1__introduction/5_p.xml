<p>In the last one hundred years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records have registered four influenza pandemics [

In the 1918 pandemic, known as the Spanish flu, over one-third of the worldâ€™s population became infected and 50 million people died, making this the largest influenza pandemic in terms of mortality. Its origin may be traced to the reassortment of a human H1 and an avian N1 viral subtypes. The 1957 pandemic (Asian flu) caused over 1.1 million deaths from infection by an H2N2 viral subtype which resulted from the combination of the H1N1 from the 1918 pandemic with an avian H2N2 subtype. The Asian flu subtype then reassorted with the H3 avian subtype originating the H3N2, responsible for the 1968 pandemic causing over one million victims. The latest pandemic, registered in 2009, resulted from the reassortment of the human H3N2, the swine H1N1, and the avian H1N2 subtypes. This pandemic infected over 60 million people in the United States, killing from 100 to 500 thousand people worldwide [

The threat of a new pandemic is always present, as shown by the recent situation in China with a H7N9 Asian flu epidemic that was contained after the use of the H7-Re1 vaccine. However, the virus underwent antigenic shift and a new highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was identified last year [
