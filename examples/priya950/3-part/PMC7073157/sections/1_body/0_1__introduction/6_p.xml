<p>To reduce influenza’s infections three main approaches are available: vaccination, antiviral drugs, and surveillance. Vaccination is the main preventive response to influenza infections. As mentioned before, vaccines get annual updates according to information from WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), responsible for data collection and analysis on surveillance, clinical practice, and research around the world [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir and peramivir). However, CDC does not recommend the use of the first two for recently circulating influenza viruses due to the high resistance they display towards these drugs; hence neuraminidase inhibitors are the only used in-clinic currently [

 <xref rid="B22-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the polymerase acidic protein (Baloxavir Marboxil) [
