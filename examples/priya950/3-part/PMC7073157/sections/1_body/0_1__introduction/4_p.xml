<p>Mutation rates in the influenza virus are high rendering insufficient previously acquired host immunity. The antigenic changes result from two different processes, i.e., antigenic drift and antigenic shift [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Antigenic drift results from subtle changes in the influenza virusâ€™ genome over time that culminates in a virus of the same strain, but unrecognizable for the host cell immune system. These mutation high rates occur because of the lack of proofreading ability in RNA viruses and it is common in several of these viruses. Unlike antigenic drift, common in several viruses, influenza A viruses (IAV) display a rare ability to undergo antigenic shift [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This process, also known as reassortment, occurs occasionally when segments of RNAs from two different strains of IAV infect the same cell allowing their rearrangement into a new viral strain for which most of the population does not have preexisting immunity. A new viral strain can arise due to this genetic event which may display the ability to spread successfully from human-to-human, allowing a new pandemic [
