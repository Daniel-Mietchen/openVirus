<p>In this review, we focus on influenza’s Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1). NS1 presents itself as a potential therapeutic target based on two central complementary activities, i.e., counteracting the host’s immune response and aiding viral replication [

Previous studies on the role of NS1 in the virus biology have shown that viruses without this protein have low rates of replication and dissemination. Thus, the development of therapeutic approaches targeting NS1 could achieve good outcomes in influenza infection treatment [
