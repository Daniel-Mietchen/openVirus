<p>To enhance pro viral responses, viruses have different strategies such as delaying apoptosis through PI3K activation, an important checkpoint for cellular homeostasis [

 <sub>2</sub> domains of the p85β subunit of PI3K via residues Tyr89 and Pro164. It has been suggested that the dimerization of the ED is not necessary for the interaction with PI3K [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Recently, additional NS1 interactions have been proposed, such as the one with nucleolar RNA helicase 2 (DDX21). This protein inhibits viral polymerase (VP) aggregation by PB1 viral subunit binding. Due to NS1’s binding to DDX21, VP is then able to assemble all the subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and continue to catalyze viral RNA synthesis [

 <xref rid="B100-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] forming a heterotrimeric complex that inhibits viral translation. Cytoplasmic polysomes were found to contain NS1 and hStaufen, a protein involved in the transport of mRNAs to the active translation sites [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Zhu, Zheng, and collaborators had recently unveiled the interaction of NS1 with the nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein (NOLC1). The authors observed that, after binding, there was an increase in apoptosis of host cells, which seems counterintuitive considering the role of NS1 in the viral cycle, and thus awaits future clarification [
