<p>NS1 inhibits double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), ribonuclease L (RNAse L), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) of the host cell, interfering with multiple cellular pathways. PKR is a kinase from the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) that, after activation by dsRNAs, inhibits translation, a critical aspect harmful to viral growth. In previous studies, the interface for the NS1-PKR binding was thought to comprise residues Ile123 and Asn127 [

This means that NS1 binds preferentially to dsRNA instead of binding to OAS. This could indicate that the primary function of dsRNA binding is to make it unavailable to OAS, hence, stopping the IFN cascade by the activation of RNAse L through OAS [
