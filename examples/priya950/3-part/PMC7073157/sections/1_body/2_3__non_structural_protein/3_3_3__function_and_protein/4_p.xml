<p>Recently, Wang and collaborators identified two residues essential for NS1’s contribution to viral pathogenicity and its cell concentration. Mutation of Ser212 to proline in avian H7N9 decreases the NS1 ability to stop the host’s IFN response and to enhance viral replication. Likewise, mutation of Ile178 to valine prompted NS1 degradation through the proteasome pathway [
