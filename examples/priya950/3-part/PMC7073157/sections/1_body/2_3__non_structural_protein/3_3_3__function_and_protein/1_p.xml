<p>NS1 has a plethora of strategies to inhibit the host immune response due to its ability to establish multiple protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions. NS1 hampers different pathways both in the cytoplasm [

The presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) at the C-terminal end of the effector domain allows exiting from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. On the other hand, nuclear localization signals 1 and 2 (NLS1 and NLS2) direct NS1 to the nucleus. While NLS1 is part of the RNA-binding domain N-terminal region allowing NS1 to locate in the nucleoplasm, NLS2 is located in the C-terminal tail allowing NS1 to migrate to the nucleolus [
