<p>In 2012, another compound—NSC125044—was tested by Jablonski and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] for activity evaluation of the molecule’s core after stripping it of accessory regions, and a structure-activity relationship (SAR) was established. Using a live cell virus replication assay, the authors concluded that the best SAR for this binding site was represented by a chemical entity with a large hydrophobic core with a weakly basic function on its left-hand side, whereas the right-hand side should have an aromatic ring linked by an amide bond before a short methylene chain. In this study, A9 and A22, small molecules that are derivatives of NSC125044, were the most promising molecules, A22 being 10 times more potent than A9. Recently, Kleinpeter and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B140-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] continued Jablonski’s research [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Both molecules bind to NS1-ED and, by mapping the interaction region through X-ray crystallography, it was shown that they share the same binding pocket as CPSF30, meaning that these compounds can act as inhibitors of the NS1-CPSF30 interaction.
