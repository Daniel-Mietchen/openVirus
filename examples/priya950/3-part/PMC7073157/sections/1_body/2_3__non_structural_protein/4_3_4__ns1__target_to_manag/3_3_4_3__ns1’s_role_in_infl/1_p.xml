<p>Host tropism refers to the specificity of some pathogens to infect particular hosts or host tissues. Molecular and biological characteristics of the host organism determine host tropism, i.e., the ability of a virus to interact with a particular characteristic of a host. In the case of influenza virus, quantitative analysis of surface interacting molecules and immunohistochemistry assays stand central to the understanding of host tropism, although other approaches should not be neglected [

For example, random forests (RF) was used to build 11 computational models from sequences of proteins isolated from influenza, producing highly accurate prediction models capable of determining the host tropism of individual influenza proteins. In this study, NS1 was predicted to have a large number of interactions with different hosts (high host tropism) [
