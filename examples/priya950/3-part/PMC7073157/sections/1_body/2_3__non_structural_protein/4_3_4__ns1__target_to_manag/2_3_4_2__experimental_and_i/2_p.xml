<p>With the high viral mutation rates and resistance-related problems associated with the commonly used therapeutic targets, the key to the development of new antivirals is the identification of novel therapeutic targets [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In this context, NS1 presents itself as a promising target due to its multifunctional nature and central role in virus biology and infection mechanisms. Thus, it is key to pinpoint all the relevant interactions and ligand-binding sites in NS1 to enable the discovery of small molecules with the goal of developing new therapies [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One of the most relevant characteristics of NS1 to be considered is its ability to inhibit the innate immune response of the host, restricting the cascade response of IFN at different levels and increasing the level of virulence of the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B128-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. One way to decrease NS1 expression is through the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This approach strictly marks viral genes with zero impact on host pathways and expression, which should decrease undesirable side effects and toxic effects [
 <xref rid="B129-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Wu and coworkers synthesized three antisense RNA oligonucleotides targeting the NS gene, and each one worked individually well 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, in vivo the results were not very promising. The authors recognized that the results were improved when the three sequences were used simultaneously. Rajput and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B130-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] tried to mute NS genes post-transcriptionally by administering wild type (WT) siRNAs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Their results showed that siRNAs could strongly inhibit viral replication, justifying this as a valuable approach applicable to antiviral drugs that aim to inhibit NS1 indirectly.
