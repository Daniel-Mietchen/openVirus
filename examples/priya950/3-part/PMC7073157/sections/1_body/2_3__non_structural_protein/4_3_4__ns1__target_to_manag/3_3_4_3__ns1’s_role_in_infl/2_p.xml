<p>Influenza viruses, in particular, have a high risk of being transmitted through animal carriers (zoonotic risk [
 <xref rid="B162-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]). The distinction in host tropism protein signatures can be used to train ML prediction models for zoonotic strain prediction. Using a dataset consisting of 13,998 strains of the influenza A virus from the Influenza Research Database [
 <xref rid="B163-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>], after removing invalid sequences of the 11 proteins, NS1 included, host tropism signature features were transformed from the protein sequence to yield 146 feature vectors comprising several amino acid-based characteristics. This dataset was then used to train an RF prediction model, i.e., an ensemble of decision trees trained with randomly selected features and instances that were then combined with a bagging algorithm to maximize the value of the information on the dataset. This model can predict the zoonotic classification of the virus (in this case, avian, human, or zoonotic), and thus could be eventually used as a predictive tool with social, economic and public health impact [
