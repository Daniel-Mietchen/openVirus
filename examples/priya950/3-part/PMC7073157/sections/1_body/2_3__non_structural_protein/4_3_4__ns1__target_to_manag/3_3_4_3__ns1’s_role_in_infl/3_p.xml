<p>Due to their ability to evade species barriers influenza strains have been detected in a larger number of different host’s species [

In a recent study, a multi-host dataset of 674 different influenza strains organized into three host categories (avian, human, and swine) was compiled. The authors multi-labelled the sequences depending on the host’s species they were isolated from and their parent-strains. For example, if a human isolated virus reassortment occurred from both avian and swine parent-strains, then, the new strain would be labelled as avian, swine and human. This dataset ended up with seven different classifications: avian, human, swine, human-swine, human-avian, avian-swine, and human-avian-swine. This classification enabled the representation of the host range for each sequence through multi-label learning, i.e., the possibility of each sequence to belong to more than one individual class. Finally, the dataset was trained using different ML models, such as decision trees, and it was possible to pinpoint the most discriminative and combinatorial positions, regarding the host range. NS1 was one of the proteins associated with high human host range [
