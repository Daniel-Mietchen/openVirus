<p>In addition, the ML303 family of compounds was passed onto in vivo studies carried out by Patnaik and coworkers [

This pyrazolopyridine family of compounds is a group of NS1 antagonists and exhibited rehabilitation of the IFN cascade, previously inhibited by NS1, and a remarkable antiviral activity in-cell culture. Another study using yeast-based assays was conducted by Kong and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B142-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] targeting NS1’s interaction with CPSF30. They tested Chinese medicine substances to assess if they could inhibit this interaction site. The most promising results came from an oral liquid substance called “Shuanghualian”.
