 <xref rid="B143-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] studied a naphthalimide family of compounds to identify if they could revert the function of NS1 in blocking the replication machinery of the host. They concluded that these compounds could be used as upregulators of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (REDD1), a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, which is a defense factor [
 <xref rid="B147-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Cho and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B144-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] carried out a FP-based screening study that identified six promising molecules as NS1 inhibitors. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was selected as the most effective using a minimal dosage. They proposed that EGCG interferes with the binding of dsRNA to NS1 because it interacts with Arg38, which is essential for dsRNA binding. You and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B145-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] also used FP-based assays to test a family of quinoxalines, which share a bicyclic ring with the ability to incorporate polar side chains. They conducted a SAR study concluding that two compounds were effective at binding to the NS1 dsRNA binding domain, inhibiting the binding of dsRNA. Martínez-Gil and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B148-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] tried a different approach. After high-throughput screening, compound C3 came up as a potential candidate against influenza’s infections since its effect of increasing IFN levels was not affected by NS1, apparently because it activated a different pathway or because it acted downstream of NS1’s targets. This molecule seems promising as a broad-spectrum antiviral since its action is not NS1 dependent, but, instead, IFN inductive. Maroto and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B146-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] used radiolabeled RNA to check if the NS1’s binding site to vRNA could be a new antiviral drug target and, if so, to identify some contenders. They analyzed 27,520 compounds and three of them could decrease NS1-vRNA binding proving that this could be a target for new drugs.
