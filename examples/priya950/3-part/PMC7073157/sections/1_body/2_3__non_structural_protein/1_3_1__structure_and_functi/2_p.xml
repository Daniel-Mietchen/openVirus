 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. RBD has two long antiparallel α-helices (from Asn4 to Asp24; and Pro31 to Leu50) linked by a short loop and a third helix (from Ile54 to Lys70) before the linker region [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RBD dimerizes forming a group of six antiparallel α-helices. A pair of highly conserved Arg38 residues, one per dimer subunit, seem to play a critical role in the interaction with dsRNA, in addition to a charged residue, lysine, at position 41 (Lys41) [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Some authors propose that binding to dsRNA allows NS1 to assemble into an oligomeric tubular structure that protects the dsRNA molecule, and thus block cellular antiviral processes [

 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The ED has a seven-strand twisted β-sheet as its main structural element. The structure is comprised by an initial β-strand in the N-terminus followed by a short helical element, five main antiparallel β-strands, a α-helix across the β-sheet, and an additional β-strand before the C-terminus region [
