<p>NS1 is a highly conserved [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and multifunctional protein with approximately 26 kDa molecular weight and 215 to 237 amino acids, resulting from the collinear transcription of the eighth vRNA segment. This viral protein has four different structural regions: two globular domains, a linker region, and a C-terminal disordered “tail”. The N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) comprises the first 73 amino acid residues, the effector domain (ED) residue 85 onward until the end of the structured part of NS1, and the C-terminal tail (CTT) is a disordered region with about 20 residues. The linker region (LR), a short and flexible region with a variable number of residues, connects both globular domains [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. NS1 can adopt different conformational states due to the high flexibility and variable composition of the linker region [
