<p>In cells, full-length NS1 is likely a homodimer [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with several conformational states as “open”, “semi-open”, and “closed” [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01511-f003">Figure 3</xref>A–C, respectively. Previous studies have hypothesized that NS1 conformational states are strain dependent with variations being attributed to different linker sizes and residue composition [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, more recently, evidence has been provided that even in the presence of a shorter linker, it is possible to observe open conformations [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Taken the available full-length structures of NS1, it has been proposed that NS1 can shift between different oligomeric conformational states, depending on the function being carried out. This could be related to cellular location, virus lifecycle, or even the presence of different molecular partners with whom NS1 interacts [
