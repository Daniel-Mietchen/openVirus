<p>SUMOylation is a post-translational modification by the SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) family of proteins which is involved in cellular processes like nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, protein stability, response to stress, and progression through the cell cycle [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. SUMOylation of NS1 by SUMO1 occurs in residues Lys219 and Lys221, both in the CTT, increasing NS1â€™s stability [

 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Some authors argue that SUMOylation happens not only by SUMO1 but also by SUMO2/3 and that the influenza viruses upregulate SUMOylation since it favors viral multiplication [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Lys219 and Lys70, which are conserved residues across viral strains, are crucial to abrogate the IFN signaling pathway associated with SUMOylated NS1. There are multiple potential sites for SUMOylation in NS1, but there seems to exist an intermediate optimal level of SUMOylation for maximal NS1 activity and pathogenic potential [
