<p>ISGylation, the conjugation of proteins with ISG15 (Interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein), has been demonstrated at several NS1 residues. The ISG15 conjugation system targets Lys41 at the nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1) on the RBD, blocking NS1’s interaction with importin-α, critical to nuclear importation, hence decreasing the rate of viral replication [
