<p>The influenza virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of virus. There are four types (A, B, C and D) of influenza virus but only A, B, and C infect humans. Human influenza A and B are the virus types responsible for the seasonal flu epidemics, whereas influenza type C infections generally cause mild illness. Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics. The influenza viruses from types A and B are pleomorphic with size ranging from 80 to 120 nm. Their shape is typically spherical but can acquire a cordlike shape. The C-type influenza viruses are filamentous and can be up to 500 nm long [
