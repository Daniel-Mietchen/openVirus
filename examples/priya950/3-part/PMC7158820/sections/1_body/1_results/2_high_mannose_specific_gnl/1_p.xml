<p id="p0055">Although the analyzed HAs contained variable amounts of high-mannose type glycans, all included at least low levels of oligomannose, raising the possibility that they could be specifically labeled by a mannose-selective lectin, and subsequently used for detection. GNL is a commercially available, non-Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent lectin with specificity for α1-3-linked mannoside sugars found in high-mannose type N-glycans, making it a candidate to detect HAs and IAVs in glycan array experiments. While our glycan arrays contain N-linked glycans with a Man

 <sub>2</sub> core, GNL does not appear to be able to bind complex-type glycans with terminal sialic acids and gave minimal background reactivity with sialylated N-linked glycans on the array (

 <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>). To assess detection of purified IAV HAs, the same panel of six human and avian HAs used for MS analysis were applied to microarrays, either as a pre-incubated complex with anti-His and AF488-labeled secondary antibodies (standard protocol, see 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>) or by direct incubation of pure HA trimers on the microarray surface, followed by washing and incubation with a pre-formed complex of biotinylated GNL and AF488-labeled streptavidin. Detection of bound samples via GNL staining of high-mannose glycans was comparable to that achieved with antibodies in all cases, with specificity patterns and binding fingerprints appearing qualitatively matched (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> ). Furthermore, GNL detection was also able to enhance signals of weaker-binding glycans, presumably due to more robust staining of multiple high-mannose glycosites per trimer.
