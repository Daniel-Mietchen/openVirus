<p id="p0075">In contrast to the limited neutralization of the virus panel by mAbs, GNL targeting of high-mannose glycans gave consistently strong neutralization. Indeed, GNL showed neutralizing activity, independent of underlying sequence and antigenic drift variants, against all five virus samples examined, with MN titers comparable to the best specific mAbs for each virus (
