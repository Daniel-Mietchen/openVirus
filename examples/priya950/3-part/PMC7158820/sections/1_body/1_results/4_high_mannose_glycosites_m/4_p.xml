<p id="p0095">The top of the HA molecule is relatively undecorated in most viral subtypes, with the exception of H5 and recent human H3 viruses (

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Imai et al., 2012</xref>). The top of Vic/11 H3 is densely covered by multiple glycans and contains fully occupied glycosites at N63, N126, and N133, and partially occupied species at N45 and N144, that are not observed in other HAs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, the structure and location of two significant high-mannose glycosites in Vic/11, N165 and N285, are analogous to oligomannose sites in H1 and H5 (compare 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4C), while a third unique site, N133, is positioned nearby, creating the appearance of a “high-mannose patch” (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). While all three of these glycans appear close to the RBS, the modeled high-mannose glycan at N165 lies extremely nearby and appears the most likely target for neutralization by GNL. That N165 and N285 are conserved in all H3 HAs since 1968 (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>) also provides a rationale for observed broad neutralization within this group. All modeled high-mannose glycans in Vic/11 H3 appear to pack closely against the surface of the HA molecule, similar to those described above. Together, these data suggest a model whereby IAVs, particularly those associated with human infection, select for increased glycosylation around the HA head domain, and that evolution of predominantly high-mannose species at particular glycosites may be controlled by structural and/or sequence features within HA itself.
