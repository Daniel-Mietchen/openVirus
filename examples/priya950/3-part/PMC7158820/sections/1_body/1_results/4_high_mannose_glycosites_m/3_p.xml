<p id="p0090">Above the glycan ring most HAs are quite undecorated, particularly those of avian origin (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D–4F). Tai/13 H6 and Shang/13 H7 present with the simplest and most homogeneous glycosylation, maintaining both minimally decorated head domains and mainly complex glycans at every observed glycosite (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and 4E). Interestingly, while the glycosylation profile (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) of Tai/13 is most closely matched to Shang/13, the location of all four observed glycosites is most closely conserved in Viet/04 H5 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D), however, the attached species vary strongly. Interestingly, structural or positional variances that might impair mannosidase processing in Viet/04, relative to Tai/13, are less readily observed than in H1 and H5, with glycan conformations in respective glycosylated structures appearing highly similar (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>C). Within group 2 HAs, Shang/13 H7 and Jiang/13 H10 feature several matched or comparable glycosites, including predominantly complex-type glycans at N22, N38, N411, and N483 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). Shang/13 and Jiang/13 also contain one comparably positioned glycan with heterogeneous occupancy at N240 and N242, respectively (N240 is 100% complex in H7, while N242 is only 51% complex in H10; 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Glycosylated models of N240 and N242 reveal that the attached glycoforms possess very different conformations, with Shang/13 N240 pointing directly out from the HA surface in an open conformation, while Jiang/13 N242 projects directly up toward the top of HA, and packs closely against the protein surface, potentially reducing access for processing (
