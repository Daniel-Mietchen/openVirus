<p id="p0080">Quantitative glycoproteomics data (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) reveal the presence of high-mannose type glycosites in both the H1N1 and H3N2 human IAV strains; however, GNL neutralized only H3N2 virus (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), implying differences in the localization of high-mannose glycans within the two strains. To better understand such glycosylation differences, we set out to look at the glycosylation data for the six HAs in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in the context of their three-dimensional structures. Due to their conformational flexibility, HA glycans are not typically found in crystal or cryo-electron microscopy structures deposited in the PDB. We therefore employed a computational approach to assign energy-minimized glycan structures and conformations 
 <italic>de novo</italic> at glycosites on the recombinant HAs (see 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>A). Shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> are the top and side views of each of the six HA subtypes, with energy-minimized glycan structures modeled at each glycosite, and colored according to the dominant glycan type determined by MS (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Predominantly high-mannose and complex-type glycans are shown in green and purple, respectively, while sites with at least 30% of each type are designated “mixed” and colored orange. Sites with substantial high-mannose content (green) are present only in H1, H3, and H5, and are located exclusively within the HA1 subunit, with the vast majority found adorning the antigenically dominant head domain that contains the RBS (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A–4C). While further broad similarities among the panel are mainly confined to subgroups, e.g., within human or avian origin, or phylogenetic group 1 and 2 HAs, all six HAs contain one mainly complex-type glycan at N483 that occupies a very similar conformation (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).
