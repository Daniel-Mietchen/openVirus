<p id="p0085">Covering the interface between the head and stem domains in all HAs, there is a reasonably conserved “glycan ring” composed mainly of complex glycosites. These glycans include the comparable pairs of N21 and N33 (group 1 HAs), and N22 and N38 (group 2 HAs), N278 (H1), N285 (H3), N289 (H1 and H5), and N411 (H7 and H10). The glycan ring appears to form a relatively closed shield, obstructing access to the top of the stem domain that forms the core of the HA membrane-fusion machinery. Within Cal/04 H1 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), the ring harbors two predominantly high-mannose glycosites, N278 and N289, located immediately at the head-stem interface. A similarly located glycosite in Vic/11 H3, N285, is also predominantly high-mannose (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), while N289 in avian Viet/04 H5 is 100% complex type (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Although Cal/04 N289 is somewhat close to N278 in the primary sequence, suggestive of hindrance to processing by α-mannosidases, structural analysis suggests this region to be uncrowded in both H1 and H5 (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4C). Sequence and structural alignments reveal subtle differences around the Cal/04 and Viet/04 N289 positions that may account for the strong divergence in attached glycoforms (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> ). Within Cal/04 H1, the N289 glycosite comprises an “NTS” glycosylation sequon, compared with “NSS” in Viet/04 (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). In the Cal/04 structure, the hydrophobic methyl group on T290 appears rotated into a small hydrophobic pocket created by the side chains of T280 and P306, leading to a rearrangement of the amino acid backbone relative to Viet/04 and an approximate 45-degree rotation of the N289 side chain in toward the protein surface (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C). Final energy-minimized models of the glycosylated form of Cal/04 N289 reveal that the attached glycan lies closely packed against the HA surface, rather than in an extended solvent-accessible form as for Viet/04 (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), likely contributing to reduced access for processing and the consistent observation of a high-mannose species at this position. Similar structural variances are also evident for Cal/04 N94, whose location within a shallow pocket beneath the major part of the head domain and proximal to the trimer interface, appears to result in a similar high-mannose glycoform closely contacting the HA surface (
