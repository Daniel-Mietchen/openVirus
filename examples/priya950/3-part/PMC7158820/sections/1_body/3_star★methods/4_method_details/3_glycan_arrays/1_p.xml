<p id="p0165">For antibody detection, recombinant HA trimers (50 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup> final) were pre-complexed with the anti-His mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Alexa488-linked anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4:2:1 molar ratio for 15 min on ice in 50 μl PBS-T. This complex was incubated on the array surface in a humidified chamber for 60 min before washing and analysis. For GNL detection, recombinant HA trimers (50 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup> final) alone in 50 ul PBS-T were incubated on the array surface in a humidified chamber for 60 min, followed by washing and further incubation with a complex of GNL:Streptavidin-Alexa488 for 60 min. For whole viruses, virus stocks diluted to 256 HAU (final) in PBS, 3% BSA were incubated on the array surface in a humidified chamber for 60 min, followed by washing and incubation with either GNL:Streptavidin-Alexa488 or antiviral monoclonal antibodies or antisera for a final 60 min. Unlabeled antiviral reagents were detected with Alexa488 anti-mouse or anti-sheep secondary antibodies incubating for 60 min. Following final washing, all arrays were scanned using an Innoscan 1100AL microarray scanner (Innopsys). A complete list of the glycans on the array is presented in
