<p id="p0170">For HAI, anti-Cal/04 (FR507), anti-Per/09 (FR553), and lectin stocks were diluted to 20 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup> before making 2-fold serial dilutions across 96-well U-bottom plates (final concentration range = 10 – 0.005 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup>). Pre-titered Cal/04 (H1N1) and Per/09 (H3N2) viruses were applied to each well at 8 HAU (final) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Hemagglutination inhibition was analyzed through addition of 0.5% (final) turkey red blood cells, and titers read after a 30-45-minute incubation at room temperature. All titers were calculated in triplicate and values averaged. For microneutralization, all antibodies and GNL were diluted to 20 μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup> before making 10-fold serial dilutions (range = 2.0 – 2.0e
 <sup>-7</sup> μg ml
 <sup>-1</sup>) in microtiter plates. Pre-titered Bris/07, Per/09, Vic/11, Switz/13, and HK/14 were applied to each well at 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> ml
 <sup>-1</sup> (final; in virus media containing TPCK-trypsin) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, 100 μl of each sample was applied to three wells of a 96-well plate containing MDCK (all viruses except HK/14) or MDCK-SIAT1 (HK/14 only) and incubated for 72 hours. Viral growth/neutralization titers were determined by analyzing CPE and hemagglutination of the final supernatant by mixing 1:1 with 0.5% (final) turkey red blood cells in 96-well U-bottom plates. All microneutralization assays were repeated in biological triplicate and average titers calculated.
