<p id="p0175">PDB entries for Cal/04 (3LZG), Vic/11 (4O5N), Viet/04 (2FK0), Tai/13 (4XKD), Shang/13 (4N5J), and Jiang/13 (4XQO) were downloaded and edited manually to remove all non-protein components including ligands, solvent molecules, and a minimal number of paucimannose type glycans from insect cell expression. For glycan modelling, all protein models were edited into two forms, containing either a single HA protomer or one single HA trimer. Protein models were uploaded to the Glycoprotein Builder tool within the web implementation of GLYCAM (Woods Group, 2005–2019) (

Since only one glycoform could be assigned per glycosite, the major (&gt;50% either complex, high-mannose, or no glycan) glycoconjugate as determined in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> was selected for inclusion to produce a view of a “typical” HA trimer likely present on the surface of each virus. To reduce the complexity of simulations and minimize over-estimation of the HA glycan footprint, one of three simple, commonly observed glycoforms were selected for oligomannose or complex, and are modeled as either Man
 <sub>9</sub> (oligomannose &gt;70%), Man
 <sub>5</sub> (oligomannose &gt;50%), or asialo-LacNAc
 <sub>1</sub> biantennary glycans (all complex &gt;50%; see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref> for structures). This determination was made since previous studies have shown that glycosites with very high oligomannose occupancy strongly tend towards entirely unprocessed Man
 <sub>9</sub> glycoforms, whereas lower high-mannose fractions are more commonly observed as Man
 <sub>5</sub> (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Khatri et al., 2016</xref>). Expected rotamer geometries for the Manα1–6Manβ bond(s) in both glycans were set as commonly observed forms: gg and gt (ω = 60 and 180° respectively) (

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Wormald et al., 2002</xref>). Conformations of all attached glycans were then energy minimized using the GLYCAM06 forcefield (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kirschner et al., 2008</xref>) deployed within Glycoprotein Builder. All final structural and surface figures were assembled in Pymol (Schrödinger, LLC) using fully-glycosylated HA trimers. Majority (&gt;70%) oligomannose and complex glycans were colored green and purple, respectively, while mixed occupancy species are shown in orange.
