 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2018</xref>)). Briefly, approximately 50 μg of each HA was denatured with 8 M urea in 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 6), followed by DTT and iodoacetamide treatments to reduce and alkylate the protein. The resulting protein was divided into aliquots for proteolytic digestions, including triple digestion (

Each of the samples generated from different proteolytic digestions was deglycosylated with Endo H, followed by PNGase F treatment. The samples were then analyzed on a Fusion Orbitrap tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS spectra were searched against the European Bioinformatic Institute (IPI)
