<p id="p0100">Through minor evolutionary drift of human seasonal strains and major reassortments of avian viruses, IAVs pose a significant and complex challenge to health (

Zoonotic IAV strains adapt to transmission among human hosts initially through changes in receptor specificity, increased HA stability, replication-enhancing polymerase mutations, and, subsequently, through antigenic drift within the HA head and addition of head-domain glycans. While research in many of these areas has matured significantly during the last decade, particularly with respect to receptor specificity switching (

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>), details of IAV glycosylation and evolutionary or adaptive changes to the HA glycome remain poorly understood. This is in-part due to substantial technical challenges, meaning many studies employ non-site-specific or poorly quantitative techniques to interpret glycosylation patterns, while more advanced methods have proved labor-intensive and extremely low-throughput, revealing only limited insights. Knowledge of HA glycosylation and links to antigenicity are of increasing interest, since despite long-running immunization programs, development of effective and broadly protective IAV vaccines has remained difficult and represents a major research goal (
