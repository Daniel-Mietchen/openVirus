<p id="p0125">While our study adds significantly to the number of IAV HAs for which site-specific glycome data are now available, these results still focus on comparatively isolated examples and clearly substantial further investigation will be required to determine links between enhanced high-mannose glycosylation and HAs with apparent adaptation to human hosts. Development of vaccine and analogous strategies that better take into account HA glycosylation status will likely enhance protection, especially within highly glycosylated human seasonal IAV strains and contribute toward the goal of universal influenza vaccines. Furthermore, that GNL is also able to universally label HA and IAV samples on glycan microarrays provides a significant advance in our ability to screen receptor-binding profiles in new and emerging virus strains and may well contribute to ongoing surveillance efforts.</p>
