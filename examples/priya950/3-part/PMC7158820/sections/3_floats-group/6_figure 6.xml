  <p>Quantitative Glycomic Analysis of H3 Precursors</p>
  <p>All graphs show percentage occupancy of specific N-linked glycoconjugates with either complex type (purple), high-mannose or hydrid type (green), or no glycan (gray), at individual glycosites within A/Duck/Ukraine/1/1963 (A; H3 precursor to 1968), and A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (B; 1968 H3N2 pandemic strain). Bars are distributed along the x axis according to relative position in the primary sequence, with specific glycosites depicted by numbering of the glycosylated asparagine (N). Histograms depict average occupancy with error bars showing standard error.</p>
