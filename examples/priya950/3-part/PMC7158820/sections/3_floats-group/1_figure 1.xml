  <p>Glycoproteomic Analysis of Diverse Influenza Virus HAs</p>
  <p>Shown is the glycosylation status of each HA N-linked glycosite (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) with either complex type (purple), high-mannose or hybrid type (green), or no glycan (gray), at individual positions within Cal/07 H1 (A), Vic/11 H3 (B), Viet/04 H5 (C), Tai/13 H6 (D), Shang/13 H7 (E), and Jiang/13 H10 (F). Bars are distributed along the x axis according to relative position in the primary sequence, with specific glycosites depicted by numbering of the glycosylated asparagine (N). Two glycosites in H6 for which corresponding glycopeptides could not be detected in the MS analysis are shown as open gray bars. A glycosite at position N8 in Vic/11 H3 has been excluded due to protein stability, all H3 constructs include only the folded ectodomain (residues 11–521). Histograms depict average occupancy with error bars showing standard error.</p>
