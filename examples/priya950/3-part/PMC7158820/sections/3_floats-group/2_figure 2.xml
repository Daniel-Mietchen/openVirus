  <p>Comparison of GNL versus Anti-His Staining of Recombinant HAs on the Glycan Array</p>
  <p>(A–F) Direct staining of high-mannose glycan on recombinant HA trimers with GNL (right panels) gives strongly comparable data to traditional anti-His staining (left panels) for all HAs: Cal/07 H1 (A), Vic/11 H3 (B), Viet/04 H5 (C), Tai/13 H6 (D), Shang/13 H7 (E), and Jiang/13 H10 (F). Particularly relevant for universal virus receptor specificity analysis, GNL robustly detects HAs of human and avian IAVs, even those with low content of high-mannose glycans. Bars depict mean intensity minus mean background of the four median out of six total replicate observations with error bars showing standard error.</p>
