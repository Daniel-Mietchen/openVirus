  <p>(A–F) Glycomics data determined in 
   <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> were used to inform modeling of likely glycan structures at each individual glycosite across all six HA candidates: Cal/04 H1 (A), Vic/11 H3 (B), Viet/04 H5 (C), Tai/13 H6 (D), Shang/13 H7 (E), and Jiang/13 H10 (F) using GLYCAM. Figures depict complete HA trimeric ectodomains (shown as gray surface models) in side view (left) and top view (right). The structure and position of individual N-glycans are shown as color-coded surfaces: &gt;70% complex (purple), &gt;70% high-mannose/hybridG (green), and mixed occupancy (orange) and are labeled according to the protomer they belong to (either A, B, or C; see top view). The trimer interface in each HA is defined by broken lines in top view. Unoccupied (no glycan) or unobserved (glycopeptides that could not be detected) glycan positions are not modeled. The location of the RBS is labeled for each HA and a bound Neu5Ac-Gal disaccharide (purple and yellow spheres) modeled within each for illustration. Complex, high-mannose, al and NeuAc species color schemes are according to the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) guides for Neu5Ac, mannose, and galactose, respectively.
