<p>Skin melanoma has generally been classified according to the origin of the sun exposure, the degree of cumulative UV exposure, age at the time of diagnosis, types of oncogenic drivers and the mutational load [
 <xref rid="B2-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is known that B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF), neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and NRAS mutations, together with a high mutational load related to UV exposure, are the main genetic drivers [
 <xref rid="B3-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cases of periodic sun exposure are usually associated with BRAF
 <sup>V600E</sup> and a lower mutational load [
 <xref rid="B2-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is important to mention that each melanoma subtype may evolve from different precursor lesions, which can involve different gene mutations as well as different transformational stages [
