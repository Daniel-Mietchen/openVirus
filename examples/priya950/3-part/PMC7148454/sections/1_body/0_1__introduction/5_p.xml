<p>Electrochemotherapy (ECT) combines two cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin and bleomycin) with high-intensity electric pulses, which enhances the delivery of the drug into cells [

 <xref rid="B22-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This approach has been used for the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous melanoma nodules [
 <xref rid="B23-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The overall response was 85%, and no major negative adverse events were reported [

 <xref rid="B24-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PDT is considered a minimally invasive procedure that requires a photosensitizer. Absorption is superior in metabolically active tissues [
 <xref rid="B24-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The method applies non-toxic compounds, which create reactive oxygen species (ROS) when combined with oxygen [
 <xref rid="B25-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. ROS does irreversible damage to tumor cells and tumor-associated blood vessels, and contributes to the activation of various antitumor, immune and inflammatory responses [

 <xref rid="B28-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although PDT can be applied to both nonmalignant and malignant diseases, several reports show that PDT alone has only limited efficacy in melanoma [
 <xref rid="B22-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To improve PDT results, certain protective mechanisms, like pigmentation and oxidative stress resistance, need to be overcome [

 <xref rid="B30-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The combination of PDT and dacarbazine chemotherapy displayed resistance reduction in pigmented and unpigmented metastatic melanomas [
 <xref rid="B31-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, combination of PDT and immunotherapy may increase the effect of eradication of the initial tumor and decrease in melanoma recurrence [
