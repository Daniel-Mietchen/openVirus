 <xref rid="B1-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In men the incidence of melanoma is three times higher than in women by the age of 75. Ultraviolet (UV) light is known to be the main cause of malignant melanoma. A history of sunburn in childhood or adolescence has been suggested to be directly associated with the development of melanoma. Other risk factors include the number of melanocytic nevi, family history and genetic background. It has also been confirmed that patients with a previous history of melanoma are more prone to develop multiple primary melanomas [
