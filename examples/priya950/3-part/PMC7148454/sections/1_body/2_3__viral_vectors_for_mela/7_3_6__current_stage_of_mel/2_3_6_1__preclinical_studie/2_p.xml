<p>Alphavirus vectors have shown promising potential in cancer treatment because of easy and fast production of high-titer recombinant particles and the possibility of administration of transcribed RNA or layered plasmid DNA [

Another aspect that makes alphaviruses attractive is their capacity for extreme cytoplasmic RNA replication and transient high-level recombinant protein expression. Compared to an adenovirus vector, SFV-based HPV E6-E7 immunization required 100- to 1000-fold lower doses to evoke similar therapeutic responses in a mouse model [

Another important aspect is that alphaviruses do not possess widespread immunity in human and animal populations, despite some epidemics reported for certain alphaviruses such as SFV, SIN and VEE [
