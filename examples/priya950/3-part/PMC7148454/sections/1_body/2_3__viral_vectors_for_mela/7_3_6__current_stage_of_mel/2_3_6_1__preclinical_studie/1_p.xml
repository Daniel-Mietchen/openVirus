<p>Tumor targeting represents one important consideration when using alphaviruses for cancer treatment. It has been reported that SIN particles possess natural tumor targeting. After subcutaneous administration of SIN-IL12 in mice implanted with tumor xenografts the tumor load was reduced to 6.2% of control mice [
