<p>Alphavirus DNA replicon vectors have been evaluated in animal models. In this context, expression of the HSV type 1 glycoprotein B from a SIN DNA vector elicited a broad range of immune responses, which included virus-specific antibodies, cytotoxic T cells and protection against lethal virus challenges in mice at a significantly lower dose compared to a conventional plasmid [

In another study, an SFV DNA replicon vector carrying the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) p80 (NS3) was administered into the quadricep muscles of BALB/c mice; this generated significant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity and cell-mediated immune responses against cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV [
