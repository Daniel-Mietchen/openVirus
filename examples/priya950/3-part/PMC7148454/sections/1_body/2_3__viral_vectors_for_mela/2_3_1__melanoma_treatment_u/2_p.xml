<p>TVEC replicates in tumor cells, which results in lysis and release of soluble tumor-associated antigens and viral pathogens. Migration and maturation of dendritic cells is induced by local GM-CSF expression, leading to ingestion of dissolvable tumor antigens and apoptotic tumor cells. The dendritic cells are transported to the nearest lymph nodes, where antigens initiate a systemic immune response, specifically in CD4+ and CD8+ helper and cytotoxic T-cells. However, the response rate in metastases is lower than in injected tumors, which reflects insufficient effector T-cell expansion. The other reason could be the lack of efficacy at distant sites. To overcome this limitation, combination therapy with TVEC and immune checkpoint blockers might provide better results [
