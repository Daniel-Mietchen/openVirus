<p>The first human study of TVEC was a phase I trial, involving 30 patients [
 <xref rid="B123-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Patients were chosen according to cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases from melanoma, breast cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [

Local intratumoral administration of virus was applied in order to reduce toxicity compared to systemic delivery, and this was well tolerated with only few adverse effects, like local inflammation and flu-like symptoms. Local reactions were dose-limited (10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL) and baseline HSV serologic status did not influence the effect of TVEC. However, a priming dose of 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/mL was established, followed 3 weeks later by increasing the dose to 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/mL every 2 weeks until disease progression was confirmed or unacceptable toxicity occurred [

Although objective responses were not seen in the trial, viral replication as well as GMâ€“CSF expression and HSV-antigen-associated necrosis were observed in melanoma, breast, head and neck cancer. Six patients manifested flattening of injected/un-injected tumors, and in four patients, systemic immune responses were obtained.
