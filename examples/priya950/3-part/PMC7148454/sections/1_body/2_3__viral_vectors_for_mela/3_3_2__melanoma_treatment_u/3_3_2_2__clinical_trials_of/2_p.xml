<p>The success of CAR-T based lentivirus therapy for hematological cancers such as ALL has also triggered treatment of solid tumors [
 <xref rid="B134-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. However, with tumors, the transition might be limited by therapeutic barriers such as CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, trafficking, and fate. In the context of melanoma, the first results from CAR-T cell therapy could not reproduce the findings from the treatment of hematological diseases [
 <xref rid="B135-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Issues to be addressed include the lack of migration of CAR-T cells from blood vessels to the tumor site, as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment within solid tumors, before this technology can be successfully applied for melanoma treatment.
