<p>Epidemics of infections with Zika virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, first emerged in Pacific islands (Yap 2007, French Polynesia 2013) followed by a big outbreak in South and Central America starting in 2015 [

Zika virus is a close relative of other important human pathogenic flaviviruses like dengue (DEN) virus, yellow fever (YF) virus, West Nile (WN) virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and Powassan virus. All these viruses are antigenically related and not only induce type-specific and protective antibodies, but also broadly flavivirus cross-reactive, non-protective antibodies [
