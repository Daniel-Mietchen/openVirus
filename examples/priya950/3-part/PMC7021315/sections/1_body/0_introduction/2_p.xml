<p>In sequential infections with different flaviviruses, anamnestic responses to shared epitopes can lead to the phenomenon of original antigenic sin, resulting in a strong boost of cross-reactive antibodies at the expense of type-specific antibodies to the newly infecting virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This situation can occur in regions where two or more flaviviruses co-circulate, such as the four dengue viruses in all tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world or dengue and Zika viruses in South and Central America or Southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Pre-existing cross-reactive immunity has thus the potential to affect the antibody response in different combinations of flavivirus infections and vaccinations, which not only includes the modulation of IgG specificities but may also impair the development of newly formed IgM antibodies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our study, we have therefore analyzed the antibody response in groups of individuals with recent Zika virus infections that were either flavivirus-naïve or had previously been vaccinated against TBE and/or YF.
