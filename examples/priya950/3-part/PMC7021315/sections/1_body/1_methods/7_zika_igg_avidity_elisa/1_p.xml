<p>Relative avidities of polyclonal serum samples were analyzed with Zika virus E protein in the flavivirus IgG ELISA described above including a short exposure to urea as performed in standard virus diagnostic assays [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Strep-Tactin XT plates were used for capturing the antigen as recommended by the manufacturer (IBA GmbH, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany) to avoid elution of the strep-tagged E protein from Strep-Tactin-coated plates by urea. After incubation of serum samples with the antigen, the plates were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature (RT) with and without 6M urea (Biorad, reagent for protein electrophoresis) in PBS pH 7.4 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Urea was added to the buffer immediately before use and did not change its pH. After the urea incubation step, the plates were washed twice with PBS pH 7.4 before the assay was completed and evaluated for titer determination as described for the flavivirus IgG ELISA. Relative avidities were calculated according to the following formula: Avidity (%) = (titer plus urea/ titer without urea) x 100. The performance of the assay was controlled using serum samples obtained early and late after Zika virus infection (
