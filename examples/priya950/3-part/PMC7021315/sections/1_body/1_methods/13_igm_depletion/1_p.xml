<p>1 ml anti-IgM agarose beads (Sigma) were mixed with 2 ml binding buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, pH 7.4) and were centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 g. The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed with 2 ml binding buffer. Mock depletions were performed with Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). Serum was diluted 1:2 in binding buffer and added to the beads. The mixture was incubated for 90 min at RT under gentle shaking. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 g, the supernatant was subjected to control ELISAs. Depletion was verified by Zika IgM ELISA (described above), and the presence of IgG was confirmed by the flavivirus IgG ELISA (described above), using the Zika virus E protein.</p>
