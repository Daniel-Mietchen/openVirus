<p>We analyzed serum samples from 62 patients who were diagnosed with an acute symptomatic Zika virus infection after returning to Europe from Zika-endemic areas. They developed Zika virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies, and 30 patients were Zika PCR positive (23 negative, 9 not tested). Samples from only two of these Zika patients exhibited a low degree of broad flavivirus cross-reactivity of IgM, as revealed by Rio Bravo (RB) and dengue IgM assays. Previous flavivirus immunity (YF and/or TBE vaccinations) was confirmed by neutralization assays (see below); the time points of vaccinations were not known to us. All serum samples were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56Â°C prior to serological testing. Pools were prepared from equal aliquots of serum samples.</p>
