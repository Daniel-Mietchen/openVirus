<p>TBE and YF NTs were performed as described previously [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Briefly, serial dilutions of serum samples were mixed with TBE virus strain Neudoerfl [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or YF virus strain 17D [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were added and incubation was continued for 3–4 days. In the case of YF virus, virus neutralization titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that was required for 100% protection against virus-induced cytopathic effects. Virus neutralization titers ≥20 were considered positive. Since TBE virus does not produce a cytopathic effect, virus replication and its inhibition was determined by measuring the presence of virus in the cellular supernatants using a four-layer ELISA as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The virus neutralization titer was defined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that gave a 90% reduction in the absorbance readout in the assay compared with the control without antibody. Virus neutralization titers ≥10 were considered positive.
