<p>MaxiSorp microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 28 ng/well polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgM (Dako) in carbonate buffer pH 9.6 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Diluted human serum samples were added for 45 min at 37°C. Bound IgM antibodies were then detected with the strep-tagged E proteins and Strep-Tactin-labeled HRP (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). For the quantitative Zika IgM ELISA, a Zika virus post-infection serum sample (TBE-pre-vaccinated patient) was included as a standard, set at 1,000 IgM arbitrary units (
