<p>It appears that the prominent role of IgM antibodies in virus neutralization in the early phase of human flavivirus infections and its function in protecting from severe forms of disease has been underappreciated so far. This is especially important in the context of sequential flavivirus infections in which IgM responses may be delayed and/or strongly diminished [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the case of sequential dengue virus infections, IgM levels may even be reduced to non-detectable levels [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). It is apparent that the effects described are transient due to dynamic changes of the proportions and avidities of IgM and IgG antibodies in the early phase of infection. Whether and/or how the differences observed can affect durable immunity may be the subject of future studies performed with samples collected more than one year after infection.
