<p>The FL appears to be cryptic in the cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structures of mature flaviviruses [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), suggesting differences in the accessibility of broadly cross-reactive epitopes in different flaviviruses. The differential behavior observed can be related to stronger dynamic motions of the dengue virus envelope or incomplete maturation of viral particles, both of which can lead to a better exposure of the FL epitope [
