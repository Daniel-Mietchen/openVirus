<p>For the analysis of Zika virus-specific antibodies, we used a recombinant Zika virus E protein with a C-terminal strep-tag and lacking the stem-anchor region (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). This protein crystallized as a dimer in the absence and presence of mabs recognizing an epitope that is dependent on the dimeric structure of E (E-dimer dependent epitope, EDE) [
