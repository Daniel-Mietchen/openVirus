<p>The pattern of Zika virus NT appeared very similar with samples of the naïve and pre-immune groups (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), neutralization of dengue virus was observed with almost all samples from the pre-immune group, whereas most of the samples from the naïve group were negative (
