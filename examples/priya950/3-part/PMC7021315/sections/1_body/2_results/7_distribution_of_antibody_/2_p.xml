<p>The distribution of IgM antibodies appeared similar at first glance, with a rapid rise followed by a decline in both groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), whereas no such difference was found with respect to the kinetics of IgM development (no significant difference between slopes of naïves and pre-immunes by applying a GLM as described in Methods, p = 0.187). The difference between the two groups was much more pronounced in IgG ELISAs with Zika and RB antigens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>), with a faster and more extensive rise of IgG titers in the pre-immunes (significant difference between slopes of naïves and pre-immunes by applying a GLM as described in Methods, p &lt; 0.001), consistent with an anamnestic booster response of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies.
