<p>Since increased infection of Fcγ receptor-positive cells is the result of an interplay between neutralizing and enhancing effects of antibody populations present in a given serum sample [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we also analyzed to which extent the presence of neutralizing IgM antibodies could affect IgG-mediated Zika virus ADE of infection. For this purpose, we determined the ADE profiles of the four serum pools before and after IgM depletion (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g004">Fig 4</xref>) despite the relatively strong variation observed for the mock-depleted controls. Using the area under the curve, this difference was highest in the naïve group (1,790-fold), and ranged from 78- to 131-fold in the pre-immune groups, indicating that the presence of neutralizing IgM antibodies had a strong suppressive effect on IgG-mediated ADE in all instances.
