<p>Since the pre-immune groups had significantly higher titers of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), we quantified their contribution to Zika virus neutralization and enhancement by depletion of these antibodies using the RB E protein. As shown by RB ELISA, cross-reactive antibodies were completely removed by this procedure (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Analysis of the depleted samples in Zika IgG ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) revealed that more than 60% of IgG reactivity were Zika virus-specific in the naïve group, contrasting to only 5.8 to 16.5% in the pre-immune groups, in which most of the total virus-specific IgG was broadly cross-reactive (94.2% to 83.5%). Avidity measurements before and after depleting cross-reactive antibodies with the RB E protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) revealed a significant reduction in all pre-immune groups but not in the naïve group. The data show that the newly synthesized Zika virus-specific antibodies (i.e. those not removed by RB depletion) had a low relative avidity in all groups (empty columns in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) with no significant differences, as determined by a GLM and Wald’s test as described in Methods (p = 0.556, 0.756, and 0.998). Depletion of cross-reactive antibodies had no influence on Zika virus neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6C</xref>)—consistent with the data displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2</xref> - and did not significantly affect Zika virus ADE (
