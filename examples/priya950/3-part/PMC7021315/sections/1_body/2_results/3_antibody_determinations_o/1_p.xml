<p>The four serum pools and individual sera (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) were tested in Zika and Rio Bravo (RB) IgM as well as IgG ELISA, and Zika NT. In all cases, the mean values of the pools were similar to those obtained with individual sera that were included in the pool (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and comparative statistical evaluation is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s010">S1 Table</xref>. The comparison revealed a significant difference between pool and individual serum data in only a single case (the naïve pool in RB IgG ELISA), due to an upward distortion caused by one of the individual samples. Without this distortion, the difference between the naïve and pre-immune pools would be even more pronounced. Zika IgG avidity could only be performed with the pools because of volume limitations of individual sera. All four groups produced high amounts of Zika virus-specific IgM antibodies, which were slightly higher in the YF-pre-vaccinated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). None of the pools contained detectable amounts of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive IgM antibodies as shown in an ELISA with the E protein of the distantly related RB virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which shares only approximately 40% of its amino acids with human pathogenic flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast to the IgM results, the Zika virus-specific IgG response was significantly higher in all pre-vaccinated groups than in the naïve group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This difference was even more pronounced in the RB ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), indicating a larger proportion of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies in the pre-immune groups. As also suggested by the higher relative avidities of these groups in Zika IgG ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), this pattern is consistent with an anamnestic booster response of IgG in the pre-vaccinated individuals. In the Zika neutralization test (NT), however, no differences were found among the four groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), showing that the broadly cross-reactive antibodies did not contribute significantly to the neutralization of Zika virus.
