  <title>Results of Zika virus neutralization of samples before and after antibody depletion with the Zika virus E dimer.</title>
  <p>(A) Serum pools. (B) Individual serum samples. The % residual neutralization after depletion is indicated in the empty columns. Mean titers were calculated from two independent experiments and error bars represent the range. Colored columns: mock depletion (mock dep), empty columns: Zika virus E depletion (ZIKV dep). n.t., not tested, because of volume limitation of the YF+ pool. S1 to S4: individual sera from each of the 4 groups.</p>
