  <title>Effect of IgM depletion from serum pools on ADE of Zika virus infection.</title>
  <p>Serum pools were depleted with IgM agarose beads as described in Methods. Fcγ receptor-positive K562 cells were infected with Zika virus in the presence of serially diluted (A) flavivirus-naïve pool, (B) YF pre-vaccinated pool, (C) TBE pre-vaccinated pool, and (D) YF and TBE pre-vaccinated pool. Colored symbols: mock depletion, empty symbols: IgM depletion. Data are shown as mean values +/- range from two independent experiments. Dotted line indicates no enhancement of infection. Comparison of fold-enhancement of Zika virus infection in the presence of depleted and mock-depleted pools was performed by applying a GLM as described in Methods. p-values are indicated in the graphs. ZIKV, Zika virus; naïve, flavivirus naïve serum pool; YF+, yellow fever pre-vaccinated serum pool; TBE+, tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool; YF+TBE+: yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool; mock dep, mock-depleted serum pool; IgM dep, IgM-depleted serum pool.</p>
