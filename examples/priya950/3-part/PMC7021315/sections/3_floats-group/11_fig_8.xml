  <title>Effect of depletion of cross-reactive antibodies from serum pools with Rio Bravo virus E on TBE and dengue virus neutralization.</title>
  <p>(A) TBE virus NT. (B) Dengue virus NT. IgG-containing serum pools were further depleted with RB virus E protein as described in Methods. Colored columns: mock depletion, empty columns: RB depletion. The dotted line indicates the cut-off (c.o.) of the assay. Mean NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers were calculated from two (A) or three (B) independent experiments. Error bars represent the range (A) or standard error of the mean (B). Significant differences between mock depletion and RB depletion are indicated by asterisks (2-way ANOVA with linear contrasts); ***, p &lt; 0.001. TBEV, tick-borne encephalitis virus; DENV1, dengue virus serotype 1; mock dep, IgM and mock-depleted serum pool; RB dep, IgM and Rio Bravo virus E-depleted serum pool.
