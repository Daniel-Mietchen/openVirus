  <title>Zika virus neutralization NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers by IgM after IgG depletion from serum pools.
  </title>
  <p>Colored columns: mock depleted pools containing IgM and IgG; empty columns: IgM only after IgG-depletion. NT titers are shown as mean values +/- SEM from three independent experiments. Numbers in the empty columns represent the means of percent IgM-mediated neutralizing activity (IgM NT) derived from three independent experiments. The dotted line indicates the cut-off of the assay. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers of mock and IgG-depleted pools (2-way ANOVA with linear contrasts); *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01. ZIKV, Zika virus; naïve, flavivirus naïve serum pool; YF+, yellow fever pre-vaccinated serum pool; TBE+, tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool; YF+TBE+: yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool; mock dep, mock-depleted serum pool; IgG dep, IgG-depleted serum pool.
