  <p>ADCC- mediating antibodies (ADCC-Abs) targeting different influenza antigens. HA, NA and M2 are the surface-exposed proteins and they are capable of inducing ADCC-Abs. Antibodies targeting the conserved epitopes in these proteins confer broad protection against divergent viruses. NP expressed on the surface of the influenza-infected cell serves as a promising target for ADCC-Abs.</p>
