  <p>Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-epitopes in HA. Antibodies targeting HA stalk, as well as HA head including esterase domain and trimer interface, can induce potent ADCC 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and elicit broad-spectrum protection 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. The HA structure is generated using PyMOL. A/California 04/2009 HA (PDB code: 3UBE) is used as a representative HA structure to show the location of ADCC-epitopes. Influenza HA is a trimer with each monomer comprised of HA1(wheat), vestigial esterase domain (orange) and receptor binding domain (pink), and HA2 (palegreen). The remaining two monomers are shown in light blue. Sialic acid is colored cyan. Side view of the HA trimer surface is shown in (
   <bold>A</bold>), while the top view of the HA trimer interface is shown in the cartoon (
   <bold>B</bold>) and surface (
   <bold>C</bold>) modes. Besides, there are ADCC-Abs targeting HA head with unknown epitopes [
