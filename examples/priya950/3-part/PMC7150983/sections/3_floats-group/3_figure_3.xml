  <p>Two synapses between effector cell and virus-infected cell are essential for robust ADCC activities. The interaction between Fc and FcÎ³RIIIa severs as the first synapse and the interaction between viral HA head and the sialic acid on effector cell form the second synapse, which are indispensable for inducing potent ADCC activities (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>). The HI-positive antibody may interfere with the interaction between viral HA head and the sialic acid on effector cell, leading to weak ADCC activity (
   <bold>C</bold>). HI assay was extensively performed to determine the effects of antibodies in blocking the receptor engagement and replication of the viruses. However, this evaluation may be challenged by some emerging influenza viruses that lack the ability to agglutinate red blood cells of various animal origins [
