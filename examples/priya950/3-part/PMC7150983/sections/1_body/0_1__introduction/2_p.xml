<p>Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two primary viral surface glycoproteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00276-f001">Figure 1</xref>) involved in critical steps of the influenza life cycle. The trimeric HA protein is comprised of two domains: the head domain and the stalk domain. HA head domain contains the receptor binding site (RBS) that binds to sialic acids (SAs) on the susceptible cells to initiate the virus’ replication cycle. After the virus is endocytosed, the fusion peptide in the HA stalk was exposed to mediate the membrane fusion towards releasing viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex into the cytoplasm and subsequently to the nucleus of infected cells [

After the newly assembled influenza virus buds from the infected cell, HA on the virion still interacts with the SA receptors on the host cell membrane. The tetrameric NA spike functions to release the viral progeny through cleaving α-ketosidic linkage between the SA and an adjacent sugar residue [
