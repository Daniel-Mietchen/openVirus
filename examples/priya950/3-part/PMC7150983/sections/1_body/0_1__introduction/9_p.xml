<p>Most therapeutic antibodies in development are IgG [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 in humans) exhibited different binding affinities to FcÎ³Rs as they differ in primary sequence and the associated structure. Of the four IgG subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 are used clinically for therapeutic purposes [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while the extensive application of IgG3 may be hindered by the its short serum half-life [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Both IgG1 and IgG3 can mediate potent ADCC activity, while IgG2 and IgG4 have a poor ADCC function [
