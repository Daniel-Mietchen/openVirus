<p>Vaccination is the best countermeasure to prevent and control influenza [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Live attenuated, inactivated and recombinant HA vaccines are the three types of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These vaccines conferred considerable protection in combating influenza by inducing antibodies that target HA. However, their efficacy can be significantly reduced when novel viruses emerge, or when there is a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the circulating influenza strain [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to develop a universal vaccine that could confer long-lasting protection against multiple influenza strains, including the drifted seasonal influenza viruses and antigenically distinct viruses. Several approaches are employed to achieve that goal, such as stalk-based immunogen [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], chimeric HA immunogen strategies [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA)-based vaccines [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Elicitation of antibodies exhibiting ADCC activities also contributes to the design of universal vaccines, which are thought to confer broad-spectrum protection [
