<p>Multiple parameters impact the potency of Fc-effector functions. FcRs expression pattern in these cells affects the potency of Fc-effector functions. FcRs are divided into activating and inhibitory receptors based on whether the receptor-mediated signal activates the ITAM or the opposing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The magnitude of NK cell responses critically relies on the integration of signals transduced by ITAM and ITIM [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. FcγRs are the most well-studied FcRs. Different FcγRs can vary significantly from antibody binding affinity to ADCC induction [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In human FcRs, FcγRI(CD64), FcγRIIa(CD32a), FcγRIIc(CD32c), and FcγRIIIa(CD16a) are activating receptors, while FcγRIIb (CD32b) is the inhibitory receptor [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Without the intervention of FcγRIIb as an inhibitory receptor to negatively regulate cell activation, NK cells serve as the predominant cells that can mediate potent ADCC responses
