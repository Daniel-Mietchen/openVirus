<p>NK cell activation assay is employed extensively to evaluate ADCC activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> due to its high-throughput and precision [

In this flow cytometry-based assay, recombinant proteins or virus-infected cells are coated in plates followed by the addition of antibody and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (or NK cell lines). Lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1 or CD107a) is a cell marker expressed on the NK surface and is employed in this assay to identify NK cellsâ€™ functional activities as the expression level of CD107a is highly correlated with cytokine secretion from activated NK cells [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Therefore, the potency of ADCC activities can be determined indirectly by measuring the activation marker CD107a expression on the NK cell surface. This assay has been widely used to assess ADCC activities evoked by antibodies against the influenza virus and HIV [
