<p>ADCC activity is measured indirectly by the release of 
 <sup>51</sup>Chromium(
 <sup>51</sup>Cr) following lysis of virus-infected target cells in early studies [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In this assay, the target cells are labeled with 
 <sup>51</sup>Cr and subsequently incubated with the appropriate antibody. The quantity of 
 <sup>51</sup>Cr released from the lysed cells is detected by a gamma counter as a correlate of ADCC activity [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. However, the biohazard problem of radioisotopes plus the testâ€™s low sensitivity restricts the wide application of this assay. For these reasons, nonradioactive assays with better sensitivity are later developed to assess ADCC activities [
