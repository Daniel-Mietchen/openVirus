<p>Flow cytometry-based ADCC assays are developed to measure ADCC activity by using different fluorescent dyes to differentiate living and dead cells [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In this assay, PKH-67 is used to label both live and dead target cells while dead target cells and effector cells are labeled with 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD). Instead of measuring reporter molecules released from target cells, this assay directly measures the lysed target cells. The quantification of lysed target cells is determined by measuring the double fluorescent dyes positive cells by flow cytometry. Target cell death in the absence of antibody is used as a background control. In 1990, Radosevic et al. reported their ADCC assay using different fluorochromes for cell staining with similar principles [
