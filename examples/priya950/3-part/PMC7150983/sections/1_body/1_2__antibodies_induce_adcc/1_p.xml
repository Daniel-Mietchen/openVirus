<p>As Fc-FcγR interactions are required to induce ADCC, effector cells must express FcγRs on membrane surface to facilitate Fc binding. The NK cell is not the only cell type that has the FcγRIIIa on the membrane, other Fc receptor-bearing cells, like neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) may also play a crucial role in mediating ADCC or ADCP for viral infected cell clearance [
