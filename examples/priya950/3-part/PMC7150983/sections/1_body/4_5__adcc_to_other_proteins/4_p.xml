<p>In addition to those proteins expressed on the viral surface, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) possesses highly conserved regions and is also detected on influenza virus-infected host cells surface [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This makes NP reachable by antibody and substantial efforts have been focused on the antiviral effects of anti-NP mAbs. The host immune response against NP may participate in multi-mechanisms against influenza infection. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can kill target cells via the recognition of NP antigen peptides presented by MHC-I molecules [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Berthoud et al. reported a T cell-inducing vaccine based on NP and M1, was safe and immunogenic in older adults [

These internal viral proteins have not only shown beneficial by inducing host CTL response, but also can serve as a target for protective mAbs. Jegaskanda et al. demonstrated that mAbs targeting M1 and NP can also elicit ADCC activity and these mAbs can be induced by influenza vaccination and natural infection in children [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. However, the protective role of anti-NP ADCC-Abs has not been investigated in animal models. Since internal viral proteins are more conserved, these ADCC-Abs may be considered to be included in future universal vaccine design.
