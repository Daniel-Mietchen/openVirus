<p>Firstly, epitopes in the vestigial esterase domain on HA head have also shown some promise as ADCC-Ab binding targets (

 <xref rid="B101-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Recent studies indicated that vestigial esterase domain-binding antibodies also elicit ADCC that may help to protect against viral infection [

Bangaru and colleagues found a monoclonal antibody, H3v-47, that not only can neutralize diverse H3N2 viruses and block progeny viruses release, but also induce potent ADCC activity, suggesting that Fc-effector functions are critical for both HA head and stalk targeting antibodies [

Interestingly, these researchers found that this multifunctional antibody can recognize a novel epitope that spans the vestigial esterase and receptor-binding subdomains. Similar Fc-mediated ADCC activity was observed in mAb 46B8 that targets the vestigial esterase domain of HA head of the influenza B virus [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In addition, the vestigial esterase domain is highly conserved, indicating a potential role in universal vaccine design.
