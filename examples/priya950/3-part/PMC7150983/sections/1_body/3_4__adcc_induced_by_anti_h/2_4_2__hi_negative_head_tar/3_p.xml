<p>Secondly, antibodies targeting epitopes in the trimer interface may also initiate Fc-effector activities. Watanabe et al. reported that antibody (S5V2-29) binding to a conserved epitope at the HA head trimer interface can also confer potent protection

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. However, the ADCC may not be essential to the protective role in mice. Historically, it is believed that the trimeric HA protein is so stable that the trimer interface may not be exposed to the host immune system and is likely unreachable by antibody but, contrarily, the epitopes identified by these researchers suggest that the trimer interface may be accessible, at least partially. As such, the trimer interface can be further explored as a potential target for vaccine and therapeutics.
