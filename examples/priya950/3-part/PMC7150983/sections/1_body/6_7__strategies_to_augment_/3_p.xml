<p>Other strategies have been attempted to promote the secretion of cytokines by activating effector cells. Reovirus and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can increase NK-mediated ADCC by facilitating cytokines secretion [

It has been reported that CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), TLR9 agonists, have the effect of promoting the cytokines secretion from an activated NK cell [
