<p>To tackle the threat posed by influenza viruses, developing a universal vaccine that can induce broad immune response against both seasonal drift strains and emerging strains with pandemic potential is of heightening priority of influenza research. Considerable effort has been focused on the development of therapeutic agents and universal vaccines against influenza virus infection in recent decades. Protective antibodies that bind to conserved epitopes in the HA head, HA stalk, NA, NP, M2e have been isolated and characterized in the vaccine research. Most influenza vaccinology studies aim to induce a high titer of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are capable of conferring broad and durable protection against influenza virus infection, but nnAbs are less investigated. However, it is difficult to induce bnAbs through natural infection and the effectiveness of bnAbs was compromised after the emergence of mutant viruses. Therefore, nnAb has become an alternative option and numerous studies have shown the different protective mechanisms of nnAbs and bnAbs [

The protective property exhibited by nnAb seems to make an equally potential candidate for universal vaccines and therapeutics against influenza infection. Therefore, Fc-dependent effector activities should be considered and recognized when we evaluate the protective effects of influenza therapeutic agents and vaccine candidates.
