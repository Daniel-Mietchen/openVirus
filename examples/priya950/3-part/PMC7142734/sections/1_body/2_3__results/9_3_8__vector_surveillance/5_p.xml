<p>During the home visits, mosquito larvae are collected to produce the Quick Index Survey for Aedes Aegypti. This consists of a quarterly larval sampling of A. Aegypti to estimate the infestation level. The index is used for directing vector control actions, as it presents the magnitude and distribution of mosquito infestation by type of breeding site.</p>
