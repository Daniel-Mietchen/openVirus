  <bold>D</bold>: The surveillance model needs to be adjusted in the epidemic and inter-epidemic phase. From a laboratory point of view, we are really compromised when we do not define it and use the same model in these two different scenarios. So, you end up overloading the laboratory at certain times [...] we have limited human resources, [...] and we often overburden the surveillance service as much as the laboratory when you do not have this very clear definition regarding the models.
