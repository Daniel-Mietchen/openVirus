<p>Basic tests, such as NS1 and serology, are performed in hospitals and emergency units. More advanced tests are performed in the Central Laboratory of the State. There are 27 central laboratories in the country, one for each state plus one in the DF. In these laboratories, every sample collected during the earlier stage of the disease is tested for the serotype, as it can be detected only during the viremic phase (day 1 to 3). Only 10% of the collected samples is eligible for that test, meaning that most of the patients access the health system after the opportune period.</p>
