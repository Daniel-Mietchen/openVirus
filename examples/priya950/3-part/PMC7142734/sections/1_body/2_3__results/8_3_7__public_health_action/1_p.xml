 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-02062" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The SDCC is a committee formed by representatives from various administrative bodies, with the purpose of developing an intersectoral approach for arboviruses control. It consists of weekly meetings with representatives of the fire department, urban cleaning service, companies connected to water and sanitation and infrastructure, and secretaries of education, infrastructure, urban development, and health logistics. The Geiplandengue (regional management for dengue control) has the same structure as the SDCC reproduced in the health regions and implements the decisions of the SDCC. This system, which started in 2016, is fundamental for a comprehensive and integrated response.
