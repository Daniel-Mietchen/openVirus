<p>Delays in the notification process occur during every phase of data collection. The first delay is caused by the health seeking behavior, as approximately 90% of patients reach the healthcare system during the convalescence phase, according to the interviewees. The second delay occurs during access to healthcare, caused by long waiting lines; this, among other problems, also deters the population from seeking medical attention, leaving part of the cases unreported. The third delay occurs in the notification, due to the overload of healthcare units as well as the necessity—in the UBS—to notify the case on paper and subsequently send it to the epidemiological surveillance to be digitized. The fourth delay, during the confirmation phase, is caused by the overburden of laboratories, which is considered by some interviewees to be the main weakness of the surveillance system. The last delay is in the completion of the forms. Due to the long wait of laboratory confirmation, many professionals forget to complete the notification form when they receive the test results.</p>
