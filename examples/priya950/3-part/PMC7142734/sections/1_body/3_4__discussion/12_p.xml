The selection of experts was also based upon recommendation, possibly introducing selection biases. The study was set in the DF, which is the only Brazilian state with no municipality; the functioning of the surveillance system, with different roles undertaken by municipality, state and federal government, might differ in other Brazilian states. Finally, as a qualitative work, the study does not entail any inferential statistical analysis, and does not provide any quantitative evidence of the described results. The use of numeric data from the SINAN is only intended to describe the sources and the content of the data collected by the surveillance system.
