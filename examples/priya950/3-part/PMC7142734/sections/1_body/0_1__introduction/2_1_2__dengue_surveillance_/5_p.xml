<p>To investigate the functioning of dengue surveillance in Brazil, the surveillance system of the Federal District (Distrito Federal (DF)) will be evaluated as a case study. The DF is the federal unit where the Brazilian capital (Brasilia) is located. Contrary to the other Brazilian states, the DF has no municipalities, as the capital city constitutes the entire territory of the DF. Brasilia is the third largest city in Brazil and its territory is endemic for dengue, which disproportionally affects urban areas. Being the location of the national Ministry of Health, its setting allows for interviewing experts on both a federal and local level.</p>
