<p>Laboratory confirmation is important for data collection, especially in areas where other arboviral infections co-exist [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-02062" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A cost-effective, rapid diagnostic test for dengue is available, the NS1. The rapid test can be complemented by viral isolation or, more commonly, by PCR, which is a molecular technique used to detect the presence of the virus RNA. The PCR test can diagnose dengue up to 7 days after the onset and can be used to determine the serotype [

Through laboratory confirmation, surveillance can exclude the co-circulation of other arboviroses and detect circulating serotypes, as recommended in the International Health Regulations. The detection of new serotypes in one area represents an epidemic potential and is associated with an increase in dengue-related deaths [
