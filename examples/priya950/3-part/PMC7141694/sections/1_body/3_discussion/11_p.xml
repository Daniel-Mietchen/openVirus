<p>For the CHIKV serological diagnosis, 11% were positive with both IgM ELISA and RT-PCR, while 31.3% were detected only by RT-PCR, indicating that use of IgM alone in clinical settings as diagnostic assay may be insufficient and may result in false negative cases. This may happen in early phase of disease when antibodies are not detectable due to neutralization with viral antigen.</p>
