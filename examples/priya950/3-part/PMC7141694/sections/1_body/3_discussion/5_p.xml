<p>GI manifestations were most pronounced in patients with DENV infection, with 53.8% of DENV cases as compared to 26.2% of CHIKV, a finding that may help differentiate the two infections in clinical setting. The association of DENV with GI symptoms has consistently been reported from other endemic regions. Ramos et al in their retrospective review of 8559 patients reported GI symptoms in 67% of DENV patients [
