<p>The patients were divided into four age groups comprising less than or equal to 1 year (infants), 2–18 years (youths), 19–64 years (adults) and more than 64 years (elderly). The frequency distribution of the various age groups encompassing groups 1 to 4 stated above was 48.2% (629/1306) for infants, 43.3% (566/1306) for youths, 8.2% (107/1306) for adults and 0.3% (4/1306) for elderly respectively. The mean (±
 <sc>s.d.</sc>) age of the studied cases was 6.05 (±9.536). The highest anti-CHIKV seropositivity rate was observed in infants (17.6%). Also, most of the dengue positive cases belonged to infants (7.9%). Although the CHIKV seropositivity rate was higher in infants, CHIKV seropositivity was not statistically significant based on the age group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.3). Besides, the observed difference between anti-dengue and age in this study was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.09).
