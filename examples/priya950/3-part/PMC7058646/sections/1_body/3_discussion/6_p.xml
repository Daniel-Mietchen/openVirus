<p>Since 2005, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have been found in Afghanistan, Algeria, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Syria, Turkey and Iran [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although outbreaks of suspected dengue occurred in Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Madagascar in 2005–2006, there is no report of autochthonous transmission of DENV from these countries so far [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Despite the fact that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is regarded as the primary vector traditionally, some recent epidemics were caused by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, which suggests that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is becoming superseded by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> due to virus mutation [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been distributed widely in Madagascar, Southern Europe and North and South America, Africa, the Indian Ocean and South East Asia via increased international travel and vehicle component such as water-containing tyres imported from elsewhere [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, vehicles travelling from Turkey, Bulgaria and Syria may introduce 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Iran [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A number of factors may have promoted the distribution of Aedes-borne viruses such as urbanisation [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], heavy rainfall [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], war and economic disturbance in Iraq, Syria and Yemen [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], migration [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and heavy trade in the Red Sea region [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], that may pose risk for spread of DENV from Pakistan to Iran or Afghanistan [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With this regard, a significant difference in the high CHIKV and dengue seropositivity rate in summer was observed (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in our study. On the other hand, vector mosquitoes are mainly active in the summer season [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Based on this finding, we could hypothesise that the vector active season has played an important role in facilitating the autochthonous transmission of imported viruses in Iran. Considering the fact that the presence of mosquito vectors, as well as the infectivity of these vectors, have not yet been studied in Iran since 2014, it is possible that these regions could be the foci of these vectors if the climate conditions were suitable.
