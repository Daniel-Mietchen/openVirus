<p>Given that chikungunya and dengue fever epidemic is engendered by either 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus,</italic> in a population with low herd or community immunity [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], it is not surprising that Iran may be at high risk for the occurrence of chikungunya and dengue fever epidemic. At this point, it is worth mentioning that the present study is not without its limitations. Firstly, the cross-reactivity between these arboviral infections particularly that of 
 <italic>Flaviviruses,</italic> with other viral infections such as West Nile Virus, which had been previously reported in Iran was not taken into consideration [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another limitation can be explained by the fact that polyclonal stimulation of the immune system or antibody persistence may have had an impact on the specificity of the positive results of the ELISA test. Hence, diagnostic reports should be accompanied by neutralisation assays including the detection or isolation of the virus from patients in order to confirm the presence of these viruses in Iran. The main strength of this study is the large sample size.
