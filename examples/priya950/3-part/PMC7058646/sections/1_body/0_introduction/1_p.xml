<p>Measles and rubella infections in Iran decreased due to the mass campaign of measles and rubella vaccination in 2003 [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but still, there are suspected cases. National Measles Laboratory (NML) in Tehran University of Medical Sciences receives samples for about 6000 suspected cases of measles and rubella in 1 year. Fortunately, the Measles/Rubella incidence rate is less than expected. It is worth noting that some other viral infections show similar signs with measles and rubella such as some arboviruses [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the past decade, a considerable global emergence/re-emergence of arboviral diseases occurred [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Arboviruses cause some of the most important emerging infectious diseases which are associated with fever and rash in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Of these viruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belonging to the alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] has re-emerged in Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, South and Southeast Asia, with an emergence seen in the Americas, the Pacific and Europe due to the transatlantic and transpacific migration of patients [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another arbovirus is dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family with four closely related but antigenically different DENV serotypes 1â€“4 [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is responsible for about 400 million estimated infections annually resulting in asymptomatic or mild dengue fever to dengue haemorrhagic fever [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, DENV infection is a major health threat and the most important human arbovirus disease in both the tropics and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The CHIKV and DENV transmission between humans occurs through different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species including 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes which are distributed throughout the world [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Signs of disease in CHIKV and DENV infections are associated with arthralgia, fever, rash and also other manifestations such as muscle pain, headache, nausea and fatigue [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Iran, the epidemiology of DENV and CHIKV remains poorly understood. Iran is a country located in West Asia. Iran is bordered to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan and to the west by Turkey and Iraq, countries where epidemics and endemics of arboviruses including CHIKV and DENV have occurred [
