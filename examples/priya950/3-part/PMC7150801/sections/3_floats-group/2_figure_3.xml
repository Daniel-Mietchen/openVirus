  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogeny of -ssRNA and dsRNA viruses. Putative viruses that may infect 
   <italic>S. titanus</italic> are in bold. All the phylogenies described in this manuscript used virus sequences and nomenclature as provided by Shi et al. [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Tree (
   <bold>A</bold>): Scaphoideus titanus bunya-like virus 1 within the “Bunya-Arena” clade; GenBank accession numbers of the viruses included in the phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Hubei bunya-like virus 9, APG79278.1; Shuangao Insect Virus 2, YP_009664561.1; Wuhan Mosquito Virus 2, YP_009305135.1; Kigluaik phantom virus, AIA24559.1; Wuhan mosquito virus 1, YP_009305130.1; Hubei diptera virus 7, APG79296.1; Hubei diptera virus 6, APG79294.1; Hubei odonate virus 8, APG79264.1; Hubei odonate virus 9, YP_009329871.1; Wuchang Cockroach Virus 1, YP_009304995.1; Ganda bee virus, APT68154.1; Hubei bunya-like virus, 8 APG79291.1. The collapsed branched named “
   <italic>Phasmaviridae”</italic> grouped five sequences: Jonchet virus, AKN56871; Hubei bunya-like virus 10, APG79271.1; Wuhan Insect virus 2, YP_009270651.1; Sanxia Water Strider Virus 2, AJG39245.1; Ferak virus, AKN56888. Tree (
   <bold>B</bold>): Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1 within the “Toti-Chryso” clade. GenBank accession numbers of the viruses included in the phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Cucurbit yellows-associated virus, CAA63099.2; Spissistilus festinus virus 1, YP_003800001.1; Circulifer tenellus virus 1, YP_003800003.1; Barrymore virus, QED21514.1; Persimmon latent virus, YP_009025166.1. Tree (
   <bold>C</bold>): Scaphoideus titanus reo-like virus 1 within the “Reo” clade. GenBank accession numbers of the viruses included in the phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Hubei reo-like virus 11, APG79151.1; Hubei reo-like virus 10, APG79149.1; Rice gall dwarf virus, YP_001111373; Rice dwarf virus, NP_620544; Homalodisca vitripennis reovirus, YP_002790884. Tree (
   <bold>D</bold>): Scaphoideus titanus associated partiti-like virus 1 within the “Partiti-Picobirna” clade. GenBank accession numbers of the viruses included in the phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Beihai partiti-like virus 11, APG78185.1; Hubei partiti-like virus 57, APG78229.1; Changjiang partiti-like virus 1, APG78201.1; Hubei partiti-like virus 56, APG78242.1; Wuhan large pig roundworm virus 1, YP_009329866.1; Xinzhou partiti-like virus 1, YP_009329867.1; Ustilaginoidea virens partitivirus 2, YP_008327312; Hubei partiti-like virus 55, APG78299.1; Hubei partiti-like virus 53, APG78297.1; Hubei partiti-like virus 54, APG78298.1. The collapsed branched named “
   <italic>Deltapartitivirus”</italic> grouped six sequences: Fig cryptic virus, YP_004429258; Rose cryptic virus 1, YP_001686786; Raphanus sativus cryptic virus 2, YP_001686783; Raphanus sativus cryptic virus 3, YP_002364401; Hubei partiti-like virus 58, APG78223.1; Persimmon cryptic virus, YP_006390091. The collapsed branched named “
   <italic>Gammapartitivirus”</italic> grouped five sequences: Fusarium solani virus 1, NP_624350.1; Penicillium stoloniferum virus S, YP_052856.2; Gremmeniella abietina RNA virus MS1, NP_659027.1; Botryotinia fuckeliana partitivirus 1, YP_001686789.1; Discula destructiva virus 1, NP_116716.1. Only bootstrap values higher than 70 are shown. Complete trees are provided in
