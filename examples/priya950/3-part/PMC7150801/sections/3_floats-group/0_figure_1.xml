  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogeny of +ssRNA viruses. Putative viruses that may infect 
   <italic>S. titanus</italic> are in bold. All the phylogenies described in this manuscript used virus sequences and nomenclature as provided by Shi et al. [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Tree (
   <bold>A</bold>): Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 and Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 2 within the “Iflaviridae-Secoviridae related cluster”.
