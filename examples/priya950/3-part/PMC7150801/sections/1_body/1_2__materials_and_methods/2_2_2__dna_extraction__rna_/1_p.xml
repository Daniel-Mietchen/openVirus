<p>Adult insects were frozen with liquid nitrogen, crushed with a micropestle in sterile tubes, and then subjected to either DNA or RNA extraction. DNA was extracted according to the method described by Marzachì et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For RNA extraction, samples were homogenized in TRI Reagent (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 g at 4°C to remove cell debris. RNA was extracted from supernatants with Direct-zol RNA Mini Prep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol with DNAse treatment. Concentration, purity, and quality of DNA and RNA extractions were estimated using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
