<p>Baculoviruses have been successfully used as safe and selective bioinsecticides to control mainly Lepidoptera, since their first commercial use in 1975 [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, the use of baculoviruses is still limited by their narrow host range, which exclude major plant pests such as those belonging to the order Hemiptera. Only two members of the families 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Nudiviridae</italic> were used so far for biological control of insect pests other than Lepidoptera: Cockroach densonucleosis virus against 
 <italic>Periplaneta fuliginosa</italic> (Blattodea) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Oryctes virus against 
 <italic>Oryctes rhinoceros</italic> (Coleoptera) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
