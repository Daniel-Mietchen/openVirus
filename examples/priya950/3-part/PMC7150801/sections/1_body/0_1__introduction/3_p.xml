<p>In this work we applied RNA-Seq to describe putative viruses that may infect wild-caught 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> populations in both its invasive (Europe) and native (United States) geographical areas. Comparisons between the two sampling areas allowed for the description of two completely different viral profiles, characterized by a reduction in the number of potential enemies in the European populations. Nine new complete or near-complete viral genomes were identified, representing seven virus families. An iflavirus identified in Europe, in particular, represented a potential candidate for future isolation and pathogenicity assays or for the construction of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) vectors to transiently knock-down insect genes involved in phytoplasma acquisition/transmission.
