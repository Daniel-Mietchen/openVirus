<p>Although the inventory of viruses identified in 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> does not include any member of the family 
 <italic>Baculoviridae,</italic> the species identified in this work have the potential to be used as natural enemies to control the insect vector. Unfortunately, most of them were identified in the St_USA library only and will not be given priority as potential biocontrol agents for the European 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> populations, in order to avoid issues related to the introduction of alien viral species. As far as it concerns the remaining two species, Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 and Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1, experimental investigations, such as isolation and pathogenicity assays, are required before proposing them as components of integrated pest management strategies. Viruses may not be necessarily lethal to their host, but just cause a reduction in its survival and fecundity, which in our case may decrease the overall insect density in vineyards and thereby Flavescence dor√©e incidence. Besides targeting insect vectors directly, they might also interfere with FDp acquisition and transmission. Studies on 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, in fact, demonstrated the existence of reciprocal interactions among insect antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-parasite immune responses that involve the Toll immune signaling pathway [
