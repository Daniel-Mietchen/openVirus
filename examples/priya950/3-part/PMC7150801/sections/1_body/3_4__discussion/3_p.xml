<p>Both metatranscriptomics and metagenomics rely solely on inferred homology to known viruses to identify putative viral sequences, as viruses do not share any specific genetic marker. Such an approach, however, precludes the discovery of viruses that lack closely related sequences. Consequently, we could not exclude that our libraries contained more viruses than the nine described in this work. Another issue raised by such sequencing studies is whether the newly discovered viruses are true infectious agents of the targeted host. Field populations of insects can, in fact, harbour viruses that infect the insect itself, viruses of microbes or pathogens associated with the insect, and viruses associated with ingested materials [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Viruses infecting insect microflora, in particular, could also be potential candidates for insect biocontrol (e.g., bacteriophages attacking primary bacteria symbionts), but their exploitation would require the knowledge of the exact composition of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> microbioma, which is so far fairly unexplored. All samples used in this work were caught in the wild, so the chance that some of the sequenced microorganisms were associated with insects only as environmental contaminants was very high. Therefore, we preferred to exclude bacteriophages and known plant viruses (e.g., Grapevine asteroid mosaic associated virus found in St_CH library) and retained only those viruses that are closely related to other insect-infecting viruses. The main ambiguity was represented by Scaphoideus titanus-associated partiti-like virus 1. After the taxonomic reorganization of 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic>, the family has now five genera: 
 <italic>Alphapartitivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betapartitivirus</italic> (fungi and plant viruses), 
 <italic>Gammapartitivirus</italic> (fungi viruses) 
 <italic>Deltapartitivirus</italic> (plant viruses) and 
 <italic>Cryspovirus</italic> (protozoa viruses) [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Scaphoideus titanus-associated partiti-like virus 1 clustered with two viruses identified in nematodes and formed a distinct clade only distantly related to 
 <italic>Deltapartitivirus,</italic> the phylogenetically closest genus among those officially recognized by the ICTV. This result was consistent with phylogenetic analyses presented in previous works [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], especially in the manuscript by Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which remarked that in the 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic> family it is possible to resolve well-supported clades that appear to be specific to invertebrate hosts. Despite that, conclusive evidence that a partiti-like virus could infect insects has never been reported in literature, so we preferred the indication “associated virus”.
