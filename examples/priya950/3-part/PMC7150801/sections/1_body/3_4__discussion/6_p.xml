<p>In addition to wild-type viruses, biotechnologically manipulated viruses in the form of VIGS could be used to interfere with the insect immune system or manipulate the expression of insect genes that are hypothesized to be associated with the acquisition and transmission mechanisms of phytoplasmas. From this perspective, Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 could be considered a good candidate for the construction of infectious clones. Indeed, an appropriate strategy to deliver virus-based biocontrol agents should be developed, especially for piercing-sucking insects like

In-field application of RNA silencing techniques in phloem-feeding insects poses, in fact, a great technical challenge, since the delivery should preferably occur through vascular tissues. In this regard, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) have been successfully delivered to psyllids and leafhoppers by root drench and trunk injections of grapevine and Citrus plants [
