 <italic>Scaphoideus titanus</italic> is native to North America and invasive in Europe. Sampling in Europe was quite straightforward, because this species is abundant in vineyards showing symptoms of the Flavescence dor√©e disease. On the contrary, in the USA, the presence of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> is not related to the manifestation of specific symptoms in the vegetation. Sampling in the USA is further complicated by the fact that 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> is usually found in unmanaged open woodlands and in mixed populations with other morphologically similar species, making its correct identification quite problematic, while sampling [

Despite the low number of insects caught in the USA, the most striking result of this investigation was the marked difference in the diversity and abundance of the viral species identified in the two geographical areas. Seven viral species were discovered from three individuals collected in the USA, whereas only two viral species, Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 and Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1, were collectively identified in the 214 individuals that were analyzed from various European sites. Additionally, 91% of the insects collected throughout Europe appeared to be free from both viruses. The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) could be a possible explanation of such a dramatic shift in the number of viruses putatively infecting 
 <italic>S. titanus.</italic> ERH predicts that a species will be successful in a new habitat as a result of a drop in overall number of natural enemies [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], e.g., predators, parasites and pathogens, including viruses. This hypothesis has been widely applied to invasive species, such as plant or animal pests in new habitats, even if the outcomes of these studies are highly variable and sometimes even contradictory [

 <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>, a dipteran pest of soft fruits first isolated in Japan at the beginning of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century and now spread worldwide [
