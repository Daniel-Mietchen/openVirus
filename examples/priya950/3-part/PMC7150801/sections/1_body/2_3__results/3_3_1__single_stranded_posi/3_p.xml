<p>The genome of iflaviruses is a monopartite +ssRNA genome, which encodes a large polyprotein auto-catalytically cleaved into structural and nonstructural component peptides: starting from the N-terminus, capsid proteins, followed by three non-structural proteins, an RNA helicase, a 3C-like cysteine protease, and an RdRp. A Pfam search revealed the presence of these peptides in both Scaphoideus titanus iflaviruses (

The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that both sequences were closely related to iflaviruses identified from other hosts of the family Cicadellidae (
