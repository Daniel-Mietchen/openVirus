<p>A contig from the St_USA library showed the highest similarity (39% amino acid identity, 39% query coverage) with Hubei permutotetra-like virus 9 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Despite the blastx result, the genome organization of this virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00287-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) was more similar to Hubei permutotetra-like virus 8 (GenBank accession: NC_033216.1). Both genomes, in fact, contained three coding sequences on the same strand, which simultaneously overlapped for a short region. In our case, the first and the longest ORF, encoding the RdRp, overlapped at the 3′ terminus for 106 nucleotides with both 5′ termini of the other two ORFs, which putatively coded for the capsid proteins. The latter two were found in a +1 and -1 reading frame compared to the RdRp coding sequence. Similarly to all permutotetraviruses, the RdRp motif C was located upstream of motif A, forming a non-canonical C-A-B arrangement. On the basis of these characteristics, hereafter we referred to this virus as Scaphoideus titanus permutotetra-like virus 1. This virus was distantly related to previously described members of the family 
 <italic>Permutotetraviridae</italic> and fell within a weakly supported clade (bootstrap &lt; 70%), which grouped viruses isolated from insects, including the abovementioned Hubei permutotetra-like virus 9 (
