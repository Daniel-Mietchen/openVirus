<p>In the St_USA library we also identified a partiti-like virus, hereafter named Scaphoideus titanus-associated partiti-like virus 1 (

A blastx analysis, in fact, revealed the presence of two contigs with similarity to a hypothetical protein (61% amino acid identity, 35% query coverage) and an RdRp (87% amino acid identity, 44% query coverage), both belonging to a partiti-like virus identified in a nematode, named Wuhan large pig roundworm virus 1. The same nine nucleotides were identified at the termini of both segments, confirming they were likely to be part of the same viral genome. Interestingly, Scaphoideus titanus-associated partiti-like virus 1 fell in a large heterogeneous clade that included also deltapartitiviruses (plant-infecting viruses), as well as a group of four viruses identified in arthropods (two from the subphylum Crustacea and two from the class Insecta) and two identified in nematodes (
