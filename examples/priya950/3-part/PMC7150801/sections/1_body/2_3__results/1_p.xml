<p>We characterized the total transcriptome of six 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> pools: five from European locations (St_IT1, St_IT2, St_HU, St_FR and St_CH) and one from a USA location (St_USA). RNA sequencing resulted in 110 million to 130 million reads per library, which were independently assembled into contigs and compared to NCBI protein non redundant database for virus discovery. These transcriptome data allowed us to identify nine new viral RNA genomes associated to 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic>: two in the European libraries and seven in the USA one (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Five of the viruses described here are expected to have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome, one a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (âˆ’ssRNA) genome and three a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. Only complete or near complete viral genomes were considered in this computation, i.e., genomes comprising the complete coding potential that should be expected from the existing virus taxa they are most closely related to. None of these genomes featured premature stop codons or repeat sequences, so they unlikely represented endogenous viral elements (EVEs), namely integrations of DNA and nonretroviral RNA viruses into the host genome. According to these strict criteria, the St_HU library was the only one in which we could not identify any sequence matching to viruses deposited into public databases.
