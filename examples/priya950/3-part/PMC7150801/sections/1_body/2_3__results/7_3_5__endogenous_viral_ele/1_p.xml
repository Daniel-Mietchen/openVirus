<p>Some contigs from the European and USA libraries found significant matches with known viruses, but sequences were partial and/or contained multiple stop codons, so they were considered as potential EVEs. This was the case of sequences disclosing similarities to: three fragments of RdRps from viruses belonging to the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, a glycoprotein from a phlebovirus (order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>), an RdRp from a reovirus, multiple non-structural proteins (NS1) and capsid proteins (VP1) from members of the family 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>.
