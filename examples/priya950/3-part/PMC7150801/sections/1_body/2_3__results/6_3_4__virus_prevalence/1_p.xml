<p>RT-PCR was used to define the prevalence of the two viruses discovered in the European libraries. The same RNA extracts used for the construction of RNA-seq libraries were used unpooled to diagnose the presence of Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 and Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1, even in those European samples that, according to the bioinformatic analysis, were negative to one or both viruses (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We observed a perfect concordance between the presence/absence of the two viruses in the five libraries and the RT-PCR results (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Regarding the prevalence, results divided by sampling countries are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00287-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1 was found only in Italy and in France populations with extremely low frequencies (3% at most). Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1 was the most geographically widespread virus, as it was found in six out of the eight European sampling locations with variable percentages: 24% of the insects sampled in France and 13% of those collected in Switzerland. The percentage of insects negative for both viruses also rather fluctuated, being 100% in samples collected in Hungary and 74% observed in the ones from France.
