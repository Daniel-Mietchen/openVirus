<p>Population immunity may contribute to the variability of ICV. Substantial antigenic and genetic diversity exists among ICV isolates; there are six genetic lineages representing six antigenic groups of HEF, with two major genetic lineages of the internal genes [

Elegant longitudinal studies in Japan that compared the antigenic and genetic character of circulating isolates with concurrent serology showed periodic epidemics of ICV every few years. While multiple strains co-circulated, there was a dominant antigenic group that was replaced every few years, driven by herd immunity [
