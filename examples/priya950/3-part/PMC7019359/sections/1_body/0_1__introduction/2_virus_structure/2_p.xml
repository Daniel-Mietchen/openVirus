<p>M1, encoded from segment 6, is the major structural protein of ICV that lies under the lipid bilayer [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The internal structure of ICV is dominated by ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that are composed of ribonucleic acid and four structural proteins. Genome segment 5 codes for nucleoprotein (NP) and segments 1â€“3 code for the polymerase (P) subunits basic (PB)2, PB1, and P3, respectively [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Segment 6 also encodes CM2 protein, a minor envelope glycoprotein ion channel [
