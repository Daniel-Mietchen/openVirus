<p>ICV is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. It has a 7-segmented genome that encodes 9 viral proteins [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], distinguishing it from influenza A and B viruses that have 8-segment genomes encoding 10 major viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some IAV strains express other proteins PB1-F2 or PA-X from alternate reading frames [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The presence of a single surface glycoprotein that combines the function of two surface proteins found on influenza A and B viruses is another key feature that distinguishes ICV from influenza A and B viruses [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Influenza A and B surface proteins include hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which mediate attachment, entry, and escape [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast to influenza A and B, ICV hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoprotein, encoded on segment 4, efficiently fulfills the roles of both HA and NA by facilitating host receptor binding, cleaving sialic acid, and membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, ICV HEF binds to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid rather than to N-acetyl-neuraminic acid for influenza A and B viruses [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. HEF is the major target for host neutralizing antibodies, which appear to bind to epitopes near the receptor-binding site and the esterase site [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Human CD8+ T cells recognize epitopes of ICV internal proteins, some of which are conserved in IAV and IBV [
