<p id="p0325">The hepatitis C virus is another virus with a high genomic variability where traditional vaccine methods have not proved very successful. Now efforts are under way to develop synthetic peptide vaccines based on CTL T-epitopes determined on the viral core protein which have been seen to evoke good immune response in mice models. A peptide vaccine against multiple sclerosis has entered Phase 3 trial stage, epitopes of human papillomavirus protein E5 as peptide vaccine candidates provided strong cell-mediated immunity (See video abstract, available under the Relevant Websites section for epitopes identified in human papillomavirus L1 protein; 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 3</xref> provides a snapshot of one peptide identified in the HPV35 L1 protein pentameric structure identified by the type of bioinformatics analysis outlined here.). A combination chemotherapy together with peptide vaccine therapy is also in Phase 3 trials to determine how effective that may be in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, and the ClinicalTrials website lists a number of other peptide vaccine candidates in various stages of clinical trials.
