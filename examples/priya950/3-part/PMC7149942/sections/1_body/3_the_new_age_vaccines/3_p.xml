<p id="p0305">Overall, however, production of peptide vaccines leads to improvements in time and cost. The initial screening for possible vaccine targets is now more focused and lab procedures and field trials can start within a few weeks of the start of a project. From the in silico processes of identification of suitable epitopes and design of synthetic peptide vaccines to in vitro tests and in vivo field trials, the entire process is much more rapid and efficient. In fact, in the case of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Asia in 2003, the initial indications were available in late 2002–early 2003, the genomic sequences were available by May 2003, and the first results of an experimental vaccine by December 2003, an extremely fast response indeed.</p>
