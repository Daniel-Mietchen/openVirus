<p id="p0315">Some of the projects to design peptide vaccines are promising, and indeed the first successful peptide vaccine was against the virulent canine parovirus as mentioned earlier and there have been such vaccines developed against other viral diseases in animals, but to date no such vaccine has been licensed for humans. However, significant contributions have been made to rationally design peptide vaccines against influenza, rotavirus, coronavirus, and certain other viruses, of which the hypervariable flu virus has presented the greatest challenges. These efforts have been taken a step further to design a universal flu vaccine, a long cherished goal, that ideally could provide permanent protection against the flu virus with a single shot or perhaps with booster shots every 5–10 years. The targets here are generally the viral hemagglutinin protein’s conserved segments which are common to most flu strains so as to provoke effective antibody response against the flu virus. The estimates of almost a quarter to half a million lives being lost annually to flu according to World Health Organization are indicative of the importance of such a vaccine. </p>
