<p id="p0300">However, there are problems as well. Peptides are very poor immunogens on their own and require adjuvants (immune stimulants) to be effective. They are also very susceptible to enzymatic degradation. The choice of an epitope is a crucial step in the design of peptide vaccines. These epitopes should be able to induce strong, long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity against the pathogen, but sometimes are not the immunodominant types desired. Ultimately, the chosen epitope needs to be highly conserved to cover a variety of viral strains or be a mixture of several epitopes for the required vaccine.</p>
