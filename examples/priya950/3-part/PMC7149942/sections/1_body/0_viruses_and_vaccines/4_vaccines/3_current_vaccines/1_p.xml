<p id="p0080">Vaccines in use at present are generally one of several types. The first is the attenuated or live-attenuated virus where the viral genome is altered so that the virus becomes less virulent or harmless, but can still elicit immune response; vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, and several other viral diseases are of this type. These vaccines have a problem that sometimes mutations in the genome can make it revert back to the more virulent form and infect the human host.</p>
