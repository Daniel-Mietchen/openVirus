<p id="p0025">When not in action against any organism, viruses exist as individual particles which are referred to as virions. The virions consist of a protein shell, called a capsid, with the genome of the virus inside; in the case of some viruses, there is also a lipid envelope covering the capsid. Some viruses, called DNA viruses, carry single-stranded or double-stranded DNA genomes; other viruses, called RNA viruses, may carry double-stranded RNA or single-stranded, positive or negative sense RNA genome. The genome itself could be a continuous strand, as in the case of dengue, or could be in separate pieces, one for each constituent gene as in the case of the influenza genome, and referred to as segmented genome. The genes themselves can be grouped as structural and nonstructural. The structural genes contribute to the make up of the capsid, that is the viral coat, which is formed from many identical protein subunits, which may consist of one or more proteins grouped together, and can take up forms such as icosahedral, helical, prolate, and so on. The nonstructural genes function in replication of the genome, among other functions.</p>
