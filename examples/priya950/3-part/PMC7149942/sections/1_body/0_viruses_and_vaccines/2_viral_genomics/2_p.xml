<p id="p0030">When a virus attacks a cell, a part of the surface proteins will attach to the cell surface through its segments called receptors and then fuse into the interior of the cell in a process known as endocytosis. Inside the cell the outer layers of the virion are removed by viral or host enzymes and the viral genome is released. The viral genes are then involved in synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA), viral protein synthesis, and replication of the viral genome using the machinery of the host cell to produce multiple copies. During replication there may be errors in copying the nucleotides, resulting in a mutated gene. DNA viruses have the ability to use error correcting enzymes to undo the damage; RNA viruses do not have such machinery and so accumulate errors very rapidly. It is estimated that RNA viruses accumulate errors at the rate of ∼ 10
 <sup>− 4</sup>–10
 <sup>− 5</sup> per nucleotide per replication; viruses that are about 10,000 nucleotides long in their genomes such as influenza or dengue viruses will accumulate errors at the rate of about 1 nucleotide per replication. DNA viruses on the other hand will accumulate errors at a rate of ∼ 10
 <sup>− 8</sup>–10
 <sup>− 11</sup> and therefore will be much more stable. Accumulation of errors, called genetic drift, may lead to creation of new strains of the virus; other methods of generation of new strains are through reassortments in segmented genomes where whole genes may be exchanged with another homologous strain, or, more rarely, recombination where parts of a gene may be exchanged with similar segments of another homologous strain.
