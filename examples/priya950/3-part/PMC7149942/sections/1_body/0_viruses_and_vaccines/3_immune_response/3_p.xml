<p id="p0050">B-cell receptors can recognize foreign antigens on their own. Naïve B-cells, that is, B-cells that have not yet encountered an antigen, split immediately on encountering an antigen into a memory B-cell and an effector B-cell, the progeny B-cells having identical membrane-bound receptors as the naive B-cell. The memory B-cells survive much longer than the naïve B-cells; effector B-cells live for a short period but release antibodies at a very high rate, about 2000 per second. On first encounter with an antigen, the immune response can take 5–6 days to start and peak at about 14 days; at the second attack the response occurs very fast, in about 1–2 days, and the intensity is very high. Vaccination primes the body for just this kind of response.</p>
