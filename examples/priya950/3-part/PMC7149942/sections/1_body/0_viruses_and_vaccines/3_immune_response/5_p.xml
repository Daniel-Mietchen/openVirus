<p id="p0060">Antigens that invade host cells and replicate get their peptides attached in the endoplasmic reticulum to the MHC Class I molecules which then move to the cell surface. The T
 <sub>C</sub>-cells recognize the MHCI-peptide complex and proliferates and differentiates into effector cells known as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). The CTLs monitor the affected cells and kill them.
