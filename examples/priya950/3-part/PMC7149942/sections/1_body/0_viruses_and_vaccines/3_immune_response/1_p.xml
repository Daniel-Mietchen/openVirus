<p id="p0040">All organisms are equipped with some degree of immunity against invading pathogens and microorganisms. This immunity can be considered in two parts—innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is provided by our dry outer skin and mucous membranes in certain openings like the mouth, nostrils, uterine passages, etc., the body’s temperature, the highly acidic environment in the stomach and many others, all of which act to prevent pathogens and microorganisms from harming the host, but are not necessarily specific to any particular pathogen or its varieties. Pathogens and microorganisms that may enter the body through cuts and bruises are ingested by phagocytes, the macrophages and dendritic cells, and finally eliminated.</p>
