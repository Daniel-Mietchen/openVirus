<p id="p0055">T-cells also have a similar response profile. There are two subtypes of T-cells—T-helper cells, T
 <sub>H</sub>, and T-cytotoxic cells, T
 <sub>C</sub>; the T-helper cells each have an associated CD4 membrane glycoprotein, and the T-cytotoxic cells each have a CD8 membrane glycoprotein associated with them. The T-cells recognize antigens when coupled with special protein molecules known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules which are displayed on the surfaces of cells. The human MHC molecules are expressed by certain HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles and contain a cleft at the distal end from the membrane that can contain peptides. There are two main classes of the MHC—MHC Class I which are expressed in almost all vertebrate nucleated cells, and MHC Class II which are expressed in only antigen presenting cells, that is, cells like macrophages, dendrites, etc., that ingest invading antigens by phagocytosis or endocytosis and degrade the complex antigen into small peptides. The peptides get attached to the MHC Class II molecules which then rise to the surface of the cell and are targeted by the T
 <sub>H</sub> cells triggering the mechanisms for their eventual elimination.
