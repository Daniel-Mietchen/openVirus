<p id="p0065">The attachments of the degraded peptides to the MHC molecules are governed by the conformation of the clefts in the distal ends. The HLA that give rise to the MHCs are highly polymorphic and polygenic; a HLA database lists over 1600 HLA class II molecules alone; the alleles differ between individuals and between populations. Understandably, experimental approaches to determine antigenicity and traditional vaccines where effectiveness of the MHC-peptide bonding has to be tested are prohibitively time-consuming and expensive processes. Computational techniques coupled with robust algorithms to determine the binding affinities of peptides to the MHC molecules become a more reasonable approach. Still, there is a dearth of good data on many alleles that make up a populationâ€™s HLA profile, and dependence on good models of homology, molecular docking, and structural data remain imperative. Bioinformatics therefore lead the current search for effective vaccine targets.</p>
