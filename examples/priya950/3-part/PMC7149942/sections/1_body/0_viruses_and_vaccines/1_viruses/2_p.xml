<p id="p0015">Among the viruses that are pathogenic to humans one could count influenza, measles, whooping cough, plague, and polio to name a random few. Their numbers are augmented occasionally by new zoonotic viruses that make the jump from animal hosts to infect humans and create new diseases; notable among these was the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that arose from the simian immunodeficiency virus and began infecting humans around the 1980s, and the Zika virus epidemic that is affecting a part of the Americas at this time whose source is believed to be primates in Africa. When new viruses arise against which the human body is not prepared with defense mechanisms, it could lead to widespread epidemics and pandemics; the Spanish flu of 1918 was one such instance which spread rapidly across the world and resulted in over 20 million, also estimated to be 100 million, fatalities;
