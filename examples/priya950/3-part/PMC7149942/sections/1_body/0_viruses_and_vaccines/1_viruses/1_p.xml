<p id="p0010">Viruses are one of the smallest of biological entities that infect all life forms, from bacteria and fungi to animals and plants. The tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be so identified and since then over 5000 viruses have been investigated in detail although there are probably millions of viruses in existence and more are being discovered, the latest among these being a cluster of about 1500 viruses in molluscs discovered in late 2016.</p>
