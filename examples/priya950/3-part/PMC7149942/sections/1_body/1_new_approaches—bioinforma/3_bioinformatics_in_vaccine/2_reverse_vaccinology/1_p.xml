<p id="p0125">The reverse vaccinology model, part of the vaccinomics regime, uses bioinformatics techniques to screen entire genomes of pathogens to determine genes that could lead to good epitopes, the peptides in an antigen to which the antibodies actually bind, and proteins that are surface situated. The selected proteins/peptides are then synthetically produced and tested in animal models. To date this technique has been used against bacterial pathogens and the first human vaccine devised using this method was the Serogroup B meningococcus which causes meningitis. Although there had to be several trials and experimentation, the entire exercise took only a few years whereas traditional vaccine development methods normally take decades. In the case of this particular pathogen there were difficulties in using traditional methods because of autoimmune threats; use of bioinformatics methods were of prime importance in identifying surface antigens that could be used for designing the vaccine.</p>
