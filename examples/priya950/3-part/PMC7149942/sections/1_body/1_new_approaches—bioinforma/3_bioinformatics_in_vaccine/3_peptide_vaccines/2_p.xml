<p id="p0135">The current authors have added a further step to the four mentioned earlier for rational design of peptide vaccines, viz., conserved segments. The issue is that viral genomes, especially RNA viral genomes, undergo rapid mutational changes rendering drugs and vaccines against one strain of a virus rapidly obsolete. To minimize this risk, the first step taken is to analyze as many viral protein sequences as possible for similarities and dissimilarities to determine segments that remain essentially conserved even though the viral genomes undergo numerous mutational changes. The procedure adopted to make this analysis is another application of bioinformatics techniques.</p>
