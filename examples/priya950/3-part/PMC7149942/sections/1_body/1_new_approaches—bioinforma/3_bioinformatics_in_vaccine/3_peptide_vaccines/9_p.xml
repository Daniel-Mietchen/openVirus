<p id="p0210"> There are several other considerations, however, before these peptides can be classified as vaccines. There is the question of adequacy of the immune response. Often adjuvants are required to augment the immune recognition process. Then there is a need to enable these peptides on a carrier protein to ensure that they do not fold up into some shape and therefore evade the antibody binding envisaged. Last, but not least, it may be necessary to have more than one peptide vaccine injected at a time for best results, the so-called multivalent vaccine approach. However, the major bioinformatics steps taken as outlined earlier helps to narrow down possible peptides to a few and expedite the vaccine development process far beyond what traditional vaccine development techniques allowed.</p>
