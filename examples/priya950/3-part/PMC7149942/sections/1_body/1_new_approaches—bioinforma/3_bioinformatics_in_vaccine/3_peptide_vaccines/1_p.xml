<p id="p0130">Extending the reverse vaccinology model to cover viral diseases, many vaccines have been proposed and a large number are undergoing field trials in various phases. Essentially, the method in these cases is to (a) scan the viral genome for surface proteins, (b) analyze the surface proteins to predict the best epitope regions, (c) ensure these epitopes are surface situated, and (d) test them for autoimmune threats (see schematic, 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Only on successful completion of these steps can the viral peptides matching the epitope requirements be recommended as vaccine targets. These have then to be prepared for in vitro and in vivo tests and field trials launched in animal and human models whose results will finally determine the suitability of such peptide vaccines. Among the first cases reported of success using such a model was against the virulent canine parovirus, which then stimulated similar searches against malaria, swine flu, and other diseases in animals. Proposals have been advanced that ovarian and breast cancers can benefit from the peptides derived from cell surface-associated mucin gene

Initial field trials have shown that a peptide antigen vaccine against the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus provided adequate antiviral response; a mixture of four peptides against nonsmall cell lung cancer was found to be safe and capable of generating strong T-cell responses.
