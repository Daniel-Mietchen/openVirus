<p id="p0140">An almost universal approach to determining similarities and dissimilarities in a set of biomolecular sequences of a particular virus depends upon quite sophisticated software that determines segments that are similar across various sequences and introduces gaps where they are not to maximize some predefined measure of similarity. This technique of sequence alignment has enabled discovery of essential similarities between sequences and determine evolutionary relationships. Software such as ClustalW for alignments and MEGA (molecular evolutionary genetics analysis) to determine phylogenetic relationships is very popular for the purpose. However, these are model dependent about how the gaps are to be assessed and how the scoring is to be done to determine the best fit for alignment of multiple sequences; also, alignment for many sequences take a lot of computer time and could rapidly become inefficient in handling over a hundred sequences. Alignment techniques are very reliable when the sequences being aligned are very closely related, whereas results for divergent sequences are not always very reliable and are therefore often not used.</p>
