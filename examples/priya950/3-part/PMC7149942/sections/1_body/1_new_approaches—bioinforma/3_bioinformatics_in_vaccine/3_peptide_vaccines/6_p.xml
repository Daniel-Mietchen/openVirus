 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub>, with suitable parameterization described in our papers, were found to identify identical protein sequences when the 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> values were identical. Techniques were developed by the current authors and their group to determine extent of variances between different strains of a virus, movement of identical strains across countries, segments of RNA and protein sequences that remain conserved across many mutations, and many more.
