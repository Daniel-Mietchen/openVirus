<p id="p0105">The rapid advances in recent decades in information technology, high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA genomes, the completion of the initial stage of the Human Genome Project, better understanding of immunogenetics and developments in immunoinformatics are providing valuable insights into how the human immune response works to guard against and eliminate foreign pathogens that gain entry into our body. This has led to development of the science of “vaccinomics” that seeks to utilize our understanding of the body’s immune reactions to precisely target those parts of the virus, the antigenic determinants, that will enable the immune response to kill the virus. Along with the data on a person’s DNA, vaccinomics envisages an ideal scenario, admittedly in the distant future, where these genetic and viral information can be tailored into a vaccine that would be best suited to the individual—personalized immunizations that are safe, efficient, and effective for everyone without worries of side effects. The new discipline of bioinformatics becomes an essential tool to achieve this goal.</p>
