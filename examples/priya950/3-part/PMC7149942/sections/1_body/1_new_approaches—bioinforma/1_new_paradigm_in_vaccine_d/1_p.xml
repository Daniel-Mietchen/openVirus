<p id="p0100">These traditional approaches to vaccines discussed above require long development periods and results are not always satisfactory. Apart from the ever-present threat of attenuated viral vaccines mutating to the pathogenic form, traditional vaccine design generally use the whole protein of the virus coat; the antigens can evoke immune responses but also sometimes cause allergy in humans, a type of autoimmune reaction. Also, a vaccine developed at great cost suitable for one community may not work for another where the people are more susceptible to different strains of the same virus; for instance, human papillomaviruses occur in many types and not all type combinations afflict humans universally.</p>
