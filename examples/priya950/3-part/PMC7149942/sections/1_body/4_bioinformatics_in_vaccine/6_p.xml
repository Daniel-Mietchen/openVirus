<p id="p0355">The necessity of more robust techniques that perhaps can provide the best results for vaccine targets with analyses of fewer sequences than needed with current techniques is best judged in trying to cope with viral epidemics. Such epidemics strike fairly rapidly, last over a few months to a year, and then die out either due to mutational changes or enough people acquiring immunity to act as a deterrent to further spread of the virus. Given that a fresh epidemic will arise only from a new virus or a new strain of an old virus, gathering enough genomic data and going through normal dry and wet labs for a fool-proof vaccine within this time schedule is outside the realms of possibility with current traditional or bioinformatics techniques. The approach to the SARS epidemic of 2003 was an exception; the Ebola virus epidemic of 2015 could be controlled by a new vaccine, but that was because the vaccine had already been designed and was ready for field trials, but was brought into live use in the face of exigency. In the case of a future epidemic we will need much better, rapid-result bioinformatics and wet lab techniques to contain such viral attacks. The world is not ready for effective handling of epidemics and pandemics as yet.</p>
