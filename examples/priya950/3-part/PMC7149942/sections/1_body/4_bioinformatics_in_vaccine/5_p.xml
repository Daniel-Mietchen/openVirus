<p id="p0350">Mathematical and statistical techniques constitute a major pillar of the bioinformatics exercise. While a number of different techniques are being used to determine efficient epitopes, getting around the effects of mutational changes requires identification of conserved sequences and segments. There are a number of alignment-free techniques to facilitate this search, but the robustness of these techniques requires detailed analysis. Combinations of these techniques can be expected to provide more precise and dependable results.</p>
