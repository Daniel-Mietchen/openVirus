<p id="p0330">Bioinformatics are giving us a valuable service in identifying potential epitope regions in a pathogen with safeguards built in such as no autoimmune threats, most effective immune response capability and best population coverage. Traditional methods of vaccine design will take years to achieve parallel results and even then are unlikely to test for as wide a population coverage as bioinformatics studies can do.</p>
