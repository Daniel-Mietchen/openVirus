<p id="p0335">So much, however, is yet only a part of the total effort required to take a vaccine from the computer to the marketplace. The theoretically derived peptides have to be next synthesized and tested in the laboratory against mouse models to ensure the predicted immune responses do actually occur. To administer the synthetic peptides, one has to determine the best carrier proteins and take care that the peptides do not fold up in vivo and destroy the antibody–antigen binding possibility. To enhance the effectiveness of the administered vaccine, suitable adjuvants can be used. Use of adjuvants is quite common and well recognized; an adjuvant like AS04 is a part of the Cerverix HPV vaccine.</p>
