<p id="p0340">An added advantage of using peptide vaccines over traditional whole protein vaccines is combining different peptides into one vaccine, called multivalent vaccines, to enable as wide a coverage as possible so that one or the other epitope will elicit adequate immune response. The principle is well-known: Gardasil, a 9-valent VLP vaccine is designed against nine types of human papillomavirus; a childhood vaccine known as triple antigen is designed against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough where the toxoids of diphtheria and tetanus are used along with whole killed cells of whooping cough. These are examples from currently used traditional vaccines; the potential for multivalent vaccines will increase many fold in the peptide vaccine era.</p>
