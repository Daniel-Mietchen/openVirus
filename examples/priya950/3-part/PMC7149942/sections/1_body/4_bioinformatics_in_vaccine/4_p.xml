<p id="p0345">In spite of the apparently enormous developments to date, the bioinformatics era in vaccine design can be considered to be at the beginning stages and much more needs to be done. The entire exercise of determining T-cell and B-cell epitopes depends acutely on accuracy of genomic and proteomic data and that is by no means guaranteed as yet. For instance, there are still significantly large number of gene and genomic sequences where one or more of the constituents remain ambiguous: for example, out of 22 genomes of the Zika virus, 9 have 1 or more nucleotides, and therefore the associated amino acids, as yet to be identified with certainty. Since antibodies are extremely specific, and one amino acid difference can cancel the antibodyâ€“antigen binding, errors in the database can make the entire bioinformatics exercise in vaccine design in vain. Highly reliable data is an imperative in such bioinformatics search for suitable vaccine targets.</p>
