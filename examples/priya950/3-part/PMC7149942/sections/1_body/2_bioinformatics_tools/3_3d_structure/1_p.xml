<p id="p0260">3D structure information of the viral surface protein under consideration for vaccine design is useful to ensure that the epitopes considered surface situated by the ASA profile computation are not covered by any neighboring protein in a multimeric structure, for example, in influenza hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. Such information is also required for the Ellipro analysis, especially for conformational epitopes which are the dominant MHC Class II epitopes in viruses such as human papillomavirus. Commonly used software to view 3D structure data are Cn3D available from the NCBI website, and PyMOL and RasMOL which are powerful molecular graphics visualization tools with capabilities to highlight segments of user’s interest.
