<p id="p0245">EpiJen predicts binding affinity for MHC Class I molecules for T-cell epitope prediction by taking three types of interactions into account: the interaction between individual amino acids and the binding site, the interaction between adjacent and every second amino acids, and their effects on binding. The modeling considers stages of the antigen presentation by the MHC Class I, including proteasome cleavage and TAP binding, to predict the most effective epitopes. The results are often concise, predicting only a small percent of possible peptides as epitopes.</p>
