<p id="p0220">One of the most important steps in analyzing an invading pathogen for possible vaccine targets is identifying the epitope regions. Accumulated databases of identified epitopes and antigens have established a starting point to determine potential epitopes in new antigenic determinants. The analyses for this exercise have been done using different methodologies including neural networks and QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationships). Among the many epitope prediction software, some of the more widely used web-based servers are the following.</p>
