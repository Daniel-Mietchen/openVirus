<p id="p0250">NetCTL1.2 server offers a tool to predict cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in protein sequences. It uses artificial neural networks to predict the CTL epitopes for MHC Class I binding and proteasomal cleavage. The method also integrates TAP transport efficiency. The prediction covers 12 MHC super types and has been trained on a set of 886 known MHC class I ligands.</p>
