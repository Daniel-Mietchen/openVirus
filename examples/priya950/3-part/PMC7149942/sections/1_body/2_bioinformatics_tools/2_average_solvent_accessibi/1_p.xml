<p id="p0255">One of the main considerations in effectiveness of antibody binding to epitopes is the accessibility to the antigen. It is important therefore to determine solvent accessibility through the hydrophobicity indexes. There are several software available to determine such indexes. SABLE, I-TASSER, HHPred, etc. are commonly used for the purpose. They provide indications amino acid-wise of surface accessibility of the residues with accuracies in excess of 70%. Coupled with the epitope prediction data, these provide an indication of which epitopes could be accessible for the antibodyâ€“antigen binding.</p>
