<p>Initially, the genetic sequence data of more than 3,500 HA segments of global H9N2 viruses in 1997â€“2018 were retrieved from GenBank and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platforms. To reduce the dataset size, several steps were taken. Initially, identical sequences were removed by keeping the sequence with the earliest date. Secondly, a maximum-likelihood tree was computed using PhyML v.3.0 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Guindon et al., 2009</xref>), employing the GTR + g model of nucleotide substitution, whereafter sequences from high-density monophyletic clades from China were subsampled to reflect the current diversity. With this reduced dataset, new maximum-likelihood tree, using the same approach as above, was computed. Temporal structure was subsequently assessed with TempEst v.1.5.1 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>) after which additional sequences were excluded. The final dataset contained 740 representative sequences (alignment length of 1,738 nucleotides) with the corresponding virus name, host, collection time and geographical location. The majority of samples were distributed in Bangladesh, Israel and Egypt, with over 120 sequences in each country. By contrast, less than 10 samples were obtained in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. More details on sample distribution in
