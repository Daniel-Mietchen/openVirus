<p>In total 97 out of 171 available Egyptian sequences had known governorate information and were used to reconstruct the diffusing pattern within Egypt (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). By using the same molecular clock model, nucleotide substitution model and coalescent prior as above, two MCMC chains were run independently for 100,000,000 iterations and sampled every 5,000 steps. Governorates with the highest bayes factor support is denoted as the most probable transmission hub of viral migration within Egypt. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, governorates were categorized into three areas, i.e., Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta), Middle Egypt (including Giza, Fayoum and Bani Souwaif) and Upper Egypt.
