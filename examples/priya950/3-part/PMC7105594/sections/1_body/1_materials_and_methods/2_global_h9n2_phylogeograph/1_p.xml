<p>To investigate the main global-level spatial diffusion routes between 1997 and 2018, locations were assigned to different regions: Middle East 1 (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq), Middle East 2 (Jordan, Lebanon and Israel), North Africa (Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria), China, Iran and South Asia (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan) (

In a parallel analysis, Egypt was designated as a separate region from other North African countries (Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria) to prioritize viral migrations between Egypt and the rest regions. The reconstruction of viral migration network was conducted through a Bayesian statistical inference framework using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package (version 1.7.5) (

More specifically, a discrete phylogeography was inferred using the general time reversible (GTR) substitution model and a constant size coalescent prior. Three MCMC chains were run independently for 100,000,000 iterations and sampled every 10,000 steps. The convergence of MCMC was assessed by the effective sample size (ESS) of at least 200 using Tracer. Following a burn-in of 10% of each run, the three chains were combined and resampled to 1,000 trees to create the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. The reconstructed MCC tree was visualized and edited using FigTree (version 1.4.0). ‘Markov jump’ counts was used to quantify the expected number of transitions among different locations (

Additionally, the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) was applied to undertake the Bayes factor (BF) test and estimate the transition rates. We assumed Poisson prior for the BSSVS, assigning 50% prior probability to the minimal rate configuration (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bielejec et al., 2011</xref>) with a Bayes factor threshold of ≥ 3. The region with the highest bayes factor support was denoted as the most probable transmission hub for global viral migrations. To investigate the time when the inter-regional transmission between Israel and Egypt occurred, the time to the most recent common ancestors and 95% HPD intervals of the collected Israeli and Egyptian H9N2 viruses were also estimated. Given the spatial-temporal heterogeneity in viral isolation, temporal variation of transmission rate was not evaluated.
