<p>Understanding virus spread and migration patterns could aid in better preparation for epidemics and provide useful guidelines for virus control. In this study, we conducted a phylogeographic analysis of LPAIVs H9N2 obtained from our institutional repositories and public databases, including &gt;700 viruses from 1997â€“2018, to illustrate the dissemination of LPAIVs H9N2 from far Asia to the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to uncovering the transmission pathways of LPAIVs H9N2 in Egypt. The findings of this study should contribute to the strategic surveillance and targeted planning of control and prevention activities of not only LPAIVs H9N2 but also other subtypes co-circulating in Egypt.</p>
