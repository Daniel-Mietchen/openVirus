<p>Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) of subtype H9N2 is a subtype of influenza A viruses that circulate among different bird species and possess a public health concern because of its zoonotic potential (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Peacock et al., 2019</xref>). Based on their genetic features, H9N2 viruses are classified into two major lineages, i.e., the “North American” and “Eurasian” lineages, circulating in poultry and wild birds. The Eurasian lineage is subdivided into three major lineages: 1-Korean lineage: A/duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97 (Y439-like) and A/chicken/Korea/38349-p96323/96 (Korean-like); 2-Y280 lineage: A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97-like (Y280-like), A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 (G9-like) and A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94 (BJ94-like); and 3-G1 lineage: A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like (G1-like) (

Further, the G1-like H9N2 viruses circulating in Central-Asian and Middle Eastern countries, have been diversified into four distinct groups (A, B, C, and D) (
