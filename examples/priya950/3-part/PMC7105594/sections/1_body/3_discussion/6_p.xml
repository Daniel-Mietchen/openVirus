<p>Taken together, our study showed the transmission of H9N2 influenza viruses to, in and from Egypt, is part of the complex migration network from far Asia to the Middle East to Africa. Data generated on LPAIVs H9N2 on the transmission patterns in our study can be informative for AIV control strategies for the local administrative authorities. Note that This inferred transmission pattern of HA gene should not be projected to other gene segments, given the different evolutionary and transmission dynamics. Continuous monitoring and characterization of AIV in Egypt is recommended to fully understand the transmission patterns of this virus.</p>
