<p>The LPAIVs H9N2 isolated in North Africa has been demonstrated to share a close genetic relationship with those sampled from the Middle East (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Peacock et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, we proposed a diverse genetic relationship between Africa and the Middle East, with distinct sources of LPAIVs H9N2 between Egypt and the rest of the North African countries. More specific, the close genetic relationship between viruses circulating in Egypt and the neighboring Middle Eastern countries indicated that Jordan, Lebanon and, in particular, Israel are the primary sources of Egyptian H9N2 viruses. By contrast, Saudi Arabia, Emirates and Iraq are most likely to be the source of H9N2 viruses in North Africa (Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco). Given the different vaccination strategies implemented in African and Middle Eastern countries (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nagy et al., 2017</xref>), we suggest that these strategies may have facilitated the continuous evolution and diversification of LPAIVs H9N2, forming complicated genetic relationship among countries. Additionally, the lack of the direct wild bird movements (
