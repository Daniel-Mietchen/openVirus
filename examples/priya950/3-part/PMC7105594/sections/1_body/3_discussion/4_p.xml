<p>Considering our analysis span more than 20 years of global H9N2 evolution, i.e., 1997â€“2018, the inferred transmission pathways and sources for the explored regions and time periods should more so be seen as a general pattern for the time-period as a whole. However, although we have subsampled all of the available H9N2 HA genetic diversity, it is important to note that reporting LPAIVs H9N2 varies between different countries our analysis is just reflecting the currently available data. Previous studies have shown extensive expansions to the Middle East after its first emergence in Asia, forming a close genetic linkage between two regions (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Li, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, phylogenetic divergence of Asian and the Middle Eastern H9N2 viruses has also been reported through the ongoing viral evolution (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Naguib et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Li, 2018</xref>). Together, these finding indicated that Asia served as the original transmission source of global H9N2 viruses, but our analyses give heighten the distinct role of Middle East as transmission hub in shaping the following spatial expansions.
