<p>In Egypt, LPAIV H9N2 continues to cause a significant impact on poultry production industry since its introduction in 2010 (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Naguib et al., 2015</xref>); in addition, it poses threat to the public health due to its zoonotic potential where subsequent human infections have been reported (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nagy et al., 2017</xref>). Despite many reports on the molecular features, the transmission dynamics of LPAIVs H9N2 in Egypt is yet to be defined. In this study, we aimed, by using discrete state Bayesian phylogeography, to reveal the evolutionary history and spatial diffusion process of LPAIV H9N2 to, in, and from Egypt, which will in turn aid in establishing more effective avian influenza control strategies.
