<p>From this study, it is observed that Egyptian LPAIVs H9N2 have evolved into three major groups (

Determinants of viral diffusion in Egypt differed markedly between locations, where rural population density (Delta regions) was found to be a strong disseminator for LPAIV H9N2 viral migration in Egypt. This shows that movement dynamics within the Nile Delta region of Egypt are complex and important for the understanding of H9N2 circulation in Egypt. The data in this study suggests that governorates in middle Egypt (Giza, Fayoum and Bani Souwaif) are the major hubs in the LPAIV H9N2 transmission network in Egypt and has a strong connection between upper and lower Egyptian governorates (

Moreover, the phylogeographic networks of LPAIV H9N2 in Egypt, shown in this study, are likely to be indicative of poultry movements across Egypt. Therefore, our findings propose that transportation networks of live poultry between lower (Nile Delta) and upper regions should be considered key routes for LPAIV H9N2 dissemination in Egypt.
