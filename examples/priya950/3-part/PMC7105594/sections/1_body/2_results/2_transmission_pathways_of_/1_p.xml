<p>There is a distinct spatial viral diffusion structure within Egypt, including both intra- and inter-area transmission pathways (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Intra-area viral diffusions were primarily concentrated in Lower Egypt, with bi-directional transmission between El-Beheira and Dakahliya. Additionally, inter-area transmissions are generally migrated from Middle or Upper Egypt to Lower Egypt. It is noteworthy that governorates located in the Middle Egypt, i.e., Giza, Fayoum and Bani Souwaif, are most likely transmission hubs, linking viral migrations between Lower and Upper Egypt. In the interim, direct long-distance diffusions between Upper and Lower Egypt are also observed, particularly the Suez – Sohag and Ismailia – New Valley viral migrations. Of note, transmission from New Valley to Fayoum is of the highest significance compared with the others. Given the localized circulation and viral incursion from Upper and Middle Egypt, we suggest that Lower Egypt may be the reservoir of H9N2 viruses.
