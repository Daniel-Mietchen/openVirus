 <caption>
  <p>Bayesian evolutionary tree of global LPAI H9N2 viruses based on the nucleotide sequence of the HA gene between 1997 and 2018. Locations were assigned to six regions: Middle East 1 (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq), Middle East 2 (Jordan, Lebanon and Israel), Africa (Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria), East Asia (China), West Asia (Iran), and South Asia (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan). The posterior probability of each location acting as transmission hub, i.e., root state posterior probability, was also presented.</p>
