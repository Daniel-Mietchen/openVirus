<p>HAdV belongs to the genus Mastadenovirus and family Adenoviridae. It is a nonenveloped virus with a linear dsDNA genome and icosahedral capsids. HAdV consists of 7 groups classified through genomic sequence analysis.
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Adenoviral-based ocular surface infections are attributed to several subtypes of Group B and D HAdV. Generally, these viruses bind CD46, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein, to infect the host.
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Exposure of the host to HAdV is made possible through the interaction between adenoviral fiber protein and primary host cellular receptors such as CD46, sialic acid, and heparin-sulfate proteoglycan, all of which promote the attachment and internalization of HAdV.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interactions between the penton base of the virus and vitronectin-binding integrins of the host support internalization and acidification of the endosome, triggering conformational changes to the viral capsid. This process culminates in the release of viral DNA genome into the host nucleus, where viral replication occurs.
