<p>HAdV causes a lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea as well as a latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells.
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Members of Groups B and D HAdV cause both GIT and ocular infections. See 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for the subtypes of Group B and D HAdV.
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> HAdV type 3, 7, and 21 of Group B can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, respiratory infection, and GIT infection. Group D HAdV can also cause both ocular and GIT infection. Some group B HAdV subtypes infect the respiratory tract. Group B HAdV including type 3, 7, 14, and 21 have been associated with acute respiratory distress (ARD) outbreaks.
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> HAdV types that cause ARD are transmitted through aerosolized droplets. It is important to note that both respiratory droplets and the fecal-oral transmission route from individuals with acute adenoviral infection, or even post-infection adenoviral shedding, play an important role in the transmission dynamics of HAdV infections.
