<p>Another significant challenge in managing adenoviral infections, particularly in Group D HAdV, is the propensity for this group to cause oculogenital infection. Several published cases have demonstrated that Group D HAdV can be associated with concurrent urethritis and conjunctivitis.

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Avolio et al also presented a case of two male patients with HAdV D37 associated urethritis and conjunctivitis, in which one of the spouses contracted adenoviral conjunctivitis via oculogenital contact. These cases highlight the importance of testing for the presence of adenovirus in clinical specimens collected from both urethral and conjunctival swab in men presenting with conjunctivitis, dysuria, and scant urethral discharge.
