<p>Immunocompetent individuals are likely to shed less HAdV into their stool, in contrast to those who are immunocompromised, where significant amounts of HAdV are released. Immunocompromised individuals are also more likely to have reactivation of HAdV with productive infection of intestinal epithelial cells and consequential extensive viral dissemination in the community. As such, in the immunocompromised state, reactivation of persistent latent HAdV is an essential cause of HAdV dissemination.
