<p>For patients with chronic adenoviral corneal opacification following resolution of acute infection, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) can be an alternative option to other corneal surgeries or transplants. Corneal transparency can be compromised, or corneal irregularity may result with sequelae from the immune response to pathogen. Fortuitously, these scars are often superficial in nature by virtue of affecting the subepithelial layer. Transepithelial PTK low dose mitomycin C has shown benefit in such cases with reported improvements in photophobia, best corrected vision, and contrast sensitivity.
