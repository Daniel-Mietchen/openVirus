<p>Corneal involvement in EKC occurs in approximately 80% of cases, varying in presentation as a superficial punctate keratitis, focal epithelial punctate keratitis, subepithelial infiltrate (SEI) formation, and reduced corneal sensitivity.

 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> This clinical finding may persist for months to years following resolution of the conjunctivitis, leading to subjective visual disturbances, such as decreased vision, photophobia, halos, and the development of irregular astigmatism. Due to their chronicity and visual impact, treatments including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents have been investigated to treat as well as prevent SEIs, though they often end up resolving without scarring or corneal neovascularization formation.
