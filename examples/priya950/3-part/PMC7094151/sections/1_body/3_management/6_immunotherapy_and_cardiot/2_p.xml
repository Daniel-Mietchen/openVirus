<p>Topical cyclosporine (both 1% and 2% concentrations) is an alternative option which, if used in the acute phase of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, is successful in both reducing the risk of developing corneal findings as well as the chronic treatment of persistent SEIs, with most cases resolving over a course of 3–4 weeks.

 <sup>®</sup>, Allergan, Irvine, California, USA) once per day or once every other day, in treatment of SEIs secondary to adenoviral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis in cases persisting for more than three months. Patients in this study had also initially been treated with topical corticosteroids for several months with no regression, or who had to discontinue due to subsequent, elevated IOP. After one month of 0.05% cyclosporine treatment, 81.75% of eyes had cleared SEIs while the remaining 18.2% had decreased in number. No systemic or ocular side effects were observed. Few cases (11.12%) in this study resulted in recurrence of SEIs after discontinuing treatment.
