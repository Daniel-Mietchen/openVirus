<p>Another promising treatment for HAdV is adoptive T cell therapy. This involves the transfer of virus-specific T cells into Tcell-depleted patients to fight infection. HAdV-specific T cells are present in peripheral blood of healthy individuals in low frequencies; as a result, donor leukocytes were reportedly useful in patients with severe HAdV infection. HAdV-specific T cells play a significant role in viral clearance, and as such, adoptive transfer of HAdV-specific T cells would be an immunotherapeutic agent of immense benefit for patients at risk of disseminated adenoviral infection. The method of adoptive T cell therapy involves harvested leukocytes that are stimulated and expanded in vitro using peptide-MHC I tetramers, instead of using lymphocytes derived from the same donor as the transplant which yielded results as early as two weeks.
