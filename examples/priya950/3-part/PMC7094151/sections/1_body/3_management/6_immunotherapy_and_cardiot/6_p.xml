<p>Topical tacrolimus 0.03% has ophthalmic uses, mainly in the treatment of giant papillary conjunctivitis and vernal keratoconjunctivitis. With regards to its effect on HAdV keratoconjunctivitis, tacrolimus was more effective than dexamethasone in the reduction of SEIs, and subsequently in the improvement of vision and symptomology. This study is significant in that tacrolimus was not only superior to topical corticosteroids in the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms but also offered a lower recurrence rate and no significant rise in IOP as is sometimes seen with steroid use. Adverse effects were observed in 17.8% of patients using tacrolimus, manifesting as burning, redness, and foreign body sensation.
