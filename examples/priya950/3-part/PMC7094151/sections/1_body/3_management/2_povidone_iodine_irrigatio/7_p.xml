<p>Interestingly, Cheung et al have indicated that multiple types of adenovirus can be involved in a single outbreak and as PVI has proven viricidal activity in multiple ocular types of HAdV, it would be sensible to consider PVI irrigation to decrease colonization of the ocular surface in this disease picture.
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The most powerful tool in limiting the severity of adenoviral conjunctivitis outbreaks includes reduction of viral shedding and limiting contamination of objects, workspaces, and surfaces in public places to avoid horizontal transmission, as mentioned previously in this manuscript.
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Gargling or flushing with PVI has been postulated as an effective measure in disrupting the transmission of respiratory viral spread.
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Hence, PVI irrigation can be a powerful tool to help in the reduction of transmission of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.
