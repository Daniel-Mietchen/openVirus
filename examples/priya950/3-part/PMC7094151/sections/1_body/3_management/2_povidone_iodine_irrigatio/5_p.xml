<p>Studies have shown that PVI exhibits antimicrobial activity proportional to the concentration of free iodine released in any given solution of specified dilution, regardless of PVI concentration.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition to its well-documented antimicrobial activity, a study examining the virucidal efficacy of 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, and 10% PVI demonstrated that 0.1% solution was actually the most effective against HAdV 3, as it maximized free iodine concentration.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Specifically, PVI formulations have been proven effective against non-enveloped human viruses including HAdV, although, it has been postulated to be adenoviral type dependent.
