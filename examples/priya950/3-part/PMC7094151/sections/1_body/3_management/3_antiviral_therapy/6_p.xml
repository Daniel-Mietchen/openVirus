<p>Ribavirin and cidofovir have also been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against HAdV in vitro. However, many of these systemic antiviral therapies lead to the risk of significant side effects. Cidofovir (CDV) is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate and nucleotide analog of cytosine. It is converted by cells to its diphosphate form and binds to the HAdV DNA polymerase, causing viral DNA chain termination and viral inhibition.

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Intravenous cidofovir is often used in transplant clinics with only mild efficacy. This is due to poor cellular uptake because of its phosphate group, leading to accumulation of the drug in the renal tubules and, when used systemically, leads to nephrotoxicity.

Due to these discoveries, it is necessary to determine an effective antiviral with a high therapeutic index for the treatment of HAdV associated infections.
