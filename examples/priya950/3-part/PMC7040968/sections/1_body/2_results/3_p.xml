<p>To examine if there were specific patterns of correlation between the detected viruses, all virus pairs in Table 
 <xref rid="irv12694-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> were evaluated with Fisher's exact test for 2 × 2 tables. In addition, the detection rate of one virus in the background of another virus‐positive sample was compared with that in the background of all samples, to determine whether correlation was positive or negative. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant association (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), where INFA‐INFB and INFB‐CVEV showed negative correlation and CVEV‐RHV and CVEV‐RSVB exhibited positive correlation (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12694-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, influenza viruses were not significantly correlated with most of the other respiratory viruses. These results suggest that INFA and INFB would mutually interfere in each other's infection, whereas infection with influenza and other viruses would occur independently in most cases.
