<p>To investigate whether MDCK‐S, MDCK‐A, and LLC‐MK2D can selectively amplify influenza virus in the presence of other respiratory viruses, co‐infection samples containing influenza virus plus other viruses were inoculated and passaged in the three cell lines. From all samples with triple or double infection, MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A could selectively allow proliferation of influenza viruses while eliminating all contaminating viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12694-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Particularly, the isolation rates of influenza viruses were significantly higher than those of co‐existing viruses in the groups of double infection 1 (INFA and OC43, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), double infection 2 (INFA and CVEV, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and double infection 3 (INFA and RHV, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). For LLC‐MK2D, influenza viruses were isolated from the groups of double infection 1 and double infection 3 without propagation of adventitious viruses; however, the differences in detection rates between influenza virus and others were not significant. In the double infection 2 group, an isolate of CVEV was obtained from four specimens (25%), although no influenza virus was amplified during cell passages.
