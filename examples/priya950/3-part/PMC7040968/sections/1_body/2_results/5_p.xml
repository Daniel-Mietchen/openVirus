<p>To examine further whether MDCK‐S, MDCK‐A, and LLC‐MK2D can eliminate contaminating viruses, we passaged clinical specimens containing respiratory viruses other than influenza virus in the three cell lines. The ResPlex II assay did not detect any respiratory virus in the cell‐passaged samples from all cell lines (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12694-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). CVEV, RHV, RSVA, RSVB, OC43, and NL63 were eliminated during cell passages irrespective of single or double infection.
