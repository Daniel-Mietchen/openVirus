<p>All adventitious virus‐positive specimens were inoculated into the cultures of these cells. For virus isolation using MDCK‐S, the infection medium was prepared with 37.5 µg/mL of neomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to prevent bacterial contamination from specimens and 1 µg/mL of TrypZean (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to support viral growth. The density of MDCK‐S in the infection medium was adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL, and 5 mL of cell suspension was distributed to 50‐mL filter‐capped tubes. For virus isolation with MDCK‐A and LLC‐MK2D, 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells of MDCK‐A and 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells of LLC‐MK2D were seeded in dishes of 60‐mm diameter 3 days before inoculation and maintained in MEM with 10% FBS until further use. OptiPRO serum‐free medium containing 4 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>‐Glu, 37.5 µg/mL neomycin, and 1 µg/mL TrypZean (for MDCK‐A) or 5 µg/mL Trypsin Acetylated (for LLC‐MK2D) was used to prepare the virus isolation medium. Fifty microliters of clinical specimens was inoculated into the cultures of the three cell lines and incubated under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 34°C for 72 hour. Supernatants were harvested and passaged further. After two passages, ResPlex II assays were performed again to investigate the presence or absence of influenza and other respiratory viruses.
