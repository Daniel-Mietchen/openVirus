<p>With respect to the viruses that were not included in the ResPlex II kit, we could not perform tests such as PCR for their detection, due to limited clinical specimens. It was reported that adherent MDCK cells (MDCK‐A) showed no growth of mumps viruses, measles viruses, rubella viruses, herpes simplex viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and parechoviruses
 <xref rid="irv12694-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>; hence, there seems to be little or no risk of amplification of these viruses during passages in MDCK‐S or MDCK‐A.
