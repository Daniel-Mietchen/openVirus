<p>The two MDCK cell lines showed different growth phenotypes; MDCK‐S is a suspension cell line, whereas MDCK‐A is an adherent cell line. This difference suggests that MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A have dissimilar patterns of glycosylation and protein expression on the cell surface. Consequently, we expected that MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A would exhibit different profiles of virus amplification; however, MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A showed the same results as both cell lines could propagate all influenza viruses and remove all adventitious agents from multiple infection samples. These results demonstrate that both MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A could be good cell substrates for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses.</p>
