<p>MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A cells were determined to be useful in this study for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents. However, new influenza viruses might appear that have lower abilities to replicate in MDCK cell lines. In this situation, it would be necessary to establish other cell lines and use them together to facilitate the amplification of variable influenza viruses. The use of MDCK‐S, MDCK‐A, and other cell lines could contribute to global public health through the rapid production of safe and effective cell‐based vaccines.</p>
