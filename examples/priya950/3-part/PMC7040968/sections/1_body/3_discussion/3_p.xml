 <xref rid="irv12694-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> have reported some statistically relevant associations between particular pathogens such as CVEV‐RHV (positive correlation) and INFB‐CVEV (negative correlation). These results were reproduced in the present study. Moreover, we newly identified INFA‐INFB as a negatively associated pair and CVEV‐RSVB as a positively associated pair.
