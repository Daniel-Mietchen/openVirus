<p>One of the limitations of this study is that the sample size of the multiple infection groups was small. Larger sample sizes will make it possible to identify more correlations among viruses and to test broader patterns of multiple infections for the selective isolation of influenza viruses. Another limitation is the lack of follow‐up studies to determine whether some viable viruses could be amplified upon additional passages. Cell culture techniques can sometimes multiply viruses even in the PCR‐negative samples.</p>
