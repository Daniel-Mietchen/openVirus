<p>Regarding LLC‐MK2D, the isolation rate of influenza viruses was 9.1% (n = 22), whereas that in MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A was 100% with a statistically significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). From four samples in the group of double infection 2, all contaminating CVEV was eradicated during passages in MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A, whereas one CVEV was isolated during LLC‐MK2D passages. These results indicate that LLC‐MK2D might be inferior to MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A considering its low ability to multiply influenza viruses and to eliminate the contaminating viruses.
