<p>Cell‐based vaccines can potentially solve the problem of antigenic changes associated with egg adaptation. Vaccine seed viruses, for cell‐based vaccines, can be prepared from clinical specimens with cell cultures; however, clinical samples have a risk of harboring respiratory viruses other than influenza viruses. Moreover, mammalian cells might amplify contaminating human viruses more easily than embryonated chicken eggs owing to host similarity. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co‐infection present in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses.</p>
