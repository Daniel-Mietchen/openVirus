 <xref rid="irv12694-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> LLC‐MK2D, which is a sub‐line of LLC‐MK2, was proven to be non‐tumorigenic in nude mice and free of specific adventitious agents. This cell line could be a promising candidate for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses, since its safety is confirmed and it can be used in practical applications with little delay.
