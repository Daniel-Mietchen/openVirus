 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> but the contribution to the immunity against influenza B is not well defined. Some degree of lineage cross-protection has been reported upon vaccination with trivalent influenza virus vaccines. However, it seems to be limited to certain age groups and the vaccine efficacy is consistently superior for influenza B strains belonging to the vaccine lineage

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The capability of an individual to generate a broad antibody response against epitopes that include regions conserved between the two lineages, e.g. in the HA stalk, seems to be of major importance. Thus, the factors influencing lineage cross-protection are complex and not easy to predict as also the immune memory may have a substantial impact on the targeted epitopes
