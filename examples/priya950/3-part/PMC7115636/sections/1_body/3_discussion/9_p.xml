<p id="p0115">In 76% of the patients with a vaccination history in this study the trivalent vaccine, with an expected moderate level of vaccine efficiency 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, was used. The majority of the vaccinated patients were adults. However, a major improvement to influenza disease burden may only be accomplished by extending vaccine recommendations to younger age groups that are immunologically more na√Øve and thus more susceptible to infections

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. WHO recommendations for the use of tetravalent vaccines that contain two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) in addition to the two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) should be implemented in national vaccination guidelines as it was done in Germany as a result of the severity of the 2017/18 influenza season.
