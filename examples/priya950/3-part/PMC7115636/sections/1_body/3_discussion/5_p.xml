<p id="p0095">A third potential factor may be the circulating influenza type. The Yamagata-lineage of influenza B was predominantly found in the season of 2017/18. In contrast to the Victoria lineage, which has a faster evolution with nearly each season representing a phylogenetic bottleneck, the biology of the Yamagata lineage is different. In long term studies of the HA of the Yamagata lineage a long co-circulation of Yamagata variants was observed 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In accordance with these observations the analyzed strains of this study were phylogenetically closely related. Furthermore, the detected amino acid changes were scattered throughout the HA and to the best of our knowledge no substitution is known for increased virus pathogenicity.
