<p id="p0105">A reason for this might be the interplay between the circulating influenza strains causing infections and the choice of the vaccine components or type of vaccine. In the season of 2015/16 Influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 and the Victoria-lineage of influenza B caused the majority of influenza infections. In 2016/17 influenza A/H3N2 was the main cause of flu disease. When looking at the influenza B component of the broadly used trivalent influenza vaccine there was a switch from B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata-lineage) to B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria-lineage) in the season 2016/17, effectively causing a mismatch in each of the three studied seasons. In 2017/18 the only strain that was not immunologically covered by recent epidemics or the current vaccine composition was the influenza B Yamagata-lineage. An increased proportion of non-immune individuals in the adult population thus may have contributed to the observed shift in the age distribution of the infected patients.</p>
