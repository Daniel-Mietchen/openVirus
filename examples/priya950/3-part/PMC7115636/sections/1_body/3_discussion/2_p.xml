<p id="p0080">The influenza season of 2017/18 was dominated by the Yamagata-lineage of influenza B in Europe. In Germany, it was the largest season in terms of case numbers since the establishment of the nationwide surveillance system in 2001 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Large scale epidemics or pandemics are usually caused by influenza A. This is attributed mostly to the broader host range and faster rate of evolution of influenza A 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Influenza B infections usually occur with a temporal delay towards the end of an influenza A-dominated season 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The exceptional impact of influenza B infections in 2017/18 with regard to public health was therefore surprising. However, seasons with a high proportion of influenza B infections occur infrequently. Specifically, in Germany, the mild seasons of 2001/2 and 2005/6 and the severe season of 2015/16 have been dominated by influenza B with a share of up to 78% of all influenza cases. The high severity of the season 2017/18 with an overall estimate of 9 million excess consultations in Germany 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> may be attributed to several factors.
