 <italic>Lineage Determination.</italic> Sufficient material for the phylogenetic lineage determination of the detected influenza B viruses was available in 337 (93.6%) of the cases, including 71 of season 2015/16, 10 of season 2016/17, and 256 of season 2017/18. Influenza B strains of the Victoria-lineage predominated in season 2015/16 (93%, n = 66/71), were rare in season 2016/17 (10%, n = 1/10), and were not detected in season 2017/18. Influenza B strains of the Yamagata-lineage were rare in season 2015/2016 (7%, n = 5/71), but prevailed in 2016/17 (90%, n = 9/10) and 2017/18 (100%).
