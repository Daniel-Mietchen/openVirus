 <italic>Amino acid changes</italic>. The detected amino acid changes (AA-changes) within the HA protein are depicted in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (HA0 numbering). In comparison to the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008, that is used as a reference, all Victoria strains showed a distinct amino acid at position 129 (N129D). Furthermore, eleven strains showed the I117V substitution including the single strain of season 2016/17. Both AA-changes are located within the 120-loop region. Further AA-changes were only found in single strains (A127T, N197D, T258I, E346G, K408R, M417I, and N525S, respectively). The strain of season 2016/17 showed three AA-changes (R80G, E313K, and D418N). In comparison to the vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013, all Yamagata strains showed a distinct amino acid at positions 251 (M251V) and 172 (L172Q). Following AA-changes were found in up to five of the strains: H14Y, V15M, V16I, P31Q, T35A, T37T/K, A42S, R69M, M71T, V73M, D126N, I150V, Y165H, T181A, E182K, N217D, D229G, D232N, K253S, R278Q, I438M, A505V, and D529N, respectively.
