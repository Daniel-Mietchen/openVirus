 <italic>HA phylogeny.</italic> Sequence analysis of the whole hemagglutinin gene was performed for 16 Victoria and 76 Yamagata strains and consistently confirmed the results of the initial lineage determination. Included were all strains of patients with a known trivalent (n = 33) or tetravalent (n = 7) vaccination, randomly selected patients without known vaccination (n = 51), and of all patients that had a fatal outcome within 30 days of the influenza B detection (n = 27). Except for one strain of 2017, all Victoria strains originated from the 2015/2016 season and belonged to the 1A clade. All of the strains were phylogenetically closely related and did not cluster based on vaccination history or fatal outcome (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). All analyzed Yamagata strains belonged to clade 3. All of the strains were phylogenetically closely related, but strain phylogeny indicates a discrete drift from season 2015/16 to season 2017/18. Again, no clustering with regard to vaccination history or fatal outcome was observed (
