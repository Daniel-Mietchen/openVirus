<p id="p0060">A total of 360 laboratory-confirmed influenza B cases were included in the study and were derived from 75 patients in 2015/16, eleven patients in 2016/17, and 274 patients in 2017/18. Cases of seasons 2015/16 and 2016/17 were combined (i.e. 2015–2017) and compared to 2017/18. The two groups differed in the age distribution (

However, when considering the pediatric (patients 17 and younger) and adult (patients 18 and older) populations separately, median age and age range did not differ between groups 2015–2017 and 2017/18. Therefore, a further analysis was done to compare the clinical features of the influenza B infections of the pediatric and adult patients with regard to the seasons and between the two age groups (

For the pediatric patients there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and 2015–2017 except for the combined rate of comorbidities and risk factors for a severe course of the influenza. However, this could not be attributed to a single analyzed factor. When looking at the adult population, there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and the previous seasons except for a higher proportion of female patients and a lower proportion of viral coinfections in 2017/18. Most differences were noted between the age groups. 32.3% of the adult patients were vaccinated, mostly with the trivalent vaccine, whereas 95.5% of the pediatric patients were unvaccinated. The rate of comorbidities was significantly higher in the adult population. Furthermore, the clinical course of the disease was more severe in the adult population as higher rates of ICU admissions, invasive ventilation, and fatal outcomes were observed.
