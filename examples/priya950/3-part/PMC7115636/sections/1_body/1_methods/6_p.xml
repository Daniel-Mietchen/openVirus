 <bold>Phylogenetic analysis.</bold> NA sequencing of the complete HA was performed according to WHO guidance 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In cases of low influenza B concentration an alternative protocol generating three instead of two overlapping fragments was used 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Phylogenetic trees of the 1710 nucleotides large HA coding region were constructed at nucleotide level with the MEGA software version 6 using the Maximum-Likelihood method. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Complete HA sequences were submitted to Genbank (accession numbers MK459565 - MK459656).
