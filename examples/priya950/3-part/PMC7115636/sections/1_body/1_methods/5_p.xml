 <bold>Lineage determination.</bold> NA sequences of a 123 bp-long amplicon of the HA gene 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> were assessed (BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit v1.1 and ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The sequenced region corresponds to nucleotide positions 966–1088 and 963–1085 of the complete HA gene of the Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008) and the Yamagata lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013), respectively. Sequences with nucleotides G16, G17, G28, G55, C64, G73, and A112 belonged to the Victoria-lineage. Viruses with nucleotides A16, A17, A28, A55, T64, T73, and G112 belonged to the Yamagata-lineage.
