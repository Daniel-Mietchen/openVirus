<p id="p0020">The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and molecular features of laboratory-confirmed influenza B cases during three consecutive seasons between 2015 and 2018. A comparison between patient characteristics was done in relation to the combined seasons of 2015/16 and 2016/17 when appropriate. Additionally, molecular epidemiology of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene was performed on selected isolates and amino acid changes were mapped to the major antigenic domains of the HA protein.</p>
