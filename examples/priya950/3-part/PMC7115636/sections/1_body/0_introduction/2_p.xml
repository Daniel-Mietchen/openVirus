<p id="p0005">Influenza B virus of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> has a segmented single stranded, negative sense RNA genome. First isolated in 1940, influenza B virus diverged into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, in the late 1970s with similar clinical 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> but different phylodynamic properties 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although infections in pigs and seals were observed, there is no known animal reservoir for influenza B 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, while influenza A infections can be zoonotic, influenza B virus only circulates in the human population. The narrow host range and slower evolution 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> are thought to be the main contributing factors to the less frequent occurrence of influenza B epidemics 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.
