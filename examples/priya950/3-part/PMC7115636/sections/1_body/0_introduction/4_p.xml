<p id="p0015">The key component of the vaccine is the viral hemagglutinin (HA) that covers the viral surface in a trimeric form. The major antigenic regions are the 120-loop, 150-loop, 160-loop, and 190-helix 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and are located on the HA1 subunit which forms the globular head domain. It is responsible for recognition and binding of sialic acids on the surface of the target cells. The HA2 subunit is the main component of the HA stalk. Although some antibody cross reactivity is observed 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, vaccine efficiency between the two lineages might be reduced in seasons in which the formulation of the trivalent influenza vaccine does not match the circulating strain due to antigenic differences 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Additionally, there is growing evidence that vaccine effectiveness is already waning within a season thus reducing immunological protection even if the vaccine contained the matching strain in the previous season
