  <p>Phylogenetic trees of the hemagglutinin (HA) nucleotide sequences of (A) Victoria- and (B) Yamagata-like influenza B viruses. Trees were constructed based upon nucleic acid alignments of the complete coding sequences (1710 nucleotides) of HA gene (1755 nucleotides) by the Maximum-Likelihood method. Numbers at each node represent bootstrap values obtained with 1000 replicates (values &gt; 75 are shown). Reference strains are given at the bottom of the trees (black). Isolates from this study are labeled with the following symbols: vaccinated with trivalent vaccine (triangle), vaccinated with tetravalent vaccine (square), randomly selected case without vaccination history (circle), fatal cases (black filled symbols). Strains of season 2015/16 are shown in purple, strains of season 2016/17 are shown in green and strains of season 2017/2018 are shown in blue. Amino acid changes with regard to the vaccine strain (red) are given in brackets. The clades of the detected lineages are shown on the right (numbers). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
