<p>In the current work, aphid vectors and indicator plants were utilized to sample the ‘potyvirome’, a collective term for all potyvirus genomes in the area, particularly those capable of infecting common beans in Iran. Potyvirus detection was performed by serological assays using broad-spectrum antibodies and degenerate RT-PCR primers, followed by sequencing and sequence analyses. The results clearly confirmed the natural occurrence of a new potyvirus, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., Wisteria vein mosaic virus (WVMV), in the country. We compared the sequences from Iran and other geographical regions for the evolutionary characterization of the virus. Our studies, to our knowledge, provide the first phylogenetic analysis of WVMV isolates.
