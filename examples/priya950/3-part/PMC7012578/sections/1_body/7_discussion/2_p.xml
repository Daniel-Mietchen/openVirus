<p>The discovery of WVMV was surprising because this virus had not previously been reported from Iran or the rest of the western Asian region. However, we have not any information about the occurrence, distribution and the possible economical importance of the virus in different crops, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> legumes, in different geographical regions of the country. Phylogenetic analyses of WVMV isolates indicate five geographical subpopulations: three from China (East Asian-1 to 3), one from USA (North American) and one from Oceania, Europe and Iran (World) (
 <xref rid="f2-ppj-36-087" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>); however, East Asian-3 and World groups may be also considered as one genogroup (
 <xref rid="t2-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the trees obtained from amino acid sequences categorized the sequences into three major groups: one from China (containing East Asian-1&amp;2 isolates), one from USA (containing North American isolate) and one from Oceania, Europe, China, and Iran (containing World and East Asian-3 isolates) (figure not shown). The results seem to indicate that “geographical origin” may play an important role in the evolution of this virus; similar results have been obtained for other RNA viruses (

 <xref rid="b63-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Yasaka et al., 2017</xref>). While very low values (0.00–0.02) were obtained in nucleotide sequence comparisons between the isolates in the World group, high values (0.00–0.22) were calculated in pairwise comparisons between Chinese isolates, and between Chinese and non-Chinese isolates (
 <xref rid="t3-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These findings, together with the results of the phylogenetic analyses, show a possible Eastern-Asian origin of the virus, because highest genetic diversity of a pathogen typically occurs in its center of origin (
 <xref rid="b26-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2005</xref>). This region is considered as the main region where 
 <italic>Wisteria</italic> originated (
 <xref rid="b31-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies seem necessary to confirm this hypothesis. It is worth noting that WVMV is limited to 
 <italic>Wisteria</italic> species (
 <xref rid="b6-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Clover et al., 2003</xref>), and 
 <italic>Robinia</italic> sp. is not listed as a host. Moreover, there are no wild 
 <italic>Wisteria</italic> species in Iran; the ornamental species cultivated is 
 <italic>W. sinensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="b40-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Mozaffarian, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the simplest explanation for the occurrence of this virus in Iran is that it was transported there by humans in 
 <italic>Wisteria</italic> plants. The role of human in dissemination of other potyviruses has been suggested earlier (
 <xref rid="b63-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Yasaka et al., 2017</xref>). Virus-infected plants were possibly imported to Iran from Europe or Oceania; some of the countries in these regions have a lot of agricultural trades with Iran. This study also showed some genogroup-specific amino acid substitutions that can be used to design genogroup-specific primer pairs for fast and accurate detection of different populations of the virus, which can improve our future quarantine programs.
