<p>A limitation of the approach used in this study is the difficulty in identifying viruses that do not infect the experimental host plants. To solve this problem, a broad range of indicator plants or those susceptible to a wide range of plant viruses,

 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (

The other issue happens when we are dealing with viruses for which genus or family-specific primers do not exist. This is illustrated in the challenges we are having to identify the second virus discovered here. HTS can be an effective tool for detecting unknown viruses because no previous knowledge of the virus sequence is required, and this approach has been used to identify known and novel viruses from wild and domesticated plants (

However, the effectiveness of an HTS approach to screening the virome of the area by sampling aphids relies on the proportion of aphids carrying viruses. Furthermore, this method seems not to be highly reliable where viruses or viroids are in low titer (
 <xref rid="b25-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 2018</xref>). The average of non-persistent virus particles transmitted by an aphid was estimated to be as low as 0.5â€“3.2 (
 <xref rid="b38-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Moury et al., 2007</xref>). These issues and the transient nature of non-persistently transmitted plant viruses may be the main reasons for the failure to detect such viruses in aphids by using HTS approach in previous studies (

 <xref rid="b54-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Wamonje et al., 2017</xref>), so it is not a definitive measure of the virome of the region.
