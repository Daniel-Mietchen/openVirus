<p>Previous studies have shown the occurrence of different aphid species capable of transmitting potyviruses in several parts of Iran that experience different climate conditions (

Therefore, an extension of this survey to the other areas of Iran and the use of different approaches seem justified to understand more about aphid-borne potyviruses and their epidemiology. This work introduces a simple but effective approach to sample potyviruses, which can be possibly applied for other vector-transmitted plant viruses. Utilizing such approaches will help us understand more about vector-borne viruses in the area, optimize diagnostic systems for their fast and accurate detection, and monitor them effectively to control them before causing epidemies.
