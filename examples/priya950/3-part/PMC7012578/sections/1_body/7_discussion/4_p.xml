<p>‘Virome’ was a term first used to define the total viral component of a species or ecosystem (
 <xref rid="b56-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Wegley et al., 2007</xref>), but has since been used to describe the sum of the viral genomes present on the planet (
 <xref rid="b44-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Paez-Espino et al., 2016</xref>). When the term virome is applied to an individual, it generally refers to the viruses replicating within a host (
 <xref rid="b53-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Virgin, 2014</xref>). To distinguish those viruses replicating within a host and those viruses, especially non-replicative ones, that are using the organism as a vector to transport them to another host, herein we propose the term ‘vectorome.’ The term describes viruses carried by a viral vector that can be transmitted to non-homologous hosts, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., from aphids to plants, but do not replicate in vector cells in many cases. For example, Aphis glycines virus 2 (ApGlV2) systemically infects the soybean aphid, 
 <italic>Aphis glycines</italic>, where it is vertically transmitted to progeny (
 <xref rid="b35-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). It does not infect plants, and thus is not part of the aphid vectorome. On the other hand, the non-persistent (non-replicative) potyvirus SMV is a plant-infecting virus vectored by this aphid and is a component of its vectorome. Persistent (replicative) viruses such as tospoviruses that replicate in both vectors and plant hosts, are also components of the vectorome. In other word, all viruses present in a vector, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., an aphid, at any given moment constitute its virome, but only viruses capable of being transmitted to a non-homologous host constitute the vectorome. Non-replicative viruses, such as SMV and many other RNA-based plant viruses, may remain infectious in their vectors for periods of minutes to hours (

 <xref rid="b22-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2014</xref>), and thus the vectorome is of a transient nature. We propose that this term be applied to all viruses transmitted by all vectors to non-homologous hosts.
