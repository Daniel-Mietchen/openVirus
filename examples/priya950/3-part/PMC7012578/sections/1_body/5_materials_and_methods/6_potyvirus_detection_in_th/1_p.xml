<p>The presence of a potyvirus in the original locust tree (
 <italic>Robinia</italic> sp.) was tested. To this end, leaf samples were collected from this plant in the fall and spring of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Sampling was done from different branches of the plant and each sample was tested separately for potyvirus infections by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using potyvirus antibodies followed by RT-PCR using NIb primers, as above.
