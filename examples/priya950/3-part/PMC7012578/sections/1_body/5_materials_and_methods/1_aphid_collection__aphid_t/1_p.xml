<p>In June 2014, live colonizing (apterous) aphids were collected from wild asymptomatic leguminous herbs and trees in Tehran province, one of the main pulse-producing provinces of Iran. The location of each sample was recorded by Global Positioning System (GPS). Eleven aphid samples consisting of 10–20 insects per sample were immediately transferred to young healthy bean (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) seedlings, grown from seeds under greenhouse conditions, for an inoculation access period of at least 1 h. Inoculation of bean plants was performed at cotyledon to two-leaf growth stages under field conditions, and the plants were then covered. Inoculated plants were transported to an insect-proof greenhouse. Aphids were preserved in 70% ethanol for later identification by A. Rezvani (Iranian Plant Protection Research Institute, Tehran, Iran). Potyvirus infections of the inoculated plants were tested by plate-trapped antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (

OD values were measured at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader (EL800, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). A sample was considered virus-positive if its OD was equal to or exceeded three times the mean value of the negative controls (healthy) one hour after adding the substrate (
