<p>As a first step, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (
 <xref rid="b1-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) was applied to search GenBank databases (available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify the sequences that most closely matched the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences obtained in this study. In the second step, the partial sequences of the CI and NIb genes and the complete sequence of the CP gene of the isolate Th-W2259 were concatenated (2,277 nts length). This sequence and the corresponding regions of 78 reference sequences from a set of representative species from the genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic> (ICTV) (
 <xref rid="b58-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Wylie et al., 2017</xref>) were used in phylogenetic analysis to confirm the results of database searches. A sequence from an isolate of ryegrass mosaic virus (RGMV) (accession no. NC_001814), genus 
 <italic>Rymovirus</italic>, was used as the outgroup (
 <xref rid="b64-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>) (
 <xref rid="s1-ppj-36-087" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The sequences were first aligned and degapped (
 <xref rid="b11-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Farzadfar et al., 2009</xref>). Evolutionary relationships between the viral sequences were deduced using maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithms in Mega 6.0 software (
 <xref rid="b51-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>). ML analysis was done using the ‘find best substitution model’, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., general time-reversible model with a gamma distribution of site-rate variants across four categories and a proportion of invariant sites. The ML trees were found by subtree pruning and regrafting trees. We also did NJ analysis using Kimura two-parameter model. Both methods were done using 1,000 bootstraps. Trees were graphically edited using Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) v4 (
 <xref rid="b30-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Letunic and Bork, 2019</xref>): nodes with less than 50% bootstrap support in both methods were collapsed and the joining branches of a collapsed node were adjusted to include the length of the collapsed branch and maintain most patristic distances (
