<p>RT-PCR tests were conducted using universal cylindrical inclusion (CI), nuclear inclusion body protein (NIb), and NWCIEN primers according to previously published procedures (

 <xref rid="b64-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). To obtain the complete coat protein (CP) gene sequence of the isolate, two new primers (WVNIb1P: 5′-TTGTTTGCCCTTGGACAGTG-3′ and WVPseq: 5′-ATGTATGCTTCAGCCGCATC-3′) were designed based on the partial NIb and CP gene sequences of the isolate, respectively. These primers were then used to amplify the gap between the NIb and CP regions; the PCR program was 94°C for 4 min, 38 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 45 s and 72°C for 2 min, and finally 72°C for 10 min. PCR products and DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized using GelRed staining (Biotium Inc., Fremont, CA, USA), and photographed with ultraviolet-illumination.
