<p>Isolate Th-W2259 was studied further. To this end, partial genomic sequence of the potyvirus isolate was determined. First, total RNA was extracted from 0.02–0.03 g of dried infected bean leaves using a LiCl-based protocol (
 <xref rid="b7-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">de Fátima Rosas-Cárdenas et al., 2011</xref>). We used 5 μl of DNase I (50 u/μl; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove DNA from the total RNAs obtained; the enzyme was then deactivated by adding 10 μl EDTA (50 mM; Thermo Scientific) and incubation at 65°C for 10 min. Total RNA was finally precipitated, resuspended in RNase/DNase free water and stored at −20°C. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (CinnaGen, Tehran, Iran), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. PCR amplifications were done using
