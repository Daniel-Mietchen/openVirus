<p>About 80% of known plant viruses are insect-transmissible, and more than 70% of all insect-borne viruses are transmitted by hemipterans (
 <xref rid="b13-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Fereres and Raccah, 2015</xref>), including aphids. Aphids belong to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and over 5,000 species have been recorded (
 <xref rid="b14-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Foottit et al., 2008</xref>). While some aphids have very narrow host ranges, being specialized to feed from plants of one species or genus, others feed across multiple families. For example, 
 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (green peach aphid) colonizes plants from over 50 families. The combination of feeding behavior, sexual and asexual life cycles, and ability to transmit many viruses make aphids very serious pests of agriculture in temperate regions. Aphids transmit plant viruses, especially single-stranded RNA viruses, through non-circulative (non-persistent or semi-persistent) and circulative (propagative or non-propagative) strategies; most aphid-borne viruses are transmitted non-persistently (
