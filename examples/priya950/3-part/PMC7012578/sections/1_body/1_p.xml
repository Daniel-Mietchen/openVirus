<p>Human activities, such as the international trade in fresh plant produce and propagules, and farming activities at the interfaces of managed and wild systems, enhance the possibility of viruses expanding their geographical and host ranges, leading to emergence of new viruses and epidemics (

 <xref rid="b61-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, constant monitoring and diagnosis of plant viruses is important. Aphid-transmitted plant viruses have mainly been detected directly from host plants rather than from aphid vectors (

 <italic>etc</italic>.) that may restrict effectiveness of RNA extraction and subsequent enzymatic amplification steps (
