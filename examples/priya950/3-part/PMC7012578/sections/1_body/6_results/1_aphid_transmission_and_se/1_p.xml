<p>Virus-like symptoms consisting of necrotic dots, chlorotic patches and mottling, and discoloration, bleaching, mosaic patterns and necrotic ring spots appeared on leaves of two bean plants after inoculation with aphids collected from a 
 <italic>Robinia</italic> sp. (locust) tree in the city of Tehran, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., mixed colonies of 
 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fabae</italic> which were subsequently identified. The two virus-like isolates were respectively named Th-W2259 and Th-W2260 (
 <xref rid="f1-ppj-36-087" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). While systemic symptoms were induced for isolate Th-W2259, symptoms for the isolate Th-W2260 were limited to inoculated leaves. The identity of Th-W2259 as a potyvirus was confirmed by ELISA using potyvirus antibodies. Sample Th-W2260 had a negative reaction under ELISA for the same potyvirus antibodies.
