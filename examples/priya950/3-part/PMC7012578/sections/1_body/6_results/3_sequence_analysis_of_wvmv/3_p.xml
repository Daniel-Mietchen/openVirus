<p>The net mean nucleotide distance between two groups, except for between the World and East Asian-3 groups, ranged from 0.12 to 0.21; the value obtained for the two groups was 0.04 (
 <xref rid="t2-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). So, the phylogenetic clustering of the isolates into at least four groups was reasonable. However, the East Asian-3 and World group may be either considered as two distinct groups, or one group namely World group. The mean nucleotide and amino acid sequence distances of the isolates in each group with respect to SMV sequence used as the outgroup were 0.31–0.38 and 0.19–0.24, respectively (
 <xref rid="t2-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nucleotide sequence comparisons between Chinese isolates, non-Chinese isolates, and between Chinese and other isolates were 0.00–0.22, 0.00–0.14, and 0.04–0.21, respectively. This value was 0.00–0.02 for the Iranian and other isolates from Oceania and Europe. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence distances of representative WVMV sequences from different genogroups are shown in 
 <xref rid="t3-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The overall nucleotide and amino acid sequence distances among the WVMV sequences were 0.12 and 0.02, respectively.
