<p>The three universal primer pairs used in RT-PCR, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., CI, NIb, and NWCIEN primers, generated amplification products for the potyvirus isolate Th-W2259 with expected sizes of approximately 0.7-kb, 0.3-kb, and 0.7-kb, respectively (

 <xref rid="b64-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Also, DNA fragments of about 1.0 kb were amplified using primers WVNIb1P and WVPseq designed to amplify the gap between NIb and CP regions. The sequences of the amplicons were determined. BLASTN analyses showed that the partial sequences of CI, NIb, and CP genes most closely matched sequences from WVMV isolates (genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic>), with pairwise sequence identity scores of 91%, 89%, and 99%, respectively. A contig consisting of the partial NIb, the complete CP and the partial 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) was then assembled. The results showed that the complete CP gene of Th-W2259, composed of 846 nucleotides with deduced amino acid sequences of 282 aa, had the highest identities of 99% and 100%, respectively, to an Australian isolate of WVMV (accession no. AF484549). The genomic sequences were assigned GenBank accessions MH558669 (CI region) and MH558668 (NIb to 3′UTR). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the concatenated CI, NIb, and CP sequences of the isolate. The ML analysis is shown (

In all the trees, the sequence of the Iranian isolate was placed as a sister group of WVMV and clustered with potyviruses in the BCMV subgroup with high bootstrap values, similar to those reported previously (
