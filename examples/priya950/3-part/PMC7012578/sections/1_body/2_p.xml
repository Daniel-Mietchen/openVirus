<p>Studies of non-aphid vectors, including ticks, mosquitoes, and whiteflies, have revealed novel viruses and others not previously known to exist in the study area (

Direct virus sampling of aphids from host plants or by trapping/collecting aphids followed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or high-throughput sequencing (HTS), are some potential methods for detecting and studying aphid-borne plant viruses. One review described direct detection of viruses from their vectors as a “major challenge to diagnosticians and plant pathologists” (

A potential disadvantage of such approaches is the difficulty of subsequent establishment of virus cultures for further studies from extracts of single aphids, when a virus is diagnosed. By enabling captured aphids to transmit any viruses they are carrying to indicator plants, a virus culture is thereby established. A similar method has been previously utilized to assess efficiency of transmission of specific viruses,
