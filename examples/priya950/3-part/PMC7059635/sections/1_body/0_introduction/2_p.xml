<p>Furthermore, there are 290 000 new HIV infections each year in South Africa and TB incidents stand at 854 per 100 000 cases that include PLWH. Such figures raise serious concerns (UNAIDS 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, one-fourth of deaths reported in the RSA are because of HIV-related illnesses and TB has been identified as the leading cause at 8.4% of natural deaths (UNAIDS 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). World Health Organization’s (WHO) task shifting was implemented for nurses to initiate ART in order to meet this increasing demand for ART since 2009 (WHO 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Other policy strategies like 90–90–90 were developed and nurses working in the primary health care (PHC) setting were capacitated to improve the management and control the HIV and TB epidemics (UNAIDS 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). Despite these measures, quality health is still a challenge as measured by patient outcomes. This is confirmed by low rates of viral load (VL) suppression, high loss to follow-up (LTFU) and fluctuating numbers of total patients remaining on ART (TROA). In addition, ART initiation amongst HIV-positive antenatal care (ANC) pregnant women, children and TB or HIV co-infected is far below the target of 90% in some districts of the North West province. This is despite the fact that nurses in the province have been trained on HIV management or nurse-initiated management of ART (NIMART) (North West Province Department of Health, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015–2016</xref>). The healthcare system in the North West province continues to experience challenges that have serious repercussions on the implementation of NIMART or HIV management. This fact points to the negative impact on the outcomes of the programmes and patients. Several studies reviewed in this study have revealed that organisational barriers influencing NIMART implementation range from training, human resources (HRs)and budget to patient factors. All these need to be dealt with decisively (Byakika-Kibwika et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Davies, Homfray &amp; Venables 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kaposhi, Mqoqi &amp; Schnopflocker 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mbonye et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Spies et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zuber et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The objective of NIMART training is to produce knowledgeable, skilled and competent nurses who could exhibit confidence as health practitioners. The training also seeks to inculcate positive attitudes in the practitioners as they deal with PLWH. The ultimate stride is that the HIV programme ought to improve patient outcomes (National Department of Health
