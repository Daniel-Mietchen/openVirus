<p>Monitoring assists in early identification of drug interactions, treatment failure and early switching to other drugs or regimens (Cope et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wilhelmson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Life expectancy of PLWH could be improved if LTFU is considered seriously (Patterson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It is evident from the study results that NIMART nurses still lack confidence and competence because of the level of NIMART training and mentoring received, which along with the organisational factors influence implementation (Davies et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mack et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mbonye et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nyasulu et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Owens &amp; Moroney 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It is also evident from the study findings that these barriers should be dealt with decisively to improve outcomes. De La Mata et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) stated that facility resources contribute to implementation and reduction of LTFU. Nurse-initiated management of antiretroviral therapy nurses did not comply with guidelines and compromised the quality of management provided. It was from these issues that the need originated to develop a CF to strengthen NIMART training and implementation in the North West province.
