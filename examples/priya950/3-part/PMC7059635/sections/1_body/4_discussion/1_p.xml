<p>The purpose of this study was to conceptualise the study findings to develop and describe a CF that could provide guidance and strengthen NIMART training and implementation to improve patient and HIV programme outcomes in the North West province. The CF was developed based on Dickoff et al.’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) practice-oriented theory and Donabedian’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>) SPO model. The study found that even though access to ART has increased, ART initiation versus HIV-positive patients is low, especially amongst children and ANC (pregnant) women and poses a risk of mother to child transmission, while nurses are trained on NMART. Abuogi, Smith and McFarland (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) opined that failure to initiate or retain children on ART leads to early mortality. According to Van der Walt, Lancaster and Shean (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), Anigilaje et al. (2016) and Teklu et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), early ART initiation reduces transmission of HIV infection, death and incidences of TB. Deconinck et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and Adedinsewo et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also confirmed that timing of ART initiation also reduces opportunistic infection and improves the health of PLWHV. Reddy et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), Gesesew et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and McNairy et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) confirmed that poor linkage of HIV-positive patients to care results in early LTFU and delayed ART initiation. Grimsrud et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) stated that reorganisation of the ART programme and a proper down referral system could reduce LTFU. The universal test and treat policy should be implemented to improve patient outcomes and achieve the ambitious 90–90–90 targets (UNAIDS 2014).
