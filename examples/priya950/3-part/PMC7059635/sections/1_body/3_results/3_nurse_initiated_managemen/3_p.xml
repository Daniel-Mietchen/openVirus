<p>Training is conducted differently over 5 or 10 days. Community service nurses left the higher education institution (HEI) without the basic knowledge and skills on ART or HIV management; hence, some patients are turned away and advised to come back when there is a NIMART nurse. If this does not happen, the reports indicate that patients are transferred to another PHC facility or hospital. These factors were reported to frustrate community service nurses and weaken linkages to healthcare. Another aspect revealed in this study is the use of unskilled facilitators and ineffective traditional training strategies that lack integration of theory and practice and thus result in poor learning outcomes. The study revealed that NIMART training is not recognised or registered with the regulatory bodies like South African Nursing Council (SANC) or health and welfare sector education and training authority (HWSETA) for quality and is not regarded as part of continuous professional development (CPD) to keep nurses and lecturers updated on HIV management.</p>
