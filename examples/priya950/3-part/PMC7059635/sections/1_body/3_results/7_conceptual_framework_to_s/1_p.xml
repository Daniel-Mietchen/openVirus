<p>The CF was developed based on Dickoff et al.’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) practice-oriented theory and Donabedian’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>) SPO model. Both Dickoff et al.’s practice-oriented theory and Donabedian’s SPO model enabled the researcher to identify and incorporate the different features so that these coalesce to provide the emerging phases 1–3 results, and eventually a CF. The development of CF is described next.
