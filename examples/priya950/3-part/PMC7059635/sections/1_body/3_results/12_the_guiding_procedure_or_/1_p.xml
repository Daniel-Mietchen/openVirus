<p>Guiding principle refers to the rule, technique, protocol and routine governing the activities to achieve the terminus (Dickoff et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>). It is evident from the study results that quality training, mentoring, support and compliance to policies, guidelines, SOPs and protocols are the guiding principles that facilitate achievement of patient and framework outcomes. Again, monitoring, reporting and evaluation facilitate identification of gaps, signs of danger and success to arrive at the terminus. Another principle to facilitate and influence implementation is involvement of all internal and external stakeholders, which includes district clinical specialist teams (DCSTs), facilitators, RTC managers and the province and district leadership developmental partners, HEI, SANC and HWSETA in implementation.
