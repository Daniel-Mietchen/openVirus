<p>Terminus refers to the outcomes or results of an activity (Dickoff et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>). Donabedian (

It is evident from the study findings that the outcomes of effective and efficient implementation of NIMART training facilitate the production of confident, competent and skilled NIMART nurses, who are compliant to policies and guidelines. This will facilitate the improvement of patient health status by increasing linkages to ART, improving adherence and retention to care, low LTFU, viral suppression and decanting of stable patients and relieving pressure on NIMART nurses. Furthermore, this facilitates the reduction of death rate and increases life expectancy.
