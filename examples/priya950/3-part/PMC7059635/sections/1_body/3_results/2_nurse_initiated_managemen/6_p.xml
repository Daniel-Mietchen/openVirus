<p>Some patients were reported to wait outside and felt uncomfortable when they had to wait for long times before they were attended to. The study revealed that there is a critical shortage of skilled HRs and experienced nurses are resigning. In addition, NIMART nurses revealed that the Department of Health always argued that budget constraints were the main reason why vacancies were not filled. This was also highlighted through the reported high staff turnover, especially amongst skilled NIMART nurses. The remaining NIMART nurses and programme managers reported that they are overworked, and this puts them under severe pressure. Because the NIMART-trained nurses are stressed, some display negative attitudes towards the HIV programme and PLWH. These also contribute to poor compliance to guidelines and patients having to wait for long hours for care, while some are left unattended. Both NIMART nurses and programme managers revealed that there is no support, coaching and supervision from management and the absence of all these demoralises them (
