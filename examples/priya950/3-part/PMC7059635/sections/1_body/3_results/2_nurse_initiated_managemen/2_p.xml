<p>The qualitative results revealed that newly qualified PNs from the nursing colleges and university reported that they were frustrated by not knowing what to do and tended to transfer patients who tested positive to another facility or book them for another day. One NIMART nurse stated that ‘[
 <italic>I</italic>] wish NIMART can be introduced in the college or university curriculum so that I know how to manage TB/HIV patients before I join the Department [
 <italic>of Health</italic>]’ (P13, FGD3, female) and another nurse indicated that ‘I was so disappointed and frustrated at the same time for failing to help the client’ (emotional, raising the voice) (P8, FGD2, male). Such transfer of responsibilities could negatively contribute to low ART initiation and losing patients before initiation. The study revealed that not all HIV-positive patients are initiated on ART in both PHC clinics and CHCs, especially amongst children and ANC pregnant women, despite the introduction of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)policy in 2013 (National Department of Health 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and universal test and treat in September 2016 (National Department of Health 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These policies specifically direct that all patients who are HIV-positive, including pregnant women, should be initiated on ART without considering the Cluster of Differentiation 4 cell count.
