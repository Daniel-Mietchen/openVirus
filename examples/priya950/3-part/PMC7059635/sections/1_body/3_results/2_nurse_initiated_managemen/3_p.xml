<p>This was found to be closely linked to the qualitative results (
 <xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), showing clearly that NIMART nurses are not initiating ART because they are not trained. The other reason lies in the fact that some PNs have negative attitudes towards the HIV programme. There is also evidence that inadequate in-service training on updated guidelines, poor compliance to guidelines, lack of confidence, especially to manage children and TB and HIV co-infected patients, and poor linkage to care within the facility only serve to exacerbate the situation with regard to PLWH. In addition, NIMART nurses revealed that data quality and management are poor. This contributes to low ART initiation and frustrates them, as their hard work is not recognised. The study also disclosed that NIMART nurses fail to complete and audit clinical records and such practices compromise the quality, capturing and reporting of critical data.
