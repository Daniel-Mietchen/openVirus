<p>According to Dickoff et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>), an agent refers to a person or thing that implements the framework. According to Donabedianâ€™s (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>) SPO model, this refers to the structure that enables the implementation of the CF, including the recipient and the context. In this study, the national, provincial and district-level RTCs, and developmental partners including SANC and HEI are the chief implementers of the framework. It is evident from the study findings that they lack a CF to guide and strengthen the implementation of NIMART training that strives to achieve the intended goal of a skilled, confident, competent NIMART nurse cohort that renders quality HIV services and improves patient outcomes. In most instances, it does not address the gaps affecting the HIV programme.
