<p>Dynamics refer to the sources of power or energy amongst the activities (Dickoff et al.

It is evident from the study findings that motivation, acknowledgement and recognition of NIMART nurses for rendering services under difficult conditions substantially influence and facilitate implementation. Intrinsic and extrinsic recognition is necessary to motivate and enhance the performance. This would invariably boost their self-esteem, build confidence and improve the sense of responsibility and feeling worthy to the department. Again, the Department of Health should meet NIMART nurses’ needs and deal with their frustrations. Furthermore, avoiding negative criticism and blame–punishment feedback would exert a great influence on successful implementation.
