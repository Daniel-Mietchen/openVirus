<p>The influenza virus NS1 protein is a determinant factor for viral replication and host adaptation, as well as for host anti-viral response counteraction (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). The reassortant viruses were propagated in SPF embryonic eggs followed by single-plaque purification. The titers of NS1031 virus were significantly lower than those of the other three RG-AIVs when initially amplified in embryonic eggs, and this pattern was mirrored in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetic experiments, even at a late stage of infection (48 hpi). Moreover, among the four reassortant viruses, NS1031 gave rise to plaques with the smallest size. Given that plaque size generally represents the replication efficiency of influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), the low yield, retardation of growth kinetics, and decrease in plaque size indicated that NS1031 gene substitution leads to attenuation of the reassortant RG-AIV. Noticeably, cells that were infected with the NS1031 virus, as compared with NS0702, expressed significant higher levels of cytokines, including IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF-α; and that could be observed in both avian and human models (as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Similarly, infection of the RG virus NS1680 stimulated a higher level of IFN-β and TNF-α in chicken DF1 cells, whereas cells infected with RG NS683 virus expressed a lower level of TNF-α in DF1 cells.
