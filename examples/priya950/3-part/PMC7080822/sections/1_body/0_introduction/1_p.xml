<p>Avian influenza virus (AIV) causes highly contagious diseases in poultry worldwide and poses a severe public health threat to humans (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>). This H5N2 was a reassortant virus, with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) likely derived from a Mexican-like H5N2 and internal genes from the enzootic H6N1 lineage. The Taiwanese H5N2 evolved to a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2012; sequence analysis indicated that these H5N2 viruses harbor multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the HA-connecting peptides and that they co-circulate with H6N1 (
