<p>Madin–Darby canine kidney cells seeded in 12-well plates (approximately 90% confluency) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with 400 μl of viruses serially diluted by an infectious medium (DMEM with TPCK-treated trypsin) in 10-fold steps. One hour post adsorption, the infectious medium was removed, and the cells were covered by the infectious medium with 0.6% agarose. At 48 h post infection (hpi), cells were fixed by methanol and stained with crystal violet. Virus titers were calculated and expressed as the mean plaque-forming units (PFUs)/ml.</p>
