<p>The effect of AIVs on cytokine expression was evaluated in cell and animal models. Cell models using avian DF-1 and human A549 cells were infected with reassortant viruses at a MOI of 0.1 in five independent experiments. At 6 and 12 hpi, total RNA was extracted from cells by RNeasy Plus Universal Mini kit (QIAGEN) and processed by TURBO DNA-Free kit (Invitrogen). One-day-old chickens (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were used as an animal model and intratracheally inoculated with 5 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of the reassortant viruses. At 6 and 12 hpi, lungs of the infected animals were collected and homogenized by TissueLyser II (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell RSC simplyRNA Tissue kit (Promega). The experimental protocol and sample collection were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Committee of National Chung Hsing University (IACUC number: 107-148).
