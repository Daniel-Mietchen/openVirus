<p>Subsequently, cytokine expression was monitored by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers (summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). RNA was reverse-transcribed with GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR System kit (Promega) followed by cytokine quantification (CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System, Bio-Rad). Expression data from three independent experiment were relativized by 2
