<p>Transient expression was achieved by transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate one night prior to transfection. In total, 1 μg of plasmid(s) was mixed with 2 μl of liposome diluted in 50 μl of DMEM (without FBS or antibiotics) at room temperature. After 20-min incubation, the DNA and liposome mixture were added dropwise onto cells and incubated for 1 day for further analysis.</p>
