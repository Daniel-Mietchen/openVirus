<p>Briefly, 293T cells seeded in 48-well plates were co-transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid expressing A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013 NP (20 ng), PB1 (20 ng), PB2 (20 ng), and PA (20 ng); a firefly luciferase expression plasmid (10 ng) as an internal control for transfection efficiency; and a reporter plasmid, pPol I-Flu-Rluc (100 ng) (

At 24 hpi, the transfected cells were harvested, and luminescence was assayed using a Dual-Glo luciferase assay system following manufacturer instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured by a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). Relative light units (RLUs) were estimated as the ratio of
