<p>The RNA of A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013 was extracted, and the eight segments of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR (primers, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All primers contained the restriction enzyme 
 <italic>Sap</italic>I and the non-coding regions of each segment. The reverse genetic vector pDZ was kindly provided by Professor Peter Palese (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Sobrido and Garcia-Sastre, 2010</xref>). The eight PCR products with sequences of individual gene segments were digested by 
 <italic>Sap</italic>I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, United States) and then cloned into the pDZ vector. Following the same strategy, the NS gene segments of the other three H5N2 AIVs were commercially synthesized by Allbio Science Inc., (Taichung, Taiwan) for generation of the reassortant AIVs, including two Mexican-like strains, A/chicken/Taiwan/683/2012 and A/chicken/Taiwan/1680/2013, and one that belongs to clade 2.3.4.4, A/goose/Taiwan/01031/2015.
