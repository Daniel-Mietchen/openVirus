<p>Protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) paper (Bio-Rad). After being blocked in 5% skim milk, primary antibodies were incubated with NC paper at 4°C. On the following day, NC papers were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) five times, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 h. After being washed with PBST, protein signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The dilutions of each antibody were as follows: anti-β-actin (1:1,000; Signalway Antibody), anti-PKR (1:2,000; Abcam), anti-PKR-p (T446; 1:2,000; Abcam), anti-FLAG (1:2,500; Signalway Antibody), and anti-HA (1:2,500; Yao-Hong Biotechnology).</p>
