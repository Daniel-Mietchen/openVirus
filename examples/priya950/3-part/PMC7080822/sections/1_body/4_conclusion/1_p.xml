<p>Our study extends the current understanding of AIV phylogenetic studies to characterize the NS1 function of H5N2 viruses isolated from Taiwan. We demonstrated that exchange of the NS segment significantly impacted the replication of reassortant viruses and modulated anti-viral responses and viral RdRp activity. These results indicate that NS1 is a critical factor responsible for the diverse traits of AIVs in Taiwan.</p>
