<p>The NS1 protein is well-known as an antagonist of type I IFN that mediates anti-viral responses. Therefore, we investigated whether the impact of NS substitution on viral production is related to the effect of NS1 on innate immunity. To do so, we measured transcripts of IFN-α/β and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), as well as viral M RNA in infected DF-1 cells or chicks by qRT-PCR at 6 and 12 hpi. In general, the viral M RNA was expressed to a similar extent among the viruses tested (
