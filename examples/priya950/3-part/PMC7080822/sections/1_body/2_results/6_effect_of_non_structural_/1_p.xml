<p>Influenza NS1 is a well-known repressor of PKR activation by a direct interaction with PKR; however, the exact functions of these H5N2 NS1 proteins have not been investigated. In cells transiently expressing NS1, PKR activation was induced by treatment with synthetic dsRNA (poly I:C). NS1 of H1N1 (strain PR8) significantly decreased phosphorylation of PKR relative to empty vector (EV) (

Moreover, results of immunoprecipitation suggested that NS1031 interacted poorly with PKR than did other AIV NS1 proteins analyzed and was significantly lower than NS0702 (
