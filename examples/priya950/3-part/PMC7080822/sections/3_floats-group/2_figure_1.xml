  <p>Sequence analysis of influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) proteins. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Phylogenetic analysis of NS1 proteins of several avian influenza viruses, including the NS1 from subtype H6N1 (NS0702), one LPAI H5N2 (NS683), two HPAI H5N2 (NS1680 and NS1031), and one human H1N1 (NS-PR8). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Sequence alignment indicated variations at residues responsible for interactions with cellular protein CPSF30 (box 1), protein kinase R (PKR) (box 2), SUMO-1 (box 3), and a PDZ-binding domain (box 4), as well as two sets of nuclear localization signals (NLS), the nucleolus localization signal (NoLS), and nuclear exportation signal (NES).
