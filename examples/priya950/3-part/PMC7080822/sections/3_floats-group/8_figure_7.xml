  <p>The effect of avian influenza virus (AIV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) proteins on protein kinase R (PKR) activation and interaction. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> Modulation of PKR activation by NS1. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector (EV) or plasmids expressing NS1 proteins, followed by activation of PKR by the transfection of 150 ng/ml of poly I:C for 4 h. The phosphorylation level of PKR was monitored by 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Western blot analysis; 
   <bold>(B)</bold> PKR activation level was estimated relative to EV. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> Interaction of NS1 proteins with PKR. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PKR together with either EV or one of the NS1 constructs, followed by FLAG-IP and immunoblotting. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Relative PKR–NS1 interaction was estimated relative to EV. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.
