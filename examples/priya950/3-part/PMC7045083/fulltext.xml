The timing and route of influenza vaccination, and the presence of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the nasopharynx, had a significant effect on symptoms in adults. Reported symptoms following <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> inoculation were consistent with those reported in previous EHPC studies <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, higher incidences of nasal and non-nasal symptoms were reported by Trimble et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> due to a lower threshold of symptom reporting. The most commonly reported symptoms following vaccination were runny nose, congestion, and sore throat; reflecting published data following LAIV administration <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, we found much lower incidences of nasal symptoms in our study compared to previously published rates in adults following LAIV administration (20% vs 44%, respectively) <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Reasons for these differences is unclear but might relate to the timeframe of symptom data collection, year to year variation in vaccine replication efficiency, the different data collection methods and thresholds for reporting symptoms.</p><p id="p0115">Our results demonstrate that LAIV administration prior to pneumococcal inoculation significantly reduces nasal and non-nasal symptoms compared to TIV. Additionally, less symptoms were seen in the LAIV group compared to the TIV group after inoculation despite similar symptom rates between the two groups following vaccination. For the concurrent study, there was no difference seen in symptom rates following inoculation or vaccination in either vaccine group. The reasons for these differences are unclear, although we have previously observed from the antecedent study that LAIV induces a strong pro-inflammatory response in the nose, but impairs nasal neutrophil responses to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation compared to TIV vaccinated participants <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. During acute respiratory viral infections neutrophils have been shown to positively correlate with nasal symptom severity <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and could explain why fewer nasal symptoms are reported in the LAIV vaccination group.</p><p id="p0120">We found evidence that colonisation status led to significant differences in symptoms between the LAIV and TIV groups across both studies. In the antecedent study, TIV treated colonised adults had higher nasal symptom reporting compared to TIV non-colonised adults. However, in the LAIV group there was no difference seen in symptoms reported between colonised and non-colonised adults either before or after inoculation. Likewise, fewer nasal symptoms were seen in LAIV colonised adults compared to TIV colonised adults. In the concurrent study, colonisation status did not affect symptoms between the two vaccination groups. This suggests that TIV potentiates symptoms following colonisation. In the antecedent study, post nasal drip and cough were only increased pre but not post <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> exposure. One possibility is that these are transient effects of vaccination, which can be observed in the first days following vaccine administration, but not at later points.</p><p id="p0125">Co-colonisation (with LAIV and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) in healthy adults led to a transient increase in acquisition at Day 2 following bacterial challenge in those who had previously received LAIV (33/55 [60.0%] vs 25/62 [40.3%] in TIV, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03). Bacterial carriage densities were increased approximately 10-fold by Day 9 in the LAIV recipients <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have now shown that co-infection and its associated increase in pneumococcal density did not correlate with symptom reporting, consistent with other research in adults <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Conversely, in children, it has been found that being colonised with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> at the time of LAIV administration causes a 6-fold increase in bacterial densities at Day 28, with symptoms of rhinitis positively associated with pneumococcal density <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="p0130">We used an adapted validated respiratory symptom tool <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recall bias was limited by contemporaneous completion of a symptom log. Using this novel human co-infection challenge model, we were able to determine the exact day of pneumococcal exposure in relation to the influenza vaccination and the timing and duration of pneumococcal colonisation. The main limitations were the use of two slightly different questionnaires between the antecedent and concurrent studies: we were therefore able to compare directly the presence of symptoms, but not severity. Secondly, there was no control group for mock-vaccinations or inoculations as it was assumed that in the absence of a vaccination or being non-colonised was an asymptomatic process <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and we did not anticipate topical effects of TIV administration. A control group for mock-vaccinations or inoculations would have helped to further dissect the relative contributions of the vaccination and inoculation to symptoms.</p><p id="p0135">We hypothesised that nasally administered LAIV would produce more symptoms than intramuscular TIV in healthy adults. However, the results, unexpectedly, demonstrated that TIV in particular when followed by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation caused more symptoms in adults than LAIV. These results were biologically relevant as we scored symptoms on a scale, where a score of &#x02264;2 (no symptoms or occasional limited episode) was considered &#x02018;asymptomatic&#x02019; and a score of &#x02265;3 (mild steady symptoms to severe hard to tolerate symptoms) was considered &#x02018;symptomatic&#x02019;. By definition what we defined as symptomatic was therefore noticeable at least by the participants.</p><p id="p0140">The authors acknowledge that these results are counter-intuitive based on the adverse events data collected following vaccination with LAIV versus TIV, previously <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, we performed two randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials with 271 participants who completed symptom questionnaires allowing us to interrogate the effects of vaccination in the setting of existing or new <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation. The differences between groups were not apparent prior to the intervention, indicating these are true biological effects. What is important to note is that symptoms were driven not just by the vaccine alone, but strongly associated with the <italic>S. pneuomoniae</italic> colonisation afterwards. We demonstrated that LAIV impaired neutrophilic degranulation upon <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and it is for example possible that this, or another immune mechanism that was altered by LAIV, led to the differences in symptoms. We believe these results highlight that the environment and microbiota can therefore affect symptomology differentially following vaccination with attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Importantly, the order of vaccination had an impact of symptom reporting, as it did on microbiological endpoints (<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation) in the trial <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0145">This is the first controlled challenge study in humans to directly assess the symptomology of a respiratory live viral vaccine during co-infection with a human pathogen. Our study demonstrates that symptoms experienced during live viral vaccination and bacterial co-infection in the nasopharynx are directly affected by the precedence of the pathogen acquisition. The mechanism by which LAIV and TIV influence the symptoms in adults remains undetermined. Further research should target our understanding of the immunological processes that underpin the symptomology of LAIV and TIV administration prior to or following the acquisition of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in adults.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Funding and sponsorship</title><p id="p0150">The study was funded by the <funding-source id="gp005">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source> (grant OPP1117728) and the <funding-source id="gp010">UK Medical Research Council</funding-source> (grant MR/M011569/1).
