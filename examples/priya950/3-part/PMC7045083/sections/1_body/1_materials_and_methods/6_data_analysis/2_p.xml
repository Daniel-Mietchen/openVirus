<p id="p0060">Individuals were ‘colonised’ if 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotype 6B was detected by nasal wash culture at any time point following experimental challenge in the study period. Individuals who were naturally colonised with any serotype of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> at baseline were excluded from the data analysis. Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to analyse symptoms with binomial distribution for symptom outcomes (0 = No symptoms, 1 = symptomatic) and logit link function, taking into account repeated measurements in symptoms. To assess the treatment effect on symptoms, the GEE model has treatment (LAIV, TIV), time (&lt;=3 days, &gt;=4 days), interaction between treatment and time as study variables, participants’ age and gender as covariates. Difference in log odds of having a symptomatic outcome between LAIV and TIV at each time point was derived from the GEE model. To assess the difference in symptoms between colonisation status, the GEE model has colonisation status (positive, negative), time (&lt;=3 days, &gt;=4 days), interaction between colonisation status and time as study variables, participants’ age and gender as covariates. Difference in log odds of having a symptomatic outcome between positive and negative colonisation status at each time point was derived from the GEE model. All analysis was based on the intention to treat basis. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA); a two-tailed P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
