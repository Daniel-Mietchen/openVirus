 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Participants completed a daily symptom questionnaire from the day of vaccination until 6 days post inoculation (antecedent cohort, total of 9 days) or from the day of inoculation until 3 days post vaccination (concurrent cohort, total of 6 days). Participants were unaware of their colonisation status until after symptom log data had been completed and returned. Symptoms were assessed using a modified Likert score for severity 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the antecedent cohort 10 symptoms were examined (5 nasal and 5 non-nasal symptoms) on an 7-point severity scale. Based on participant feedback, the questionnaire was modified for the concurrent cohort to improve usability. The scoring system for both studies was aligned for analysis. A score of ≤2 (no symptoms or occasional limited episode) was considered ‘asymptomatic’ and a score of ≥3 (mild steady symptoms to severe hard to tolerate symptoms) was considered ‘symptomatic’. Symptoms were categorised as indicated to reduce the impact of participants reporting a symptom which was an isolated episode of short duration that would not fit with known symptomology patterns of respiratory infection
