<p id="p0145">This is the first controlled challenge study in humans to directly assess the symptomology of a respiratory live viral vaccine during co-infection with a human pathogen. Our study demonstrates that symptoms experienced during live viral vaccination and bacterial co-infection in the nasopharynx are directly affected by the precedence of the pathogen acquisition. The mechanism by which LAIV and TIV influence the symptoms in adults remains undetermined. Further research should target our understanding of the immunological processes that underpin the symptomology of LAIV and TIV administration prior to or following the acquisition of
