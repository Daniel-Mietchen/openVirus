<p id="p0135">We hypothesised that nasally administered LAIV would produce more symptoms than intramuscular TIV in healthy adults. However, the results, unexpectedly, demonstrated that TIV in particular when followed by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation caused more symptoms in adults than LAIV. These results were biologically relevant as we scored symptoms on a scale, where a score of ≤2 (no symptoms or occasional limited episode) was considered ‘asymptomatic’ and a score of ≥3 (mild steady symptoms to severe hard to tolerate symptoms) was considered ‘symptomatic’. By definition what we defined as symptomatic was therefore noticeable at least by the participants.
