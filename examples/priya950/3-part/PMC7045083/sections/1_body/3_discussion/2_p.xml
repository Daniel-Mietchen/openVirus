<p id="p0110">This is the first study to evaluate symptoms associated with live attentuated influenza vaccine and controlled pneumococcal colonisation. The timing and route of influenza vaccination, and the presence of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the nasopharynx, had a significant effect on symptoms in adults. Reported symptoms following 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> inoculation were consistent with those reported in previous EHPC studies 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, higher incidences of nasal and non-nasal symptoms were reported by Trimble et al. 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> due to a lower threshold of symptom reporting. The most commonly reported symptoms following vaccination were runny nose, congestion, and sore throat; reflecting published data following LAIV administration 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, we found much lower incidences of nasal symptoms in our study compared to previously published rates in adults following LAIV administration (20% vs 44%, respectively) 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Reasons for these differences is unclear but might relate to the timeframe of symptom data collection, year to year variation in vaccine replication efficiency, the different data collection methods and thresholds for reporting symptoms.
