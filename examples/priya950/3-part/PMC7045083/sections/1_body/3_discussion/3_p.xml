<p id="p0115">Our results demonstrate that LAIV administration prior to pneumococcal inoculation significantly reduces nasal and non-nasal symptoms compared to TIV. Additionally, less symptoms were seen in the LAIV group compared to the TIV group after inoculation despite similar symptom rates between the two groups following vaccination. For the concurrent study, there was no difference seen in symptom rates following inoculation or vaccination in either vaccine group. The reasons for these differences are unclear, although we have previously observed from the antecedent study that LAIV induces a strong pro-inflammatory response in the nose, but impairs nasal neutrophil responses to
