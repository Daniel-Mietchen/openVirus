<p id="p0120">We found evidence that colonisation status led to significant differences in symptoms between the LAIV and TIV groups across both studies. In the antecedent study, TIV treated colonised adults had higher nasal symptom reporting compared to TIV non-colonised adults. However, in the LAIV group there was no difference seen in symptoms reported between colonised and non-colonised adults either before or after inoculation. Likewise, fewer nasal symptoms were seen in LAIV colonised adults compared to TIV colonised adults. In the concurrent study, colonisation status did not affect symptoms between the two vaccination groups. This suggests that TIV potentiates symptoms following colonisation. In the antecedent study, post nasal drip and cough were only increased pre but not post
