<p id="p0125">Co-colonisation (with LAIV and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) in healthy adults led to a transient increase in acquisition at Day 2 following bacterial challenge in those who had previously received LAIV (33/55 [60.0%] vs 25/62 [40.3%] in TIV, p = 0.03). Bacterial carriage densities were increased approximately 10-fold by Day 9 in the LAIV recipients 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have now shown that co-infection and its associated increase in pneumococcal density did not correlate with symptom reporting, consistent with other research in adults 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Conversely, in children, it has been found that being colonised with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> at the time of LAIV administration causes a 6-fold increase in bacterial densities at Day 28, with symptoms of rhinitis positively associated with pneumococcal density
