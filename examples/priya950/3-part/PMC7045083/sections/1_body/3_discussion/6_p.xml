 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recall bias was limited by contemporaneous completion of a symptom log. Using this novel human co-infection challenge model, we were able to determine the exact day of pneumococcal exposure in relation to the influenza vaccination and the timing and duration of pneumococcal colonisation. The main limitations were the use of two slightly different questionnaires between the antecedent and concurrent studies: we were therefore able to compare directly the presence of symptoms, but not severity. Secondly, there was no control group for mock-vaccinations or inoculations as it was assumed that in the absence of a vaccination or being non-colonised was an asymptomatic process 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and we did not anticipate topical effects of TIV administration. A control group for mock-vaccinations or inoculations would have helped to further dissect the relative contributions of the vaccination and inoculation to symptoms.
