<p id="p0075">We investigated whether influenza vaccination led to symptoms in healthy adults. Apart from post nasal drip there was no statistical difference in the reporting of symptoms (LAIV 23%; n = 12/53 vs TIV 25%; n = 15/61) in the 3 days following vaccination in either group (

Following inoculation, reporting of one or more symptoms were less in the LAIV group with 19% (n = 10/53) compared to 41% (n = 25/61) in the TIV group. Nasal symptoms were overall less common in the LAIV group (OR 0.57, p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, symptoms of runny nose, congestion and post nasal drip were all significantly less common in the LAIV group (OR 0.33; 0.55; 0.19, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) (
