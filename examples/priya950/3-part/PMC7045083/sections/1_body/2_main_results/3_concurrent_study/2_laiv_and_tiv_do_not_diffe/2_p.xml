<p id="p0090">Participants were first inoculated with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and then received influenza vaccines 3 days later. 163 participants completed the primary study end points and 157 returned their symptom log questionnaires for data analysis (LAIV n = 70, TIV n = 87). As reported, similar demographics were observed in both groups 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In total, 79 participants (50%) became experimentally colonised with both groups having similar colonisation rates (LAIV 50% and TIV 51%). Overall 31% (22/70) participants in the LAIV group and 32% (28/87) participants in the TIV group reported one or more nasal or non-nasal symptoms, or both, at any time point in the 6 days following inoculation. Runny nose (LAIV 11%, n = 8/70; TIV 13%, n = 11/87), congestion (LAIV 9%, n = 6/70; TIV 18%, n = 16/87) and sore throat (LAIV 11%, n = 8/70; TIV 14%, n = 12/87) were the most frequently reported symptoms in both groups. No statistical difference was seen in the reporting of symptoms across both groups (
