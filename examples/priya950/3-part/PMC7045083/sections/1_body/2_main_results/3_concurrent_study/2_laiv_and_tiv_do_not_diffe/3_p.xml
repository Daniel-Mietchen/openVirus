<p id="p0095">We investigated whether inoculation with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> led to symptoms in healthy adults in the absence of any influenza vaccine in the three days prior to the administration of LAIV or TIV. At baseline (prior to inoculation) 10% (n = 7/10) in the LAIV group and 3% (n = 3/87) in the TIV group reported one or more nasal or non-nasal symptoms, or both. In the 3 days following inoculation similar rates of reported symptoms were noted across both groups (LAIV 21%, n = 15/70, TIV 22%, n = 19/87). Despite differences at baseline there was no statistical difference in the reporting of symptoms between the two groups (

Following vaccination, three days after inoculation, symptoms remained at similar rates in both the LAIV group with 26% (n = 18/70) and 25% (n = 22/87) in the TIV group; no statistical difference was seen in the number of participants reporting symptoms following vaccination in either group (
