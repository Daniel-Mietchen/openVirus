<p id="p0025">Nasopharyngeal colonisation by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is a prerequisite for pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis and otitis media 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Reports suggest that point prevalence of colonisation is 21–52% and 6.5–8% in children and adults, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, although it is uncertain if these natural colonisation events are associated with symptoms 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It has been suggested that nasopharyngeal symptoms are related to the viral co-infection and not bacterial colonisation 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In children, pneumococcal colonisation densities are increased by viral infection, irrespective of whether symptoms are present or not 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) (used annually in children in the UK, USA and other countries) is commonly associated with runny nose and nasal congestion in all ages groups, fever in children, and sore throat in adults 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In adults, nasopharyngeal colonisation with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is considered an asymptomatic event

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, although no studies have examined symptoms in the context of viral/bacterial co-infection particularly in adults.
