  <p>Antecedent Study- Symptoms reported by participants who had become colonised with 
   <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (LAIV n = 24; TIV n = 23) compared with those who did not (LAIV n = 29; TIV n = 38). Timepoints are split up as until day of Spn inoculation, post Spn inoculation or all timepoints combined. Bars represent log
   <sub>10</sub> transformed odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Asterisks denote p &lt; 0.05 i.e. a statistically significant difference in the rate of reporting between colonised (positive) and non-colonised (negative) individuals. Odds ratios are derived from GEE model analysis (see methods), and are presented as those occurring early (left panels, at or before 3 days after vaccination and pre Spn inoculation), or late (centre panels, 4 or more days after vaccination and following Spn inoculation), or combined throughout the period of reporting (right panels). Reported symptoms are subdivided by their vaccination group: LAIV nasal spray (upper panels); TIV intramuscular (lower panels). Spn = 
   <italic>S. pneumoniae.</italic>
