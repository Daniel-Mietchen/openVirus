  <p>Antecedent study- Symptoms reported by participants receiving nasal LAIV (n = 53) compared with those receiving intramuscular TIV (n = 61). Timepoints are split up as until day of Spn inoculation, post Spn inoculation or all timepoints combined. All subjects are included regardless of ultimate Spn colonisation status. Bars represent log
   <sub>10</sub> transformed odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Asterisks denote p &lt; 0.05 i.e. a statistically significant difference in the rate of reporting between the two arms of the trial. Odds ratios are derived from GEE model analysis (see methods), and are presented as those occurring early (left panel, at or before 3 days after vaccination and pre Spn inoculation), or late (centre panel, 4 or more days after vaccination and Spn inoculation), or combined throughout the period of reporting (right panel). Spn =
