<p id="para0021">For 18 patients with serum samples collected during hospitalization, 13 (72%) developed an HAI antibody titer ≥40 during hospitalization at a median of 12 days (range 5–36 days) after illness onset; 3 (17%) patients who did not have HAI antibody titer ≥40 during hospitalization developed HAI antibody titers ≥40 after discharge, at a median of 221 days (range 126–227 days) after illness onset; and HAI antibody titers for 2 (11%) patients remained ≤10, even after discharge (on day 20 in one patient, and on days 31, 112 and 180 in another patient) (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (A)). A 4-fold or greater rise in HAI antibody titer was noted in seven of nine patients with paired serum samples collected during hospitalization, which occurred between a median of 5 days after illness onset for the initial specimen (range 1–13 days) and a median of 29 days (range 15 to 55 days) after illness onset for the 2nd specimen. Serum specimens collected from 4 critically ill patients with fatal outcomes had HAI antibody titers ≥40 on days 10–12 after illness onset. HAI antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers during hospitalization and after recovery were lower in 4 moderately ill patients not treated with oseltamivir compared with 53 patients who received oseltamivir treatment, including 28 who were severely ill (Supplementary Fig. 3).
