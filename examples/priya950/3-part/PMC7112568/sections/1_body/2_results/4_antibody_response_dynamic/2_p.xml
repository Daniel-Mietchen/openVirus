<p id="para0022">After illness onset, HAI GMTs reached ≥40 within 9–20 days, peaked at 21–30 days with a GMT of 452.5, and persisted above 40 until 16–20 months (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(B)). In contrast, increases of neutralizing antibody titers were delayed (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(C) and 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>(D)). Applying a cutoff value of 40, the proportion of seropositive with HAI antibodies was 58% (95% CI: 25.6–91.1) at 9–20 days after illness onset, and was greater than 89% thereafter until one year after illness onset (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Neutralizing antibodies were undetectable until a month after illness onset, and applying a cutoff value of 20, the seropositive rate increased from 40% (95% CI: 12–74) at 21–60 days to 83% (95% CI: 52–98) at 16–20 months after illness onset (Supplementary Fig. 4B). HAI antibody titers correlated with neutralizing antibody titers (rho = 0.56, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01, indicating a moderately positive correlation) (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The correlation coefficient of HAI antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers for A/Anhui/1/2013 (rho=0.64, moderately positive correlation) was lower than observed for A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (rho=0.93, strongly positive correlation) (Supplementary Figs. 5B and 5C). HAI antibody titers correlated with neutralizing antibody titers for each antigen tested for sera from patients from the 2016–2017 epidemic (rho=0.91 for A/Anhui/1/2013, rho=0.93 for A/Hong Kong/125/2017, and rho=1 for A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016, all strongly positive correlations).
