<p id="para0028">For the pooled analyses of antibody kinetics, data for antigens that were antigenically-matched to circulating strains are preferred. However, there might be antigen-specific differences in HAI titers, which could affect the results. We adopted two statistical approaches to investigate this question: (1) we evaluated the main effect and interactive effect of each antigen in the model and found that the effects were not statistically significant; (2) we constructed the model with the HAI results for A/Anhui/1/2013 virus only, with the same formula and knots as the model for pooled analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7). Before 7 months after illness onset, the trend of the average curve of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-only model was similar to that of the model with pooled results, and subsequently the former curve decreased slower than the later one. However, due to the lack of sera available between 14 months and 65 months after illness onset for testing in the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-only model, we viewed the model with pooled data to be more reliable. We did not find that antigen-specific differences in HAI responses affected the model significantly, but this could be due to small sample size and additional investigations are needed when more data are available for the different antigens.</p>
