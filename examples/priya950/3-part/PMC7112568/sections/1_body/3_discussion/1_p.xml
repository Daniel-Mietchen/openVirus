<p id="para0025">In this study, patients hospitalized with virologically-confirmed A(H7N9) virus infections during the 2013, 2013–2014, and 2016–2017 epidemics mounted strong serum HAI antibody responses against A(H7N9) virus during hospitalization and after recovery. We estimated that mean A(H7N9) virus-specific HAI antibody titers peaked three months after illness onset and remained above 80 for 11 months. Severely ill patients mounted higher antibody responses during hospitalization that persisted for a long period after recovery. Therefore, studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.</p>
