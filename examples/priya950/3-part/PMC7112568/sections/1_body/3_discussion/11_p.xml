<p id="para0035">In conclusion, we have established the largest cohort of A(H7N9) survivors to date, followed them for up to 5 years and determined the specificity, kinetics and longevity of A(H7N9) virus-specific antibodies. If convalescent plasma treatment is pursued in clinical trials, our findings indicate that plasma could be prepared from blood from survivors of severe disease with homologous A(H7N9) virus strain-specific infection collected approximately 1â€“11 months after illness onset.</p>
