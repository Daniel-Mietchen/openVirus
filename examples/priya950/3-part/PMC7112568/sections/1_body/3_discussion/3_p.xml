<p id="para0027">Our analysis estimated that mean HAI antibody titers remained ≥40 until 22 months after illness onset. Ma et al. reported that HAI GMTs declined to lower than 40 at 10 months after illness onset.

In another cross-sectional study, Ma et al. reported that HAI GMT was near 40 at about 26 months after illness onset, which was similar to our findings.
