 </xref> During 2016–2017, A(H7N9) virus spread among poultry across China, and 30 out of 34 provinces reported human infections.

 </xref> Moreover, A(H7N9) virus strains continue to evolve and have diverged into two main lineages, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) lineages.

 </xref> YRD lineage A(H7N9) viruses evolved into antigenically distinct strains during 2016–2017, including low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N9) virus strains (represented by A/Hong Kong/125/2017), and some viruses were classified as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains based on their genotype (represented by A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016).

 </xref> Although only four human cases of A(H7N9) virus infection were reported since October 2017, and virus detection has declined in poultry, the virus is far from eradication.

 </xref> Notably, A(H7N9) viruses continue to be assessed as representing a moderate to high public health risk, ranking highest among 12 influenza A viruses of animal-origin in the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza risk assessment tool.
