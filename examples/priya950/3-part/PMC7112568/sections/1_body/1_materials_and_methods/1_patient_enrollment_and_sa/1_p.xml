<p id="para0013">We recruited and followed patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus infection from six provinces of China (Beijing, Shandong, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian) from three epidemics (2013, 2013–2014, and 2016–2017 epidemics), during hospitalization and after discharge. Patients enrolled from the 2016–2017 epidemic were from Jiangxi Province. Demographic information and clinical data during hospitalization were collected using a standardized form.
