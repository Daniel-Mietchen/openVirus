<p id="para0017">For the analyses of the kinetics of the antibody responses and association with clinical outcomes, we pooled serological data from patients with RT-PCR-confirmed A(H7N9) virus infection from three epidemics. HAI and neutralizing antibody titers were log
 <sub>2</sub> transformed before analyses. Comparison of the GMTs between severely ill patients and moderately ill patients was performed with Mannâ€“Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test, clustered by sampling time from illness onset; we also used a linear regression model adjusted for sex, age, and sampling time from illness onset. Previous studies have reported that patients with A(H7N9) virus infection have lower neutralizing antibody titers than HAI antibody titers, and neutralizing antibody titers are lower in A(H7N9) patients compared to A(H5N1) patients.

 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We also observed lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to HAI antibody titers in this study. We used a random intercept linear model with B-spline to analyze the dynamics of HAI antibody responses and neutralizing antibody responses over time in sera of A(H7N9) virus-infected patients. Degree and knots of B-spline were selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model used to fit the dynamic curve of antibody titers yielded similar results to the random intercept linear model.
