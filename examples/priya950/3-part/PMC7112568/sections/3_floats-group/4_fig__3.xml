  <p>Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers over time in patients with A(H7N9) virus infection. (A) HAI antibody titers and (C) neutralizing antibody titers at different times after illness onset for each patient. Triangles, circles and squares show results for each sample, each combination of symbol and color represents an individual, points from the same patient are connected. (B) geometric mean HAI antibody titers and (D) geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers at indicated periods after illness onset. The dots represent geometric mean titers (GMTs) and the lines represent 95% confidence intervals (CI) for GMTs. Data from 67 participants and 128 blood samples are included in all panels, HAI and neutralizing antibody titers against A/Anhui/1/2013 virus are used for samples from patients from the 2013 and 2013–2014 epidemics, and HAI and neutralizing antibody titers against A/Hong Kong/125/2017 virus are used for samples from patients from the 2016–2017 epidemic. Gray dashed line indicates threshold for seropositive titer (HAI antibody titer ≥ 40, and neutralizing antibody titer ≥ 20).</p>
