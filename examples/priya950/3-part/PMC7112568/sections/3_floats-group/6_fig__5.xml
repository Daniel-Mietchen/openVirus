  <p>Relationship between hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody response and disease severity. Serum samples were grouped by time of sampling (1–8 days, 9–30 days, 1–5 months, 6–8 months, and 12–20 months after illness onset), and clinical outcomes [moderately ill: patients without ARDS and did not receive mechanical ventilation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 25), severely ill: patients progressed to ARDS or required invasive mechanical ventilation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 32)]. HAI antibody responses between moderately ill and severely ill patients were compared by using Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test.
