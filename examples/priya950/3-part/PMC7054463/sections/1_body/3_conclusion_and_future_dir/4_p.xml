<p>While this paper reviews limited case studies and series indicating that in some instances influenza vaccination has been linked to CNS-directed autoimmunity, there is currently no evidence demonstrating a clear association between influenza vaccination and the development of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The limited reported cases constitute a weight of evidence which is far weaker than the many epidemiological studies supporting the association between maternal influenza infection and schizophrenia. Influenza vaccination—both pandemic and seasonal—has saved and continues to save countless millions of lives worldwide, with an overwhelming evidence base supporting its efficacy. Within this context, influenza vaccination may nonetheless represent an as-yet underutilised opportunity for epidemiological and mechanistic explorations of potential influenza-psychosis associations. For example, healthy volunteers having the vaccination could be assessed using immunophenotyping, brain imaging, and behavioral measures to further characterize the acute response to influenza exposure [analogous to similar human studies of the acute response to LPS or typhoid vaccine administration (
