<p>An increase in our understanding of neuro-immune interactions has enabled a fuller understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and have contributed to a more nuanced picture of schizophrenia pathogenesis which can accommodate the influence of influenza infections after the perinatal period. Our understanding of both influenza and schizophrenia has changed immensely since the 1918-1919 pandemic. The development of next-generation genetic, immunological and bioinformatic technologies may bring a resolution of the centuries-old puzzle of the relationship between influenza and psychosis.</p>
