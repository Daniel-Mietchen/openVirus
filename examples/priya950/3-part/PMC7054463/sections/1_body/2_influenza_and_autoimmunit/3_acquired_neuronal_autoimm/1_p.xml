<p>As described above, infection-induced neuronal autoimmunity may have relevance for some acute psychoses. However neuronal autoimmunity also has relevance in the context of maternal transmission. Maternal-foetal transfer of pathogenic antibodies has long been proposed as a potential mechanism in the development of ASD and, to a lesser extent, for schizophrenia also (

Although not formally regarded as part of the MIA paradigm, recent animal models have had some successes in recapitulating neurodevelopmental phenotypes in immunisation paradigms whereby maternal antibodies are transferred to the offspring, resulting in neuropathological and behavioral abnormalities (

 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>). Two of these studies used CASPR2 antibodies, cell surface IgG antibodies which have been implicated in encephalitis and a variety of peripheral nerve manifestations. Intriguingly, a study by Coutinho et al. found that NMDAR antibodies were more frequent in mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, who themselves (i.e. the mothers) subsequently developed psychosis. This finding was not replicated in another cohort in which the mothers did not go on to develop psychosis, but clearly mandates attempts at replication (

A recent animal study has shown that maternal-foetal transfer of recombinant NMDAR NR1 antibodies—at levels that did not affect the behavior of the pregnant mother—resulted in impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes, reduced anxiety, motor hyperactivity, and impaired sensorimotor gating, the latter two of which were regarded as psychosis-like phenotypes (

 <italic>Experimental paradigms of maternal infection</italic>” for transdiagnostic relevance of these behaviors).
