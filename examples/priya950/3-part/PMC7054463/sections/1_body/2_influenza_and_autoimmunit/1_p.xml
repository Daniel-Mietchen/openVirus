<p>Research on autoimmune disorders and schizophrenia dates to the 1950s, when schizophrenia was found to be protective against the development of rheumatoid arthritis (

 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>), serological research has reported the presence of these same autoantibodies against cell surface neuronal antigens in some patients with schizophrenia [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>)]. An extensive literature also focuses on markers of previous infection (usually IgG antibodies to specific pathogens, including influenza) in adults with psychotic disorders, with exposure to several organisms associated with increased schizophrenia risk or risk for a specific psychosis symptom profile (e.g. impaired cognition) (
