<p>A potential association between anti-NMDAR encephalitis and influenza is supported by reports of at least five patients who developed the disorder following influenza vaccination (

 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>)—although in none of these cases can causation be proven. A phylogenetic relationship has been suggested between microRNAs related to anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the H1N1 influenza virus, with some authors suggesting a theoretical basis for the possibility that anti-NMDAR encephalitis could be induced by influenza vaccination [(
