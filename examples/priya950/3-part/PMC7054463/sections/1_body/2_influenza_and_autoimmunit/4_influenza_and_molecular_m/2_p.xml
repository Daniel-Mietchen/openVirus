<p>There are multiple strands of evidence that influenza infection may have an aetiological role in systemic autoimmunity, including in Henoch-Schonlein purpura, type 1 diabetes mellitus and antiphospholipid syndrome [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>)]. In one study, influenza vaccination induced autoimmunity (primarily antiphospholipid antibodies) in apparently healthy volunteers (
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>). H1N1 infection in rabbits has also been shown to induce brain-reactive antibodies, including to a 37kDa target also present in humans (

 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>) and narcolepsy, in which hypocretin-producing neurons could be an autoimmune target due to molecular mimicry between H1N1 virus-derived antigen and a neuronal autoantigen in
