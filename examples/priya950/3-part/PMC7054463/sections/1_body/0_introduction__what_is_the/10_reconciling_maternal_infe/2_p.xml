<p>Amongst other criticisms, the theory fails to account for later-onset schizophrenia [45 years or older; (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>)] and postadolescence changes (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Extended neurodevelopmental models posited further “hits,” e.g., genetic and environmental factors first predisposing to schizophrenia prenatally and then later in life [“three-hit” model, (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>); multiple hit theory, (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>)]. Infection is a possible “hit”; for instance, human endogenous retrovirus infections, activated by viruses including influenza, were suggested as late “hits” (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). This theory is consistent with evidence that maternal infection contributes to later increased offspring risk for childhood infections, which in turn contribute to schizophrenia development (
