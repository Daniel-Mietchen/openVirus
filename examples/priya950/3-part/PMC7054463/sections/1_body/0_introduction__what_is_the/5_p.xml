<p>While suggestive, these reports do not provide evidence of a causal link between influenza infection and psychotic disorders. Renewed interest in the second half of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century shifted focus towards maternal infection, following consistent findings of an increased risk for schizophrenia in late winter/spring season births (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), raising the possibility of winter-borne infection as a plausible mechanism. Beginning with Mednick et al.'s 1988 study of a Finnish population exposed to the 1957 influenza A2 pandemic, epidemiological studies in the 1980s–1990s, of an ecological nature, described increased risk for schizophrenia in children who were

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These studies are comprehensively reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Frequently, rates were highest for second trimester exposures, although the first trimester appeared also to be a period of increased risk. Some subsequent studies however—often with more accurate case ascertainment and larger samples—were not able to replicate these initial findings [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>)]. While estimates of risk varied greatly and heterogeneity in methodology somewhat limits generalisability, a 2010 review calculated that maternal influenza exposure increased schizophrenia risk with an odds ratio of 3.0 and a population attributable proportion of 14% (
