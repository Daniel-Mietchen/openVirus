<p>Before the focus of this review moves to schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, it should be noted that some of the associations that will be discussed are now thought not to be specific to schizophrenia risk. The late winter/spring season of birth effect has also been reported in bipolar disorder (BD) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), but the evidence for a link between BD and influenza is somewhat mixed (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and addressed in limited studies (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Influenza (including serologically documented infection) has been reported as a risk factor for BD with psychotic features but not nonpsychotic BD [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)]. Furthermore, some evidence suggests an association between maternal infection and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)]. A substantial body of work from Scandinavian (largely Danish) health register studies supports the notion that clinically diagnosed maternal, childhood, or adulthood infection is a pluripotent risk factor for the subsequent development of psychiatric disorder, with effects observed across diagnostic boundaries (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, while the focus of this review is on schizophrenia and psychosis, the potential transdiagnostic relevance of some of the mechanisms reviewed here should not be ignored.
