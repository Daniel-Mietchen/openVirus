<p>Some controversy persists as to whether the evidence for maternal influenza as a schizophrenia risk factor is sufficient. A recent review of studies of schizophrenia risk in relation to the 1957 influenza pandemic criticised the serological studies for using strain-specific antibody titres that were too low to be specific for recent infection and so were insufficient as proxy measures of recent infection; furthermore, a pooled meta-analysis of eight ecological studies and one serological study found no overall increased risk of schizophrenia in children of influenza-exposed mothers (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>); furthermore it appeared to omit some relevant serological data [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)] and as it focuses on the 1957 pandemic only, it does not include studies on other strains of influenza infection and psychosis.
