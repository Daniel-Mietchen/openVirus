<p>Substantial epidemiological evidence exists suggesting that maternal, perinatal, childhood, and adult infection may all increase the risk of schizophrenia diagnosis (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). While many organisms and infection types have been implicated in schizophrenia risk, the influenza virus has special status: not only is maternal influenza infection the most well-replicated infective risk factor for schizophrenia, but the history of schizophrenia research has been shaped at crucial points by observations concerning the apparent, sometimes surprising, role of influenza as an exposure. This review aims to present the current state of knowledge on mechanisms by which influenza infection may confer schizophrenia risk, along with the implications of this understanding for future research, prevention, and treatment.
