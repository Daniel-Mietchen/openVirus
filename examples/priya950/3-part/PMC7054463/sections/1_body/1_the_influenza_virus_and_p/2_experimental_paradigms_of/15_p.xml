<p>Both neurotropic and nonneurotropic influenza strains can cause microglial activation and potentially contribute to inflammation (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Innate immune training against influenza confers protection against infection with antiviral interferon-stimulated defence genes, including 
 <italic>MXA</italic> (prevents nuclear import of the virus), 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> and other 
 <italic>IFITM</italic> proteins (block host-virus cell membrane fusion), and viperin [blocks influenza virus release; (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>)]. Innate immune training also promotes disease tolerance of host tissues (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>) and previous activation primes microglia to respond strongly to a new stimulus (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). Previous neuropathology potentially attunes microglia to respond more strongly to systemic inflammation (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>), including inflammation by chronic mild stress in periadolesence following MIA (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Consequently, infection could prime microglia towards heightened activation, potentially increasing the risk of developing psychotic symptoms (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>); alternatively, the opposite could be true, i.e., that the microglia become tolerant and as such cannot respond flexibly to new stimuli.
