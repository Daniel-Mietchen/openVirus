<p>An important mediator of the maternal immune response to infection is likely to be disruption of cytokines regulating brain development. Notably maternal infection could dysregulate cytokine networks either by direct transplacental transfer of cytokines to the foetus, by placental cytokine production or by increased foetal production of cytokines, including within the CNS (

The deleterious or protective effects of any individual cytokine are likely determined by its context within a network of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators, dynamically responding to external and endogenous challenges with differential expression in different brain regions over time (

For example, macrophage-driven expression of antiinflammatory IL-10 in a mouse model can attenuate the long-term effects of prenatal viral infection, but in the absence of inflammatory stimulus, IL-10 itself precipitates offspring behavioral abnormalities (
