 </sup> Changes in ganglioside composition of lipid rafts may cause alterations in the modes of interactions with individual counterpart proteins, or phospholipid and cholesterol molecules.

 </sup> These may be involved in signaling, generation of focal synapse-like points of interactions and removal of membrane components by internalization or exocytosis.

 </sup> Such events may take place in T lymphocytes during their activation by various signals.

 </sup> Thus, defects in membrane lipid rafts could contribute to dysfunction of CD4+ T helper cells and consequent autoimmunity.
