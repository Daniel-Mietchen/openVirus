<p id="Par14">Structural studies have shown that the specific targets for factor H include the α2–3 linked sialic acid glycans of the GD3 ganglioside.

 </sup> Thus, on surfaces, where the complement component C3b has become accidentally bound, the neighboring sialic acids provide the additional affinity to bind the complement inhibitory factor H instead of the activation promoting factor B, which does not bind to sialic acids.
