<p id="Par12">Another special example is the influenza virus. Influenza viruses bind to sialic acids via their hemagglutinin (H) proteins, and after entry e.g., to respiratory epithelial cells, the neuraminidase (N) enzymes of the virus, will cut the sialic acids from the cell surface to prevent entry of further viruses to the cell. Of great importance, different types of influenza viruses carry H proteins with different sialic acid specificities. Thus, only certain influenza viruses (H1, H2, H3) are infecting humans, while H1 and H3 have more preference for pigs and all types from H1 to H16 can infect birds. The H5 and H7 types are particularly dangerous influenza virus types for birds and a potential risk for humans, as well.

 </sup> Variation in the H and N protein structures in pandemic influenza strains forces the adoption of new vaccines against the H and N proteins for seasonally occurring new types of influenza virus during epidemics.
