<p id="Par11">Gangliosides have multiple important structural and functional roles that are related with various immunological functions. Because of their location on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, gangliosides are critical components in the protection of host structures against the autologous immune system. By virtue of their robust negative charges, sialic acids shield self-surfaces and repulse the attachment of other cells or macromolecules to the cellular surfaces. On the other hand, certain viruses, bacteria and parasites, like blood merozoites of the deadliest malaria parasite 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, have learnt to exploit sialic acids/gangliosides as their receptors. Thus, gangliosides can function as attachment sites for pathogens. Some bacterial toxins (cholera toxin, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> toxin) also use sialic acids as their receptors. Since the binding of these toxins is specific for sialic acids in humans, the diseases they cause also occur primarily in humans.
