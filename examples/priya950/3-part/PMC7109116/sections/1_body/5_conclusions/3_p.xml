<p id="Par44">Relative to proteins, immune responses to carbohydrates and glycolipids have often received less attention in studies of autoimmunity despite the fact that they could have a direct or an important adjunct role. Future studies should address the abilities of antibodies to neutralize the functions of gangliosides, including their roles as receptors or protective molecules against immune attack. Therapeutic inhibition of complement activation could be considered in cases, where the protective ability of gangliosides has become compromised, and complement causes serious injury. Because of varying expression during different life periods, gangliosides could explain relative sensitivities to diseases in different age groups, especially in the elderly people. Their roles as receptors for infectious agents and initiators of immunological cross-reactions still needs further exploration. Also, studies on the roles of gangliosides in T cell-mediated immune responses and in regulating activities of nonconventional T cells, NK cells and innate lymphoid cells could prove useful and interesting in the future.</p>
