<p id="Par2">The neuronal and immune systems represent the two most complicated systems in the vertebrate bodies. The brain has traditionally been considered as an immune privileged organ. However, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity can attack different cells and structures to cause autoimmune diseases. These include multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, optic neuritis, limbic encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Immunoinflammatory mechanisms are believed to be involved in various forms of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, as well.</p>
