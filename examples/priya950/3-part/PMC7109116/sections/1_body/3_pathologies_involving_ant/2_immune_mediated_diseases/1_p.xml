<p id="Par21">The presence of AGAs has been investigated in many immune-mediated diseases, especially in those with neurological manifestations. In MS patients, AGAs have been detected in several studies, but their role in disease progression remains unclear.

 </sup> In fact, the presence of anti-GM1 antibodies appears to be unrelated to the level of brain atrophy.

 </sup> However, patients with primary MS have been shown to have higher plasma levels of anti-GM3 and anti-GQ1b antibodies compared to patients with relapsing-remitting MS, healthy controls and patients with other neurological diseases. This has led to the hypothesis that unconventional T cell reactions against GM3 and GQ1b could contribute to axonal damage.
