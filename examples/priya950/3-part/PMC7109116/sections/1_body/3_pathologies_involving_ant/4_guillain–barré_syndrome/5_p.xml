<p id="Par28">As is apparent from the above, there is no doubt that anti-ganglioside antibodies may cause a variety of serious neurological diseases. However, antibodies alone rarely cause target cell damage. They recruit the complement system, leukocytes and other effector mechanisms into the area of antibody deposition. They mediate inflammation and cell injury, whose extent depends on the types of antibodies (class, subclass, target specificity and affinity), individual patterns or reactivity (including the MHC-type determining the extent of T cell help) and target cell sensitivity to damage. Importantly, sialic acids on gangliosides usually protect cells from complement attack, but this protection may fail, if AGAs neutralize the protective layer on cell surfaces. As pointed out above, the complement inhibitor factor H is a key player in protecting host cells from complement attack, because it binds directly to gangliosides in the context of prior antibody-mediated C3b deposition. Inhibition of factor H binding to neuronal cells predisposes them to complement-mediated cell damage and attack by inflammatory leukocytes.</p>
