 </sup> It is characterized by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BEE), clinically very similar to MFS, is characterized by hypersomnolence, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia.

 </sup> Both syndromes are associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies, suggesting that they are two distinct manifestations of a single disease spectrum.

 </sup> Subsequent testing of the anti-GQ1b antibodies revealed that they react also with GD3 and GT1b gangliosides, making it difficult to identify a clear target for the immunological attack.
