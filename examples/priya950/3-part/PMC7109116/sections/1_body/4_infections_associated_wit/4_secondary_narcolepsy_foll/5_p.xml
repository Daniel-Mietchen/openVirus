 </sup> we found AGAs, in particular anti-GM3 and anti-GM4, in the sera of 18.1% of patients with 
 <italic>Pandemrix</italic>-induced narcolepsy (compared to 7.3% in unvaccinated controls). The origin of these antibodies could be an immune response against the vaccine adjuvant (squalene) preparation that is from shark liver, a source rich in the GM3 and GM4 gangliosides. The role of anti-ganglioside antibodies in the pathological process is not clear. While the disease most likely is a specific autoimmune response to distinct self antigen(s) expressed by the orexin producing neurons the anti-ganglioside antibodies could have an additional role. A model for the potential disease development is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Anti-GM3 or anti-GM4 antibodies could (1) directly damage the hypothalamic neurons by binding to their gangliosides and activating the complement system or inflammatory cells. This is unlikely to be a major mechanism given the presence of these autoantibodies only in a proportion of the patients. On the other hand, they are frequently observed in the context of neurological disorders and could have an effect on the aforesaid nervous damage. (2) Since GM3 is a major endothelial ganglioside, anti-GM3 AGAs could damage the cerebral endothelium and BBB increasing its permeability to immune cells and mediators. (3) Furthermore, anti-GM3 autoantibodies could bind to lipid raft gangliosides and activate a signaling pathway that leads to the recruitment of molecules like integrins that can potentially facilitate the chemotaxis of the leukocytes.

 </sup> A similar effect has been observed in melanoma cell lines, in which GD3 activation leads to the recruitment of β1 integrins.

 </sup> These potential mechanisms could play a role in any disease, where antiganglioside antibodies are formed (Table
