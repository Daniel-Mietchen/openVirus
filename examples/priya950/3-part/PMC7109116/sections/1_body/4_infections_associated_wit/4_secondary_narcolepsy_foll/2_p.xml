<p id="Par38">There are different genetic traits related to the human narcoleptic phenotype, i.e., mutations in the T-cell-receptor Î± chain and purinergic receptor subtype 2Y11.

 </sup> It associates strongly with the HLA- DQB1*06:02 allele, present in practically all narcoleptic patients.

 </sup> However, the etiology of NT1 is still under investigation, but in the majority of cases it is an autoimmune disease. No direct evidence is available for the pathogenetic mechanisms in humans but evidence from studies in mice indicate that CD8+T cells can mediated killing of orexinergic neurons to give a narcolepsy-like phenotype.
