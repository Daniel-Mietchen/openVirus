<p id="Par40">The mechanisms and potential autoantigen underlying the development of H1N1 vaccine- or virus infection-induced narcolepsy have remained elusive. The receptor for the H1N1-virus hemagglutinin H1 is sialic acid, α2–3 or α2–6 linked to galactose, structures commonly present on gangliosides, like GD3. Furthermore, the other main protein on the virus particle surface is neuraminidase N1, capable of cleaving sialic acids. A molecular mimicry between orexin and the viral proteins leading to T cell cross-reactivity has been suggested.

 </sup> Pandemrix is an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine that contains α-tocopherol, which in vitro can increase the expression of orexin, upregulating the Nrf2 pathway.

 </sup> In this way it can potentially favor cross-reactive antigen presentation by MHC class II.
