<p id="Par33">Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused recent outbreaks in Latin America, Africa and French Polynesia. It has been associated with neurological sequelae such as microcephaly in newborns and GBS in adults.

 </sup> Microcephaly seems to be related to a direct neurotropic effect of the virus on the neural cells of the newborn, given its ability to cross the placenta, while the pathogenesis of GBS is far from being understood.

 </sup> An autoimmune etiology, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry similar to the one observed in 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, has been hypothesized, but the mechanism may differ.

 </sup> In a few studies, AGAs have been found in GBS patients having antibodies against ZIKV. Nico et al. reported anti-GD3 antibodies in acute ZIKV infections.

 </sup> Baskar and colleagues showed anti-GM1 antibodies in 50% of ZIKV-positive patients.

 </sup> However, Cao-Lormeau and his team showed that only a fraction of patients with GBS after ZIKV had AGAs, and their sera (anti-GA1 and GD1a) displayed no antibody competition between ZIKV proteins and GA1, a.k.a. asialo GM1.

 </sup> In addition to ZIKV, also other arbovirus infections have been associated with GBS, like dengue, West Nile and chikungunya with sporadic reports in the literature. Case reports have been published on GBS in patients with hepatitis E

 </sup> Parvovirus B19 infections are associated with a broad spectrum of neurological complications. Anti-GD1b AGAs were described in a case report by Sequeira et al. in a 23-year-old immunocompetent woman with a PB19 infection associated with hemolytic anemia and cranial polyneuropathy.
