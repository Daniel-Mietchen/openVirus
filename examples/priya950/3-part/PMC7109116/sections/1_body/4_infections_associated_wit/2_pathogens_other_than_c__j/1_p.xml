<p id="Par31">GBS and AGA development can be a post-infectious condition associated with many pathogens other than 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. These include 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae</italic>, cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus.

 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> has been linked to the development of GBS. These patients developed antibodies not only against gangliosides but also against anti-galactocerebrosides.

 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> has GM1-like structures on its surface that can elicit a mimicry-type antibody response similar to the one seen in 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> infections.

 </sup> Analyses of the the antecedent infections in GBS and MFS have indicated that 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> is the most common causative agent for infections preceding the occurrence of the neurological disease, being usually observed in approximately 21–32% of the cases.
