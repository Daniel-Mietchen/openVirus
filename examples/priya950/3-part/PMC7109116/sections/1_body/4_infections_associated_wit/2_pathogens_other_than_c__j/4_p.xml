<p id="Par34">While in some cases the associations between viral infections and GBS may be coincidental, it is possible that viral infections could lead to autoimmunity e.g., by exposing endogenous structures. One possibility is that a viral infection of cells may force them to release cell membrane particles containing gangliosides, e.g., from the membrane rafts, which then, in association with viral structures, could lead to a bystander-type autoimmune response.</p>
