<p id="Par10">In cells, gangliosides are concentrated in the outermost leafleats of the plasma membranes (PMs) in transient structures referred to as lipid rafts.

 </sup> Gangliosides are attached to the membrane so that their hydrophobic ceramide tail is embedded in the lipid membrane, and the sugar moiety is protruding out from the membrane. Lipid rafts are specific and transient subdomains rich in glycosphingolipids (e.g., gangliosides), cholesterol and distinct proteins, e.g., caveolins, flotillins and glycophosphoinositol (GPI)-linked proteins. They also contain molecules involved in signaling, like low molecular weight and hetero-trimeric G proteins, EGF receptors, PDGF receptors, endothelin receptors, MAP kinase and protein kinase C.

 </sup> Gangliosides interact with phospholipids, cholesterol and transmembrane proteins of the lipid rafts both in cis and trans. They are involved in many cellular processes such as regulation of many cellular functions, neurotransmission, interaction with regulatory proteins of the nervous system and in cell-cell recognition, proliferation, as well as in the modulation of signal transduction pathways.
