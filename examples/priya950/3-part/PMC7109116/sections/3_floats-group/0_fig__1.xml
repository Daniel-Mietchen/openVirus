  <p>Structures and biosynthesis of gangliosides. 
   <bold>a</bold> Structure of the GM1 ganglioside. The sialic acid (red) is linked to the oligosaccharide residue (green) ultimately connected to the ceramide tail (blue) that is embedded in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. 
   <bold>b</bold> A schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway and structures of gangliosides. Gangliosides are sialylated glycosphingolipids. Their synthesis consists of the sequential addition of sugars and/or sialic acids (neuraminic acid; NeuAc) by two main groups of enzymes, i.e., sialyltransferases (GM3/GD3/GT3 synthases and ST3GAL2/ ST3GAL3) and glycosyltransferases (B4GALNT1 and B3GALT4).

   </sup> The letters M (1), D (2), T (3) and Q (4) indicate the number of sialic acid residues, respectively. The numbers, on the other hand, indicate indirectly the number of sugar residues subtracted from 5: e.g., GM1 contains 5–1 = 4 sugar residues, and GD3 contains 5–3 = 2 sugar residues. Abbreviations: beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 1 (B4GALNT1), beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 4 (B3GALT4), ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2 (ST3GAL2), ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3 (ST3GAL3)
