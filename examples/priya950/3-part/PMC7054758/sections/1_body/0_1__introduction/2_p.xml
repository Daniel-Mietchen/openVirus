<p>Virus infection can induce a large number of antiviral factors and host immune responses [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The type I interferon (IFN) (including IFN
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN
 <italic>β</italic>) system is a first line of the defense against viral infections [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Type I IFN can induce the production of various antiviral factors through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When IFN binds to IFN receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on the cell surface, JAK, which is linked to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, is recruited and activated by phosphorylation. Meanwhile, IFNAR1 is also phosphorylated. STATs form heterodimers after binding to phosphorylated IFNAR1. The activated STATs can enter the nucleus to regulate the transcription of antiviral factors [
