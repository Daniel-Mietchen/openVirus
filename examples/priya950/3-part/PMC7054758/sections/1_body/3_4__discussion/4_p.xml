<p>The critical role of SOCS3 is manifested by its binding to both JAKs and cytokine receptors, which results in the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 triggers a variety of gene expressions in response to cytokine (such as IL-6 and IL-10) and growth factor stimulation and plays a critical role in many cellular biological processes involved in anti-/proinflammatory responses, cell growth, and cell death [

The EV71 virus may escape host immunity by inducing expressions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, we found that the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B inhibitor could inhibit the expression of the SOCS protein induced by EV71. Consistently, Collins et al. reported that murine hepatitis C virus could induce the expression of SOCS3 through the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway, ultimately leading to an increase of the viral titer [

 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway to block this antiviral strategy.
