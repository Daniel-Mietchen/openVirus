<p>Total RNA was extracted with a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was reverse transcribed with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Roche) and oligo d(T)18 primers. The RT-PCR was carried out on Mx3005P (Agilent Technologies, Stratagene, USA) using the Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (2x) (ABI). The amplification procedure was as follows: initial activation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 57°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 20 s. The primers used in this study are listed in
