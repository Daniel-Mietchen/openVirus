<p>We then investigated the roles of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in EV71 infection. We knocked down SOCS1 and SOCS3 via shRNA in RD cells prior to viral infection. When SOCS3 and SOCS1 were knocked down in RD cells, RT-PCR and western blot results showed significant decreases in mRNA and protein levels of SOCS3 and SOCS1, respectively (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). Furthermore, the production of EV71 in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells was significantly lower than that in the control cells after EV71 infection, which revealed that the infectivity of EV71 was decreased significantly in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref>).
