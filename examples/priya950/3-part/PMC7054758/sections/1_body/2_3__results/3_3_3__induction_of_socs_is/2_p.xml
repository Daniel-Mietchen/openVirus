<p>To further confirm these results, we knocked down the IFNAR1 in HEK293T cells. RT-PCR showed that about 60% of IFNAR1 was knocked down (

 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> were increased in control cells infected with EV71 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(h)</xref>). In the IFNAR1 knockdown cells infected with EV71, the induction of type I IFN was inhibited significantly (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(g)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(h)</xref>), while the expressions of SOCS1/3 were still increased (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>). SOCS1/3 levels in the knockdown cells were almost unchanged compared to control cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>). These results indicate that induction of the SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expressions is independent on the virus-induced type I IFN expression. SOCS expression may be induced by other signaling pathways during EV71 infection.
