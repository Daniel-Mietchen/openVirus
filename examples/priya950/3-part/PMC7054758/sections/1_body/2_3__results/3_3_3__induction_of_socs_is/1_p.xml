<p>To detect the relationship between EV71 infection and SOCS expression, the EV71 viral titer was increased to MOI 1.5 in the infection of RD cells. SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA levels were increased in the early stage of viral infection (

 <italic>α</italic> and IFN
 <italic>β</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). We wonder whether SOCS3 induction might be due to the EV71 virus itself or the paracrine stimulation by IFN during the EV71 infection. Therefore, RD cells were stimulated with IFN
 <italic>β</italic> for different time points, and the mRNA levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and the IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) were measured by RT-PCR. ISG56 is a typical IFN-inducible gene [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref> showed that ISG56 mRNA was significantly upregulated, whereas neither SOCS1 nor SOCS3 mRNA was significantly elevated in IFN
 <italic>β</italic>-stimulated RD cells.
