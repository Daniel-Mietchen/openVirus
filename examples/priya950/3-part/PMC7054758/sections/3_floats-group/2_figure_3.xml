  <p>Early induction of SOCS gene transcription is an IFN-independent manner. (a–c) RD cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 1.5) or stimulated with human IFN
   <italic>β</italic> for the indicated time points. The mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (a, c), IFN
   <italic>α</italic> and IFN
   <italic>β</italic> (b), and ISG56 (c) were analyzed by RT-PCR. (d) Knockdown of IFNAR1 in HEK293T cells was performed with shRNA and determined by RT-PCR. (e–h) The effect of EV71 on SOCS1/3 expression in IFNAR1 knockdown cells. The mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (e, f) and IFN
   <italic>α</italic> and IFN
   <italic>β</italic> (g, h) were analyzed by RT-PCR. All the data were representative of at least three independent repeats. The statistical significance analyses were performed using two-tailed unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (NS: no significance;
