  <p>SOCS proteins promote EV71 virus infection. (a–d) Knockdown of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in RD cells was performed with shRNA. The mRNA level expression was determined by RT-PCR (a, b) and the protein level expression was determined by western blot (c, d). (e, f) SOCS knockdown inhibited EV71 virus infection. RD shcontrol cells or stably expressing SOCS1- (f) or SOCS3- (e) specific shRNA cells were stimulated with EV71 (MOI = 0.06). At 36 h after infection, the viral loads were analyzed by RT-PCR (upper) and by western blot (lower). (g, h) Antiviral factor MX1 (g) and OAS2 (h) mRNA expressions were detected in SOCS1 or SOCS3 knockdown RD cells by RT-PCR. The statistical significance analyses were performed using two-sided unpaired
