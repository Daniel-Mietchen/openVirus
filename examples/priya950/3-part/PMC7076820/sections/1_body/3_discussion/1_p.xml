<p id="Par24">PRV is a neurotropic virus that infects both the peripheral and nervous system. It causes huge economic losses in some domestic and wild animals and is especially devastating for the swine industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although PRV has a broad host range, pigs are its natural hosts and serve as a viral reservoir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Humans working on a hog farm can also be infected by PRV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this study, we reported that 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide can inhibit PRV replication, prevent infection, and kill the virus. Thus, 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide might be adopted for PRV therapy in the future.
