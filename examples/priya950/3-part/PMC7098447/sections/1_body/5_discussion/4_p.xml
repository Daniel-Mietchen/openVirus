<p>Studies have shown that during influenza epidemics, cardiac injury was associated with increased mortality (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and was more prevalent among infected individuals who died (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Study of a cohort from the severe H1N1 pandemic in 2009 showed that elevated TNI and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF &lt; 50%) were associated with high mortality (

 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Consistent with this result, 69% of patients who died of influenza B viral infection in one study showed pathologic evidence of cardiac injury (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Our study is the first to identify cardiac injury as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Cardiac injury in influenza-infected patients may contribute to mortality in part by causing hemodynamic deterioration. Indeed, many of our patients with cardiac injury were on vasopressor therapy. This deterioration may be due to cytokines released after severe infection. Cytokines can suppress cardiac output, and cytokine storms inhibit oxygen use by mitochondria, and contribute to the occurrence of acute heart failure in patients with severe infection (
