<p>Cardiac injury was defined as one or more of the following (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>): blood levels of cardiac biomarkers (TNI or CK-MB) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), new abnormalities in electrocardiography, including supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave flattening/inversion, and QT interval prolongation (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), new abnormalities in echocardiography, including decreased EF value (EF &lt; 50%) or a worsening of the underlying state (patients with basal state of EF &lt;50%), regional/global ventricular wall motion abnormalities, the presence of pericardial effusion, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (

 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). PAPm was calculated by adding estimated right atrial pressure to mean tricuspid regurgitation pressure, echocardiographic estimation of PAPm with a cutoff value of greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg at rest with regard to the diagnosis of PAH (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Clinical manifestations, cardiac evaluation, hemodynamic variables, documents of physician diagnoses, and related guidelines or standards were used to identify heart failure, myocarditis, sudden cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and acute myocardial infarction.
