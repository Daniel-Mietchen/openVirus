<p>Copies of original patient medical records were sent from the participating hospitals to the central data collection center in Beijing (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Clinical data were reviewed by trained physicians of pulmonary and critical care medicine to determine the accuracy of diagnoses. Demographic characteristics (age and gender), clinical characteristics (comorbidities, laboratory findings, severity of illness scores, treatments, complications, and outcomes), and results of cardiac examinations (cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, and echocardiography) for participants during hospitalization were collected and independently entered into the computer database by two analysts. Results of cardiac biomarkers included values of TNI and creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB). Results of electrocardiography included heart rate, heart rhythm, and waveform change of P, QRS, and ST-T. Results of echocardiography included value of EF, ventricular wall motion assessment, pericardial effusion, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm).
