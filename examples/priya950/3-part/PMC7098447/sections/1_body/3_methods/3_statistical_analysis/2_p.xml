<p>Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between patients with or without cardiac injury using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine the independent risk factors for death during hospitalization. Variables with

Probabilities of entering and removing variables in a stepwise manner in the multivariate model were 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. To determine the association between cardiac injury and mortality, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with adjustment of age (&lt; 65 yr, ≥ 65 yr), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (&lt; 21, ≥ 21), Pa

Subgroup analysis according to ARDS, age, and APACHE II score was also performed with the multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model.
