<p>The Chinese Surveillance System for Pneumonia was used to retrospectively collect data of inpatients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza from hospitals throughout China. Database for data collection of H7N9 virusâ€“infected patients has been established and described previously (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In brief, based on the database, copies of original medical records of 338 patients from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of mainland China between January 22, 2015, and June 16, 2017, were available. For each hospital, the collaborators contributed all the patients with H7N9 viral infection from their hospital. H7N9 viral infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral isolation, or serologic testing (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Cardiac testing was ordered by the treating physicians. If there was more than one test for a single patient, all the results were captured. Patients were followed up from admission to death during hospitalization or hospital discharge. Loss to follow-up was defined as the survival status that cannot be ascertained.
