<p id="p0115">Gross et al. [
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] showed that taking 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> (G115, 100 mg) twice daily for 12 weeks enhanced respiratory endurance and improved pulmonary function in 92 moderate patients with COPD. In a study of 40 chronic bronchitis patients, 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> (100 mg) taken twice daily for 8 weeks significantly decreased the number of alveolar macrophages in BAL fluid when compared with the placebo control [

 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> (G115, 100 mg for 9 days) in combination with antibiotics in 75 patients with chronic bronchitis, they were able to show a reduced bacterial count compared with antibiotics alone [

 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> treatment did not show any adverse effects [
