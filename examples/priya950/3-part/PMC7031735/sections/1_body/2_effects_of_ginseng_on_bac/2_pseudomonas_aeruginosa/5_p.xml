 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> aqueous extract used for treatment at a concentration of 0.5% for 24 h destroyed most 7-day-old mature biofilms formed by both mucoid and nonmucoid 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains. Ginseng increased bacterial motility in biofilm-like alginate beads, resulting in the release of bacteria from the biofilm and loss of the protective effects of the polymeric matrix, suggesting that ginseng treatment might help to eradicate biofilm-associated chronic infections caused by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. In addition, 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> significantly inhibited bacterial biofilm formation in both mucoid and nonmucoid 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In a study wherein P. ginseng (250 mg/kg/day) was subcutaneously injected into a mouse model challenged with alginate beads containing mucoid 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PAO 579), ginseng treatment resulted in higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α but lower levels of IL-4 in lung cells and splenocytes after 6 and/or 24 h of incubation compared with the control [
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. All these data suggest that ginseng facilitates bacterial clearance from the lungs through multiple mechanisms and has a negative effect on the quorum-sensing system of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, resulting in a milder lung pathology. In addition, these findings suggest that the immunomodulatory functions of ginseng are most likely associated with the activation of a Th1 type cellular immune response and downregulation of the humoral immune response, reducing the formation of immune complexes [
