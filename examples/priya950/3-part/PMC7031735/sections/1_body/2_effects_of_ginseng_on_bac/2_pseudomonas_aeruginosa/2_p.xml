 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a complex gram-negative opportunistic facultative anaerobe that causes nosocomial infections and pneumonias, leading to COPD, thermal injury, and urinary tract infections in infants and immunocompromised patients [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. P. aeruginosa disrupts airway homeostasis in the lung by damaging the epithelium and evading innate and adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>]. Biofilm-associated chronic 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis are difficult to manage with antibiotics due to the high tolerance of biofilm-associated bacteria to medical intervention and host defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. An aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> administered at a concentration of 25 mg/kg/day for 14 d in a rat model of chronic 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia mimicking cystic fibrosis significantly increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemiluminescence and serum IgG2a levels while decreasing IgG1 levels when compared with the control [
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This suggests that 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> could be a useful adjunct therapy in cystic fibrosis able to alleviate bacterial infections and reduce biofilm formation.
