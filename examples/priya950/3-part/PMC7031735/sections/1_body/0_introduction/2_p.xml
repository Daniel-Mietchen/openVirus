<p id="p0010">Environmental exposure to fine particles in polluted air is the leading risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction that can alter the development of both immune function and lung mechanics, including substantial adverse impact on human health mainly in growing children and immunocompromised patients [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Polluted air contains a mixture of multiple substances, including gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM) [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], both of which affect the respiratory system and cause pulmonary disorders and adverse health effects [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PM is primarily emitted from combustion engines or formed by chemical transformation. It is classified based on particle diameter; aerosolized particles with a diameter of 10 μm or less are denoted as PM
 <sub>10</sub> and those with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less as PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. The World Health Organization provides air quality guidelines that reference the daily and annual concentrations of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> (World Health Organization) [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent global multicenter studies demonstrated that short-term exposure to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> is associated with increased respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates [
