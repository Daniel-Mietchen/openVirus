<p id="p0020">Infectious diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are primarily caused by either bacterial or viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and often experience treatment failure 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587606000358?via%3Dihub" id="interref0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587606000358?via%3Dihub</ext-link> [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infections and facilitate secondary bacterial infections by aiding bacterial adherence, colonization, and translocation through the epithelial barrier of respiratory cells

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clinical features do not reliably distinguish bacterial from viral infection; however, their management and treatment are different [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both management and treatment of bacterial and viral infections can be complicated, if the patient is exposed to air pollutants, which have recently emerged as one of the greatest environmental health risks worldwide as a result of rapid industrial development and urbanization [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although, viral infection areas more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations than bacterial infections to cause respiratory symptoms, yet viral infections may induce bacterial infection, and this condition complicates investigation of the role of each microorganism in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because majority of viral infections is self-resolving; however, rapid molecular diagnostics tests have increased our understanding to identify bacterial and viral pathogens [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The diagnostic yield is influenced by antibiotic therapy, specimen collection, transport, rapid processing, and correct use of cytological criteria [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Regarding viral and atypical pathogens, conventional culture of bacteria from normally sterile sites remains the ‘gold standard’ for confirming bacterial infection; however, it may take several days and are frequently negative when infection resides in inaccessible sites or when antibiotics have been previously administered [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, rapid onset of disease, symptoms, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; however, detection of a virus in the specimen does not rule out bacterial infection and is of little help in decisions on whether to administer antibiotics. Clarifying the differences and dynamics of respiratory infections can elucidate pathogenesis of viral–bacterial interactions and provide a basis for developing novel approaches for the prevention, treatment, or management of acute respiratory infection.
