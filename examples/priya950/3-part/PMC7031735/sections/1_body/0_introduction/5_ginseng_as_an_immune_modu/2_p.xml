<p id="p0025">Although there are a number of ginseng species, Korean ginseng (
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> C. A. Meyer), American ginseng (
 <italic>Panax quinquefolius L</italic>.), and Chinese ginseng (
 <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic>) are the most popular experimental models and have received significant attention for their potential use to alleviate disease symptoms and improve health conditions. These species of ginseng have also been included in health-care products and food additives worldwide [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> is abundant in North Asian countries, especially Korea, the eastern regions of China, Japan, and Russia. 
 <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> is cultivated mainly in China [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. quinquefolium</italic> is found in the United States and Canada and has been used by Americans for several years [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ginseng is known to possess immunomodulatory activities with a wide array of therapeutic applications against microbial infections. Contradictory data regarding the immunomodulatory properties of ginseng are most likely a result of differences in the extraction method, origin and source of ginseng, and laboratory practices [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is because it contains numerous pharmacologically active ingredients, including ginsenosides, saponins, carbohydrates, phytosterols, polyacetylenes, polyphenolic compounds, sugars, acidic polysaccharides, organic acids, amino acids, vitamins, nitrogenous substances, and minerals, each of which can play a significant role in protection from and treatment of many diseases [

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>]. In common practices, 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> has been shown to promote physical performance, improve vitality, increase resistance to stress and aging [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Recently, approximately 200 active compounds, such as ginsenosides, polyacetylenes, polysaccharides, amino acids, and peptides have been validated from Korean ginseng [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], whereas 
 <italic>P. quinquefolium</italic> commonly known as a popular nutritional supplement and herbal remedy [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] has approximately more than 100 substances isolated from American ginseng. Chemically, several differences exist among Korean ginseng and American ginseng which make them different in terms of their mechanism of action [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Ginsenosides, including Rb1, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rg3, Rh1, and Rh2, are the major active ingredients in ginseng known to possess enhanced therapeutic activity and stability due to change in its chemical constituents [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An important parameter used for differentiation is the presence of the ginsenoside Rf in Korean ginseng and notoginseng, the pseudoginsenoside F11 in American ginseng [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the notoginsenoside R1 in Korean ginseng. In addition, the ratio of Rg1/Rb1 has been widely used to differentiate between these ginsengs. Ratios less than 0.4 are indicative of American ginseng, whereas a high value ratio is characteristic of Korean ginseng [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Apart from ginsenoside, saponins are a heterogeneous group of triterpene glycosides and sterols [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and increase cellular and humoral immune responses when used as adjuvants during vaccination [
