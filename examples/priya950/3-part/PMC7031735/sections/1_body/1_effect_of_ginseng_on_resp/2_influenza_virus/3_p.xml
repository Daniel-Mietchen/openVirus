<p id="p0035">Ginseng modulates both T-helper type 1 and 2 (Th1) and (Th2) immune responses via antibody production, inhibiting the invasion and replication of influenza virus and aiding the detachment of the virus from mucosa. Cellular immunity mediated by Th1 and Th2 responses is associated with tissue remodeling and healing and is required to improve cell viability and viral clearance [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Coadministration of ginsenoside Re (25, 50, or 100 μg) with inactivated influenza virus (H3N2) antigen equivalent to 10 or 100 ng of hemagglutinin in mice immunized subcutaneously produced increased serum specific IgG, IgG isotype responses, hemagglutinin inhibition, lymphocyte proliferation, as well as IFN-γ and IL-5 secretion [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, immunized mice presented with higher levels of influenza virus–specific antibodies with amplified neutralizing activities in mucosal secretions and blood. IgA antibodies in the lung were particularly amenable to this effect, suggesting that both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were activated in splenocytes

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Immune responses to respiratory illness are typically characterized by a classical Th1 immune response in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], mediated by Th1 cells and enriched production of antibodies, such as IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. Moreover, a Th1 immune response is mandatory for cytotoxic T lymphocyte production

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Dietary intake of both RGE and RG saponin for 14 d before primary immunization showed two times more anti-influenza A serum IgG titers with enhanced survival rates after influenza A infection in mice. Mice receiving RG saponin and RG extract had a total survival rate of 63% and 56%, respectively, whereas animals who received only the vaccine had a 38% survival rate [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mice treated with ginsenoside Re also experienced increased hemagglutination inhibition and serum-specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels, which was mirrored in the results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of splenocytes, which produced elevated levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Moreover, dietary intake of Korean Red Ginseng saponin, and RGE has also been implicated in increasing H1N1 vaccine efficacy by improving anti-influenza A–specific IgG titers and thus, survival rates

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The Th2 response induces IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, which contribute to mucus production, goblet cell formation, eosinophil recruitment in the lungs, and airway hyperresponsiveness [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Contrarily, the Th1 response is effective against intracellular infectious agents, providing protective immunity

Oral administration of RGE (with a daily dose ranging from 10 to 100 mg/kg), with vaccination before infection, provided enhanced cross-protection against swine-origin influenza A viruses, including H1N1, antigenically distinct H1N1 subtype A/PR/8/34, and H3N2 subtype A/Philippines/82 [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Naive mice infected with virus mixed with Korean Red Ginseng extract (KRGE) showed higher levels of IFN-γ but lower levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and lung viral titers when compared with control mice infected with virus without RGE [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The inhibitory effects of polysaccharides on viral replication were also tested in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells using the H1N1 virus

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, RGE, ginseng saponin, and ginseng polysaccharides were evaluated for their antiviral effect after oral administration in chickens or mice. These studies measured antibody titer response, body weight, cytokine production, histopathology, lung viral titers, and survival rate

 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> polysaccharide administration (25 mg/kg) intranasally (
