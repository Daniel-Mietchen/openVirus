 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family is the most common human respiratory pathogen and the main causative agent of seasonal influenza [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which is a serious respiratory disease estimated to cause around three to five million cases of severe illness and half a million deaths per annum [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Influenza has three main types, A, B, and C, with influenza A being the most virulent in humans, other mammals, and birds, and, thus, the best understood of the three. The H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu caused a lethal pandemic in 2009, affecting more than 74 countries [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the antiviral activity of Red Ginseng extract (RGE) and its purified components on influenza A infection both

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that ginsenoside components, particularly Rb1, have the ability to interact with viral hemagglutinin proteins, preventing the attachment of the virus to α 2-3′ sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface, and thereby minimizing pandemic H1N1 viral entry into host cells [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Fermented RGEs containing ginsenosides (protopanaxatriol [PT], protopanaxadiol [PD], compound K, and Rh2) showed antiviral activity against several influenza subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9) in mouse models [

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that treatment with ginseng polysaccharide followed by treatment with RGE and saponin was effective in alleviating the symptoms of influenza viral infection. Intranasal coadministration of Korean RGE (200 mg/kg body weight) with inactivated influenza virus A (PR8) increased the specific antibody levels in treated animals and induced improved protective immunity when compared with immunization with PR8 alone (25 mg). Mice-fed ginseng polysaccharide fractions, total extracts, saponin fractions, or phosphate-buffered saline for 14 d before influenza A challenge had a 78%, 67%, 56%, and 17% survival rate, respectively. In addition, RGE as a mucosal adjuvant also played a protective role against influenza virus A/PR8 viral infection
