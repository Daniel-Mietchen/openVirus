<p id="p0040">Ginseng stem–leaf saponins (GSLS) possess multiple biological functions, mainly immunomodulatory activities [

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, when the effect of orally administered GSLS (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) on immune responses in chickens vaccinated with live Newcastle disease vaccines was evaluated, GSLS enhanced hemagglutination inhibition and researchers determined its optimal dose at 5 mg/kg. In addition, administration of GSLS in drinking water at 5 mg/kg for 7 days before vaccination markedly improved intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte proliferation and mucosal IgA
 <sup>+</sup> cells in chickens immunized with a live Newcastle disease vaccine [

Similarly, the effect of administering GSLS at concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg for seven days on the immune response after administration of a bivalent inactive vaccine of avian influenza in chickens was examined. Data showed that the spleen lymphocyte proliferation induced by Concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharides, and the numbers of IgA-secreting (IgA
 <sup>+</sup>) cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the duodenum were recovered in chickens treated with GSLS before immunization. GSLS also proved to be a potential vaccine candidate, as it enhanced serum antibody responses in immunosuppressed chickens after cyclophosphamide treatment at 100 mg/kg for 3 days [
