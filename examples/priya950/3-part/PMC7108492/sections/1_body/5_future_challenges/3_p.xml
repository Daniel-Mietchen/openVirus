<p>As additional resources become available (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), CEPI is diversifying its current vaccine R&amp;D investment portfolio to include additional pathogens, beginning with chikungunya, a debilitating mosquito-borne disease spread by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, that affects millions of people globally, and Rift Valley fever, a viral zoonosis of cattle and other domesticated livestock that also infects humans (
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Chikungunya infection can lead to substantial morbidity; patients can experience arthralgia for months or even years, and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease develops in small subset of patients (
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The substantial burden of this disease, for example, coupled with a large vaccine pipeline relative to other EIDs, could justify investments that might yield clinically relevant outcomes in a shorter time. The quantity of antigen is generally expected to be different across EIDs; however, not knowing what quantity of antibody would be required to induce protection against chikungunya could make the identification of situations that would allow statistical demonstration of efficacy challenging. Feasibility of development would consequently depend on technical hurdles and regulatory guidance for appropriate clinical trial design.
