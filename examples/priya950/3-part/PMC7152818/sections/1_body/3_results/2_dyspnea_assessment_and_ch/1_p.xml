<p id="para0025">During hospitalization, dyspnea was observed in 52·5% A(H7N9) patients. Mild dyspnea was assessed with mMRC dyspnea grading (mean ± SD) scale of 1·47 ± 0·80, 1·40 ± 0·58 and 1·16 ± 0·38 at the three-month, six-month, and 12-month follow-up visits, respectively, that declined to 1·00 at the 18-month and 64-month visits. On chest auscultation, moist rales were documented in 8·8-15·0% of A(H7N9) patients at the three-month through 12-month visits. Results of dyspnea assessment and chest auscultation for A(H7N9) patients during follow-up are presented in
