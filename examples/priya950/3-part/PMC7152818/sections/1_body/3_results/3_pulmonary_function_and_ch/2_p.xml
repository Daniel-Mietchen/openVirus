<p id="para0027">Cox regression analysis showed that respiratory failure at hospital admission was significantly associated with the risk of persistence of pulmonary dysfunction (adjusted HR = 0·11; 95% CI, 0·02–0·60), and age was significantly associated with the risk of chest CT scan abnormalities (adjusted HR = 0·95, 95% CI, 0·92–0·98) during follow-up (Table S4, Supplementary materials). For the Cox regression evaluation, the p-value of our global test was 0·30 for pulmonary dysfunction and 0·99 for chest CT scans, and we accepted the null hypothesis and the PH assumption as valid.</p>
