<p id="para0022">Data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database and statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 for Microsoft Windows, and R programming software package (version 3.5.3; R Development Core Team, 2019). For continuous variables, we calculated mean and standard deviation (SD) or median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Since the number of participants with data available at the six month follow-up visit was higher than at other follow-up time points, we analyzed data on mMRC score, chest auscultation, and lung function at six months to compare the effects by the following variables: age group (“0-64” and “≥65”); receipt of antiviral therapy; any underlying comorbidities; and receipt of corticosteroid treatment. Inter-subgroup effect differences were examined by Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U-</italic>test for continuous variables with non-normally distributed data. For categorical variables, percentages of survivors in each category were compared using Pearson χ
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the cumulative rates of pulmonary dysfunction and persistence of chest CT scan abnormalities during the follow-up period. Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) Regression Model was applied to evaluate the relationship between age, gender, ARDS, severe pneumonia, respiratory failure at hospital admission and pulmonary dysfunction, and chest CT abnormalities in A(H7N9) patients for the duration of the follow-up visits. Outcomes in survival analysis were defined as pulmonary function and chest CT scan without abnormalities. Participants’ data were censored due to missing assessments. We used Schoenfeld's global validity test to evaluate the Cox regression model with the null hypothesis defined as “Cox PH assumption valid”. All the statistical tests were two-tailed and the significance level was set as α=0·05.
