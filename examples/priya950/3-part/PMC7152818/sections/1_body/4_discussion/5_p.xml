<p id="para0035">The pulmonary abnormalities we identified persisted for longer than has been reported in follow-up of hospitalized patients with pandemic or seasonal influenza. A study of 44 patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, including 27% diagnosed with pneumonia on admission, reported substantial improvement of respiratory capacity from discharge compared to a six-month follow-up visit

Another study of ARDS patients who survived A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection reported that while 2 of 3 patients had a restrictive pattern at 6 months after ICU admission, all had improvement in CT abnormalities and normal diffusion capacity by six months of follow-up

One study that compared the clinical characteristics of 18 A(H7N9) and 26 A(H1N1)pdm09 patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit reported that the proportion of patients with bronchiectasis, reticular opacities, linear fibrosis, and patchy opacities at six months of follow-up was significantly higher for A(H7N9) than A(H1N1)pdm09 patients
