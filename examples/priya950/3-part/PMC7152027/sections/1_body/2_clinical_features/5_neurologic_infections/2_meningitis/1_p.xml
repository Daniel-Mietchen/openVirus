<p id="p0385">Typical bacterial and viral causes should be considered. Causes of predominantly lymphocytic meningitis include arboviruses, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Q fever, relapsing fevers, syphilis, tuberculosis, HIV seroconversion, and HIV-related opportunistic infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). Some infections, such as enteric fever, rarely present with meningismus but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal.</p>
