<p id="p0365">Travelersâ€™ diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill returned travelers.
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>3</sup>
 </xref> Fever is self-reported in one third of these patients. Specific pathogens vary according to destination, setting, and season; however, enteric bacteria, including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella,</italic> and 
 <italic>Shigella,</italic> are the most common. In up to 50%, no pathogen is identified. The combination of fever and bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. Empiric antibiotics can be considered (see later). Any systemic febrile infection can have diarrhea at presentation; for example, severe sepsis, malaria, and pneumococcal pneumonia.
