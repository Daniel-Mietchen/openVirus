 </xref> It should be excluded in all travelers with a history of fever. The risk of travelers acquiring malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa has decreased substantially in recent years, especially in those from India and South America.

 </xref> When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured.

  <sup>8</sup>
 </xref> Chemoprophylaxis can obscure the diagnosis, so in cases where malaria is thought likely, chemoprophylaxis can be stopped while patients are investigated.
