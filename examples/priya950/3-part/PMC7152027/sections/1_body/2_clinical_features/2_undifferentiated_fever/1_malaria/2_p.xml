 </xref> Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, and some patients report diarrhea or cough. Complications occur mainly with 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection but can also occur after infection with 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> and 
 <italic>P. knowlesi.</italic> In patients with confusion, seizures, or reduced consciousness level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.
