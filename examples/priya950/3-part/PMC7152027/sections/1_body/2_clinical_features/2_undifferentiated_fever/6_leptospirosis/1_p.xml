<p id="p0285">Leptospirosis has a global distribution. Infection occurs after exposure to rodent or dog urineâ€“contaminated freshwater; for example, through recreational water sports, flooding, or occupation. After an incubation period of 7 to 12 days, patients classically present with a biphasic illness: a bacteremic phase with flulike symptoms lasting 4 to 7 days, followed 1 to 3 days later by an immune phase of fever, myalgia, hepatorenal syndrome, and hemorrhage.
