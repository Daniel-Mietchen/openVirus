    <italic>Geographic distribution:</italic> Risk varies with country and environment (e.g., urban or rural, mountains or coastal plains). Although malaria is the most common infection diagnosed in travelers returned from sub-Saharan Africa, dengue is more prevalent in travelers returning from Southeast Asia and enteric fever from southcentral Asia (see

    <italic>Incubation period:</italic> Most travelers become symptomatic within 21 days of exposure, with the majority presenting within 1 month of return. However, some pathogens have a much longer incubation period (e.g., 
    <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> and tuberculosis); patients can present months or, rarely, years later (
