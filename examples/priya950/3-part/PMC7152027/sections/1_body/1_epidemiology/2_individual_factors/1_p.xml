    <italic>Purpose and duration of travel:</italic> Individuals visiting friends and relations (VFR) and long-stay travelers (e.g., aid workers) are at greatest risk of acquiring malaria, enteric fever, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. This is partly due to longer duration of travel and closer proximity to the local population.

    <italic>Immune status:</italic> Migrants returning to their home countries may be immune to certain infections, such as hepatitis A and acute schistosomiasis; however, they may incorrectly consider themselves immune to others, such as malaria. Consequently, VFR travelers are less likely to seek pre-travel advice, take malaria prophylaxis, or receive vaccines.
