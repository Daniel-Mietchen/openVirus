<p id="p0515">When there is a strong suspicion, a parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) can be commenced pending blood culture results. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates are reported in patients returning from Asia, but so far have been rarely reported in those returning from Africa.

 </xref> Ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily remains the treatment of choice for fully sensitive isolates. Azithromycin 1 g followed by 500 mg daily should be used as follow-on therapy where fluoroquinolone resistance is suspected or confirmed. Regardless of which antibiotic is used, fever can take time to resolve; failure to defervesce is not a reason to change antibiotics when the isolate is confirmed as sensitive.
