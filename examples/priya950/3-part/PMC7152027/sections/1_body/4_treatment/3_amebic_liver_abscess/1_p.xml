<p id="p0510">Metronidazole 750 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days or tinidazole 2 g daily for 3 days should be started empirically in patients with an appropriate travel history, clinical presentation, imaging, and, where available, serology (can be falsely negative in early disease). Most patients demonstrate clinical improvement and resolution of fever within 48 to 72 hours. The main differential diagnosis is a pyogenic liver abscess; patients with sepsis require broad-spectrum antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical or percutaneous drainage is rarely required and should only be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms persist after 4 days of treatment, or there is imminent risk of rupture into critical sites (e.g., left-lobe abscess rupturing into the pericardium).
