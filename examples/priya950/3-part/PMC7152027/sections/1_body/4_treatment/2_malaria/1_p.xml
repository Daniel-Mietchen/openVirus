<p id="p0505">Parasitic confirmation (smears, rapid diagnostic tests [RDTs], or PCR) of suspected malaria is preferred, and empiric treatment is not recommended in clinical settings with good diagnostic facilities. However, diagnostic results must be accurate, timely, and available. Accuracy depends on the skills of the microscopist; RDT and PCR results reflect the performance characteristics of the assay. RDTs have high sensitivity for
