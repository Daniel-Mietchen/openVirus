Symptoms and signs vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in advanced cases. These infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Diagnosis is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood, which should be performed prior to further investigations (which might result in exposure of health care staff); malaria must be excluded. A high index of suspicion, close liaison with specialists, and transfer to a specialist facility are usually necessary to manage these patients.
