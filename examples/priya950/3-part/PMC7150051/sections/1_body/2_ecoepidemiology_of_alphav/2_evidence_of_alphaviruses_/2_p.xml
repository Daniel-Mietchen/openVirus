<p id="p0160">In Trinidad Island, a seroprevalence study was conducted against antibodies selected from flavivirus and alphavirus in a sample of 384 bats (10 genera and 14 species). The sera were analyzed by the Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) technique using antibodies specific to WNV, VEEV, EEEV. About 2.9% of the sample (11/384) were seropositive against VEEV-specific antibodies, none of the sera were seropositive against antibodies to the VWN and EEEV viruses (

 <italic>Artibeus planirostris</italic> (frugivore) and 
 <italic>Sturnira lilium</italic> (frugivore). A fragment of the nsP4 nonstructural protein of the alphaviruses corresponding to 195 bp was amplified. The positive samples were reamplified, and the amplicons were sequenced. The obtained consensus sequence of 154 kb presented a 97.7% similarity with sequences of the gene that codes for the precursor of the nonstructural and structural protein of VEEV registered in the Genbank.
