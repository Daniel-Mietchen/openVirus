<p id="p0020">The faunistic, bioecological, and distribution data of the culicids allow us to distinguish between species with the capacity to maintain the enzootic stage of some of these arboviruses of others that can act as vectors of the virus to the human being. The study of bioecology and the population dynamics of mosquito vectors is important to predict local transmission scenarios and determine which species should be controlled according to their possible participation in both the enzootic cycle of the disease and its arrival, and even maintenance in the human being.</p>
