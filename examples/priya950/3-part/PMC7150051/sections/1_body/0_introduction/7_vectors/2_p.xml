<p id="p0060">The transmission of DENV by mosquitoes could be limited in wild ecosystems, where urban species of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>; for example, in canopy forests (Mexico), other mosquito species inhabit the blood of bats, birds, and other wild animals (

 <italic>Desmodus</italic>, as well as in ectoparasites of the order Diptera Streblidae, 
 <italic>Strebla wiedemanni</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trichobius parasiticus</italic>; it is an interesting finding since flies could also be involved in the maintenance of DENV in nature (
