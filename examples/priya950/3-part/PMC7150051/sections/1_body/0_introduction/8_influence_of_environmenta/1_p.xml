 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> is known to be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and demographic factors such as urbanization (

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> is highly dependent on temperature and water availability (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Luz et al., 2008</xref>). The greenery index of vegetation canopy can be used as a substitute to indirectly know soil moisture at the surface level. The coverings of vegetation near ground level have been used to associate them with the larval development capacity in these sites (
