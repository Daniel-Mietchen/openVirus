<p id="p0045">The transmission cycle of arboviruses is considered complex due to the necessary interaction between the hosts and the vectors of the disease. The basic transmission cycle of arboviruses is through an adult mosquito that feeds on an infected host. The mosquito then transports the infective viral particles in their salivary glands and then, in a secondary feeding, transmits the virus to another susceptible host. For viral transmission to be successful, a competent vector is necessary. The competent vector is the ability of an insect to receive, transport, and transmit virus from one host to another. There are many factors that affect vector competition, such as temperature (

The vector capacity is determined by the density of vectors, the competition of the vector species, the ability to successfully feed on a viremic host, the incubation time necessary for an infectious vector to infect another host, and the survival rate (

This interaction between vectors, reservoirs, and hosts is what contributes to the existence and maintenance of arboviruses.
