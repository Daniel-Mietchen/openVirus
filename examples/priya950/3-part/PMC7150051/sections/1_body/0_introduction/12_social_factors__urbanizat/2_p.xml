<p id="p0095">The indiscriminate anthropic action within an ecosystem produces instability, which has caused, over the years, the emergence of several arboviruses and other viral diseases with the findings of new reservoirs. The abovementioned factors can be related to the following facts: between 1954 and 2006, the isolation of at least 196 different types of arboviruses was possible, of which 160 were isolated for the first time in the Brazilian Amazon with at least 100 new types for the world (

Of these, five are of great importance in terms of public health, as they are associated with epidemics, which are DENV, OROV (Bunyaviridae family), MAYV (Togaviridae family), Rocio virus, and YFV. DENVs and Rocio virus are associated with epidemics in urban areas, while MAYV and YFV are associated with human disease in wild areas (
