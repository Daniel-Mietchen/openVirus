<p id="p0105">Trips that have shortened the long distances in turn have contributed to the expansion of vectors to nonendemic areas, producing the appearance of epidemics in nonendemic areas. 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, since its introduction in Europe in 2004, has spread from northern Italy to many countries of the European Union (

 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, the first index case of an acute febrile syndrome was reported in a 7-year-old girl (patient 1), 1 day after returning from Rajasthan (India), serum was positive for CHIKV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 3 weeks later the index case, another girl appeared (patient 2), who experienced clinical symptoms similar to febrile syndrome, the patient had no history of travel to endemic areas of CHIKV and resided at 2.5Â km from the index case; the serum sample was positive for CHIKV. The doctor of patient 2 reported that another girl (patient 3), a close friend of patient 2, showed clinical symptoms compatible with CHIKV infection; patient 3 lived near patient 1 and on September 15, she was invited by patient 2 to her home; the two girls presented with numerous mosquito bites and the serum sample of patient 3 had high specific anti-CHIKV IgM titers and a weak signal by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Given that patients 2 and 3 did not report any recent travel to endemic areas of CHIKV; their clinical episodes were classified as autochthonous cases of CHIKV infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these viral strains belong to a group that is closely related to the strains of India; the CHIKV isolate of patient 2 could be derived from an Indian strain introduced by patient 1 (
