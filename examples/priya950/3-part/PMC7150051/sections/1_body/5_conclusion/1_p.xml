<p id="p0195">The ecoepidemiological studies are important for the solution of public health problems related to zoonotic diseases. The ecoepidemiological studies that involve biological, ecological, and geographical aspects related to the transmission cycle allow the development of adequate strategies for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases. The relationship between the emergence of infectious diseases and the climatic variations associated with human behavior and that of vectors is also important; this demonstrates the need to address public health problems from complex and multidisciplinary perspectives.</p>
