<p id="Par31">For the purposes of comparison, we calculated a general MIR for both species considering all the seasons studied (number of infected pools/total number of specimens for all the seasons analyzed x 1000), a MIR for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> only (number of infected pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>/total number of specimens analyzed for all seasons x 1000) and a MIR for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for each season with positive pools (number of infected pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>/total number of specimens analyzed for each season with positive pools x 1,000).
