<p id="Par26">To detect the presence of DENV, each pool was initially macerated in 1 mL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 6000 rpm. A volume of 140 μL of the supernatant from each pool and the commercial QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (250) (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) were used for RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To avoid non-specific amplification, we treated the viral RNA with amplification-grade DNase I (Invitrogen, California, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
