<p id="Par7">The green areas in municipal parks in the city of São Paulo are remnants of Atlantic Forest vegetation. These parks are used for recreation and provide habitats for several species of mosquitoes of medical importance, such as those of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> genera
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Previous studies performed in Piqueri Municipal Park, for example, reported a great abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, followed by 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes fluviatilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes scapularis</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex nigripalpu</italic>s and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, corroborating the findings of studies that showed that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is usually present in areas with vegetation cover

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Despite the body of knowledge on mosquito fauna in green areas in São Paulo, little is known about the pathogens circulating in these locations. Investigation into the occurrence of natural vertical transmission of DENV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations is therefore of critical importance for an understanding of the transmission dynamics of this virus and can provide a new outlook on the maintenance of this pathogen in urban green areas and its possible implications for public health.
