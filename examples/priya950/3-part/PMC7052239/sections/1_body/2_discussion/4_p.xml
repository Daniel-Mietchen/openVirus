 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>, indicating that despite the importance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for horizontal transmission this species may be less relevant in the maintenance of DENV during periods of low vector density
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. Our results corroborate these findings as we found positive 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> pools but no positive 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pools. Other hypothesis for the absence of positive pools of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in our study is related to the smaller number of specimens analyzed compared to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. In addition, green areas favor the presence and abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> when compared to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and not in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The presence of DENV-3 in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from Piqueri Municipal Park suggests that this mosquito may be acting in the transmission dynamics of DENV, thereby maintaining circulation of the arbovirus in this environment.
