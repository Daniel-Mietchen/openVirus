<p id="Par19">It is important to highlight that for natural vertical transmission to be detected under the conditions established in this study, an infected female had to have laid eggs in the ovitrap and successfully transmitted the virus vertically and the larvae had to have survived until adulthood to finally be analyzed. When mosquito infection rates are low, more specimens are required for a higher chance of virus detection. For example, for an infection rate of 1, a minimum of 1,609 and 2,301 mosquitoes are needed for an 80% and 90% chance of virus detection, respectively

Nevertheless, considering the difficulty in detecting this phenomenon in natural environments, the successful detection of natural vertical transmission of a serotype with no recent autochthonous cases in SÃ£o Paulo
