<p id="Par11">The two positive samples were sequenced, edited, aligned with each other and compared with GenBank sequences using BLAST. They had high degree of identity with DENV-3 serotype sequences from GenBank, as shown in the Neighbor Joining tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and only three differences in nucleotide sequence were found between the two samples. Both showed high identity with strains found in the city of Guarujá, SP, Brazil, and Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. The positive control sample, which was also sequenced and aligned with GenBank sequences, showed high identity with strains of completely different origin. The DENV-3 sequences found in this study and the positive control sequence were deposited in GenBank, respectively, under accession numbers (MN025404/MN025405/MN025406), as well as the data of the sequences used for construction of the Neighbor Joining tree are described in Supplementary Table
