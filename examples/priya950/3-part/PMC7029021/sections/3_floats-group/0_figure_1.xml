   <italic>In vivo competitive growth experiment</italic>. The BALB/c mouse model was used for the hMPV infection model, and each mouse was infected with 50 μl of virus at 1.0 × 10
   <sup>9</sup> copies/μl through the nose. There were 3 groups with different genotype A:B proportions: 50:50, 20:80, and 80:20. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 50:50. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 20:80. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 80:20. All the figures on the left show the ratio change in each passage post infection (Black represents genotype A, and Blank represents genotype B) and the figures on the right show the viral load of the two genotypes (Solid circles represent genotype A, and solid squares represent genotype B).
