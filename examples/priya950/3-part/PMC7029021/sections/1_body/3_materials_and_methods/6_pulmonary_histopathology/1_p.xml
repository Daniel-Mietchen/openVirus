<p id="Par31">Approximately 36 BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old, female) were divided into 6 groups: A, B, C, D, E, and F, 6 mice pre group. Five days after infection, the left lungs of BALB/c mice were removed and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned in 4 μm slices, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Four types of histopathological changes were scored for each section: peri bronchiolitis (inflammatory cells in the surrounding bronchiole), perivasculitis (inflammatory cells in the surrounding blood vessel), interstitial pneumonitis (increased thickness of the alveolar walls associated with inflammatory cells), and alveolitis (inflammatory cells within alveolar spaces). Each histopathological change was scored based on a numerical score ranging from 0–26

 </sup>. The final score for each animal (ranging from 0–26) was obtained by averaging the scores for each lung, which were calculated by the addition of the subscores obtained from the assessment of the quantity and quality of the peribronchiolar and peribronchial infiltrates, luminal exudates, and perivascular infiltrates
