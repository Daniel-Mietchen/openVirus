<p id="Par34">We used direct and clone-sequencing methods to verify the real-time PCR results when detecting mixed infections of two hMPV genotypes. The amplified products were analysed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (EB), and the sizes of the amplified fragments were compared with those of standard molecular weight markers. To validate the amplification process and to exclude the presence of carryover contamination, positive and negative controls were included in each PCR. The amplified fragments were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). The sequences were determined using an ABI Prism 3730 XL automated capillary DNA sequencer located at the company of Sangon (Shanghai, China).</p>
