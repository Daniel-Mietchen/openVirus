 <italic>in vitro</italic> competitive growth experiments were performed with conventional Vero E6 cells. Cells in 6-well plates were inoculated with viruses at the same MOI (MOI = 50). NL/1/00, NL/1/99 and mixed virus strains of five different proportions were inoculated into six wells along with a negative control (non-infection). Then, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the virus to attach. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any unattached infectious virus particles and then overlaid with 1 ml of maintenance medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. When the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was 70%, all supernatants and plates were harvested and stored at −80 °C. One millilitre of viral media was harvested at each passage, and the supernatant was passaged into fresh Vero-E6 cells. Then, 200 μl of RNA extract was added, and the remaining volume was maintained at −80 °C. This method was used for each passage and was continued for 12 passages. After each passage, we changed the medium and harvested the supernatant for testing. All tests were performed in triplicate, and six-well plates were used.
