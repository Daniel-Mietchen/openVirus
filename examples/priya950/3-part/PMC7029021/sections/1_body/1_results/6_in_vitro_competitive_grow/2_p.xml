<p id="Par15">First, the input ratio of the two genotypes was adjusted to 50:50. Genotype A predominated (99.08%) during the 1st passage, which was followed by a decrease in the 3rd passage, while genotype B was predominant (85.68%) in 3rd passage (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). Interestingly, after the 3rd passage, the proportion of genotype A gradually increased from 14.32% (passage 3, P3) to 35.67% (P5) to 98.07% (P6) and then finally to 99.98% (P8) until B could not be detected. Competition replication of this group was from type A to B and genotype A become the predominant strain in the end.
