<p id="Par14">Vero-E6 cell lines were used for the hMPV competitive experiment 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the same multiplicity of infection (MOI = 50) was used for all infection groups. There were 5 mixed groups with genotype A:B proportions of 50:50, 20:80, 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10. The cells were passaged every 4 days. The competitive experiment was terminated when one of the genotypes could not be detected for at least three passages.
