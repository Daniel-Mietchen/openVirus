<p id="Par17">The proportion of subtype infection (genotype A:B as 20:80, 10:100) was controlled to make B subtype dominant in the firstly passage. In genotype A:B = 20:80 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). During the 1st passage, the proportion of genotype A rose to 34.49% but then decreased to 4.56% (P3). At the same time, the number of viral copies was maintained at approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>. Then, the proportion of genotype A increased to 83.03% at P5 and then further increased to 99.32% (P6) and 99.98% (P8). After P9, genotype B could no longer be detected at any copy number. In genotype A:B = 10:100 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), even when the proportion of genotype A was only one-tenth of that of B, the result was the same: the proportion of genotype A increased, decreased and increased again until we could not detect genotype B (P9). Even in the two groups with a high proportion of subtypes B, there will be a competition and alternation phenomenon first and finally genotype A will reverse to become the dominant strain.
