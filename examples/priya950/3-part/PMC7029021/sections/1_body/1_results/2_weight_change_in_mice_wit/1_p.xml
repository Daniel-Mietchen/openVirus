<p id="Par9">BALB/c mice were infected with 50 μl of hMPV virus (1.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies/ml) and were observed daily to measure their weight loss. Starting 1 dpi (days post infection, dpi), the mice began to have ruffled hair that persisted until 6 dpi. Breathing problems appeared 1 to 6 dpi, as well as a slight decrease in physical activity and a tendency to huddle. Significant weight loss appeared 4 dpi (P &lt; 0.05). In the control group, neither weight loss nor respiratory symptoms were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences after 20 days of infection between the groups (in the genotype A alone, genotype B alone and 3 mixed genotype groups) (P &gt; 0.05). Differences only appeared in the infection and control groups on the 2nd day after infection.
