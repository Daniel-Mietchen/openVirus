<p id="Par25">In summary, we found and verified that the competition between A and B subtypes exists and this competition may relate to the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through cell and animal experiments. Regardless of the proportions of genotypes A and B, there will be a subtype become predominant strain in the end. Subtype A predominant

 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, and the genotype alternation observed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. There were no statistically significant differences in the severity of disease caused by the two hMPV genotypes, and the severity of disease caused by mixed infection was not worse than that caused by single genotype infection. Our results may improve the understanding of the alternation of the prevalence of hMPV genotypes; perhaps this is a strategy involving genetic structure changes that is used by the virus to seasonally maintain infection rates. This study of hMPV affords us the possibility of another explanation of the hMPV alternation epidemic besides the cause of immunity, environment and climate, and it also provides experimental evidence useful for disease control and vaccine development.
