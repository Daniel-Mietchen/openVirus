<p id="Par19">Much evidence has been gathered about the alternation of genotypes A and B. Agapov. E proposed for the first time between 2002 to 2004, the predominant circulating genotype shifted from A to B in the USA

 </sup>. A similar alternation was also observed in Malaysia from 2010 to 2012, during which the genotype shifted from A2b to B1 and then to A2a
 <sup>

 </sup>. The predominant genotype was B1 in 2004–2005, which was followed by a shift to the A2 genotype in 2006 in southeastern Brazil

 </sup>. We also have found some reports regarding the phenomenon of subtype A/B alternation in China. Zhang C 
 <italic>et al</italic>. observed a shift from the A2b, A1 and B1 genotypes (2008 to 2009) to the A2b genotype (2009–2011) in Chongqing

 </sup>. These observations were consistent with those made in Beijing, which indicated that A2, B1 and B2 co-circulated, and A2 was the most prevalent genotype from 2008 to 2010
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. The most prevalent genotype was A in 2008–2009, which shifted to B in 2010–2011 and then shifted back to A in 2012–2013 in Wuhan
