<p id="Par4">Epidemiological surveys conducted in many countries, such as China, the USA, France, Australia, Italy, Korea, Brazil, and India, have indicated that strains from both major hMPV groups co-circulate within the same community and that the predominant subgroup shifts progressively from one group to another. Many epidemiological studies have found that A/B genotyping indicated a change in the predominant viral genotype over one to three years
