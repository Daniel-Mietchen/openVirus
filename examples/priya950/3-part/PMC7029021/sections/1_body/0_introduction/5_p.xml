<p id="Par6">This study confirmed that there was a competitive replication between genotype A and genotype B. In animal experiment, subtype B became the predominant strain, but the clinical symptoms caused by type B were not more severe than non-predominant or mixed strain. In cell experiment, type A and B alternately predominated at the first four generations, and A became the predominant strain eventually. This research could offer a new opinion to study alternation of genotype prevalence. Our findings provide important information for treatment research, vaccine development, prevention strategies, and the monitoring of outbreaks of hMPV infection.</p>
