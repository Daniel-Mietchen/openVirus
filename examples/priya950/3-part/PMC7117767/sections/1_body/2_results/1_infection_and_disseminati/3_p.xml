<p>For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, no significant variation was found for infection rate (IR) and disseminated infection rate (DIR) at 14 dpe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Meanwhile, at 21 dpe, DIR varied significantly (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) from 76% to 90% according to the population origin; however, no significant variation was reported for IR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Pairwise comparisons for DIR revealed significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.04) between Bénoué population and all other populations tested except Douala and Yaoundé urban populations. Overall, while IR were similar (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.107) for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (94 and 90%) and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (88 and 82%) when tested at 14 or 21 dpe, respectively, DIR was significantly higher (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.009) in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (91% and 88.4%) than in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (69 and 73%) when tested at 14 or 21 dpe, respectively.
