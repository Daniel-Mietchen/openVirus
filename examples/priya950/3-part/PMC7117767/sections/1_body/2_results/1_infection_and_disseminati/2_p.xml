<p>When tested at 14 dpe, both the Douala and Brazzaville populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were highly susceptible to infection and dissemination with ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and at 21 dpe, all four populations were susceptible. However, the Douala (96%) population was significantly more susceptible (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) than the one from Tibati (63%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Dissemination rates ranged from 55% for Yaoundé to 89% for Brazzaville populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), but these rates were not significantly different (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11).
