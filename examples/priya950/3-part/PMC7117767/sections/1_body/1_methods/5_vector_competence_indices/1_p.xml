<p>For each mosquito examined, body (abdomen and thorax), and head were tested respectively for infection and dissemination rates at 14 and 21 days post-exposure (dpe). For this purpose, each part was ground individually in 300 μL of DMEM medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 2% fetal serum bovine (FBS), and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was processed for viral titration as described below. Saliva was collected from individual mosquitoes using techniques of forced salivation as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, mosquitoes were cool anesthetized, wings and legs of each mosquito were removed, and the proboscis inserted into a plastic pipette tip of 20 μL containing 5 μL of FBS. After 30 minutes, FBS containing saliva was mixed with 45 μL of DMEM for titration.
