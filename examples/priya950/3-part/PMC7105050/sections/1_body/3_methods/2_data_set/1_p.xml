<p>Reported information on laboratory-confirmed cases in ICUs included the following: influenza virus type; subtype (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2)) and lineage (B/Victoria, B/Yamagata); age (year); sex; duration of hospitalization (time between admission to hospital and either discharge or death); complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], bronchitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, sepsis, other); vaccination status (not vaccinated, pandemic, seasonal, or both vaccines); date of vaccination; respiratory support (not required, ventilation or oxygen support); and outcome (deceased or alive). Due to limited data reported on B-lineage, specific analysis in relation to B lineages was not feasible. The following underlying conditions were reported: asthma, cancer, chronic heart, kidney, liver or lung disease, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/other immune deficiency, neurocognitive and neuromuscular disorders, pregnancy, obesity, and morbid obesity. Countries were also able to report additional other underlying conditions in a free text field, and those covered a mix of various different genetic and acquired conditions as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, etc. Asthma and lung disease were pooled as chronic lung condition. Morbid obesity and obesity were pooled because analyzing them separately did not show any differences. Information about the date of vaccination and vaccine type was very limited. A full overview of reported data by country is available in
