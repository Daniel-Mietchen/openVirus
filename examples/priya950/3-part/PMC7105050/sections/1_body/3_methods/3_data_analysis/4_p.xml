<p>We performed a descriptive analysis of the pooled data across seasons and reporting countries. Descriptive statistics included absolute and relative frequencies of each study variable. Continuous variables were compared by using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann-Whitney test, and Studentâ€™s 
 <italic>t</italic> test. We applied different statistical models according to Barros et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as a sensitivity analysis to identify the best possible method. Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to identify statistically significant determinants of fatal outcome. The use of robust variance intended to improve the variance estimation to adjust for dispersion of the data by reducing the effect of outliers. Crude and adjusted risk ratios (incidence rate ratio [IRR]) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. The reporting country was included in the final model to adjust for country effects. A second model was developed based on the subset of the basic dataset that included cases with known underlying conditions and influenza A virus subtype (A(H3N2) or A(H1N1)pdm09) or B type. The significance level was set at 0.05. Stata 14 (StataCorp) was used for the statistical analysis.
