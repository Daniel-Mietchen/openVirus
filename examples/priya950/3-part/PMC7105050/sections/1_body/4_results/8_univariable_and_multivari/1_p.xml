<p>In the basic model including cases with known gender, age, and influenza virus type, the determinants associated with fatal outcome in the univariable analysis were male sex, age of 40 years and older, and infection with influenza A virus (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The risk for fatal outcome increased by 1.5% with each year of age (IRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02), using age as continuous variable. In the multivariable model, influenza A virus infection and older age (≥40 years) were significantly associated with mortality. The highest risk ratio was identified in people of 80 years of age and older.
