<p>The univariable analysis of cases with detailed information about influenza A virus subtype and underlying conditions again identified being male and 40 years or older as determinants of fatal outcome (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cancer, heart, liver, and kidney disease, HIV infection/other immune deficiencies as well as other underlying conditions were identified as risk factors for fatal outcome, whereas patients of younger age and with chronic lung disease were less likely to die. In the multivariable model, age 60 years and older, cancer, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, as well as HIV infection/other immune deficiency and other underlying conditions were confirmed as determinants of fatal outcome. In addition, infection either with A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) virus was retained.
