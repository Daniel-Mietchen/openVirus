<p>Most influenza viruses (11 809; 88%) were type A: 5223 (44%) were subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09, 1975 (17%) were subtyped as A(H3N2), and 4611 (39%) were reported without subtype. In all seasons, there were more influenza A viruses (&gt;60% of viruses) compared with B viruses among ICU cases. In seasons with higher proportions of A(H3N2) detections, the proportion of unsubtyped A viruses was also higher than in seasons with A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance. The proportion of influenza B virus cases was greater than 20% in both the 2012/2013 and 2015/2016 season. The highest proportion of B viruses (20%) was observed in those aged less than 20 years.</p>
