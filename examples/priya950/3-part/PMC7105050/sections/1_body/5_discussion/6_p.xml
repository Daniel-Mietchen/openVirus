<p>Others identified an association between pre-existing lung, neuromuscular or neurocognitive disease, or obesity and fatal outcome in hospitalized patients; however, this was not seen among ICU patients in this analysis [

 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although approximately 3% of all our cases were pregnant women, our findings did not show any increased risk for fatal outcome when admitted to ICU and confirm findings of others [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Pregnancy, chronic lung disease, and obesity may increase the risk for hospitalization and ICU admission, rather than fatal outcome. It can be speculated that early hospitalization, early onset of treatment, and transfer to ICU as a precaution in these patientsâ€™ populations may prevent severe disease progression. The earlier identification of these conditions as risk factors might have contributed to increased awareness and better clinical care preventing fatal outcomes.
