<p>Our analysis supports previous findings that HIV infection/other immune deficiency, cancer, heart, kidney, and liver disease increase the likelihood of fatal outcomes as do increasing age over 40 years and influenza A infection [

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

Recommendations for persons with the following chronic medical conditions vary across countries: respiratory (pulmonary), cardiovascular, chronic neurological, hepatic and renal disease, immunosuppression, metabolic disorders, HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and morbid obesity [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our analysis showed that HIV infection/other immunosuppressive disorders are associated with an increased risk of death; however, no specific information on “other immune deficiencies” was provided. People with HIV infection are known to be at greater risk of dying from influenza and its complications due to their susceptibility to infection, and they are specifically targeted by Member State vaccination programs [

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34–36</xref>]. With the constant number of approximately 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections each year and over 500 000 estimated people with HIV in EU/EEA countries, influenza vaccines as well as early antiviral treatment should be offered to them as a priority group [
