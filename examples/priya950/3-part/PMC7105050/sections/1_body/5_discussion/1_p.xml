<p>This is the first published analysis of confirmed influenza ICU cases reported from 12 EU countries over 8 consecutive seasons. Confining the analysis to ICU cases was intended to improve data comparability across countries, although criteria for ICU admission might not have been uniform across countries and hospitals. We confirmed several known determinants contributing to a greater risk of fatal outcome. In addition, the association between sepsis as a clinical complication and an increased risk of death underlines the clinical impact of early treatment and care in these severely ill patients. No information was available on why some patients admitted to ICU did not receive respiratory support, ie, the information was missing or not reported: either such patients had been transferred to ICU for precautionary reasons, there was missing case information, or data were not reported. In addition, no information on timing of complications in relation to ICU admission was available within this dataset as well as on other complications such as secondary bacterial infections or related treatment.</p>
