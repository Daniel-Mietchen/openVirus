<p id="p0150">The global burden of morbidity and mortality associated with RSV disease in infants is substantial, particularly in low and low-middle income countries. Maternal immunization is a feasible strategy that has the potential to significantly reduce the impact of RSV disease in young infants worldwide. Vaccines for maternal immunization are in active preclinical and clinical development, with encouraging results. Ongoing research and implementation planning activities support the concept of RSV prevention through maternal immunization and the possibility to achieve tangible progress in the control of RSV disease in young infants in the near future.</p>
