<p id="p0070">The development of vaccines for the prevention of RSV has been ongoing since its initial isolation in infants with severe LRTI in the 1960s. The first vaccine evaluated in a clinical trial in infants was a formalin-inactivated vaccine, which resulted in inadequate neutralizing antibody responses and augmentation of disease after subsequent wild-type infection in vaccine recipients

This experience led to the careful consideration of the potential strategies for RSV prevention and the development of various RSV vaccine candidates which are currently undergoing evaluation, that include live attenuated and chimeric vaccines, subunit vaccines, particle based vaccines, including virus-like particle and nanoparticles, nucleic acid and recombinant vector vaccines. While no vaccine is yet licensed for the prevention of RSV, there are more than 20 vaccines candidates in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, targeting specific populations at risk, including infants and young children, the elderly, and pregnant women who would receive vaccines to protect their newborns against severe RSV disease (

Vaccines specifically tailored for each of these populations are necessary to establish an effective multi-prong approach to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in young children. For example, live attenuated RSV vaccines may be administered directly into the nasal mucosa in young children to induce a robust local and systemic immune response, given that responses to vaccination under 6 months of age may be limited by interference from maternal antibody and overall lower immunogenicity, requiring repeated doses of vaccines before lasting protection can be achieved 
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. A particular challenge is that infants with low RSV antibody concentrations are at greater risk to acquire infection earlier in life, and natural RSV infection does not confer long lasting immunity, therefore reinfections in childhood and through life are common. Furthermore, the highest morbidity and mortality from RSV in both healthy term infants and those with underlying conditions that increase the risk for complications, such as prematurity and cardiopulmonary disease, occur in the first 3–6 months of life, too early for active immunization to be effective. Consequently, passive antibody administration has been the major strategy for RSV prevention in high-risk infants until now. However, passive immunization is limited by the need to restrict this costly intervention to the groups with highest risk, leaving the majority of infants, those born at term, susceptible to RSV infection and its complications.
