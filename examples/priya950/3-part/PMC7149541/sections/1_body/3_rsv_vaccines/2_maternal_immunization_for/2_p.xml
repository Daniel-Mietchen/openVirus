<p id="p0115">The goals of a maternal immunization program for the prevention of RSV in infants include the prevention of infant death and hospitalization, the prevention and/or reduction of severe RSV LRTI, and the delay in the onset of the first episode of RSV infection. This delay in onset is important given that infants may be more capable to resist and overcome the initial RSV illness when it occurs later in the first or even second year of life. Indirect benefits from breastmilk antibodies prolonging the duration of protection of transplacentally derived antibodies, and reduction of household transmission of infection through maternal and infant protection have been documented
