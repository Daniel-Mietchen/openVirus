<p id="p0130">A purified recombinant pre-F protein vaccine prepared in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] Investigational Vaccines) 
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, has been evaluated in approximately 600 non-pregnant women to assess the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of various dosages of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations. All formulations of this vaccine boosted pre-existing antibodies in these 19–45 year old women, with comparable immunogenicity, and the safety profile was similar to that of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, which is administered routinely during pregnancy in the US and various countries 
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. This vaccine construct is planned to be evaluated in pregnant women in a global phase I/II study expected to begin in 2019–20.
