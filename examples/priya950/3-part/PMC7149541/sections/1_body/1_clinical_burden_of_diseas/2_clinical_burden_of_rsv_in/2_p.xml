A recent prospective longitudinal community based study conducted in Houston, Texas, provides additional information regarding the epidemiology of RSV and other respiratory viruses in healthy pregnant women receiving prenatal care at a community obstetrical clinic 
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This study evaluated both symptomatic and asymptomatic women in an obstetric population that reflected the contemporary make-up of pregnant women in the US, with a median age of 31Â years and a broad representation of racial and ethnic backgrounds. The most significant finding in the Houston study was that over one-third of women with acute respiratory symptoms had disease consistent with LRTI, which the authors defined as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis. Morbidity was associated with multiple respiratory viruses including RSV, with considerable symptoms noted for all viruses. Common viruses detected in this study included rhinovirus (27%), coronavirus (17%), and RSV. The overall attack rate of RSV among ambulatory pregnant women in this population was 10% based on laboratory-confirmed RSV infection documented by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory secretions, and up to 13% when serologic diagnosis was added
