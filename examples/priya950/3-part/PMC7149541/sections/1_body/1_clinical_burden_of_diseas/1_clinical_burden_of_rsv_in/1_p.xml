<p id="p0015">Respiratory syncytial virus is the primary cause of viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants worldwide. RSV is associated with high rates of hospitalization, particularly in infants less than 6Â months of age 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, with an estimated global burden of 33 million infections and 60,000 deaths annually in children under five 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the United States (US) and many industrialized countries, RSV is the most common infection resulting in hospital admission among infants

 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In temperate climates, RSV produces annual midwinter epidemics clinically characterized by bronchiolitis in infants. RSV outbreaks are less clearly delineated in tropical areas, where year-round infection may occur with or without epidemics 
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. An estimated 99% of deaths due to RSV in children occur in resource-limited settings, making the prevention of RSV-associated mortality in regions of the world with limited access to health care a high priority
