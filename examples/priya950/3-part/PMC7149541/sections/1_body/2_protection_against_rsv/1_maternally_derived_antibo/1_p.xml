<p id="p0045">RSV was first identified by Chanock in 1957 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and identified as a pathogen in young infants several years later 
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Reasons for disease predilection in young children have been studied since that time, and the impact of maternal antibody on the subsequent development of RSV disease in young children has been under investigation for years. Originally, concern for potential augmentation of RSV disease in the presence of maternally-derived antibody in young infants was considered a possibility, but subsequent studies utilizing different study designs and laboratory analysis of RSV-specific antibodies dispelled that theory, and actually demonstrated that infants with RSV disease have a 2–4-lower concentration of RSV-specific antibodies compared to infants with no disease

 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In a landmark study conducted by Glezen et al. in Houston, Texas, RSV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies were shown to be efficiently transferred from the mother to the newborn and high levels of neutralizing antibodies acquired transplacentally by the neonate protected the infant against LRTI during the first few months of life 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A later study from Denmark calculated a 26% reduction in hospitalization during the first 6 months of life for every two-fold increase in cord blood neutralizing antibody 
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Efficient transplacental transfer of maternal RSV antibody has been demonstrated in multiple studies in industrialized countries as well as in Africa and Asia

 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In healthy full-term maternal/cord blood pairs, maternal: cord RSV-specific antibody ratios in these studies demonstrated more antibody in infants than in the mothers, with transplacental transfer ratios in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated women to be approximately 1.02–1.03

 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The decline of virus-specific immunity provided by maternal RSV antibodies closely mirrors the half-life of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) (approximately 30–40 days), the principal IgG subclass antibody to RSV that is transplacentally transferred in preterm and term neonates. Currently, both human and animal data from mice, cotton rats, lambs, calves, and non-human primates support serum neutralizing antibody as a good correlate of immunity against RSV disease of the lower respiratory tract but not necessarily of the upper respiratory tract. Standardization of RSV neutralization assays and work toward developing an international standard are underway
