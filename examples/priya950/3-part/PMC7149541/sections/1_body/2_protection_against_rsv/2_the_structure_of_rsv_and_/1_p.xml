<p id="p0050">RSV is a member of the genus pneumovirus, one of two Paramixoviruses in this group, with human metapneumovirus, and has two antigenically distinct subgroups, RSV-A and RSV-B. RSV has a negative sense non-segmented RNA genome that encodes 11 proteins (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Two glycoproteins in the virion membrane, the fusion (F) and attachment or binding (G) proteins, carry the antigenic determinants that elicit neutralizing antibodies against RSV (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While immunity against RSV relies primarily on the development of neutralizing antibodies to these surface proteins, non-neutralizing antibodies to the F, G and Small Hydrophobic (SH) surface proteins can inhibit infection by complement mediated neutralization or antibody dependent cell mediated toxicity, and all viral antigens can induce protection by T cell mediated immunity. Given that the F-protein plays a critical role in viral entry to the host cell, and that it is highly conserved within RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes, it is the preferred target of RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. The F-protein contains 6 antigenic sites that elicit the production of more than 90% of the high potency neutralizing antibodies against RSV. The F-protein presents two structural conformations, a pre-fusion (pre-F) and a post-fusion (post-F) form, in the course of infecting host cells. Antibodies directed to antigenic sites present in the pre-F conformation are more efficient at neutralizing RSV than those directed to antigenic sites present in the more stable post-F confirmation. Although it contains a central conserved domain available for neutralizing antibody binding, the G-protein is not a primary target for vaccine development because it is mostly covered in glycans, and it is not as well conserved within RSV types as the F-protein
