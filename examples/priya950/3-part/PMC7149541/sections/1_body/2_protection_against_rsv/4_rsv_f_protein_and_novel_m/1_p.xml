<p id="p0060">Major advances in the understanding of the structure and function of the highly conserved RSV F-protein, the target of most antibodies and current vaccine candidates, have been made this century. For example, it is known that activation of the RSV F-protein from the pre-fusion state to the post-fusion state requires a structural change 
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This conformational change exposes various antigenic sites, which each elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies that vary in potency depending on the site. The RSV F-protein has been crystallized and its pre-fusion form stabilized 
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. A substantial proportion of the neutralizing antibody response to RSV has been shown to be directed against the pre-fusion conformation of the F protein. Pre-F antibody has been postulated to serve as a more accurate correlate of protection allowing for the identification of novel antigenic sites that may serve as potential antigens for monoclonal antibody or vaccine development
