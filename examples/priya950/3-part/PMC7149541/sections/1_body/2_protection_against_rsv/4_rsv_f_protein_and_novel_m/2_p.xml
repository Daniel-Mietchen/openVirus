<p id="p0065">Next generation RSV F-protein monoclonal antibodies that target antigenic sites on the pre-fusion protein that have enhanced neutralizing activity are under active study. Motavizumab (MedImmune), a derivative of Palivizumab with higher affinity and a longer half-life, was effective in reducing RSV hospitalization in high-risk full-term infants in the US, but was not licensed due to safety concerns (allergic reactions)

Another monoclonal antibody product, Suptavumab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY) failed to meet the primary outcome of preventing medically attended RSV infection in preterm infants born at &gt; 29 weeks of gestation in a 2017 Phase III infant clinical trial (

A novel investigational monoclonal antibody, MEDI8897 (MedImmune and AztraZeneca LLC), is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that targets the pre-fusion conformation of the RSV F-protein 
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This monoclonal antibody binds a highly conserved epitope on RSV F and neutralizes a diverse group of RSV A and B strains with over 50-fold higher activity than Palivizumab. MEDI8897 has an extended half-life compared to Palivizumab due to mutations in the Fc-domain (YTE). This antibody has been studied for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in adults and healthy preterm infants
