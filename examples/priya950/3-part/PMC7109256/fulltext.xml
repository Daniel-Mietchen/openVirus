Factor H, as an inhibitor of the alternative pathway, down-regulates complement activation on the host cell surface. Locally synthesized factor H at the site of infection/injury, including lungs, can act as a pattern recognition molecule without involving complement activation. Here, we report that factor H, a sialic acid binder, interacts with influenza A virus (IAV) and modulates IAV entry, as evident from down-regulation of matrix protein 1 (M1) in H1N1 subtype-infected cells and up-regulation of M1 expression in H3N2-infected A549 cells. Far-western blot revealed that factor H binds hemagglutinin (HA, ~70 kDa), neuraminidase (NA, ~60 kDa), and M1 (~25 kDa). IAV-induced transcriptional levels of IFN-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, IL-6, IFN-&#x003b1;, and RANTES were reduced following factor H treatment for the H1N1 subtype at 6 h post-infection. However, for the H3N2 subtype, mRNA levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines were enhanced. A recombinant form of vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP), which like factor H, contains CCP modules and has complement-regulatory activity, mirrored the results obtained with factor H. Both factor H (25%), and VCP (45%) were found to reduce luciferase reporter activity in MDCK cells transduced with H1N1 pseudotyped lentiviral particles. Factor H (50%) and VCP (30%) enhanced the luciferase reporter activity for H3N2, suggesting an entry inhibitory role of factor H and VCP against H1N1, but not H3N2. Thus, factor H can modulate IAV infection and inflammatory responses, independent of its complement-related functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>complement</kwd><kwd>factor H</kwd><kwd>vaccinia virus complement control protein</kwd><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>pseudotyped lentiviral particles</kwd><kwd>cytokine storm</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="72"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9952"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a severe respiratory pathogens, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family and responsible for outbreaks with high morbidity, and mortality in both humans and animals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). IAV exhibits antigenic variations within viral surface glycoproteins, including hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). HA is the most important viral glycoprotein that can bind to sialic acid on host cells, enabling cellular fusion and viral entry (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). HA epitopes are also known to trigger synthesis of neutralizing antibodies by B cells, allowing IAV to escape from immune surveillance, leading to seasonal epidemics (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). NA cleaves sialic acid moieties, which enables release of virions, and promotes IAV dispersion (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). There are around 16 antigenic variants of HA and 9 of NA, which are found in numerous combinations and subtypes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Among all subtypes of IAV, H1N1 and H3N2 are the predominant IAV subtypes for seasonal flu in humans, with annual epidemics estimated to result in ~5 million cases of severe illness and half a million respiratory deaths (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Current circulating human IAV strains are likely to continue acquiring mutations resulting in antigenic drift and shift of HA and NA glycoproteins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), which enhance the virus' ability to evade host immune system, promoting rapid viral invasion and replication.</p><p>Airway and alveolar epithelial cells are the primary targets for IAV, which uses sialic acid as receptors, causing damage to the alveolar epithelium (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Individuals infected with IAV may become susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Lung epithelial cells express mucin glycoproteins, such as MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC1, which play an important role in restricting IAV infectivity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These mucins are rich in sialic acid, serve as viral receptors, and restrict viral binding to the target cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, NA can attenuate the biological activity of these mucins (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The D151G mutation is a well-known mutation in NA glycoprotein, which is responsible for its interaction with human &#x003b1;2-6 and avian &#x003b1;2-3 linked sialic acid, mediating the H3N2 viral association with sialic acid receptors. However, this mutation is reported to reduce the enzymatic action of NA that is required for HA detachment from its receptors (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Early defense against invading IAV by the innate immune system is crucial in limiting viral replication and invasion. The complement system, a major humoral wing of innate immunity, offers a crucial protective mechanism against IAV infection (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This includes neutralization, aggregation, opsonization and lysis of viral particles, and induction of phagocytosis via complement receptors (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have established the protective role of the complement system against IAV (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In the alternative pathway of the complement system, factor H is an important negative regulator that interacts with negatively charged surfaces containing sialic acids and glycosaminoglycans, and protects cellular structures from C3 convertase formation, hence diminishing complement activation. Factor H is a soluble, 155 kDa glycoprotein present at a concentration of 128&#x02013;654 &#x003bc;g/ml in human plasma (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) modules with different ligand binding properties. There is plenty of evidence of the local extrahepatic synthesis of factor H [reviewed in (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)]. Factor H binds to many pathogens via charge interactions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and for pathogens, surface-bound factor H may be of benefit for their survival. Factor H binds to sialic acids on <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and the outer surface of OspE of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, providing complement resistance to these pathogenic microbes. Its interaction with soluble West Nile virus NS1 protein has also been described (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> binds factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) to prevent complement-mediated lysis in the mosquito midgut via the plasmodial transmembrane gliding-associated protein 50 (GAP50) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Factor H can also bind to the surface of mycobacteria, restrict their uptake by macrophages, and modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine responses (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Viruses employ diverse strategies to protect their viral lipid envelopes from complement lysis by encoding or recruiting complement inhibitors, with structural and functional similarities to complement control proteins (CCP). Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) is a well-known complement inhibitor, secreted by vaccinia virus infected cells. VCP has inhibitory activity for both classical and alternative pathways (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Further examples of viral regulation of complement includes binding of West Nile virus non-structural protein (NS1) to factor H, or association of Nipah virions with factor I, thus restricting complement activation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In addition, NS1 serves as a key inhibitor of innate immunity as it blocks the synthesis and signaling of type 1 interferons (IFNs) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). NS1 also induces apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells during IAV infection via caspase-dependent mechanisms (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Since factor H can bind to sialic acids, a natural ligand for IAV, it is of interest to examine potential influence of factor H in competitively inhibiting IAV interaction with host cell surfaces. This study was designed to investigate the complement independent functions of factor H in the regulation of IAV infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we report the ability of human factor H and recombinant VCP to act as entry inhibitors of IAV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Viruses and Reagents</title><p>The IAV subtypes used in this study, including the pH1N1 (A/England/2009) and H3N2 (A/HK/1999), were provided by Wendy Barclay (Imperial College, London) and Leo Poon (University of Hong Kong), respectively.

The purity of the eluted protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE; the molecular weight of factor H was evident at ~155 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recombinant VCP appeared pure and migrated at ~35 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Guinea pig RBCs were used to determine if addition of factor H would inhibit hemagglutination by IAV subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Five IAV strains of H3N2 or H1N1 subtypes were tested. The basic principle of this assay relies on the specific feature of envelope viral glycoproteins that can interact with sialic acid on RBCs. In the absence of viral particles, RBCs sedimented under gravity, forming a distinct red halo at the bottom of the microtiter well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, in the presence of viral particles, glycoproteins of virus (HA or NA in this case) interact and bind with sialic acid on RBCs, forming clumps, leading to a lattice formation, where RBCs remain in suspension. Factor H partially inhibited the hemagglutination of IAV strains. Low concentration of factor H (2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) was more potent in inhibiting hemagglutination of H1N1 than H3N2 strains. Hemagglutination of all strains was effective using 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of factor H. It is possible that factor H binds to the IAV particles, restricting the binding of virus to RBCs, allowing them to form a halo at the bottom of the wells. PBS alone, in the absence of IAV particles, led to the formation of a halo at the bottom of the microtiter well, suggesting no hemagglutination.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE analysis of complement factor H purified from human plasma <bold>(A)</bold>, and a recombinant form of vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) expressed in HEK 293FT cells <bold>(B)</bold>.

We also examined, for the first time, the likely interaction between IAV and VCP, which contains CCP modules (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) like human factor H. A/England/2009 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/1999 (H3N2) strains were used in this study.

VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus was used as a negative control, which did not show any binding with either factor H or VCP. The ability of factor H and VCP to interfere with IAV binding to A549 cells was then assessed via the cell binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). An increase of IAV binding in presence of factor H and VCP was seen at the concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml for both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes, and the binding occurred in a dose and calcium dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that factor H and VCP enhance binding of IAV to target cells, which in turn interferes with viral infection in a complement-independent manner. The binding of factor H and VCP was more effective in the case of H1N1 than H3N2.

A number of bacteria can recruit factor H via the presentation of specific binding proteins, including factor H binding proteins (fHbp) of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), CspA and outer surface protein E of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), staphylococcal binder of IgG from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and pneumococcal surface protein C of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The factor H ligands, expressed by pathogens, are structurally distinct from each other, but they share the related binding site on factor H that can be localized on a common site of the CCP20 module (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). These interactions increase the binding ability of CCP 19-20 modules to C3b, resulting in a stable complex between factor H, C3b and microbial targets, with an enhanced co-factor activity. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> express sialic acid on their surfaces, which reduces complement deposition via probable factor H recruitment. Sialic acid also recruits siglec-7/9 leading to immune escape (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In addition, factor H binds to ApoE on High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) via CCP 5-7 modules, and is used by the bacteria to mimic the plasma HDL to increase their survival in the blood (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the complement-independent function of factor H in the regulation of IAV infection. Since VCP is an efficient complement inhibitor and a homolog of factor H (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we included it in the present study. VCP is a ~35 kDa secretory protein of vaccinia virus, encoded by the C3L open reading frame (ORF), and contains four CCP modules (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). VCP has been shown to inhibit complement lysis of sheep RBCs, by binding to C3b and C4b (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and serves as a cofactor in the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Additionally, VCP has been shown to inhibit formation of C3 convertase and accelerate the decay of the alternative pathway (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In the present study, a direct and complement independent interaction of factor H and VCP with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes were examined via hemagglutination assay, ELISA, cell binding, and far western blotting. In the hemagglutination assay, factor H inhibited hemagglutination of both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes; 10 &#x003bc;g/ml being the most effective with H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes.</p><p>VCP 4 modules contain a heparin binding site, as does factor H (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It is possible that in a manner similar to factor H (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), the heparin binding site found within the VCP protein enhances its decay-accelerating action against C3 convertase. SRBCs have high surface sialic acid. Factor H binds to this and protects them from the complement alternative pathway. On removal of the sialic acid with neuraminidase, SRBCs become susceptible to complement lysis. However, other studies suggest that the decay activity rate of VCP does not reduce following neuraminidase-treatment of SRBCs (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), indicating a difference in reaction with sialic acids. Furthermore, a weaker decay rate was seen with CCP 2&#x02013;4 mutants of VCP. Factor H and VCP seem to bind H1N1 and H3N2 via HA (~70 kDa) and NA (~55 kDa) in addition to recognizing M1. It is well-known that the viral HA can bind to sialic acid residues on surface glycoprotein and its receptor binding depends on the nature of the glycosidic linkage (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The binding of HA to sialic acids, like factor H, is the initial event in the virus association with human epithelial cells. In addition, the resulting disruption of the neuraminic acid residues can enable the virus to cross over the epithelial cells, thus entering new cells to initiate viral replication.</p><p>The immune response of A549 cells following IAV challenge in the presence and absence of factor H or VCP was examined using qRT-PCR. The ability of factor H and VCP to modulate viral replication, due to entry inhibition, was determined using M1 mRNA expression levels between protein treated and un-treated A549 cells challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes. Both factor H and VCP modulated the IAV replication in a strain dependent manner. In the case of H1N1, both factor H and VCP showed reduced viral M1 expression; however, an increased M1 expression was seen for H3N2, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of these proteins is strain-dependent. This suggests that both factor H and VCP could act as entry inhibitors against H1N1 subtype, but not H3N2.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated both direct and indirect correlation between cytokine levels and viral replication (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). IAV targets lung epithelial cells, and following initial exposure, progeny viral particles proliferate to infect other cells, including alveolar macrophages (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Thus, an acute inflammatory response is triggered by the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), where higher levels lead to a dramatic cytokine storm; altered levels of TNFs, IFNs, interleukins and chemokines have been detected in IAV infected patients (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Over-synthesis of IFN levels during early stages of IAV infection causes irreversible lung damage in mice infected with H5N1; however, IFN signaling may also be crucial in preventing H5N1 dissemination (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). TNFs are key soluble factors in the cytokine storm; H5N1 infected mice deficient in TNF receptors, as well as H5N1 infected mice treated with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies, show no change in survival rate compared to healthy controls (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-1 are the crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the host during influenza infection. Expression of IL-1 is detected in the early stage of IAV infection, followed by an increased IL-6 expression (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). H5N1 infected mice lacking in IL-6 receptor have demonstrated a poor survival outcome, suggesting the protective role of IL-6 pathway in the cytokine storm (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Therefore, an unbalanced cytokine storm can also lead to damage in the vascular barrier, causing tissue oedema, capillary leakage, failure of multiple organs, and death (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). However, no specific singular mechanism is reported when it comes to triggering a cytokine storm with respect to influenza strains.</p><p>In this study, alterations of cytokine levels were observed in H1N1 and H3N2 challenged A549 cells in the presence of factor H and VCP. Factor H treatment resulted in down-regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; at 2 and 6 h in H1N1 infected cells. In the case of H3N2 infected cells, expression of TNF-&#x003b1; was up-regulated at 2 and 6 h after treatment. Reduced mRNA levels of IL-6 and RANTES were also seen at 2 h treatment with factor H, which slightly increased at 6 h. Conversely, enhanced levels of IL-6 and RANTES were observed in H3N2 infected cells following 2 and 6 h treatment with factor H.</p><p>In the case of VCP, TNF-&#x003b1; IL-6, and IL-12 levels were found to be down-regulated at 6 h treatment. H1N1 infected cells treated with VCP also showed reduced levels of RANTES at 2 h. H3N2 infected A549 cells following VCP treatment revealed similar effects as factor H. Up-regulation of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-12, and RANTES were observed at 6 h following VCP treatment. Previous studies have reported enhanced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IFN-&#x003b1; in individuals infected with IAV (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; may be the key contributors to virus mediated respiratory diseases, including Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). During IAV infection, alveolar macrophages are activated, which are the primary phagocytic cells that produce robust amounts of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Macrophages infected with IAV have also been shown to produce chemokines such as RANTES and monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). This further recruits mononuclear cells to the lungs and facilitates viral clearance (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), and enhances production of those cytokines (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, RANTES, and IL-8) that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of influenza virus. RANTES, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; induced by influenza result in pro-inflammatory Th1-type immune responses in the infected host (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine levels during influenza has been demonstrated to promote tissue injury and impaired viral clearance. Additionally, suppression of IFN-&#x003b1; was also evident with factor H and VCP in H1N1 challenged A549 cells. In the case of H3N2, both factor H and VCP increased the expression of IFN-&#x003b1;, which may possibly induce protection of A549 cells against H3N2 viral particles in neighboring as well as non-infected cells. Thus, increased IFN-&#x003b1; by factor H and VCP may also suggest that in the infected A549 cells, factor H and VCP may cause digestion of viral RNA and viral proteins. Down-regulation of IFN-&#x003b1; levels in H1N1 infected cells may suggest the possibility of factor H and VCP treatment to reduce the rate of viral replication. Thus, treatments with factor H and VCP may elicit an anti-viral response, restricting the activation of innate immune cells and associated lung pathology.</p><p>Targeting viral entry into a host cell is an emerging approach for developing anti-viral therapy as viral propagation can be either restricted or blocked at an early stage of viral cycle, minimizing drug resistance by released virions. In this study, we have generated lentiviral pseudotypes, a safe surrogate model to mimic the structure and surfaces of IAV in order to determine if factor H and VCP act as an entry inhibitors in cells transduced with pseudotyped IAV particles that are restricted to only one replicative cycle. Factor H treatment resulted in 25% reduction of luciferase reporter activity in MDCK cells transduced with H1N1 pseudotyped particles. However, the addition of factor H increased the luciferase activity by 50% in cells challenged with H3N2 pseudotyped particles. VCP was found to reduce luciferase reporter activity of H1N1 transduced MDCK cells by 45%. As is the case with factor H, VCP also enhanced the reporter activity of MDCK cells transduced with H3N2 pseudotyped lentiviral particles by 30%, suggesting the ability of factor H and VCP to enhance viral infectivity through binding to cell surface bound HA found on infected MDCK cells. Our results are consistent with a previous study showing anti-viral activity of Stachyflin, which was found to be resistant against H3N2 due to differences in potential binding pockets for Stachyflin on HA molecule (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, data from restriction of M1 mRNA levels, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and luciferase reporter activity highlights the potential of factor H and VCP as cell entry inhibitors against the H1N1 IAV subtype. It appears that factor H and VCP restrict viral entry for H1N1, whilst conversely promoting H3N2 entry, which may be due to the inherent antigenic variations in binding sites for HA or NA. Further studies are required to pinpoint the specific molecular interactions of factor H and VCP against HA and NA by investigating a range of IAV strains with antigenic variability. This will not only provide further data on the pathogenesis of IAV infection, but also the utility of factor H and VCP, and their recombinant CCP modules, as possible cell entry inhibitors against IAV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>VM and PV carried out the key experiments.
