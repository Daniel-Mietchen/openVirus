<p>In this study, alterations of cytokine levels were observed in H1N1 and H3N2 challenged A549 cells in the presence of factor H and VCP. Factor H treatment resulted in down-regulation of TNF-α at 2 and 6 h in H1N1 infected cells. In the case of H3N2 infected cells, expression of TNF-α was up-regulated at 2 and 6 h after treatment. Reduced mRNA levels of IL-6 and RANTES were also seen at 2 h treatment with factor H, which slightly increased at 6 h. Conversely, enhanced levels of IL-6 and RANTES were observed in H3N2 infected cells following 2 and 6 h treatment with factor H.</p>
