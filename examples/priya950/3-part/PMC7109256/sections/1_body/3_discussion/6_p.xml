<p>Several studies have demonstrated both direct and indirect correlation between cytokine levels and viral replication (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). IAV targets lung epithelial cells, and following initial exposure, progeny viral particles proliferate to infect other cells, including alveolar macrophages (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Thus, an acute inflammatory response is triggered by the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), where higher levels lead to a dramatic cytokine storm; altered levels of TNFs, IFNs, interleukins and chemokines have been detected in IAV infected patients (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Over-synthesis of IFN levels during early stages of IAV infection causes irreversible lung damage in mice infected with H5N1; however, IFN signaling may also be crucial in preventing H5N1 dissemination (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). TNFs are key soluble factors in the cytokine storm; H5N1 infected mice deficient in TNF receptors, as well as H5N1 infected mice treated with anti-TNF-Î± antibodies, show no change in survival rate compared to healthy controls (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-1 are the crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the host during influenza infection. Expression of IL-1 is detected in the early stage of IAV infection, followed by an increased IL-6 expression (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). H5N1 infected mice lacking in IL-6 receptor have demonstrated a poor survival outcome, suggesting the protective role of IL-6 pathway in the cytokine storm (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Therefore, an unbalanced cytokine storm can also lead to damage in the vascular barrier, causing tissue oedema, capillary leakage, failure of multiple organs, and death (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). However, no specific singular mechanism is reported when it comes to triggering a cytokine storm with respect to influenza strains.
