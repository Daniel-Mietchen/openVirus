<p>Here, we investigated the complement-independent function of factor H in the regulation of IAV infection. Since VCP is an efficient complement inhibitor and a homolog of factor H (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we included it in the present study. VCP is a ~35 kDa secretory protein of vaccinia virus, encoded by the C3L open reading frame (ORF), and contains four CCP modules (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). VCP has been shown to inhibit complement lysis of sheep RBCs, by binding to C3b and C4b (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and serves as a cofactor in the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Additionally, VCP has been shown to inhibit formation of C3 convertase and accelerate the decay of the alternative pathway (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In the present study, a direct and complement independent interaction of factor H and VCP with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes were examined via hemagglutination assay, ELISA, cell binding, and far western blotting. In the hemagglutination assay, factor H inhibited hemagglutination of both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes; 10 Î¼g/ml being the most effective with H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes.
