<p>The immune response of A549 cells following IAV challenge in the presence and absence of factor H or VCP was examined using qRT-PCR. The ability of factor H and VCP to modulate viral replication, due to entry inhibition, was determined using M1 mRNA expression levels between protein treated and un-treated A549 cells challenged with H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes. Both factor H and VCP modulated the IAV replication in a strain dependent manner. In the case of H1N1, both factor H and VCP showed reduced viral M1 expression; however, an increased M1 expression was seen for H3N2, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of these proteins is strain-dependent. This suggests that both factor H and VCP could act as entry inhibitors against H1N1 subtype, but not H3N2.</p>
