<p>VCP 4 modules contain a heparin binding site, as does factor H (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It is possible that in a manner similar to factor H (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), the heparin binding site found within the VCP protein enhances its decay-accelerating action against C3 convertase. SRBCs have high surface sialic acid. Factor H binds to this and protects them from the complement alternative pathway. On removal of the sialic acid with neuraminidase, SRBCs become susceptible to complement lysis. However, other studies suggest that the decay activity rate of VCP does not reduce following neuraminidase-treatment of SRBCs (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), indicating a difference in reaction with sialic acids. Furthermore, a weaker decay rate was seen with CCP 2â€“4 mutants of VCP. Factor H and VCP seem to bind H1N1 and H3N2 via HA (~70 kDa) and NA (~55 kDa) in addition to recognizing M1. It is well-known that the viral HA can bind to sialic acid residues on surface glycoprotein and its receptor binding depends on the nature of the glycosidic linkage (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The binding of HA to sialic acids, like factor H, is the initial event in the virus association with human epithelial cells. In addition, the resulting disruption of the neuraminic acid residues can enable the virus to cross over the epithelial cells, thus entering new cells to initiate viral replication.
