<p>In the case of VCP, TNF-α IL-6, and IL-12 levels were found to be down-regulated at 6 h treatment. H1N1 infected cells treated with VCP also showed reduced levels of RANTES at 2 h. H3N2 infected A549 cells following VCP treatment revealed similar effects as factor H. Up-regulation of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and RANTES were observed at 6 h following VCP treatment. Previous studies have reported enhanced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-α in individuals infected with IAV (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), and enhances production of those cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, RANTES, and IL-8) that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of influenza virus. RANTES, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α induced by influenza result in pro-inflammatory Th1-type immune responses in the infected host (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine levels during influenza has been demonstrated to promote tissue injury and impaired viral clearance. Additionally, suppression of IFN-α was also evident with factor H and VCP in H1N1 challenged A549 cells. In the case of H3N2, both factor H and VCP increased the expression of IFN-α, which may possibly induce protection of A549 cells against H3N2 viral particles in neighboring as well as non-infected cells. Thus, increased IFN-α by factor H and VCP may also suggest that in the infected A549 cells, factor H and VCP may cause digestion of viral RNA and viral proteins. Down-regulation of IFN-α levels in H1N1 infected cells may suggest the possibility of factor H and VCP treatment to reduce the rate of viral replication. Thus, treatments with factor H and VCP may elicit an anti-viral response, restricting the activation of innate immune cells and associated lung pathology.
