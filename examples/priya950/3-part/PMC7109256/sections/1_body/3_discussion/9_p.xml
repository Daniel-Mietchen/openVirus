<p>Targeting viral entry into a host cell is an emerging approach for developing anti-viral therapy as viral propagation can be either restricted or blocked at an early stage of viral cycle, minimizing drug resistance by released virions. In this study, we have generated lentiviral pseudotypes, a safe surrogate model to mimic the structure and surfaces of IAV in order to determine if factor H and VCP act as an entry inhibitors in cells transduced with pseudotyped IAV particles that are restricted to only one replicative cycle. Factor H treatment resulted in 25% reduction of luciferase reporter activity in MDCK cells transduced with H1N1 pseudotyped particles. However, the addition of factor H increased the luciferase activity by 50% in cells challenged with H3N2 pseudotyped particles. VCP was found to reduce luciferase reporter activity of H1N1 transduced MDCK cells by 45%. As is the case with factor H, VCP also enhanced the reporter activity of MDCK cells transduced with H3N2 pseudotyped lentiviral particles by 30%, suggesting the ability of factor H and VCP to enhance viral infectivity through binding to cell surface bound HA found on infected MDCK cells. Our results are consistent with a previous study showing anti-viral activity of Stachyflin, which was found to be resistant against H3N2 due to differences in potential binding pockets for Stachyflin on HA molecule (
