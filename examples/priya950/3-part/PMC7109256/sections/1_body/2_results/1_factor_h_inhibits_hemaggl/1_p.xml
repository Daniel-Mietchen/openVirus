<p>Factor H was purified from human plasma, using monoclonal MRCOX23 Sepharose affinity column (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The purity of the eluted protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE; the molecular weight of factor H was evident at ~155 kDa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recombinant VCP appeared pure and migrated at ~35 kDa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Guinea pig RBCs were used to determine if addition of factor H would inhibit hemagglutination by IAV subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Five IAV strains of H3N2 or H1N1 subtypes were tested. The basic principle of this assay relies on the specific feature of envelope viral glycoproteins that can interact with sialic acid on RBCs. In the absence of viral particles, RBCs sedimented under gravity, forming a distinct red halo at the bottom of the microtiter well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, in the presence of viral particles, glycoproteins of virus (HA or NA in this case) interact and bind with sialic acid on RBCs, forming clumps, leading to a lattice formation, where RBCs remain in suspension. Factor H partially inhibited the hemagglutination of IAV strains. Low concentration of factor H (2.5 μg/ml) was more potent in inhibiting hemagglutination of H1N1 than H3N2 strains. Hemagglutination of all strains was effective using 10 μg/ml of factor H. It is possible that factor H binds to the IAV particles, restricting the binding of virus to RBCs, allowing them to form a halo at the bottom of the wells. PBS alone, in the absence of IAV particles, led to the formation of a halo at the bottom of the microtiter well, suggesting no hemagglutination.
