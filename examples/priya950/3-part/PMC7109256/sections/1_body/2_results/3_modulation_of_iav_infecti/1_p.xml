<p>In view of factor H and VCP binding to key IAV proteins, an infection assay was set up to assess the impact of this interaction on viral infectivity and replication by factor H and VCP. A549 lung epithelial cells, infected with H1N1 and H3N2 with and without factor H or VCP (40 μg/ml), showed differential expression of M1 mRNA levels at 2 and 6 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In the case of H1N1, both factor H and VCP led to the down-regulation (−4 log
 <sub>10</sub>) of viral M1 transcription at 6 h. However, an up-regulation was seen with H3N2 (2log
 <sub>10</sub>) subtype following factor H and VCP treatment, suggesting that the inhibitory effect by these proteins is strain specific (
