<p>qPCR data revealed that factor H and VCP treatment resulted in the modulation of both pro and anti-inflammatory responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B,C</xref>). Following factor H treatment of IAV-challenged A549 cells, the mRNA levels of TNF-α were down-regulated at 2 h (−5log
 <sub>10</sub>) and 6 h (−8log
 <sub>10</sub>) in H1N1 infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, an opposite effect was seen with H3N2 infected cells; the expression level of TNF-α was up-regulated, although not dramatically, at 2 h (3log
 <sub>10</sub>), as well as at 6 h (3.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In H1N1 challenged cells, the mRNA levels of IL-6 (−3.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) and RANTES (−0.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) were also down-regulated at 2 h time point in the presence of factor H. Conversely, IL-6 (2.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) and RANTES (1.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) levels were up-regulated in H3N2 challenged cells at 2 and 6 h (IL-6/3log
 <sub>10</sub>) (RANTES/2.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) treatment with factor H. Factor H also down-regulated IL-12 levels in H1N1 (1log
 <sub>10</sub>) subtype at 6 h, but enhanced in H3N2 challenged cells at both 2 and 6 h. We also show here, for the first time, the effect of VCP, which contains 4 CCP modules like human factor H, on IAV infection; it mirrored the results obtained with factor H (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). A greater down-regulation of TNF-α (−5log
 <sub>10</sub>), IL-6 (−3.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) and IL-12 (−1.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) levels were seen at 6 h following VCP treatment when compared to untreated control (cells + H1N1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). VCP treated H1N1 challenged A549 cells showed a reduced level of RANTES at 2 h (−0.7log
 <sub>10</sub>), which was raised slightly at 6 h. In the case of H3N2, effects similar to factor H were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and RANTES were increased at 6 h VCP treatment. Higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-α have been detected in IAV infected patients (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and correlate with severe infectivity. H1N1 infected patients have higher levels of IL-6 in their lungs and serum (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Therefore, down-regulation of IL-6 by both factor H and VCP in H1N1 infected A549 cells suggests a possible anti-inflammatory role of these two proteins in a strain specific manner. In addition, the ability of factor H (−2log
 <sub>10</sub>) and VCP (−2.5log
 <sub>10</sub>) to down-regulate type 1 IFN-α (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) at 6 h was also seen in H1N1. However, higher expression levels of IFN-α were detected in the case of H3N2 in the presence of factor H (2 log
 <sub>10</sub>) and VCP (1.7 log
 <sub>10</sub>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).
