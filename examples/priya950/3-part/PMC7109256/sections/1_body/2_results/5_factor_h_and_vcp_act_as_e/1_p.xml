<p>In this study, lentiviral pseudotypes were generated to determine cell entry strategies of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of IAV. Production of lentiviral pseudotypes was carried out by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with plasmid containing the coding sequence of IAV glycoprotein combinations such as H1+N1 and H3+N2, pHIV-Luciferase backbone, and psPAX2 plasmids via a calcium phosphate transfection method. Post transfection, H1N1 and H3N2 pseudotyped particles were harvested at 48 h, purified, and analyzed via western blotting. The HA expression level was detected using anti-H1 polyclonal antibody; HA was evident around ~70 kDa (

MDCK cells were transduced with purified H1N1 and H3N2 pseudotyped particles to measure the luciferase reporter activity, with and without factor H or VCP (40 Î¼g/ml). Nearly 25% reduction in the luciferase reporter activity was observed for factor H compared to cells only, challenged with H1N1 pseudotyped particles (

In the case of VCP, ~45% reduction of luciferase activity for cells transduced with H1N1-pseudotyped particles was noted, whereas it caused ~30% increase of luciferase activity in cells transduced with H3N2 pseudotyped particles (
