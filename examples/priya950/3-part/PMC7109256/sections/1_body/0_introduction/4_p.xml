<p>Viruses employ diverse strategies to protect their viral lipid envelopes from complement lysis by encoding or recruiting complement inhibitors, with structural and functional similarities to complement control proteins (CCP). Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) is a well-known complement inhibitor, secreted by vaccinia virus infected cells. VCP has inhibitory activity for both classical and alternative pathways (
