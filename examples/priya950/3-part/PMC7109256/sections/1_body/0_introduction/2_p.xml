<p>Airway and alveolar epithelial cells are the primary targets for IAV, which uses sialic acid as receptors, causing damage to the alveolar epithelium (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Individuals infected with IAV may become susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Lung epithelial cells express mucin glycoproteins, such as MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC1, which play an important role in restricting IAV infectivity (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These mucins are rich in sialic acid, serve as viral receptors, and restrict viral binding to the target cells (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, NA can attenuate the biological activity of these mucins (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The D151G mutation is a well-known mutation in NA glycoprotein, which is responsible for its interaction with human α2-6 and avian α2-3 linked sialic acid, mediating the H3N2 viral association with sialic acid receptors. However, this mutation is reported to reduce the enzymatic action of NA that is required for HA detachment from its receptors (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Early defense against invading IAV by the innate immune system is crucial in limiting viral replication and invasion. The complement system, a major humoral wing of innate immunity, offers a crucial protective mechanism against IAV infection (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This includes neutralization, aggregation, opsonization and lysis of viral particles, and induction of phagocytosis via complement receptors (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A number of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have established the protective role of the complement system against IAV (
