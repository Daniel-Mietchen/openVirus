<p>Since factor H can bind to sialic acids, a natural ligand for IAV, it is of interest to examine potential influence of factor H in competitively inhibiting IAV interaction with host cell surfaces. This study was designed to investigate the complement independent functions of factor H in the regulation of IAV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we report the ability of human factor H and recombinant VCP to act as entry inhibitors of IAV.
