<p>Complement factor H was purified from human plasma, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), using an affinity column made up of a monoclonal antibody against human factor H (MRCOX23) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (GE healthcare, UK). Freshly thawed human plasma (Fisher Scientific) was adjusted to 5 mM EDTA, pH 8, and dialyzed overnight against Buffer I (25 mM Tris-HCL, 140 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). MRCOX23 Sepharose column was washed with three bed volumes of buffer I, and dialyzed plasma was passed through the column. The column was then washed again with the same buffer and factor H was eluted using 3 M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 6.8. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against H
 <sub>2</sub>O overnight, followed by 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4. The samples were then analyzed for purity by 12% v/v SDS-PAGE.
