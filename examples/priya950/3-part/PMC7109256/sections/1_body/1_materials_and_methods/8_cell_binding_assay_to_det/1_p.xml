<p>A549 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 96 microtiter wells and incubated at 37°C overnight in 5% v/v CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Once 80% confluency was reached, the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS. Factor H or VCP (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 μg/ml), pre-incubated with H1N1 and H3N2 (1.36 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/ml) IAV subtypes, were added to the wells (in 5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. BSA was used as a negative control. Following washes with PBS three times, the corresponding wells were fixed with 4% v/v paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 5 min at room temperature. The wells were then blocked with 2% w/v BSA for 2 h at 37°C. Polyclonal anti-influenza virus H3 (BEI-Resources) and monoclonal anti-influenza H1 (BEI-Resources) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After gentle washes with PBSST, the wells were probed with protein A-HRP conjugate or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP-conjugate (Thermo-Fisher) diluted in PBS in 1:5,000 dilution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The wells were washed again with PBST; the color was developed by adding TMB substrate and the reaction was stopped by using 1M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
