<p>The virus infected cell pellets were lysed using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100). GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Purification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to extract the total RNA, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Once RNA was extracted, DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) treatment was performed to remove any DNA contaminants, followed by quantifying the amount of RNA at A260 nm using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c (Fisher-Scientific). The purity of RNA was assessed using the ratio A260/A280. Two micrograms of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA, using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and cDNA conversion was performed. The primer BLAST software (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) was used to design primer sequences as listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The qRT-PCR assay was performed using the StepOne Plus system (Applied Biosciences). Each qPCR reaction was conducted in triplicates, containing 75 nM of forward and reverse primers, 5 μl Power SYBR Green MasterMix (Applied Biosystems), and 500 ng of cDNA. qPCR samples were run for 50°C and 95°C for 2 and 10 min, followed by running the amplification template for 40 cycles, each cycle involving 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Eighteen seconds RNA was used as an endogenous control to normalize the gene expression.
