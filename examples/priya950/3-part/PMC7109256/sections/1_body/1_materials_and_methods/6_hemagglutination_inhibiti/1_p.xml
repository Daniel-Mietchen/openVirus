<p>In a 96 microtiter well plate, 25 μl of PBS was added to each well. In the first column, a starting concentration (total volume 50 μl) of 20 μg of factor H was serially diluted (25 μl) to achieve final quantities of 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 μg of factor H per well. Twenty-five microliters of respective IAV subtype particles were added to wells, except for PBS control wells, at the dilutions corresponding to their respective HA titer to initiate hemagglutination. Plates were gently mixed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Fifty microliter of 0.75% v/v guinea pig RBCs was added to each well; plates were gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Inhibition of hemagglutination appeared as a halo or circle of settled cells in the center of round-bottomed wells. Absence of inhibition was observed as a uniform red color across the well (hemagglutination).</p>
