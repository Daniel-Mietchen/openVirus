<p>A549 (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) cells were cultured in complete DMEM and grown overnight at 37°C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Once 85% cell confluency was reached, the cells were washed gently with fresh PBS and replaced with DMEM without FBS. Forty μg/ml of factor H or VCP was added to corresponding wells, with a MOI = 1:1 of pH1N1, and H3N2 or pseudotyped viral particles (333 μl/ml) at room temperature for 1 h and at 4°C for another hour. The unbound virus and protein were removed by pipetting out the supernatant. The cells were washed gently again with PBS, and placed in 1 ml of infection medium to initiate viral infection of the host cells being incubated for 2 and 6 h. After removing the supernatant, the infected cells were washed with PBS and detached using 2 × Trypsin-EDTA (0.5%) (Fisher Scientific), centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was frozen at −80°C for RNA extraction.
