<p>Factor H or VCP (5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 μg/well in 100 μl volume) were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates using carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (CBC), pH 9.6, and incubated at 4°C overnight. After washing the microtiter wells with PBS, the wells were blocked with 2% w/v BSA in PBS and incubated at 37°C for 2 h, followed by three PBST (PBS + 0.05% v/v Tween 20) washes. Twenty microliters of H1N1 or H3N2 virus (1.36 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/ml) in PBS were added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 2 h in the presence of 5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus was used as a negative control. Following PBST washes, the corresponding wells were incubated with primary antibodies (100 μl/well): polyclonal anti-influenza virus H3 and monoclonal anti-influenza virus H1 (1:5,000) (BEI-Resources). The wells were again washed with PBST three times and probed with Protein A-HRP-conjugate, or goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate (1:5,000) (Fisher Scientific), followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. Color was developed using 3,3′, 5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich), and reaction was stopped using 1M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, followed by measuring absorbance at 450 nm, using iMark™ microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad).
