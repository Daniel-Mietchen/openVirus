<p>Purified H1N1/H3N2 (1.36 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/ml) virus particles were run on a 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane for 2 h at 320 mA in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 20% v/v methanol, and 190 mM glycine). Membrane was blocked with PBS+5% w/v BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature, followed by PBST washes. The membrane was then incubated with 10 μg/ml of factor H or VCP overnight at 4°C, and probed appropriately with either monoclonal mouse anti-human factor H (MRCOX23) (MRC Immunochemistry Unit, Oxford) (1 mg/ml) or rabbit anti-VCP polyclonal antibody (0.5 mg/ml) (King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia) at room temperature for 1 h. Following PBST washes (three times, 10 min each), the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (1:1,000) (Sigma-Aldrich) or Protein A-HRP-conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was removed, followed by PBST washes; then the membrane was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB).
