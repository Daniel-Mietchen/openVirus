<p>50,000 MDCK cells at 80% confluency were infected either with pH1N1 (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) or H3N2 (3.3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) particles and incubated in complete DMEM medium at 37°C for 1 h. Unbound viral particles were removed and replaced with infection medium, composed of DMEM with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)— Trypsin (Sigma –Aldrich), and incubated for 3 days under culture conditions, as mentioned above. Post infection, supernatant was subjected to ultra-centrifugation (25,000 × g) for 90 min at 4°C. Purified viral particles were then re-suspended in PBS, and purity of the virus was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Production of pseudotyped particles was carried out, as described earlier (

Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of respective IAV pCDNAs, including pcDNA3.1-swineH1-flag (H1 from swine H1N1 A/California/04/09) (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1-swine N1-flag (N1 from swine H1N1 A/California/04/09) (Invitrogen), pcDNA-H3 [H3 from A/Denmark/70/03/(H3N2)], pI.18-N2 [N2 from A/Texas/50/2012/(H3N2)], pHIV-Luciferase backbone (Addgene), and psPAX2 (Addgene). VSV-G was generated similarly, without H1N1 and H3N2 pcDNAs. The released H1N1, H3N2, and VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral particles were harvested in the supernatant at 48 h. Harvested supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and the clear supernatant without any debris was concentrated using ultra centrifugation (25,000 × g) for 90 min. The ultra-centrifuged lentiviral particles were re-suspended in sterile PBS and analyzed via TCID50, western blotting and luciferase activity assay. TCID50 assay was carried out to determine the viral titer and cytopathic effects of infected cells (

 <sup>5</sup>) were infected with either purified pH1N1 and H3N2 viral parties or pseudotyped lentiviral particles, incubated at 37°C for 3 days under 5% v/v CO
 <sub>2</sub>, until a cytopathic effect was observed in terms of structural changes in MDCK cells caused by viral invasion.
