An episode of lower respiratory tract infection was defined as acute pulmonary disease with or without acute respiratory failure, including pneumonia, influenza-like illness, or an acute exacerbation of a chronic respiratory illness (including an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or bronchiectasis). The exclusion criteria included if the patient was receiving palliative care or declined nasopharyngeal swabbing. All participants provided written informed consent.
