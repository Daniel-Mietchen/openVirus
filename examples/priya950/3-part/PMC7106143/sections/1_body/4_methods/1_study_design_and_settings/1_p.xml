<p id="p0030">We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study of a sample of ED patients presenting with acute severe respiratory illness. The EDs of 2 urban medical centers participated in this project. The annual ED census is around 100,000 for one medical center and 80,000 for the other. The study period included January 2017 through March 2018. We defined the pre–respiratory panel system implementation period as January 2016 through December 2016 (12 months) and the post–respiratory panel system implementation period as January 2017 through March 2018. We had 200 multiplex PCR kits, of which 22 were used for rapid PCR respiratory panel system calibration; the remaining 178 kits were aimed for use among the study patients. However, at the planned end date of the study, we could not reach the target sample size. Therefore, a 3-month extension in the experimental group was made to collect sufficient samples. The trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research at each participating center.</p>
