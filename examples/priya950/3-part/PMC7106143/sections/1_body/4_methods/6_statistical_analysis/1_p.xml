<p id="p0060">Baseline characteristics were summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. The categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage and compared using the chi-squared test. The continuous variables were presented by median with interquartile range and compared by nonparametric Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> tests. The numbers of different respiratory viral isolates and mean serum level of PCT for different viral infections were shown by bar graph. To select control patients, we built a PS for matching. PS was defined as the conditional probability of being tested with respiratory panel and PCT, which was derived from the logistic regression model that included the following potential predictors: demographics, comorbidity, presenting vital signs, laboratory results, and admission diagnoses. To verify the balancing of baseline covariates after PS matching, we made a standardized difference plot to ensure minimum differences in the baseline covariates between 2 groups of patients (

In the PS-matched cohort, we compared the outcome between the current cohort and the PS-matched historical cohort using the logistic regression model, adjusting for the residual difference in the baseline covariates. All statistical analyses were performed by SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC), and a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; .05 was deemed significant.
