<p id="p0055">To evaluate the clinical impact of combining the respiratory panel and PCT testing on the outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory illness, we established a historical cohort, including all patients presenting to the ED with severe acute respiratory illness from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The database included the following: demographics, clinical presentations, presenting viral signs, laboratory data, image results, ED and admission, medications used in the ED and hospitalization course, and discharge status. We then used a PS-matching technique to select a group of patients with similar demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses, vital signs, and laboratory results to the experimental cohort that received the respiratory panel and PCT test. To increase the statistical power for analysis, we performed a 1-to-3 matching. The final cohort includes 169 older adult severe acute respiratory illness patients who received the respiratory panel and PCT test and 507 PS-matched control patients. This composite cohort was used to assess the clinical impact of the rapid respiratory viral surveillance and PCT tests.</p>
