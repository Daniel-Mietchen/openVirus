<p id="p0040">The FilmArray respiratory panel (bioFire Diagnostics, Inc) detects 17 viruses (RSV, influenza A H1, H1-2009, H3, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1–4, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1), and 3 atypical bacteria (
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>). We collected a nasopharyngeal swab using a nylon flocked swab that was immediately placed in universal transport media (UTM). The study nurse collected all samples and specimens in UTM, and they were tested according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood samples were collected within 24 hours of admission. PCT concentrations were measured using an immunoluminometric assay with a detection limit of 0.06 ng/mL (BRAHMS PCT-sensitive Kryptor, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BRAHMS GmbH). Respiratory swab and blood samples were tested as soon as they were received in the laboratory.
