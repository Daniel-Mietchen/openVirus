<p id="p0015">Molecular diagnostic tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the RNA or DNA of the infectious agents show high sensitivity and specificity, but they are technically challenging and time consuming. The advent of sensitive point-of-care (POC) molecular detection methods has made rapid diagnosis of respiratory virus infections possible. The FilmArray system (bioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) is a desktop automated real-time PCR system that integrates sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis into 1 complete process that delivers results in 1Â hour. The respiratory panel can detect 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction.

 </xref> Initial studies demonstrated that such POC multiplex PCR systems identified previously under-evaluated viral or atypical infections in ED dyspneic patients, and the additional information on rapid respiratory infection testing may also change the physician's antibiotic-prescribing behavior, enabling more timely and appropriate treatment.
