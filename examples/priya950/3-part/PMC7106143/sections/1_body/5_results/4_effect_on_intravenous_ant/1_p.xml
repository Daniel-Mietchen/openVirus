<p id="p0080">Compared with the control group, the patients in the experimental group had more antibiotics de-escalation (21.9% vs 13.2%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .007), received more neuraminidase inhibitor in the ED (8.9% vs 0.6%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics use (median 10.0 days [interquartile range 5.3, 14.6] vs 14.5 [7.2, 22.0], 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and had a shorter length of hospital stay (14.0 [5.0-20.5] vs 16.1 [6.0-24.5] days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .030). Although the patients in the experimental group had a trend of more antibiotic discontinuation, the small number of patients prevents meaningful comparison. Neither 30-day nor in-hospital mortality was significantly different between the 2 groups. To further account for the residual covariate difference after PS matching, we performed logistic or linear regression adjusting for age, temperature, chronic liver disease, and dementia. The results revealed that rapid PCR respiratory panel and PCT testing were associated with increased odds of discontinuing or de-escalating antibiotics [odds ratio (OR) 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28, 3.02], increased odds of neuraminidase inhibitor prescription (OR 17.9, 95% CI 5.02, 63.98), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (-–4.44, 95% CI –2.08, −2.79). There was no difference in length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality (
