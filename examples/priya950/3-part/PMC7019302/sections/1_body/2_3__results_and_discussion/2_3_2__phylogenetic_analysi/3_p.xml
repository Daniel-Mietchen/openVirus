<p>Our results were further supported by Bayesian time-scale phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00123-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Strains of the 2018 outbreak most likely originated from a diversification event taking place in Hungary between 2010 and 2013, and they are represented by both subclades. Although this analysis is highly theoretical, it provides additional evidence for the absence of novel emerging strains. Our data is also confirmed by the more detailed work about the evolutionary dynamics of lineage-2 WNV [
