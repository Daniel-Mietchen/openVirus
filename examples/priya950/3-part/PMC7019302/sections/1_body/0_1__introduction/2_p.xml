<p>The West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genus. However, there is growing concern in reference to the role of recently expanding invasive Aedes mosquitoes throughout Europe, establishing novel transmission scenarios [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The virus is maintained throughout nature in an enzootic cycle among mosquitoes and birds in which birds serve as the amplifying host while mosquitoes serve as vectors. Humans and horses are incidental or dead-end hosts which may be infected through a mosquito bite or, in very rare cases, by blood transfusion or organ transplantation [

Viral infections can lead to severe neuroinvasive forms of disease (encephalitis and meningitis) in a small proportion of cases (about 1%), especially among the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Within these groups, mortality rates may reach up to 20% [
