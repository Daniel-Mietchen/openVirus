<p>Along with other widely distributed flaviviruses, such as the Dengue virus or Yellow Fever virus, the West Nile virus is a major public health concern throughout multiple continents [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, nine genetic variants of the virus have been identified. However, the infectivity and neuroinvasive tendencies regarding the lineages have been largely different [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among genetic variants, lineage 1 and lineage 2 West Nile virus (ffWNV) strains pose the largest human health risk worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A higher degree of infectivity and neuroinvasiveness was attributed to lineage 1 WNV until the appearance of a large number of lineage 2 WNV strains in South Africa with elevated infectivity and neuroinvasive properties [
