<p>The laboratory diagnosis regarding human WNV infections across the entire territory of Hungary was performed at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL, Budapest, Hungary) for Viral Zoonoses of the National Public Health Center (NPHC, Budapest, Hungary). Serological differential diagnostic tests for WNV, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Usutu virus (USUV) were performed in parallel, and all serum and CSF samples were forwarded to the NPHCâ€™s NRL with the clinical suspicion of aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis. Due to the milder form of the human WNV infections, commonly referred to as West Nile fever, patients afflicted with exanthema, fever, myalgia, and/or arthralgia were also investigated and involved in WNV screening during the transmission season.</p>
