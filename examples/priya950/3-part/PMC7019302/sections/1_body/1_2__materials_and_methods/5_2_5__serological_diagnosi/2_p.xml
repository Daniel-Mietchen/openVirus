Confirmation by WNV microneutralization assay was performed in all cases. Serological cross-reactivity was excluded, and test results were evaluated according to the flavivirus vaccination status and travel history. Acute infections were defined and reported as confirmed or probable WNV infections in accordance with the EU case definition criteria.
