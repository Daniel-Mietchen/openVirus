<p>Mosquito, horse, and northern goshawk samples were subjected to WNV specific TaqMan real time reverse transcription PCR as described in [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following cycling conditions: Reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 51 °C for 20 c, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 s. Thereafter, WNV-positive mosquito, northern goshawk, and horse samples were subjected to a nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system targeting the NS5 gene as described in [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system targeting the NS3 gene (WNV_NS3_F 5’-AGCMGGAAARACRCGCAAGA-3’ and WNV_NS3_R 5’-GGTCTTTCCAACATACTCAG-3’) in order to amplify a longer genomic region regarding sequencing. PCR products were subjected to bidirectional sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer platform (Applied Biosystems).
