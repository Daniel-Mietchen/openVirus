<p>Model selection in reference to accurate phylogenetic analysis was performed using the PhyML 3.0 online tool Substitution model selection section. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction was implemented using the PhyML 3.0 online tool, with the TN93+G+I substitution model performing nonparametric bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Bayesian coalescent analyses and time calibrated phylogeny were used in order to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of WNV. The phylogenetic tree was calibrated by attributing the sampling dates to the tips of the tree and using uncorrelated relaxed clock with lognormal distribution. Subsequently, the analyses were performed using Beast v. 1.10 software with TN93+F+G4 substitution model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was run for 30 million generations and sampled every 30,000 steps. The convergence assessment based on the Effective Sample Size (ESS &gt; 200) was performed in Tracer v1.6.0. Tree Annotator program was used to summarize the trees in a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree with a 10% burn-in. The resultant tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 program.
