<p>The early spread of the pH1N1 influenza A virus was simulated using GLEAMviz [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which has been widely used to simulate this outbreak [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has been shown to accurately predict influenza activity in various countries [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on the simulated transitions between locations during the first weeks of the pandemic, we then used FAVITES [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to simulate the isolate sampling and sequencing, the tree as well as the sequences evolving along the phylogeny 50 times in total. The resulting simulated datasets included on average 97 sequences sampled from 76 unique locations in 23 countries. To confirm that the simulated sequences and the corresponding tree were an accurate representation of the pH1N1 virus, we compared them to real HA sequences of the outbreak that were sampled until the end of April 2009. We calculated pairwise distances between the sequences using a Jukes-Cantor model for both real and simulated sequences (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007101.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). With both the genetic distances between sequences as well as branch lengths showing a similar distribution, we conclude that the simulation was an accurate representation of the pH1N1 influenza A virus in terms of sequence diversity and tree resolution, which is essential to achieve a comparable accuracy for phylogeographic reconstructions. Most sampling locations in the simulated data were in Mexico and the US, but the virus already spread to Canada, Europe, Asia and Oceania as well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). New infections were mainly seeded from Mexico, especially from Veracruz, the origin of the outbreak, and Canc√∫n, the second largest airport of the country. Transitions were given via origin and destination, as output by the GLEAMviz simulation, but were not necessarily the direct route of travel. While Veracruz only has direct flights to a small number of locations, transitions to the US and Europe were possible via connecting flights, e.g. via Mexico City, the main connection from Veracruz. Overall, the simulated locations agreed with the spread of the pandemic until the end of April 2009, where the majority of cases was reported for Mexico and the US, and the first cases occurred on other continents as well [
