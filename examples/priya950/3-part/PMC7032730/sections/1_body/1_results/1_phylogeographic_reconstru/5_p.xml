<p>While the Fréchet tree distance measures distances between the entire spread routes, we further had a closer look at the inferred root locations. Since root locations indicate the possible origin of an outbreak, these are of particular interest. Veracruz, the correct root location in our simulation, wasn’t inferred except in a few cases—once using geographic distances on the inferred tree, once using effective distances on the simulated tree, as well as once and five times using equal distances with the inferred and simulated tree, respectively. However, the correct country of origin was inferred in the majority of cases when using effective distances. Interestingly, although no significant differences were observed when comparing the Fréchet tree distances, the reconstruction with the inferred tree topology inferred the country of origin less accurately (in 72% of the cases, compared to 98% on the simulated tree topology). When geographic distances were used, Mexico was only inferred as the origin in 24% of the simulations when using inferred topologies, and 34% when using simulated ones. Instead, the origin was placed in the US for most of the cases (74% and 62%, respectively). For reconstructions using equal distances, Mexico is inferred in 42% and 40% of the simulations, and the US in 30% and 40% (inferred and simulated topologies, respectively). In the other simulations, the root is placed in different countries across South America and Europe, causing large deviations from the actual spread.</p>
