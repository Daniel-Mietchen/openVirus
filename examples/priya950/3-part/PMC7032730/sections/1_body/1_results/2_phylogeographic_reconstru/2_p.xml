<p>Our method inferred Mexico City for the root node of the tree and therefore as the origin of the outbreak. With that, we successfully reconstructed the correct country of origin. Mexico City is the main airport of the country and was assigned to all sequences sampled in Mexico due to the lack of more accurate geographic information. The actual suspected origin in La Gloria in the state Veracruz is around 300km away from our inferred origin. The lack of more precise information about the sampling locations likely prevents our method to infer the origin more closely. However, for some internal nodes our method inferred Cancún, a second location in Mexico. This demonstrates that our approach is able to infer intermediate locations which have not been observed at the tips and might therefore overcome some of the problems introduced by poor sampling resolution. Cancún is the second largest airport in Mexico and a common tourist destination. Therefore, it likely contributed to the global spread of the pH1N1 influenza A virus. People travelling from Cancún around mid April have been the first reported cases in the UK [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our reconstruction finds a link from Cancún to New York as well, together with links to Wisconsin and Alberta, Canada.
