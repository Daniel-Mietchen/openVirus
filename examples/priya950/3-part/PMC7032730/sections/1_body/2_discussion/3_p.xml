<p>By comparing the reconstructed spread paths to the simulated ground truth using discrete Fréchet tree distances, we showed that our method using effective distances inferred the phylogeographic spread of pH1N1 more accurately than with geographic distances or equal distances, which are equivalent to previous parsimony approaches using the Fitch algorithm. Furthermore, on the country-level our approach was more accurate than the classical BEAST approach with both symmetric and asymmetric rates and comparable to the GLM diffusion model. The GLM approach only outperformed the parsimonious analysis when the simulated tree topology was fixed in the analysis; however, since this topology is generally unknown, this does not present an advantage in practice. When only considering the root instead of complete paths, the BEAST analysis with asymmetric rates and the GLM inferred the correct country of origin as well as the reconstruction with effective distances, and outperformed the reconstructions using geographic and equal distances. The difference between effective and geographic distances indicated that it’s essential to choose suitable distances for the parsimonious analysis. With suitable distances, accurate reconstructions could be achieved that outperformed or were as good as the Bayesian state-of-the-art approaches.</p>
