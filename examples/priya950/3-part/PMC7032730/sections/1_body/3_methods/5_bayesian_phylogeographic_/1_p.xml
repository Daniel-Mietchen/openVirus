<p>The simulated data included a large number of states with relatively few sequences, which is not suitable for Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction. Using countries instead of airports reduced the number of states to make the Bayesian reconstruction feasible. We used BEAST version 2.4.8 for this analysis [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Sampling dates were included into the phylogenetic reconstruction as measured in days. A HKY nucleotide substitution model was used together with a strict molecular clock. For the tree prior, a coalescent model with exponential population growth was chosen. For the phylogeographic reconstruction, analyses were performed separately with both symmetric and asymmetric rates. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for 100 million steps with trees sampled every 10,000 steps, resulting in a sample of 10,001 trees.
