<p>For both simulated and real data, nucleotide sequences were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.8.31 with standard parameters [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Positions with gaps in more than 80% of the sequences were removed with TrimAl version 1.2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to ensure a good quality of the alignment. Phylogenetic trees were then reconstructed with FastTree version 2.1.7 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] using the GTR model. Simulated trees were rooted based on the ancestral sequence used in the simulation process, which was subsequently removed from the dataset. The tree based on real data was rooted using the sequence with the earliest sampling date.
