<p>The phylogeographic reconstruction was based on the air transportation network from the OAG database including 3865 airports, which we used as all possible states in the analysis. Geographic distances between airports were calculated based on longitude and latitude using the R package geosphere [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This defined the distances as the shortest paths between locations, taking into account the ellipsoidal surface of the Earth. Effective distances were calculated based on the numbers of passengers travelling between airports in the year 2013, as in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For equal distances, all distances between airports were set to 1. The air transportation network included airports from 228 countries, which were used as locations for the analysis on a country level. Geographic distances between countries were calculated as described above using the coordinates of the centroids. For effective distances, we aggregated the passenger numbers per country and recalculated the distances. The distance matrices were used as a cost matrix for the parsimonious reconstruction using the Sankoff algorithm [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Distances represent the cost of traveling from one state to another and the Sankoff algorithm finds the internal states with the minimal cost, i.e. minimizing the distance the virus travelled along the tree. In case of equal distances between locations, this is equivalent to the Fitch algorithm which minimizes the number of changes between states. An example of the inference using asymmetric distances is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g002">Fig 2</xref>. We used delayed transformation in case of ambiguities. When an ambiguity occured at the root and therefore couldnâ€™t be resolved with delayed transformation, we randomly chose one of the possible states. Since effective distances are generally not symmetric, the tree was rooted before the reconstruction.
