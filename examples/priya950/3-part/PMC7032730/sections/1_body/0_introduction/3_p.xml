<p>Here, we propose a new parsimony-based approach for phylogeographic reconstruction and apply it to study the 2009 outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza A virus. To use prior knowledge about the mode of travel, we directly include air transportation data via effective distances, which are defined by the number of people travelling from one location to another [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The phylogeographic reconstruction then uses the Sankoff algorithm [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to find internal locations, minimizing the distances along the tree. This approach inherently overcomes the shortcomings of discrete Bayesian methods as in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and allows both the use of fine-grained locations and the inference of intermediate locations.
