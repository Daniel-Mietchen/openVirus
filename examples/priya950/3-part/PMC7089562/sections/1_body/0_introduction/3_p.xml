<p>In our study, we analyzed the therapeutic application of two murine mAbs raised against glycoprotein Gn in a mouse model for Rift Valley fever. The combined application of a neutralizing with a non-neutralizing antibody led to complete protection against an otherwise lethal dose of RVFV attributed to cooperative interference. These results open up new therapeutic treatment possibilities.</p>
