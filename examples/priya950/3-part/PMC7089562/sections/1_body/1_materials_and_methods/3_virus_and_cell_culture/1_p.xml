<p>Rift Valley fever strain 35/74 (accession number: JF784386-88) was propagated in BHK-21 cells (Collection of Cell Lines in Veterinary Medicine, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Germany). RVFV strain 35/74 was isolated from a liver of a sheep that died during an RVFV outbreak in the Free State province of South Africa in 1974 [
