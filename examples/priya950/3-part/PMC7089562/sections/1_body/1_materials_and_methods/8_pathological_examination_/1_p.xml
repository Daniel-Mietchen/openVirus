<p>Necropsy was performed according to standard procedures under a work bench at biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Specimen from brain, lung, liver and spleen were fixed during necropsy in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde for at least more than 21 days, processed, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 2–4 μm thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The grade of characteristic histopathological lesions (hepatitis, encephalitis, lymphoid depletion, follicular hyperplasia) was semi-quantitatively assessed on a 0–3 scale as follows: 0 = no obvious findings, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe findings.</p>
