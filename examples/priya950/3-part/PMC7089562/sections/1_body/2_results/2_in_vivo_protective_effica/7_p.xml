<p>Necropsied animals were subjected to comprehensive histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis including semiquantitative assessment of virus antigen (nucleoprotein) distribution in brain, liver, spleen and lung (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the severity of the typical lesions was assessed employing four different histopathological scores (hepatitis, encephalitis, lymphoid depletion and follicular hyperplasia within the spleen). Thereby, three basic combinations of pathological findings and antigen distribution were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g006">Fig 6</xref>): Pattern A (acute, high-grade hepatitis) includes animals with acute RVF infection that show predominantly high-grade, acute, confluent to diffuse, necrotizing hepatitis with Councilman corpuscles and intranuclear, irregular, eosinophilic inclusion bodies (Cowdry type B). Furthermore, these mice showed low to moderate lymphoid necrosis, apoptosis and/or depletion of the white pulp of the spleen. Pattern A is mostly found in individuals of the untreated PBS group, which are characterized by accumulation of RVF antigen mainly in liver and spleen. Main target cells for viral antigen were hepatocytes and macrophages in the red pulp and follicular dendritic cells in the spleen. In the lung, alveolar macrophages or interstitial and intravascular phagocytes were stained whereas in brain primarily neurons and rarely microglia were antigen positive.
