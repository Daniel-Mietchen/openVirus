<p>Pattern B was observed in only few mice, which survived the acute, diffuse, necrotizing hepatitis and succumbed around 8 dpi. They exhibited a more subacute hepatitis with more pronounced infiltrates of macrophages and heterophils, and an acute, focal to multifocal, necrotizing polioencephalitis. Notably there was no RVFV antigen in the livers of these mice at the time of necropsy but in the lesioned areas within the brain. These mice also display lymphatic apoptosis, necrosis and depletion in the spleen.</p>
