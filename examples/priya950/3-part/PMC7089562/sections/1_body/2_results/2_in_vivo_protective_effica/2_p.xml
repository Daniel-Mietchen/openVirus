<p>Analysis of tissues (brain and liver) as well as cruor in necropsied mice showed a significant reduction of viral RNA in combined mAb treated animals, compared to the untreated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Main target tissue was liver with an average value of 2.3x10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mg tissue, followed by cruor (7.6x10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/mg tissue) and brain (1.2x10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/mg tissue) in the untreated group. A strong decline was observed in both Gn3 groups as well as the combi T1 group regarding cruor samples as well as in Gn32 -T1/T2, Gn3 T1 and combi T1 groups regarding brain. However, high viral RNA loads remained in the liver tissues of the Gn32 (mean values 7.4x10
 <sup>5</sup>-1.6x10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mg tissue) and Gn3 groups (mean values: 7x10
 <sup>4</sup>-1.7x10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mg tissue). In contrast, no viral RNA was detected in liver of the combi T2 group and low amounts of RNA (mean value: 1 copy/mg) in the brain of 3 individuals as well as 1.8 copies/mg tissue in cruor of one animal indicating a nearly complete protection.
