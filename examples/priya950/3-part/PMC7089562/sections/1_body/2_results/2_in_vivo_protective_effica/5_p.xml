<p>Sera from necropsied animals were further tested in a competition ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The lowest number of seropositive samples (16.7%) were observed in the PBS group probably due to rapid virus spread and onset on disease. Interestingly in both T1 groups (Gn3 and combi group) a distinct higher number of animals were seropositive (58.3% and 75%, respectively) compared to the T2 group (33% and 54.5%, respectively). No such differences were seen in the Gn32 groups (44% vs 40%).
