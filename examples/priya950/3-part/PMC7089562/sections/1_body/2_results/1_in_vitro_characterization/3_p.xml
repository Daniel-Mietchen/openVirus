<p>Both mAbs were also assessed in serum neutralization test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Only mAb Gn3 exhibited neutralizing activity and reached a 50% neutralizing concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) against RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 at 33.0 μg/ml. As already seen in ELISA, co-incubation of mAbs Gn3 with Gn32 showed a synergistic effect and reduced IC
 <sub>50</sub> to 24.6 μg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of mAb Gn3 against virulent RVFV strain 35/74 were 4–5 times higher showing a concentration of 147.2 μg/ml and in combination with Gn32 of 100.6 μg/ml (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s007">S3 Data</xref>). The synergistic effects of both mAbs were additionally quantified by so-called combination index (CI) and dose-reduction index (DRI) as described earlier [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The calculation was carried out by CompuSyn software which basically quantifies synergetic effects of drug combinations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The CI, which is divided into 3 categories (&lt;1: synergistic effects, 1: additive effects, &gt;1: antagonistic effects) revealed F(a)
 <sub>55</sub> (Fraction affected) values of 0.39 and 0.31 for MP-12 and strain 35/74 respectively. The DRI indicates how many folds of dose-reduction for each compound at a given effect are allowed in synergistic combination. The corresponding values were 2.59 for MP-12 and 3.17 for strain 35/74 (detailed data used for calculation and CI and DRI at other F(a) are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s008">S4 Data</xref>).
