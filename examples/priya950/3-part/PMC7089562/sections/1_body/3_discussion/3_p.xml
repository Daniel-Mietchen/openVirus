<p>Via Pepscan analysis the main epitope of non-neutralizing mAb Gn32 could be successfully elucidated. The corresponding sequence PGKGHNYIDGMT is located in domain I of Gn and directly neighbors antigenic site A described in Wang et al. (16). Gn3 showed no distinct signal in Pepscan, indicating a conformational epitope. Even though Gn32 has no neutralizing activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, it increases significantly the neutralizing potency of Gn3. This synergistic effect was supported by the CompuSyn software with values of a CI of 0.39/ 0.31 and a DRI of 2.59/ 3.17. Similar effects were already described from studies with mAbs targeting other viruses, e.g. HIV triple and quadriple mAb combinations with CI of 0.2–0.8 and DRI of 2–39.9 [
