<p>We therefor hypothesize that the mechanistic basis for this “cooperative neutralization” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] is based on the binding of Gn32 to glycoprotein Gn which induces a conformational change and makes the epitope of mAb Gn3 more accessible. Thus, the induced conformational change allows a comprehensive and more effective binding of mAb Gn3. A similar cooperative effect of non-neutralizing mAbs that improve the activity of otherwise poorly neutralizing mAbs has been originally described for mAbs against HIV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In any case, domain I of RVFV Gn plays an important role in antibody-mediated neutralization and protection, since additional neutralizing mAbs against RVFV cluster in this domain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Application of Gn3 alone protected more than half of the group against a severe RVFV infection. In combination with non-neutralizing Gn32, 83% of the T1 group survived, whereas treatment 30 min after infection (T2) provided complete protection.
