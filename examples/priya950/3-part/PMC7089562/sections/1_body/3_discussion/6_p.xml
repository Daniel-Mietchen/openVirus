<p>Our findings are principally consistent with two previous publications, where complete protection was reported by monoclonal antibodies but with significant differences regarding sources and mode of action [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the first case rabbit monoclonal antibodies were generated with high neutralizing activity targeting an epitope at domain B of Gn glycoprotein (corresponding to Gn domain II), which probably interferes with Gn/Gc heterodimer formation and subsequent cell fusion. In contrast, Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] isolated monoclonal antibodies from a recovered human patient that targeted epitopes at domain I of Gn glycoprotein and inhibited attachment of the virion to the cells.
