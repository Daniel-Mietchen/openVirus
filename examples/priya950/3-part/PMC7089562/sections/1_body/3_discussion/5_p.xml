<p>Complete protection was correlated with a significant reduction of viral load in all tested tissues and the incapability of further replication. The combined T2 antibody regimen could even completely eliminate the virus from the liver, which represents the main target organ of RVFV. Especially in the unprotected PBS group, strain 35/74 causes an infection with marked liver tropism, leading to a fulminant acute diffuse necrotizing hepatitis that has already been shown with other RVFV strains in mice [
