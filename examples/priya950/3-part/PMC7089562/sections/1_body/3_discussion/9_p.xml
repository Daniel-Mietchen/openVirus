<p>MAb application indeed revealed a clearly differentiated picture of disease progression: Mice that survived the RVFV infection showed mainly only low-grade, multifocal, lymphohistiocytic lesions in the liver, together with follicular hyperplasia in the spleen. MAbs could not completely neutralize the virus, but minimized viral replication, which could be successfully repelled by a successful and strong immune response in the mouse. This led to lymphocytosis as found in vaccine [

Therefore antibody treatment is characterized by a strong positive correlation between follicular hyperplasia and positive ELISA (r = 0.975; p = 0.00484*) and SNT (r = 0.921; p = 0.0261*) values and by a negative correlation with hepatitis (r = - 0.888; p = 0.0445*), virus replication in liver (r = - 0.925; p = 0.0242*) and viremia (r = - 0.93; p = 0.0219*). These findings were mainly seen in the combi groups, where a significantly low-grade hepatitis and frequent follicular hyperplasia was observed.
