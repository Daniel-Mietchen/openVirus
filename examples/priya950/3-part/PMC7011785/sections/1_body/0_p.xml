<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, originally isolated from the blood of a febrile rhesus macaque in the Ziika forest of Uganda in 1947 [

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], only 14 reports of human infection were documented in the literature before 2007 [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Subsequently, ZIKV began causing outbreaks on islands in the Pacific before reaching the Americas in 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Beginning in 2015 the virus sparked widespread epidemics in the Americas, garnering international attention due to its association with severe sequelae such as Guillain–Barré syndrome in previously healthy individuals as well as Congenital Zika Syndrome in infants whose mothers were infected during pregnancy [
