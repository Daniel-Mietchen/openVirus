<p>Overall, our results validate the principal role of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> as the only mosquito species to be directly incriminated via both experimental ZIKV transmission and surveillance results [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given the preponderance of evidence in support of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> as the principal ZIKV vector, and lack of direct evidence for a role of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. or other mosquitoes, public health resources should be prioritized for the abatement of this vector.
