<p>Although results of experimental vector competence studies are undeniably valuable, such analyses cannot capture the more complex behavioural and ecological considerations that contribute to the more meaningful measurement of vectorial capacity. However, data from the field should be interpreted utilizing context gleaned from experimental studies. Therefore, we report that pools of mosquitos gathered in close proximity to suspected human ZIKV patients during a Mexican outbreak had large amounts of ZIKV RNA present; three of these pools yielded viral isolates (ZIKV strains Mex 1-7, Mex 1-44, and Mex 2-81) that have been widely utilized since 2016 [

 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], indicating the possibility that the laboratory vector competence findings for 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> represent a specific virus/geographic mosquito strain combination that is conducive for transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, to date, only sequence data from one of these reported 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> derived strains have been deposited into GenBank [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], rendering it difficult for other groups to validate these findings.
