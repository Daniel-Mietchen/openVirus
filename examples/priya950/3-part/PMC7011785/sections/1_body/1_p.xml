<p>Identification of natural vectors during arboviral outbreaks is critical to both mosquito abatement and public health control strategies. It has been generally accepted that the principal urban vector of ZIKV is the yellow fever mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic>, although other species have been suggested through both field and experimental studies as having secondary roles (reviewed previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). However, the role of the southern house mosquito 
 <italic>Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus</italic>, typically the most abundant neotropical urban species, has remained controversial. Only two field-based studies have found any evidence of natural 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> infection by ZIKV [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, in both reports, the amount of ZIKV as measured by RNA titres using RT-qPCR was unlikely to be associated with transmission-competence; for example, Guedes et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. reported Ct values in field-collected pools of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> pools &gt;37, while the salivary gland pools analysed Elizondo-Quiroga et al. were cell culture-passaged prior to RNA assay [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], eliminating the ability to directly assess transmission potential. However, Guedes et al. correctly pointed out that no quantification of ZIKV titres from 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> field collections has been reported for comparison [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
