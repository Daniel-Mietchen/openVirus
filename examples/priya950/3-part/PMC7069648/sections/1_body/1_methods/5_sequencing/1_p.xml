<p>The RT-PCR products of pan-flavivirus RNA screening (~150 bp) and DENV-2 E-gene RT-PCR (~1500 bp) were Sanger sequenced (DNA sequencing and genomics laboratory, Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki). For obtaining complete genome data, next generation sequencing (NGS) was attempted from RNA extracted from patient samples or virus isolation samples using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The samples were prepared using a protocol modified from Conceicao-Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, the samples were filtered (0.4 μm filters), nuclease digested with benzonase (Millipore, Burlington, USA) and micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs, Ispwich, USA), and finally precipitated with polyethyl glycol (Abcam, PEG virus precipitation kit). Nucleic acid extraction was conducted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by reverse transcription and amplification using a WTA2 Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA). The amplified DNA was purified using a GeneJet PCR Purification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) and libraries prepared using a Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The library fragment size was estimated using agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration measured using a Qubit Broad-Range dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) and NEBNext Library Quant kit (New England BioLabs). The samples were sequenced using a MiSeq V2 reagent kit with 150 bp reads.
