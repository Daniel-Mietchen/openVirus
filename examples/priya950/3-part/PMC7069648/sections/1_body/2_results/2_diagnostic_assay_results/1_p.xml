<p>The IgG seroprevalences of patients sampled in Taita–Taveta was higher (14%) than in patients sampled in Nairobi (3%). Altogether, 9.1% (51/560) of samples were found to be positive in DENV IgG IFA and 3.9% (3/76) of IgM IFA positive samples were also positive by commercial IgM EIA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008099.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The IgG IFA titres ranged from 10 to 2560. 12 samples had low titres (10–20), 31 samples had intermediate titers (40–160) and 7 samples had high titers (640–2560). For one sample, the titre could not be determined after the initial screening dilution due to a lack of sample volume. In ZIKV antibody tests, 1/51 and 1/57 were found to be positive for ZIKV IgG and IgM, respectively.
