<p>According to Fisher’s exact test (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008099.s001">S1 Table</xref>), DENV marker positivity was significantly more common in Taita-Taveta compared with Nairobi, in age group ≥30 years compared with age group &lt;30 years and among females compared with males. In addition, contact with goats, chickens or bats was more common among ‘DENV marker positive’ than ‘DENV marker negative’ patients. When studied separately in Taita–Taveta patients, similar significant differences were found in age, gender and travel history (

Further statistical testing included examining the effects of risk factors in multivariable models which included confounding factors. In the county of Taita-Taveta only, the best model included the variables age, gender and travel history. In the whole study group of Taita-Taveta and Nairobi together, also significant interaction between the variables chicken and age was found (
