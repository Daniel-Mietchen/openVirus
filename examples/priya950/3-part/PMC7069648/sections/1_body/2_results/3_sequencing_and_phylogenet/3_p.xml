<p>Since there are more E-genes than complete genomes in the GenBank, a distinct data set was constructed from the closest BLAST search matches to the Kenyan DENV-2 E-genes. The E-gene sequence analysis (1485 bp) included 63 sequences from years 2009–2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008099.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Consistently with the complete coding sequence analysis, all the Kenyan sequences formed a monophyletic group most closely related to sequences from New Delhi, India, in the year 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (tMRCA: 2012 [95% HPD 2011–2012]). In addition to the strains mentioned above, the sister group included sequences originating from India and Singapore. Interestingly, the strain from a traveller patient returning from a trip to Djibouti and Ethiopia in 2016 was found to be closely associated with the New Delhi strains in the E-gene analysis. The recent (years 2016–2017) Kenyan strains formed a monophyletic cluster that was further divided into four highly supported subclusters. Strain c96 from Wundanyi in 2016 clustered together with a strain isolated from a patient travelling from Kenya to Taiwan in March 2016, whereas the strains 509 from Mwatate, 85A from Wundanyi and 222 from Voi in 2016 clustered together with three strains from Malindi in 2017.
