 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic trees of dengue virus 2 a) Complete open reading frame sequences and b) envelope gene sequences. In a) the nodes of respective tMRCAs are shown with arrows. For both a) and b), maximum clade credibility tree of dengue virus 2 are presented, including strains that had &gt;98% sequence identity in the BLAST search. Trees were constructed using the Bayesian MCMC method with the TN93 model of substitution with a 4-category gamma-distributed variation among sites and a proportion of invariable sites, log-normal relaxed clock model and exponential growth demographic model. Posterior probabilities are shown for each node.</p>
