<p>There currently are numerous unknowns including the presumed animal origins of the virus, the efficiency of human-to-human transmission, an understanding of the full spectrum of clinical illness and an incomplete epidemiological picture of disease activity in China. While our analysis does not account for the potential effects of the epidemic on changing travel behaviours, it reflects worldwide flows of airline travellers at the same time of year in 2019, including the Lunar New Year in February 2019. At the time of writing, flights and land transportation in and out of Wuhan have been suspended, and it is uncertain how this will impact disease transmission in China. Our findings could support public health planning and readiness for different scenarios should the current epidemic spread more widely across mainland China and neighbouring cities.</p>
