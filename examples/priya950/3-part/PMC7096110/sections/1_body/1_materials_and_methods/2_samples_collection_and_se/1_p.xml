<p>A total of 1,000 blood sample from 665 sheep, 228 goats, and 107 camels were collected. Of these samples, 617 samples were from the central slaughterhouse, 124 samples were from private farms, and 259 samples were kindly supplied from veterinary clinics affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture. Animal’s bio-data, such as type, gender, locality, and source, were recorded. Historical data showed that the sampled animals were not vaccinated against any of the studied microbes. The blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein of each animal by sterile syringes and stored in 6-ml vacutainer tubes that had no anticoagulant and allowed to coagulate in the laboratory for 30–45 min. Then, the clots were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, sera were separated and transferred to clean and sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at −20°C till use.</p>
