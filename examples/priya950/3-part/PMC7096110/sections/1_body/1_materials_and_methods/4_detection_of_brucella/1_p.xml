<p>Indirect ELISA test was used for the detection of antibodies against 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. suis</italic> in serum specimens. The diluted serum samples and controls were added to the microwells which were coated with purified 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic> lipopolysaccharides. If serum contained anti-Brucella antibodies, an antibody-antigen complex would be formed. Then, a horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added, and an antigen-antibody-conjugate was formed. After washing, a substrate was added, and the developed blue color relied on the concentration of antibodies in the tested serum. In the presence of antibodies, the blue solution turned into yellow after adding the stop solution. While no color developed if there were no antibodies in the serum sample.
