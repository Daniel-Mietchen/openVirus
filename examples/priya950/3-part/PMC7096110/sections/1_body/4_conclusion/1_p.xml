<p>The viral agents (RVFV and FMDV) were more prevalent than the bacterial agents (
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>C. abortus</italic>) in single and multiple patterns. Species susceptibility, locality, source, age, and gender had an impact on the prevalence rates. 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> were reported among the human population with a higher prevalence among males and old aged patients. Finding a link between human health and pathogens that circulate in domestic ruminants in Medina will help us to deal with such serious conditions.
