<p>Foot and mouth disease is one of the enzootic diseases in Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Every year, Saudi Arabia imports millions of ruminants for slaughter and many of them are imported from countries where FMDV is enzootic. These imported animals are either subclinically infected animals that might actively excrete FMDV virus or a carrier animal which might act as a possible source of infection [
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In humans, FMDV is considered very rare, but it has been reported mainly in connection with direct contact with infected animals or as a result of consumption of unpasteurized milk, dairy, or unprocessed meat products from infected animals. It is one of the diseases which impacted badly on farmers in most African countries [
 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the current study, FMDV serotype O was detected, the predominant serotype of the FMDV in Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The overall prevalence rate of FMDV serotype O was 27.8% and 7.9% in sheep and goats, respectively, while the camel’s sera didn’t show any positivity. There was a highly significant correlation for the presence of FMDV antibodies among sheep (

 <italic/>et al. [
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] isolated type O viruses from cattle and found out that 16 out of 31 samples collected were seropositive. Moreover, Hafez 
 <italic/>et al. [
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] detected antibodies against serotypes O in 92 reactors (38 sheep, 35 goats, and 19 cattle) in different regions of Saudi Arabia. In Riyadh and AL Qassim Province, Yousef [
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] found that only 24 (6.3%) out of 376 serum samples were positive for antibodies against serotype O in camels. Furthermore, in Riyadh, Mahmoud and Galbat [
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported FMDV serotype O in 38 (67%) sheep of a Marino flock. This variation in FMDV seroprevalence among different regions could be attributed to differences in climatic conditions, ecology, and overall exposure to the virus [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the present study, FMDV seroprevalence was much higher in male sheep (22.7%) than in females (5.1%) with a highly significant correlation (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the infected goats were all females (7.9%). Higher seroprevalence in male sheep could be attributed to the behavior of males that are constantly sneaking from one herd seeking a mating partner. It is widely accepted that contact is one of the common ways in which FMDV is spread between susceptible and infected animals [
