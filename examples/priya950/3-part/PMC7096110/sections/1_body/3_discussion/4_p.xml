<p>Brucellosis is the most reportable communicable disease according to Saudi Arabian National Guard communities. There are more than 8000 human cases reported each year to Saudi Arabian public health authorities [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Brucellosis was reported all over the kingdom, but with the highest incidence at Al-Jouf, Qassim and Aseer, with a marked increase in summer and spring. The rise in brucellosis frequency in Saudi Arabia is due to the inefficient animal husbandry and overall propensity for ingesting raw unpasteurized dairy products from infected camels or goats [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In general, most cases of brucellosis are treated like other diseases and usually labeled as fever of unknown causes. The real number of brucellosis cases is uncertain and is thought to be far more than the officially announced numbers [

People in Medina keep traditional lifestyles, where people communities live in close association with livestock such as sheep, goats, and camels, and consume their unpasteurized milk. In the period between 2015 and 2017, 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic> was detected at a rate of 61.3% and 38.7% in males and females patients, respectively, while 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> was at a rate of 59.8% in males and 40.2% in females. This was following several studies that have indicated male gender as a significant risk factor for brucellosis for several reasons, including those men had more close contact with animals [

 <italic>B. Abortus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> sole or mixed infection. Following other reports, the prevalence of brucellosis increased with age [
