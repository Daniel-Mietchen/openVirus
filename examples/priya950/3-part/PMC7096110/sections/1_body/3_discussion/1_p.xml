<p>Zoonoses are the infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The link between animals and human populations is very close in regions where peoples retain traditional lifestyles. Such contact, especially in absence of proper care can lead to a serious risk to public health with great economic consequences. Zoonotic diseases may occur through direct contact with the animal, through vectors, or water or food contamination [
