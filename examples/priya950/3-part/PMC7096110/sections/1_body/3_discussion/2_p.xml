<p>The present study was aimed to investigate the prevalence rates of Brucellosis, Chlamydiosis, RVFV, and FMDV in 665 sheep, 228 goats, and 107 camels in Medina, KSA. Among the livestock population in the KSA, sheep, goats, and camels accounted for 7.4 million, 4.2 million, and half a million, respectively [

They are considered as very important economic and food sources practically under certain religious circumstances (a period of pilgrimage), as its meat is the most preferred choice among people. Collecting data on the prevalence of these diseases is important not only for the economic impact of these diseases on the livestock but also because of its zoonotic nature, which initiates a series of events that constitute the pathogenesis of the infection. Since the animals were not vaccinated against the surveyed pathogens, the results may indicate that these bacterial and viral agents are circulating within the animal populations in Medina.
