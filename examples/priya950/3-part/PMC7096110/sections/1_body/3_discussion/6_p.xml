<p>In the year 2000, Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health in received reports of unexplained humans hemorrhagic fever and associated animal deaths from the southwestern border of Saudi Arabia [

 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The key aspect of RVFV in this epidemic was acute hepatitis associated with complications this epidemic renal failure, Central Nervous System involvement, thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, vision loss, and hemorrhagic manifestations. The outbreak occurs in climatic conditions favoring the breeding of mosquito and is most severe in goats, sheep, and cattle. It causes animals abortions and a high mortality rate in the new-borns. Non-pregnant older animals are susceptible to infection too, but they are more resistant to clinical disease [

 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, RVFV was detected in sheep (10.7%) and goats (17.9%) only. Nearby in Mecca, Mohamed et al. [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] tested sheep and goats and found that 16.8% were seropositive using competitive ELISA. In Jizan, RVFV was reported in 22 animals from 17 herds [
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Al-Ahsa Oasis, Al-Qabati, and Al-Afaleq found that only 2 out of 225 sheep sera were seropositive for RVFV, while goats, cattle, and camels did not show any positivity [
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, Boshra 
 <italic/>et al. [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found only a single positive sample among goats and sheep in both Aseer and Al Riyadh, while the Al-Ahsa had no seropositive animals. The variation in seroprevalences between reports is influenced by the animalâ€™s age, sampling season, sampling time, mixing of animals under same husbandry practices, the diagnostic test used, and virus maintenance and persistence of ecological stressors [
