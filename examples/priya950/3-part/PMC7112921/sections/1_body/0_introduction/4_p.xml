<p id="par0015">In the present study, these mAbs were tested for immunohistochemistry to detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Immunohistochemistry is a well-established and powerful method which is frequently used for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of animal experiments. Simple protocols allow precise correlation between the presence and severity of lesions and the amount of viral antigen in the respective localization (

However, for double or triple immunohistochemistry and -fluoresence labeling, it can be useful to have access to epitope-specific antibodies from different species, which can be used to visualize viral antigen in tissue sections. It was therefore the aim of the present study to evaluate the suitability of different human anti-MERS-S mAbs for detection of the respective antigen on FFPE material.
