<p id="par0035">Evaluation of HE stained slides by light microscopy revealed a mild to moderate, multifocal, lymphoplasmahistiocytic and suppurative rhinitis characterized by low numbers of intraepithelial neutrophils and lymphocytes and infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa by low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes, single plasma cells, and macrophages (
