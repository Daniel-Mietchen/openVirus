<p id="par0045">The use of the 1.2g5 antibody in a 1:5 dilution with heat-induced antigen retrieval showed the strongest signal of all tested non-commercially available antibodies. Detected antigen was present multifocally in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and segmentally along the apical membranous region of few infected cells (

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Vergara-Alert et al., 2017</xref>) but the number of labeled cells was considerably lower. Staining with the same antibody without pretreatment revealed a similar distribution of viral antigen in a comparable number of cells but a less prominent expression pattern (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), which is most likely linked to the lack of antigen unmasking which takes place during antigen retrieval (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Detection of MERS-CoV antigen by the 1.2g5 antibody was almost completely absent with pretreatment by enzymatic digestion in all three dilutions, resulting only in a pale brownish signal interpreted as non-specific background staining (data not shown). The antibody 1.10f3 showed a strong non-specific background staining in all dilutions and pretreatments. A moderately intense antigen-specific signal was detected multifocally in cilia of few cells using the lowest dilution and citrate pretreatment (
