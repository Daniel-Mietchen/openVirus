<p id="par0055">The tested antibodies in the present study were derived from transgenic mice expressing chimeric antibodies containing human variable domains and constant antibody domains of rat origin. For generation of fully human antibodies the human variable heavy and light chain encoding gene segments of the antibodies isolated from MERS-S immunized mice transgenic for human V genes were cloned into human IgG1 heavy and light chain expression vectors, respectively (

Since the positive staining antibodies 1.2g5, 1.10f3 and 1.6c7 recognize epitopes that belong to different functional groups (DPP4 binding, sialic acid binding and membrane fusion, respectively), the suitability of mAbs for use in immunohistochemistry cannot be predicted from the function of their target epitopes
