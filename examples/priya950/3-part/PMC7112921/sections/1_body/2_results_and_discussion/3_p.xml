<p id="par0040">For evaluation of human mAbs by immunohistochemistry, two of the tested antibodies (1.2g5 and 1.10f3) were applied in three different dilutions and three different pretreatments in a preliminary experiment to identify the best method for the use of human mAbs on FFPE tissue (

According to these results, all other antibodies (1.6c7, 1.6f9, 4.6e10, 7.7g6, 3.5g6, 1.8e5) were tested with heat-induced antigen retrieval and in the lowest dilution.
