<p id="par0025">Formalin-fixed tissue of nasal turbinates from two experimentally infected alpacas was obtained from an animal trial recently implemented at the Research Center for Animal Health (
 <italic>Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal</italic>, CReSA, Barcelona, Spain). The mucosa was carefully removed from underlying bone and embedded in paraffin according to a routinely used protocol. Serial sections of 4 μm thickness were mounted on coated glass slides (Superfrost Plus®, Menzel Co.) and the first section was stained with HE for evaluation by light microscopy and subsequent sections were processed for immunohistochemistry. For negative control, nasal turbinate of a non-infected alpaca (collected during routine necropsy at the Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany) was used. The animal died due to cachexia related to non-respiratory disease.
