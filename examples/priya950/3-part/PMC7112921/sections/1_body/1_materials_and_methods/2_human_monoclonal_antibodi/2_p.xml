<p id="par0020">The development of the eight diverse human mAbs directed against different epitopes of MERS-S protein has been published previously (
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Widjaja et al., 2019</xref>). Shortly, generation of anti-MERS-S H2L2 mAbs was achieved by recurrent immunization of transgenic H2L2 mice, which encode the human immunoglobulin variable regions, with the respective antigens and adjuvants (for preparation of antigens see original publications (

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Widjaja et al., 2019</xref>)). At day 74, four days after the last immunization, spleen and lymph nodes were harvested and hybridoma cell lines were generated using the SP2/0 myeloma cell line. For production of recombinant mAbs, cDNA’s encoding the variable heavy and light chain regions of anti-MERS-S H2L2 mAbs were cloned into expression plasmids containing the human IgG1 heavy chain and Ig kappa light chain constant regions, respectively. Recombinant human anti-MERS-S mAbs were produced in HEK-293 T cells following co-transfection of the IgG1 heavy and light chain expression plasmids (Invivogen) according to manufacturers’ protocols (

Purified antibodies were quantified using UV absorbance (280 nm) and Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE analysis was applied in addition. Antibodies were stored at 4 °C until further use. After screening for MERS-S reactivity and neutralizing capacity eight different mAbs (
