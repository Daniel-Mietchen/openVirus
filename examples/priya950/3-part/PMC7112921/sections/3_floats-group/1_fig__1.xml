  <p>Representative HE findings in respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates of MERS-CoV-infected alpacas and immunohistochemical reactions of the commercially available positive controls for comparison. (A) Multifocal infiltration of lamina propria and submucosa by moderate numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, and single neutrophilic granulocytes (asterisk). (B) Exocytosis of single neutrophilic granulocytes (grey arrow). (C, D) Abundant viral antigen was detected multifocally in the cytoplasm and along the apical membranous region of epithelial cells using a monoclonal mouse (C, Sino Biological Inc.) and polyclonal rabbit anti-MERS-CoV nucleocapsid antibody (D, Sino Biological Inc.) with citrate pretreatment, in a dilution of 1:70 and 1:2,000, respectively. Both antibodies exhibited a similar staining intensity. (A, B) HE staining; 400x, (C, D) Avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine as chromogen; 400x.</p>
