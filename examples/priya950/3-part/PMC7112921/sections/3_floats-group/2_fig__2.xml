  <p>Representative positive immunohistochemical reactions for human monoclonal antibodies. (A) Antibody 1.2g5 with citrate pretreatment exhibited a strong multifocal MERS-CoV antigen specific signal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelial cells (arrow) and segmentally along the apical membranous region (arrow heads). (B) The same protocol without pretreatment revealed a much fainter but similarly distributed staining of cytoplasm (arrow) and ciliary base (arrow heads). (C) Antibody 1.10f3 with citrate pretreatment displayed a strong diffuse background staining and only few positively stained cilia (arrowhead). Single intraepithelial plasma cells displayed a strong false positive intracytoplasmic staining (white arrow). (D) Antibody 1.6c7 with citrate pretreatment exhibited also a strong diffuse background staining and only few positive staining cilia (arrow heads). (A–D) Avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen; 400x.</p>
