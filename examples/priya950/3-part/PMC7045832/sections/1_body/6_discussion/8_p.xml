<p>Our study has several limitations. First, participation in the network was voluntary, so the distribution of the network does not represent the entire country. Currently, network laboratories are located primarily in eastern and southern China, which generally have better infrastructure. Second, the epidemiologic information for each outbreak collected by CaliciNet China is still limited; however, China CDC is making efforts to include more epidemiologic staff in the network and collect more complete and accurate epidemiologic data. Third, the timeliness of the data reporting in CaliciNet needs to be improved. For a variety of reasons, not all network laboratories were able to submit data to China CDC on a monthly basis. In the future, submission of epidemiologic and laboratory data through a Web-based information system will enable uploading of data in near real time.</p>
