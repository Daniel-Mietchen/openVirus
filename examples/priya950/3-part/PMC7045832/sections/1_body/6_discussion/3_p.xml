<p>Previous data from CaliciNet and NoroNet have suggested a correlation of certain genotypes with different transmission modes and outbreak settings. Specifically, GII.4 viruses have been associated with person-to-person transmission, whereas non-GII.4 viruses, such as GI.3, GI.6, GI.7, GII.3, GII.6, and GII.12, are more often associated with foodborne transmission (

In our study, all outbreaks caused by GII.4 Sydney[P31] were transmitted from person to person; however, GII.2[P16] viruses predominated among both person-to-person and foodborne outbreaks. A recent study also reported that GII.2 outbreaks were transmitted from person to person (77.8%) and food (17.5%) (
