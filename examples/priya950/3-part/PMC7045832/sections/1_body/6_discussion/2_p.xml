<p>As found in studies in other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, we found the number of norovirus outbreaks was highest during Octoberâ€“March (

 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>), as the most common settings for norovirus outbreaks. In contrast, in the United States and Europe, healthcare facilities (primarily nursing homes and hospitals) are the most commonly reported setting for norovirus outbreaks (

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>) and the enhanced monitoring and reporting of any outbreaks in schools in China. In 2006, the national government started to require school officials to check and screen children attending kindergarten, primary school, and middle schools each morning for fever, vomiting, or diarrhea (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>). This program has helped facilitate the detection and reporting of infectious diseases, including norovirus, at kindergartens and schools. However, we received few norovirus outbreak reports from other settings involving more adults and elderly persons (such as companies, restaurants, and nursing homes). This difference in the collection of norovirus outbreaks between school and other settings may cause potential bias of the strain patterns of norovirus.
