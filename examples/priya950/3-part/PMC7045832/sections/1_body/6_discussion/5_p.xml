<p>During winter 2014–15, GII.17 was reported as the predominant norovirus strain in China, accounting for 67.2% of outbreaks, whereas during the following winter (2015–16), the proportion of GII.17 outbreaks decreased to 25.0% (

Although the antigenicity and histo-blood group antigen binding profile of the early 2016–2017 and pre-2016 GII.2 noroviruses were similar, 1 GII.2[P16] strain with single Val256Ile mutation and the conventionally orientated Asp382 in VP1 showed an expanded histo-blood group antigen binding spectrum in China (
