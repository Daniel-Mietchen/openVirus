<p>Since 2002, GII.4 has been the predominant norovirus genotype in outbreaks in many countries, and every 2–4 years, new GII.4 variants have emerged, displacing previous variants, several of which have been associated with increased norovirus outbreaks worldwide (

Previous studies indicated that global epidemics, including in China, were caused by GII.4 Den Haag (2006b) variant in 2006–2007, New Orleans variant in 2009–2010, and GII.4 Sydney variant in 2012–2013. Although GII.4 Sydney has predominated globally, non-GII.4 strains (GII.17[P17], and GII.2[P16]) have caused 2 recent norovirus epidemics in China (
