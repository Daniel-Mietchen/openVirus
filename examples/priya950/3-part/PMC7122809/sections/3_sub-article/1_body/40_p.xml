<p>Reviewer #2: Overall, the analysis is clearly presented and the paper proceeds in a logical manner. However, the measure of association in the body of the paper, adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) does not match the measure in abstract (adjusted odds ratio, aOR). Please change the measure and language in the abstract (AOR, "associated with a higher risk of ZIKV") to match the body of the text (APR, "associated with a significant increase of ZIKV prevalence").</p>
