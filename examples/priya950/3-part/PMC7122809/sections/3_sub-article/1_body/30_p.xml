<p>However, the stated study design of "a retrospective case-control" is incorrect in reference to the study sample and analytic approach. The sample of of "all deliveries or medical abortions between January 2016 and December 2016" and the use of prevalence ratios suggest that a "cross-sectional study design" better describes this work. The sample was taken from a singular point in time. The authors then estimate the association between disease prevalence (ZIKV serology) and other prevalent health factors (precariousness via health insurance status) at that point in time. All of which is suggestion of a cross sectional study, not a case control.</p>
