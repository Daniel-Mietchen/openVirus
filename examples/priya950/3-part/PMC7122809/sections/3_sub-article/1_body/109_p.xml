<p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting analysis acceptable for publication following minor revisions. One minor thematic point relates on the authors comments on "The unusual distribution of mircocephaly in Brazil, suggested a possible link between poverty and the risk of ZIKV related microcephaly..." The association between poverty and increased risk of infectious disease should not be considered unusual. Especially given the authors prior notes concerning the lack of sanitation and presence of disease carring insects in poor neighborhoods in French Guiana.</p>
