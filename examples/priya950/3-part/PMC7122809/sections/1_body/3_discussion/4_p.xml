<p>These results, previous observations on dengue and CHIKV, observations in patient with chronic diseases, in pregnant women, and in persons renouncing to health care all suggest that social inequalities of health often affect the same populations with poorer living conditions and reduced access to care and prevention.[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The present results emphasize that population approaches for a range of selected problems may be more pertinent than an array of vertical social programs in different populations. Indeed, many community approaches are presently funded as thematic (HIV prevention and testing, addictionsâ€¦) and community worker thus often only focus on a single theme hence missing opportunities to improve outcomes for other important health problems. Relationship between social aspects and seropositivity to ZIKV, to DENV (p&lt;10

 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggests a complex interplay between individual factors and ecological/environmental factors.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] At the individual level, underprivileged populations often have lower levels of health literacy; they often live in shacks surrounded by mosquito-breeding grounds and little protection from vectors. At the ecological level, these individual situations add up, and in addition, these populations generally gather in informal habitats in areas that are more likely to have high vector densities, and to be less prioritized by municipal and regional services.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Further studies should aim precisely define the potential multilevel causal paths underpinning this statistical association: A better mapping of vector breeding sites in priority areas, specific knowledge attitudes and behavior studies in underprivileged populations, a survey of the geographic distribution of vector-control interventions, notably relative to underprivileged areas. Such data would allow devising interventions aiming at improving health literacy and empowering populations relative to the prevention of vector-borne diseases, and improving the reach of vector-control by specifically targeting such areas.
