<p>The autochthonous transmission for the first chikunguya (CHIKV) outbreak in FG (2014), mainly affected foreign populations with precarious social status and those living in poor neighborhoods. In contrast, after further epidemics of dengue virus (DENV) in 2013, populations living in richer areas were mostly concerned. One hypothesis was that poor populations were more likely to have been immunized during previous DENV epidemics because of greater vector densities and transmission in these areas, whereas in rich neighborhoods populations were more likely to come from France and not be immunized thus being at risk for clinical disease[
