<p>Serum and urine samples collected for RT-PCR analysis were obtained during trimestrial surveillance and during possible acute symptomatic illnesses, or in the presence of fetal death or fetal structural abnormalities. Placenta and amniotic liquid were assayed for ZIKV RNA by real time RT-PCR using the Lanciotti method[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the RealStar ZIKV RT-PCR kit, or ELISA serology. Analyses were realized by the National Reference Center of Arboviruses of Pasteur Institute in French Guiana and by the Cayenne Hospital laboratory. Neutralization for IgG could not be implemented, therefore we excluded probable cases with negative IgM and positive IgG.
