It has the highest Gross Domestic Product per capita in South America, and thus attracts numerous migrants in search of better economic opportunities. Women, and notably migrant women in FG, are especially concerned by inequity with low school enrolment, unemployment, teen pregnancies, and single parenthood [<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The increase of vulnerable populations is a challenge for the health and social systems on a scale that is far greater in French Guiana than in mainland France[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In studies on health inequalities in French Guiana, being an immigrant is also associated with poverty, vulnerability and difficulties in accessing care leading to poor health outcomes.</p><p>Poor neighborhoods, with informal housing, lack of sanitation and presence of vector breeding places are especially suited for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the main vector for arboviruses in FG. This urban mosquito preferentially breeds around human dwellings, in outdoor water storage containers and in any recipient containing stagnant rain water. Densely populated areas with sustained human activity during the day are perfect for a daytime feeder that can bite several people in a short period of time [<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The autochthonous transmission for the first chikunguya (CHIKV) outbreak in FG (2014), mainly affected foreign populations with precarious social status and those living in poor neighborhoods. In contrast, after further epidemics of dengue virus (DENV) in 2013, populations living in richer areas were mostly concerned. One hypothesis was that poor populations were more likely to have been immunized during previous DENV epidemics because of greater vector densities and transmission in these areas, whereas in rich neighborhoods populations were more likely to come from France and not be immunized thus being at risk for clinical disease[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The distribution of microcephaly in Brazil suggested a possible link between poverty and the risk of Zika virus -related microcephaly[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This epidemic spread to neighboring French Guiana in 2016, but until now there was no study of the impact of poverty on the prevalence of infection. In order to deal with the important proportion of asymptomatic Zika virus (ZIKV) infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and a risk of delayed access to medical care in poor populations,[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] ZIKV serology was recommended at each trimester for all seronegative pregnant women. A first analysis of data collected during the 4 first months of the outbreak provided a representative picture of the spectrum of disease of ZIKV infection in pregnant women and mapped the intensity of the epidemic throughout French Guiana[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however it did not look at specific subpopulations of pregnant women. However, the serological surveillance at each trimester during the ZIKV outbreak in 2016 allowed us to test whether the poorest pregnant women were more likely to acquire ZIKV than more socioeconomically privileged women. The objective of the study was thus to compare the prevalence of ZIKV contact in FG for pregnant women according to their health insurance status (HIS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in Cayenne (CHAR), Kourou (CHK) and Saint Laurent (CHOG) hospital, the main cities and the main hospitals in FG.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Population</title><p>We included all deliveries, spontaneous abortions or pregnancy terminations for medical reasons between January 2016 and December 2016, 3 months after the official declaration of the end of the outbreak.

Data were collected by clinicians, pediatric nurses, or midwives in charge of pregnancy monitoring in the 3 hospital maternity wards. clinical, socio-demographic and geographical individual data were collected at enrolment and at each obstetrical consultation by interviewing the pregnant women. The following variables were available: age, area of residence, pregnancy trimester and pregnancy outcomes (type, date, attendant, place, and last menstruation date). Health insurance information was obtained from the hospital information systems (PMSI) of Cayenne and Saint Laurent du Maroni hospital, but not from Kourou hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Health insurance status</title><p>For health insurance status, we distinguished between patients in a precarious social situation and those who were not. Patients without any health insurance[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], those benefiting from free universal health care called Protection Universelle Maladie (PUMa) (which allows access to health for legal residents who are not already covered usually associated with a complementary insurance the CMUc), or those benefiting from &#x0201c;state medical aid&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;AME&#x0201d; (government run insurance program specifically conceived for undocumented migrants who become eligible after 3 months of residency in a French territory) were considered to be in a precarious social situation. Indeed, the annual income of a single person should be less than 8653.16 &#x020ac; (a very low income for French Guiana) to benefit from the above health insurance regimens. Persons with regular social security were considered non precarious. Women seen in Kourou maternity had no health insurance information. Women without health insurance can receive free care (including ZIKV screening) at the hospital after receiving a &#x0201c;PASS&#x0201d; voucher from a hospital social worker, which allows covering all expenses.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study area</title><p>We will subsequently refer to different town groupings: Western, savanas, central coastal, and Eastern. The main groups living in the western area are the Maroons, descendants of escaped slaves (15% of the total population of French Guiana) and Amerindians (3%) who live in the south west. Savannas include a mix of previous ethnicities and international workers for aerospace industries. The population of the Central Coastal area is marked by local ethnic groups including Creoles (60% of the total population), people of European ancestry (14%) who essentially come from mainland France and various immigrants from Brazil, Haiti, Caribbean islands, China and southern Asia. The eastern region includes a mix of creole and Amerindian populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Laboratory diagnosis</title><p>Serum and urine samples collected for RT-PCR analysis were obtained during trimestrial surveillance and during possible acute symptomatic illnesses, or in the presence of fetal death or fetal structural abnormalities. Placenta and amniotic liquid were assayed for ZIKV RNA by real time RT-PCR using the Lanciotti method[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the RealStar ZIKV RT-PCR kit, or ELISA serology. Analyses were realized by the National Reference Center of Arboviruses of Pasteur Institute in French Guiana and by the Cayenne Hospital laboratory.

Because of the absence of reply from the medical information department in Kourou, the 2,621 women (39%) with unknown health insurance mostly lived in Kourou (20%). For this study, 4,380 pregnant women were included with at least one sample and with available health insurance information reporting. The final population analyzed count 3,439 women, because 837/6654 women had positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture. Overall 16.5% of precarious women had positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture whereas 9.82% of women with normal health insurance had positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture, P&#x0003c;0.001.</p><p>The average age of the study population was 27.9 years-old (range 12&#x02013;52 years).

Women with a unique sample at the end of pregnancy were 1,168 (13.9%). Abortion represented 216 (3.7%) of the 5817 recorded pregnancy outcomes. The term at diagnosis was compiled for 2,968 (86.3%) women with an average term at sample of 28&#x000b1;10 weeks of amenorrhea (range: 2&#x02013;42 WA). Regarding residence location: Central Coastal area (6 communes) represented 33.8% of the study population (1,163/3,439 births), Western French Guiana (8 communes), represented 62.4% of births

id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present results show that the proportion of ZIKV-positive women was significantly greater in precarious women overall, and mostly in undocumented foreign women. Indeed, in the subgroup of precarious women, there was a trend suggesting greater exposure for undocumented women, presumably because they often live in shantytowns where vector proliferation and contact is greater than among documented precarious women who may have greater access to subsidized housing. Overall Western French Guiana was more affected than the rest of the territory[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The greater proportion of women with positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture whereas 9.82% of women with normal health insurance had positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture, P&#x0003c;0.00in the precarious group may also have reflected earlier infections during pregnancy, thus a proxy for greater risk.</p><p>Women living beyond the Coastal areas, where vector control is not as developed as in urban areas, were also significantly more likely to be infected by ZIKV.</p><p>The variables used are a coarse proxy for environmental and behavioral aspects linked to poverty, which were not measured. However they have been robustly associated with a number of chronic and acute health problems in French Guiana. [<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]The present study was hospital-based and the exact health insurance status was not always recorded for different reasons: lack of time in a busy obstetrical ward, communication problems because of the very large number of women who do not speak French. Although, the type of health insurance is based on legal or illegal residence, length of stay, and on having an income below a certain threshold, it is conceivable that health insurance as a proxy for social precariousness is not perfect and that some women in the regular health insurance group may have been precarious. The limited number of adjustment variables, notably the living area used for the analysis did not allow to precisely study confounding between individual and collective socio-economic determinants. Despite these limitations, the present results were not a quest for any significant p value but were a clearly defined <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis that was tested with the available data from the 2 biggest maternities in French Guiana, which capture most deliveries.</p><p>These results, previous observations on dengue and CHIKV, observations in patient with chronic diseases, in pregnant women, and in persons renouncing to health care all suggest that social inequalities of health often affect the same populations with poorer living conditions and reduced access to care and prevention.[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The present results emphasize that population approaches for a range of selected problems may be more pertinent than an array of vertical social programs in different populations. Indeed, many community approaches are presently funded as thematic (HIV prevention and testing, addictions&#x02026;) and community worker thus often only focus on a single theme hence missing opportunities to improve outcomes for other important health problems. Relationship between social aspects and seropositivity to ZIKV, to DENV (p&#x0003c;10<sup>12</sup>)[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and to CHIKV (p&#x0003c;10<sup>15</sup>) [<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggests a complex interplay between individual factors and ecological/environmental factors.[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] At the individual level, underprivileged populations often have lower levels of health literacy; they often live in shacks surrounded by mosquito-breeding grounds and little protection from vectors. At the ecological level, these individual situations add up, and in addition, these populations generally gather in informal habitats in areas that are more likely to have high vector densities, and to be less prioritized by municipal and regional services.[<xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Further studies should aim precisely define the potential multilevel causal paths underpinning this statistical association: A better mapping of vector breeding sites in priority areas, specific knowledge attitudes and behavior studies in underprivileged populations, a survey of the geographic distribution of vector-control interventions, notably relative to underprivileged areas. Such data would allow devising interventions aiming at improving health literacy and empowering populations relative to the prevention of vector-borne diseases, and improving the reach of vector-control by specifically targeting such areas.</p><p>In conclusion, during the ZIKV epidemic in French Guiana, precarious pregnant women and women living in Western French Guiana were significantly more affected by ZIKV than non-precarious women and women living in Central coastal areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008193.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008193.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0008193.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Femmes et hommes en Guyane&#x0202f;: regard sur la parit&#x000e9; aux diff&#x000e9;rents &#x000e2;ges de la vie&#x02014;Insee Analyses Guyane&#x02014;21.

The study design and the population have to be more precisely detailed. The sample size is large. Analysis is correct but lack go adjustment. No concern about ethical or regulatory requirements.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The objectives of this study are clearly stated in the the hypothesis "that in pregnant women Zika Virus (ZIKV) was more frequent in precarious women than in non-precarious women as reflected by their health insurance status". The analytic approach supports the aims of the hypothesis. </p><p>However, the stated study design of "a retrospective case-control" is incorrect in reference to the study sample and analytic approach. The sample of of "all deliveries or medical abortions between January 2016 and December 2016" and the use of prevalence ratios suggest that a "cross-sectional study design" better describes this work. The sample was taken from a singular point in time. The authors then estimate the association between disease prevalence (ZIKV serology) and other prevalent health factors (precariousness via health insurance status) at that point in time. All of which is suggestion of a cross sectional study, not a case control.</p><p>Reviewer #3: How can we be sure that woment with regular health insurance are not precarious?</p><p>The reason why neutralization for IgG could not be implemented should be explained.</p><p>Why is there no mention of an ethical committee for this study?</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Results</bold></p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1: Analysis match the analysis plan but the results have to be completed to be comprehensive.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Overall, the analysis is clearly presented and the paper proceeds in a logical manner. However, the measure of association in the body of the paper, adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) does not match the measure in abstract (adjusted odds ratio, aOR). Please change the measure and language in the abstract (AOR, "associated with a higher risk of ZIKV") to match the body of the text (APR, "associated with a significant increase of ZIKV prevalence").</p><p>Reviewer #3: We need to understand who are the 837/6654 women who had positive IgG and negative IgM serology without immunocapture. It could represent a biais for the final analysis.</p><p>The 2,621 women (39%) with unknown health insurance lived principally in Kourou</p><p>municipality (20%).

The proportion of women affected by Zika infection is very high and women in precarious situations seem more often concerned.</p><p>Although the study is monocentric, the number of pregnant women included is large. </p><p>In view of the existence in France of health insurance coverage for the poor and the undocumented (Compl&#x000e9;mentaire Sant&#x000e9; Solidaire -CSS- and Aide M&#x000e9;dicale d&#x02019;Etat &#x02013; AME-), the status relating to health insurance is a good proxy for measuring precariousness. However, it could be useful to discuss the lack of more precise data on the social situation. In particular, how were people without health insurance coverage treated?</p><p>As the rights to CSS and AME run 12 months regardless of changes in administrative status, the social situation of people may be different than that announced (undocumented migrants, precarious and non-precarious French resident )</p><p>Specific comments for revision</p><p>Title:</p><p>Zika Virus should be written in full in the title</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Avoid repetitions &#x0201c;Most pregnant women were precarious 2275/3439. Most women were precarious but&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Please specify the number of women belonging to the 3 analysis categories (undocumented, precarious, non-precarious)</p><p>Avoid &#x0201c;as elsewhere,&#x0201d; in the conclusion.</p><p>In addition to the inequalities of vector control by neighborhoods, it would be interesting to question the differences in personal behavior in the application of these same measures</p><p>Manuscript:</p><p>Authors&#x02019; affiliations: an affiliation does not correspond to any author (4 Regional epidemiology unit of French Public Health Agency, Cayenne, French Guiana)</p><p>Detail abbreviations: GDP</p><p>Between the summary which speaks of a monocentric study and the results which speak of 3 sites, it is not clear who was included in this study</p><p>Corrected &#x0201c;assurance&#x0201d;.</p><p>There are inaccuracies to correct on French health insurance coverage</p><p>The Universal health coverage (=CMU) (basic health insurance coverage implemented in 1999) no longer exists since 2016, it was merged with national Health Insurance (Assurance maladie) during the Universal Health Protection reform (Protection universelle maladie -Puma-). In addition, the CMU does not have a 3-month residency obligation in France, unlike the AME.</p><p>The complementary universal health coverage (=CMUC) changed its name on 1/11/2019 when it was merged with Aid to complementary health (=ACS) and is now called complementary health solidarity (Compl&#x000e9;mentaire Sant&#x000e9; Solidaire = CSS)</p><p>In addition, the CMU does not have a 3-month residency obligation in France, unlike the AME</p><p>Please specify for CSS and AME the resource criteria which explain why they can be used as a proxy for their social status</p><p>Prefer the term national Health Insurance (Assurance maladie) to that of social security (S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; Sociale) for others</p><p>The paragraph on the biological diagnosis must be reviewed and clarified</p><p>Avoid &#x0201c; extraordinary context&#x0201d;</p><p>The methods of collecting data must be more precisely described. Likewise, it is not clear which motherhood participated and why.</p><p>A flow chart specifying the site for monitoring women and their health coverage would be welcome</p><p>If prevalence ratio from Poisson regression were used, why in the abstract we found Odds Ratio?</p><p>The procedures for diagnosing Zika infection should be described much more precisely:% of women diagnosed with PCR,% of women diagnosed with serology and in what term, with what result of the previous serology, etc. A detailed table would be welcome. These results will ideally be presented according to the 3 study categories</p><p>&#x0201c;and no insurance: APR = 1.59&#x0201d;? You did not specify before having included people without health insurance. What are they? Profile?</p><p>Table 1: detail the abbreviations at the bottom of the table. Specify the method of analysis in the title.</p><p>Why not have adjusted model on age? Other adjustment variables, if available, would be welcome. The model as it is is difficult to interpret.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Can you discuss further why vector control measures are less implemented in certain regions and the policy of the regional health agency on this point. In particular, a qualitative insight into the real situation in the districts concerned would be useful for understanding the results.</p><p>The discussion could be enriched with international references having investigated the relationships between arboviruses and social situation</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting analysis acceptable for publication following minor revisions. One minor thematic point relates on the authors comments on "The unusual distribution of mircocephaly in Brazil, suggested a possible link between poverty and the risk of ZIKV related microcephaly..." The association between poverty and increased risk of infectious disease should not be considered unusual. Especially given the authors prior notes concerning the lack of sanitation and presence of disease carring insects in poor neighborhoods in French Guiana.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This an interesting study that highlights the fact that precarious people are more at risk of Zika infection in French Guiana.
