<p>This situation rendered usual sequencing techniques inappropriate and, with the constraint of limited availability of biological resources, led to imagining a different typing strategy:

   <p>We used the extremely sensitive Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA) technology (Hologic, Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States [

   <p>We performed in silico sequence analysis to identify genomic regions in which genotype-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) would allow a clear distinction between the African and Asian genotypes of ZIKV. Such SNPs are present in different parts of the genome, but the Pr gene is of specific interest because it includes 16 SNPs, which individually strictly discriminate between the Asian and African genotype (see 
    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00296-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). It is therefore expected that sequencing this region would allow the unambiguous identification of the genotype incriminated. We designed a hemi-nested PCR set of primers allowing the amplification of a 139-nt sequence (primers excluded), including these SNPs (

When tested, electrophoresis onto agarose gels of secondary PCR products revealed a band corresponding to the expected size in Case 3 from Day 1â€™s sample for three replicates, whereas PBS controls remained negative.
