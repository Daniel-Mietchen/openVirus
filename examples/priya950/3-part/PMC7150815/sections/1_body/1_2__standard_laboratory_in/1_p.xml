<p>The first case, a 52-year-old woman, and then two additional cases, respectively a 47-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman, were identified using serological techniques. All cases were neighbours living in the same area (&lt;100 m radius); they did not know each other. Neither cases nor sexual partners were found to have travelled outside the city within the 15 days before the onset of symptoms. Serology performed on the children and partners of the cases were negative. No Asian shop or warehouse receiving stock from Asia were found in this residential area. Earlier samples were tested by molecular approaches, whereas later ones were tested using in-house ELISA with a whole precipitated and inactivated virus, Zika EDIII recombinant protein (IgM and IgG antibodies to ZIKV), and confirmed by virus neutralization test. All cases were found positive in ELISA, Zika EDIII-based ELISA and virus neutralization, and negative for neutralizing antibodies against West-Nile and Dengue serotype 1 to 4 viruses [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00296" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) in serum, urine and semen were negative, even in early samples collected less than two days after onset. This was presumably because of a conjunction of unfavourable circumstances including initial low viral loads, iterative freezeâ€“thaw cycles and suboptimal conservation temperatures.
