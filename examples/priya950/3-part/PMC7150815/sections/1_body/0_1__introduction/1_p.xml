<p>The first vector-borne transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Europe has been reported recently [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00296" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It occurred during August 2019 in the Mediterranean coastal department of Var (city of Hyeres) within an area of permanent implantation of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, which represents the only potential vector locally. During the first steps of investigation, a small cluster of three cases that occurred in August 2019 was discovered retrospectively (in October 2019) within a circle with a radius 50 meters. The index case was not identified and the issue of the geographical origin and genetic typing of the virus strain remained unanswered. This question is of specific importance since recent vector competence studies suggested that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from France can transmit more efficiently the African genotype of ZIKV than the Asian genotype [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00296" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The latter includes both viruses that have been circulating in Asia for decades (as far as is known without causing large epidemics), and viruses that circulated during the recent important outbreaks in the Americas (mostly Latin America and the Caribbean) [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00296" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00296" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to determine the ZIKV genotype implicated in cases of local transmission in France, 2019.
