<p>The mammalian arboviruses may be much more vector generalist than their avian counterparts. The broad utilization of multiple mosquito species may explain why we found no strong spatial or habitat associations among the four analyzed mammalian arboviruses. The prevalence of mammalian arboviruses in multiple mosquito species and habitats throughout the state could reflect a number of mechanisms, none of which are mutually exclusive. White-tailed deer (
