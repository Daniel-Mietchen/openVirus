<p>Finally, our data strongly suggests that JCV associates with two functional groups of vectors. Univoltine 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. appear to function as overwintering reservoir hosts as well as vectors that contribute to viral persistence and early season amplification, while multivoltine 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. (and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>punctipennis</italic>) may act as further amplifying vectors later within a season. A similar mechanism of seasonal persistence in overwintering/amplification vectors has been proposed for Ross River virus in Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The recent rise in the diagnosis of clinical manifestations of human disease with JCV in the upper Midwest and northeast U.S. over the last decade [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] clearly indicate that more research is needed to confirm the functional importance of overwintering and amplifying vectors in the JCV transmission cycle. We additionally encourage greater scrutiny of similar overwintering/amplification predictions for WNV and other avian arboviruses [
