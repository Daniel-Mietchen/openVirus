<p>Overall, blood feeding ecology was the strongest driver of the likelihood of a mosquito species to harbor a specific arboviral infection. For the avian arboviruses of human importance (WNV and EEEV), the majority of arboviral isolations were limited to a small subset of the avian-biting mosquito species in CT. Our analyses confirm that

 <italic>pipiens</italic> is the primary vector of WNV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and 
 <italic>Cs</italic>. 
 <italic>melanura</italic> is the primary vector of EEEV [

 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>restuans</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>salinarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cs</italic>. 
 <italic>melanura</italic>. Though all three species shared a statistical association with WNV, WNV infections in these species were most frequently detected during peak epizootic activity, and we found no evidence that these secondary vectors contributed to any significant levels of arboviral transmission during inter-enzootic periods (i.e., spring/fall) [

 <italic>Cs</italic>. 
 <italic>melanura</italic> was the only species to share a statistical association with the virus, and EEEV isolations from the remaining vector species could be used as proxies for transmission intensity rather than represent functional contributions to transmission.
