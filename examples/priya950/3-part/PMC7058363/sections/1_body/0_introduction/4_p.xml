<p>If multiple mosquito species are involved in the transmission of an arbovirus, the effort needed to control such a disease increases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish if and when detected infections represent a realized risk to both humans and wildlife. In this report, we quantified the generality of multi-mosquito species arboviral infections using a long-term mosquito and arbovirus surveillance data set. Mosquitoes and their arboviruses have been monitored in the State of Connecticut since 1996, and over 87 trapping locations have been sampled annually for 18 years. Our study objectives were to: 1) identify drivers of and relationships between variation in mosquito and arbovirus community composition among sites and years, and 2) quantify arbovirus detection likelihoods across mosquito species in order to characterize the general risk of arboviral exposure to human populations in the presence of diverse mosquito communities. Our results provide insights into the ecological and epidemiological complexity of zoonotic arboviruses and inform both the design and implementation of arboviral surveillance and control.
