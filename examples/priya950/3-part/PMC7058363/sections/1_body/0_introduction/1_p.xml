<p>Arboviruses of zoonotic origin continue to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. West Nile virus (WNV) remains the leading cause of locally acquired arboviral disease, while other mosquito-borne viruses such as Cache Valley virus (CVV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and La Crosse virus (LACV) cause sporadic cases with occasional outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Severe manifestations of human arboviral disease are infrequent; however, clinical diagnosis of several of these arboviruses has steadily increased in the U.S. in recent years [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse) as well as the resurgence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> L. in the continental U.S. have increased the potential for introduction and local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, all of which currently circulate in tropical U.S. territories [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As mosquitoes and their viruses continue to traverse the globe and emerge in unpredictable ways, the U.S. is expected to face an increasing arboviral public health burden in its future [
