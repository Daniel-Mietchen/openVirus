<p>Studies that have attempted to link indices of entomological risk to metrics of specific arboviral infections have yielded mixed results. In the WNV system, research in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. did not find a direct relationship between indices of mosquito diversity and WNV infection rates in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a study in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. concluded that WNV infections in non-
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito species likely represent events of vector spillover rather than functional contributions to arboviral transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Outside of the WNV system (which is arguably the most-studied zoonotic arbovirus in the U.S.), detecting infections in multiple mosquito species is commonâ€“especially among certain mammalian host arboviruses. Longitudinal surveillance of both CVV and JCV in the northeast U.S. has consistently isolated these arboviruses in multiple mosquito species with no clear primary vector species [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Research on the mammalian arboviruses is limited in the U.S., and whether or not multi-species infections are an important feature of mammalian arbovirus perpetuation has not been investigated.
