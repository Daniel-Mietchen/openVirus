<p>In 18 years (2001â€“2018) of surveillance with CDC light and gravid traps, CAES tested 213,101 pools (3,100,263 individual mosquitoes) with 3,640 pools (1.71%) testing positive for an arbovirus. West Nile virus was the most commonly isolated arbovirus (58.7% of all positive samples): WNV was also isolated in all 18 years of surveillance, at the largest number of surveillance sites (n = 84), and in one-half of all tested species (

Jamestown Canyon virus was the next most commonly isolated arbovirus, accounting for 11.5% of all virus isolations with detections in every season, at 86.2% of sampling sites, and in over half (52.2%) of tested species. The remaining virus isolates were: POTV (10.2% isolates, 44.4% years, 87.4% sites, 45.7% species), EEEV (8.16% isolates, 66.7% years, 39.1% sites, 39.1% species), CVV (5.22% isolates, 61.1% years, 72.4% sites, 37.0% species), HJV (3.76% isolates, 50.0% years, 36.8% sites, 34.8% species), and TVTV (2.61% isolates, 66.7% years, 23.0% sites, 21.7% species) (
