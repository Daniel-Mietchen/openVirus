<p>The avian arboviruses showed the strongest spatial and habitat associations among the seven arboviruses. West Nile virus was more common in the southwestern region of CT (

 </bold>) which is also the most developed in the state; these sites are also likely spatially auto-correlated (Global Moran’s I 0.11, z = 3.24, p &lt; 0.01). Eastern Equine encephalitis virus was more common in the eastern half of the state (

 </bold>), which has abundant hardwood wetland forests; EEEV sites are also likely spatially auto-correlated (Global Moran’s I 0.22, z = 6.20, p &lt; 1e-6). Spatial and habitat patterns for HJV isolations were similar to EEEV. The mammalian arboviruses did display some site-specific associations (
