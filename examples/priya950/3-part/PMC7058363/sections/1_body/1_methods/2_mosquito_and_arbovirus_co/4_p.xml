<p>We utilized the same functions listed above for our analyses of arbovirus community composition among sites and years. A key difference in these analyses is that arbovirus community composition was analyzed using the number of pools positive for each arbovirus, irrespective of mosquito species identification. Additionally, the comparative rarity of detecting multiple arboviruses versus multiple mosquito species limited our use of certain functions in the VEGAN package. Accordingly, we did not use the 
 <italic>‘estimateR’</italic> function to measure the number of expected viruses at a site because the function uses rare and single species detections in its calculations; we also did not assess site-specific distinctiveness for arbovirus communities. When functions were repeated for arbovirus communities, we compared results with mosquito communities using linear correlations (i.e., Pearson’s r).
