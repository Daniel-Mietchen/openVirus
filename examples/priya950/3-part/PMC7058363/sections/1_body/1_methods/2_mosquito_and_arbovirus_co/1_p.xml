<p>Our first objective was to identify drivers of and relationships between variation in mosquito and arbovirus community composition among sites and years. To better investigate this objective, we first restricted our community ecology analyses to mosquitoes and arboviruses collected using CO
 <sub>2</sub>-baited light traps only because light traps are considered among the least biased mosquito trapping devices [

For analyses of arbovirus community composition, isolations of FLAV and LACV were excluded due to the limited number of isolations of each virus (&lt; 5 total isolates per arbovirus).
