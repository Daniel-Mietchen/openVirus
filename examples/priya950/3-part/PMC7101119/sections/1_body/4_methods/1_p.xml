<p>We modeled county-level Zika virus transmission using a coupled 2-system stochastic humanâ€“mosquito differential equation compartment model (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 1). The human system was a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model and the mosquito system a susceptible-exposed-infected compartment model that incorporates vector and viral life-stage dynamics as functions of temperature throughout the year, as well as climate (temperature) and demographic data, including county- and municipality-level seasonality of births. More specifically, we coupled high-resolution 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector risk maps (

 </xref>) describing the ecologic extent of the major vectors of Zika virus, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, with dynamic temperature-dependent Zika virus and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> life-stage models, local climate data, and county-level demographic information, including population and monthly birth cohort data. We simulated Zika virus transmission given a single importation (index case) into each county across time and under varying control measures. We simulated stochastic trajectories by using an adaptation of the fundamental Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm, an adaptive tau leaping procedure (
