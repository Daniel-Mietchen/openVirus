<p>When humanâ€“vector contact rates were reduced from baseline in the model, the probability of initial transmission remained relatively insensitive, until contact was reduced by 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>70%, at which point initial transmission fell sharply (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panels A, B). Incidence was exquisitely sensitive to reductions in contact, and fell log-linearly, with the magnitude of the slope proportional to the baseline incidence (
