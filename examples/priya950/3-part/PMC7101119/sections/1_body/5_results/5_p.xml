<p>Our model showed final epidemic size was particularly sensitive to time of introduction (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 11), especially among counties most susceptible to transmission. Among the top 10% of counties by predicted final epidemic size, the time of import that maximized incidence was â‰ˆ2 months earlier than that which maximized initial transmission (May vs. July; p&lt;0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 12, panels A, C), and final incidence was as much as 10-fold greater. This difference disappeared among the 80% of counties with the smallest predicted final epidemic size (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 12, panels B, D), where both metrics were maximized by imports during peak vector abundance, reflecting very limited transmission chains in most counties.
