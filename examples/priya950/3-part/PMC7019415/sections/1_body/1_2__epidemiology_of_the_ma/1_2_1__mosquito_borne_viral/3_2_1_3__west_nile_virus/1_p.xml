 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Salim and Porterfield suggested that WNV circulates enzootically in central Sudan, and this was confirmed in 1981 by Omer et al. [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Country-wide epidemics of WNV infection were reported in 1994, 1996, and 1999, with infection rates up to 59%, associated with heavy rainfall and flooding [
