<p>Dengue virus (DENV; Flaviviridae) is endemic in Sudan and its distribution was confined to the coastal and subcoastal regions of the country, where the disease was described for the first time by Saigh in 1906 and Balfour in 1907 on the Red Sea coast, Port Sudan city [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00081-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, most dengue outbreaks in the Middle East and North Africa were reported from Sudan [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Sudan was the first country in Africa to report DENV-1 in 1984; DENV-2 was isolated from patients admitted to a hospital in East Sudan in 1984, and reported from Kassala state for the first time during an outbreak in 2016/17 [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. DENV infections were reported from the population of east, north, south, and central Sudan with infection rates ranging between 7–25%, and these infections were associated with epidemics of febrile illness, following heavy rain and flooding [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Studies of DENV infection among pregnant women in East Sudan showed that they commonly develop severe forms of disease leading to poor maternal and perinatal outcomes, including 22% maternal death, 24% low birth weight, and 18% preterm delivery [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In 2012, a relatively high prevalence of dengue and measles co-infection (17%) in addition to 20% and 12% independent measles and dengue infections, respectively, have placed a great diagnostic challenge on the resource-limited health system. All of these infections were initially diagnosed as measles, indicating the diagnostic challenge in endemic areas of east Sudan [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with 312 cases occurred among children under 15 years of age, and about 12% of them manifested with dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV-3 was isolated from patients during the outbreaks, and a 4% case fatality rate was reported in Port Sudan city, East Sudan in 2005 [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Outbreaks of dengue fever occurred frequently in the coastal and subcoastal areas of the country. Another major epidemic caused by DENV-3 occurred in 2010 with incidence up to 72%. About two thirds of cases presented with DHF and DSS, and more than 4000 cases were detected [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Entomological surveillance showed that 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, notorious as the major vector of this virus in urban areas, was the predominant mosquito species in the area. Later, in 2015, a novel outbreak of dengue fever occurred among refugees in the Darfur area, west Sudan, in which DENV-2 and 3 were co-circulating in the area [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This was followed by further outbreak in 2016/17 in east Sudan caused by DENV-2 [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, studies reported a high prevalence (67%) of DENV infections in Sudan and up to 89% in the coastal area. They highlighted that most people in these areas were infected repeatedly, and reported that all DENV (1–4) serotypes are circulating in the area [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Recently, DENV-1 and 3 emerged and caused an outbreak of dengue fever in the Darfur area, western Sudan [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. DENV transmission in Sudan is heterogeneous in space and time, and the major risk factors for infection were poverty, lack of mosquito control, sleeping outdoors, lack of basic public services such as water supply, storing drinking water, and geographical location [
