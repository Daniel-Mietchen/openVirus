<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae) is endemic with frequent upsurges in Sudan [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00081-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The first report of the disease in Sudan in 1973 showed that the seroprevalence of CHIKV infection in Central Sudan was 13% [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similar seroprevalences were documented in the central and northern provinces of Sudan, with 10% and 12%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, studies conducted in the western region of the country documented much higher CHIKV seroprevalence, up to 44% [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An epidemiological survey in East Sudan using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that 24% of pregnant women were infected with CHIKV and the infections were associated with preterm delivery [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A wider study across the country reported a relatively low seroprevalence of CHIKV in East and Central Sudan (1.8%) with 100% dengue virus seropositivity [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Understandably, during epidemics of febrile illnesses, it is challenging to distinguish arboviral diseases from malaria and other infections due to the lack of laboratory capacity for proper diagnostics [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite the frequent reports of chikungunya from different parts of Sudan, there were no entomological studies investigating the vectors of the disease [
