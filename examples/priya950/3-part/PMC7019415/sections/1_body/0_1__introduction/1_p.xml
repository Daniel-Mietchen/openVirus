These viruses cause serious diseases including dengue fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, chikungunya, and various arboviral encephalitides. The risk of arboviral diseases is on the increase and their geographical distribution has expanded [

Due to limitations in the capacity of the health systems, particularly at the level of diagnosis of infectious diseases, many cases of arboviral diseases are misdiagnosed as malaria or any other similar febrile illness. This, in turn, not only leads to an overestimation of malaria episodes, but also to an underestimation of arboviral diseases and their socio-economic impacts [
