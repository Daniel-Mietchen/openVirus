<p>Several risk factors contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of arboviral diseases. These include climate change, international travel and trade, increased contact of humans and wild or domesticated animals, an explosion of the human population, and unplanned urbanization [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Considering these factors, understanding the epidemiology of arboviruses in Sudan is of global concern. Therefore, in this review, we aim to shed light on the risk of arboviruses in Sudan and highlight the main gaps in knowledge, research, and control of the major human and veterinary arboviral diseases as well as the main challenges to develop a strategic plan for control.
