<p>The major challenge for the prevention, control, and research of arboviruses in Sudan is the limited diagnostic capacity. The Ministry of Health is relying on external laboratories for confirmation of arboviral infections, commonly in Germany or Senegal (

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], resulting in delays in responses. The lack of advanced diagnostics with high sensitivity creates a great diagnostic challenge for the surveillance system and limits early detection of diseases [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This technological gap, in turn, creates a significant limitation in our knowledge, and many unanswered questions about the epidemiology and dynamics of these diseases and their vectors remain. Such information is crucial for developing an effective prevention and control strategy [

In addition to saving many lives, utilizing recent advancements in the biomedical research could help in elucidating the molecular epidemiology, dynamics, and evolution of arboviral diseases, improving our understanding about the transmission of these viruses and reshaping our prevention, control, and containment strategies (

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is also a need to develop multisectoral programs for controlling many of these arboviral diseases. This is critically important in Sudan’s towns and cities, where populations of the world’s most important vector of arboviral diseases, Ae. aegypti, are likely to thrive. Genetic and behavioral characterizations of Ae. aegypti populations to determine which represent peridomestic (Ae. aegypti aegypti) versus sylvatic (Ae. aegypti formosus) populations are also needed. In urban areas in particular, trash removal, the provision of reliable piped water, house screening, and infrastructure that does not provide aquatic habitats for this vector is essential for reducing the threat from diseases like chikungunya, dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. As Sudan’s towns and cities continue to grow, there has never been a better time to do this [
