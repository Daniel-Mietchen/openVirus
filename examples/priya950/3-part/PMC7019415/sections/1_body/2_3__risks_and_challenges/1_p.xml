<p>The burden of arboviral diseases has devastating socioeconomic and health impacts by causing the loss of human and domesticated animals, and reductions in economic production in endemic countries, including Sudan [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, the risk, distribution, and global burden of arboviruses is increasing and is predicted to worsen in the future unless serious actions are taken [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, a great challenge during epidemics of arboviral diseases in Sudan is the misclassification and misdiagnosis during the acute phase due to the similarity in signs and symptoms between arboviral diseases and several locally circulating infectious diseases, including measles, malaria, and hepatitis, particularly when the infections are severe [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This challenge is not restricted to Sudan, and is a common in other resource-limited countries [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, the lack of well-established public health policies or programs for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases in Sudan leaves the local population and international visitors at greater risk of epidemics and potentially, exportation to new areas. Moreover, this risk is influenced by the delay and/or lack of sharing the data and information of epidemics and health emergencies by the health authorities [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In addition, there is an obvious weakness in this area of research due to the limited funds, which are mostly directed toward malaria in malaria-endemic countries [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is a great need for strengthening the surveillance system and raising awareness of the health policymakers and healthcare providers about the risk of arboviruses, as emphasized in the World Health Organization’s Global Vector Control Response 2017–2030 [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Apparently, as arboviral infections are greatly under-reported or misdiagnosed, this masks the magnitude of the problem from the policymakers and leaves the issue worsening. Furthermore, previous local studies failed to identify the risk factors associated with arboviral infections and epidemics, and such information is crucial for developing strategic prevention and control plans [
