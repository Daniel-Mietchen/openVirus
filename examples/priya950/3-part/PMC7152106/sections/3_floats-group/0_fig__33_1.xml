  <p>The reservoir of influenza A viruses. The working hypothesis is that wild aquatic birds are the primordial reservoir of all influenza viruses for avian and mammalian species. Transmission of influenza has been demonstrated between pigs and humans (solid lines). There is extensive evidence for transmission between aquatic birds and other species, including pigs and horses, and indirect transmission to humans through pigs and evidence for direct transmission to humans from chickens.</p>
