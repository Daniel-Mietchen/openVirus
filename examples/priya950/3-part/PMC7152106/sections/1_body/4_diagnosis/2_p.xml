<p id="p0230">Rapid antigen tests exist for RSV and influenza virus, but these are not very sensitive (up to 70%). Although viral culture is still considered the gold standard, it is complicated, cumbersome, slow, and lacks sensitivity; also it is not commonly used for clinical diagnostics anymore. Instead, molecular methods to detect pathogen nucleic acids are rapid and sensitive and, when used in multiplex format, can detect most common respiratory viruses. They are often still expensive and require even more expensive equipment, laboratory infrastructure, and well-trained staff to be performed adequately, thus limiting their application in LMICs, but simpler and more portable formats of molecular diagnostics are being developed.</p>
