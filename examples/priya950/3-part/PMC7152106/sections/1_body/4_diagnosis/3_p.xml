<p id="p0235">The identification of one viral agent does not rule out double or mixed bacterial-viral infection. Recently several novel viruses have been identified in the human respiratory tract (Bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses, and several others). The significance of these viruses as pathogens has yet to be established. With next-generation sequencing becoming more accessible for clinical diagnostics, including in LMICs, it is expected that many more such viruses will be discovered.</p>
