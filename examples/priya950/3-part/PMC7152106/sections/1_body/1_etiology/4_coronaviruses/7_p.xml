<p id="p0140">A decade later, another novel coronavirus was found to be associated with acute severe pneumonia in countries in the Middle East. The virus, called 
 <italic>Middle East respiratory syndrome</italic> (MERS) coronavirus, has since caused &gt;2100 infections, 750 of which were fatal, in 27 countries. Most cases originated from countries in the Arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers, including one that caused a large health care facilityâ€“related outbreak in South Korea in 2015. More mild and asymptomatic cases are observed with MERS, and mortality is strongly associated with age and co-morbidities. The natural reservoir of MERS coronavirus is dromedary camels, and in Saudi Arabia half of cases are classified as primary, often associated with collection, preparation, and ingestion of milk or meat. The other half results from human-to-human transmission, often associated with health care facilities. Control of MERS coronavirus is difficult because of the stable natural reservoir and the presence of asymptomatic human spreaders. Vaccination of dromedary camels was proposed as an efficient intervention, but unfortunately neutralizing antibodies do not appear to protect against infection or viral shedding.
