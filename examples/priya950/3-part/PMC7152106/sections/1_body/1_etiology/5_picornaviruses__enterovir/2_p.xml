<p id="p0150">The more than 100 serotypes of enterovirus species A–D (Coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses) are mainly transmitted by the oral–fecal route and to a much lesser extent by respiratory droplets. Enteroviruses are a major cause of aseptic meningitis in children and adults but are also associated with the common cold, herpangina, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus D68 behaves more like a rhinovirus, as it replicates in the respiratory rather than the gastrointestinal tract and has caused a worldwide outbreak of relatively mild RTI in 2012–2014, but with epidemiologic links to acute flaccid paralysis.</p>
