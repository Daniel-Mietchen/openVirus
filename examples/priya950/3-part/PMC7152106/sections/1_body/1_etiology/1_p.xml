<p id="p0055">A range of different viruses can cause RTIs; the most important are the ortho- and paramyxoviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. Although it is generally accepted that the majority of mild RTIs are viral, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the published literature showed that in adults, 25% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia was viral. This percentage is higher in children, particularly children under 5, due to the large proportion of cases caused by RSV. In adults, the contributions of identified viral etiologies were 8% for influenza viruses, 6% for rhinoviruses, 3% for coronaviruses, and 2% for RSV. In children under 5 with LRTIs, strong causal associations for RSV, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus were found in comparison with healthy controls, and less so for adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and coronaviruses.
