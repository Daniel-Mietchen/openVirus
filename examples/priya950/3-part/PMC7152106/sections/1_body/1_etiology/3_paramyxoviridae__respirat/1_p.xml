<p id="p0095">These six human viruses are the most important causes of LRTIs in children worldwide. RSV is the single most important cause of bronchiolitis and the leading cause of RTIs requiring hospitalization. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes similar disease but less frequently, whereas the parainfluenza viruses are associated with bronchiolitis and croup. A recent study estimated that RSV caused 3.2 million hospitalizations and 59,600 deaths among children under 5, and 118,200 deaths among all age groups, annually.
