<p id="p0080">In contrast, H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused severe human respiratory illness in Asia and North Africa, with a mortality of over 50%. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were first detected in birds in 1996 in China. Transmission to 18 humans occurred in Hong Kong, 6 of which were fatal. During the next 6 years no human or animal cases were recorded. In 2003 the virus reemerged in China. Since then H5N1 viruses have become panzootic among poultry and wild birds and have caused 860 sporadic infections (454 fatal) in humans until 2015, most of whom reported close contact with wild birds or domestic poultry.</p>
