<p id="p0060">Orthomyxoviridae are divided into four genera: A–D. Influenza A viruses are further subtyped based on the two major antigens: haemagglutinin (HA; H1–H18) and neuraminidase (NA; N1–N11), that are responsible for host receptor binding/cell entry and cell exit, respectively. Key amino acids in these proteins, especially in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes, except H17, H18, N10, and N11. These were recently identified in bats, suggesting birds are not the only reservoir. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among land and water mammals (e.g., humans, pigs, horses, seals;

Influenza C rarely causes human infections, and influenza D viruses mostly infect cattle and will not be further discussed.
