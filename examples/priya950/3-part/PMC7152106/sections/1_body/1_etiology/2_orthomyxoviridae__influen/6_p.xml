<p id="p0085">Furthermore, a total of 1566 cases (including 613 deaths) of human infection with avian influenza H7N9 have been reported from China, occurring in annual outbreaks between December and February since 2013. Human H7N9 infection is also zoonotic, with no reported sustained human-to-human transmission, and mostly associated with exposure to live bird markets. Interestingly, human cases have been confined to parts of mainland China, and avian infection is limited to domestic poultry with little spillover to migratory birds and wild waterfowl. The case fatality of H7N9 is lower than H5N1, and associations with age and comorbidities are reported.
