<p id="p0075">Sporadic dead-end human infections of animal viruses are known to occur and have caused concern about the pandemic potential of these viruses. Swine H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2 viruses have caused infections in humans with limited human-to-human transmission. H6N1, H7N7, H7N3, H9N2, and H10N7 viruses have caused conjunctivitis and mild flulike illness in patients in close contact with infected birds or seals.</p>
