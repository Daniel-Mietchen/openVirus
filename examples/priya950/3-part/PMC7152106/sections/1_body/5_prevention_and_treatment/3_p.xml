<p id="p0255">Cidofovir is available for severe adenovirus infections but causes severe side effects and needs to be administered simultaneously with probenecid. Oral or aerosolized formulations of the broad-spectrum anti-viral ribavirin inhibit replication of several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and RSV, but is expensive and should not be used routinely. Humanized anti-RSV immunoglobulins (palivizumab) are available for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk groups (neonates and infants with congenital heart or lung disease) but are very expensive. Pleconaril was developed for the common cold and inhibits picornavirus replication, but its side effects outweighed the benefits for use in uncomplicated infections.</p>
