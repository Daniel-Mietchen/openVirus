<p id="p0165">With the exceptions noted earlier, most respiratory viruses are spread from person to person by the respiratory route, to a varying extent by large droplets, small-particle aerosols, and fomites with hand contamination and subsequent self-inoculation. Patients are most infectious early in the disease or even before. Secondary attack rates may be especially high in semi-closed populations, like schoolchildren, inpatients, and nursing home residents. Children play a major role in respiratory virus outbreaks among families and communities. Frequent handwashing and covering of the mouth when coughing or sneezing may partially prevent transmission.</p>
