 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was the vector responsible for transmitting virus in the 2001 and 2015 dengue outbreaks in Hawaii, and the outbreaks were caused by separate virus introductions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). It has been suggested that DENV outbreaks transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are less explosive and tend to smolder as was observed during the 2015 outbreak.

 </sup> However, reports of dengue outbreaks in China show that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can drive large epidemics, suggesting that outcomes of outbreaks are in part a result of complex interactions between mosquito and human behaviors, and demographics.

 </sup> For example, during this outbreak on Hawaii Island, dengue transmission might have been slowed because of host feeding behaviors of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (wide range of hosts, exophagy) and low population density that limited human–mosquito interactions compared with areas with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or higher densities of humans.

 </sup> Recent population growth, demographic shifts to urban areas, and its prominence as an important destination and hub in the Pacific for civilians and the U.S. military may alter the epidemiology of future outbreaks.

 </sup> The presence of two competent vectors and imported cases of arbovirus infection pose continued risk to the residents of Hawaii, highlighting the need for rigorous monitoring and surveillance of virus and vectors.
