<p>Hawaii Island is the largest island in the State of Hawaii. Seasons are divided into summer, occurring between May and October and winter from November to April, with the winter season receiving more precipitation. The north and east side of the island is generally wetter and more humid because of orographic precipitation. This investigation took place between mid-November 2015 and mid-February 2016. Most of the mosquito trapping occurred on the western side of Hawaii Island, between Kona and Milolii, and additional collections were conducted in Waipio, Oceanview, Hilo, and Puna (

Rock Bottom was relatively rural and surrounded by macadamia nut orchards and forest compared with Wonderview and Kealakehe, which were residential neighborhoods near Kona. Hookena was a State Park on the western side of the island and Waipio was a rural community composed of single-family houses surrounded by forest. The village of Milolii, Milolii subdivision, and Oceanview were built on lava beds, did not have access to municipal water, and thus, stored water in cisterns or water storage drums/containers.
