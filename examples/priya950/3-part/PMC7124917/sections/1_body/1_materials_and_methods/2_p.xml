 </sup> Trapping at the three locations was conducted for 14 days. At Hilo, Telephone Exchange, and Milolii, BG traps using CO
 <sub>2</sub> lures without black covers were deployed for 7 days (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). BG-Sentinel traps were monitored daily and AGO traps were checked every 3â€“4 days. Additional BG traps without black covers that varied in use of CO
 <sub>2</sub> were placed in areas where DENV or the presence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was suspected, and informal surveys of aquatic habitats were performed at Waipio and Oceanview (
