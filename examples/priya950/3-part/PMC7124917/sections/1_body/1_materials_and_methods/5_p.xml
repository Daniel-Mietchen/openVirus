<p>The envelope glycoprotein coding region (E gene) of DENV-1 was sequenced directly from the mosquito pool macerates and nine human clinical serum specimens that tested positive by PCR. The target region was amplified using serotype-specific primers and the resulting amplicon (1,743 bp) was sequenced using the Sanger bidirectional method from eight bidirectional and overlapping sequencing reactions using Applied BioSystems (Foster City, CA) BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 sequencing kits. Sequences were obtained directly from the original samples; virus isolation was not attempted. A total of 29 DENV-1 E gene sequences were obtained, including from 12 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> pools collected during the 2015 outbreak, nine clinical serum specimens from symptomatic humans collected in the same region during the same outbreak by the HDOH, and eight clinical serum specimens from symptomatic humans collected during the 2001 DENV-1 outbreak.

 </sup> To understand the genetic relatedness of these sequences in context with the South Pacific, we reconstructed a Bayesian maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree with the 29 sequences obtained from this study and 42 sequences obtained from GenBank using BEAST v. 1.8.4. Parameters for BEAST (Edinburgh, UK) include 30 million MCMC, time of the most recent common ancestor for the 2015 monophyletic lineage, and a strict molecular clock to achieve acceptable statistical values (effective sample size &gt; 200).
