<p>In total, we screened 185 pools of female mosquitoes for the presence of DENV RNA of which 135 were 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 38 were 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and 12 were 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. We detected viral RNA for DENV-1 in 15 pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from Rock Bottom, two of which were from pools using AGOs and 13 were pools from BG traps. Infection rates at Rock Bottom were 62.2 per 1,000 and 30.4 per 1,000 for AGO and BG traps, respectively (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> collected in Telephone Exchange, Hilo, or Milolii (
