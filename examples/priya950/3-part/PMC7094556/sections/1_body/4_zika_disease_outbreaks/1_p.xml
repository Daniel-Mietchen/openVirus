Since being detected in 2015 in Brazil, with reported cases of congenital malformations and other neurologic disorders linked to ZIKV infection (in French Polynesia and Brazil), ZIKV has spread to many countries in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and briefly into the United States. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and other neurologic conditions associated with the appearance of ZIKV in the Americas. On November 18, 2016, the WHO ended this Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It is projected that nearly 400 million individuals can be potentially infected with ZIKV annually (similar to dengue virus [DENV] infection and burden),
