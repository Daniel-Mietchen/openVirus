<p id="p0080">Dengue virus infection also serves as a good model of cellular immunity to ZIKV. Robust T-cell responses develop after DENV infection, with CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses targeting the C, E, and NS1 proteins while CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses preferentially target the nonstructural proteins.

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes have also been found in the prM, C, and E proteins.

 </xref> In a mouse model, both vaginal and subcutaneous infection with ZIKV led to the proliferation of virus-specific T cells.

 </xref> Adoptive transfer of these T cells into naive mice led to a significant reduction in viral titers upon infection, indicating that T-cell responses contribute to protective immunity. The evidence thus far suggests that an optimal vaccine would elicit both humoral and cellular immunity.
