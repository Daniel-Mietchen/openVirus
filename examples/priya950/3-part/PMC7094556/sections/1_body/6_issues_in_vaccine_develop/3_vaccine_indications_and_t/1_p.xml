<p id="p0085">Although Zika infection typically causes no or self-limited symptoms, more severe symptomatology can and does occur. This may be particularly true in pregnant women and women of childbearing age, infants/children, older adults, and those who are immunocompromised. Given the destructive fetal effects of Zika infection and the need to protect unborn children, it seems reasonable that the group requiring the most immediate protection is women, followed by men, of childbearing potential. This will likely be followed by the desire and need to protect all ages. Guillain-Barr√© syndrome may be particularly more likely and severe among older adults, and hence this represents a different spectrum of risk group. Such considerations may drive vaccine development efforts. For example, women who are pregnant cannot receive a live virus vaccine, while older immunosenescent adults may require vaccine adjuvants to boost immune response.</p>
