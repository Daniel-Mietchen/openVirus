<p id="p0100">Mouse models are inexpensive, are available on multiple genetic backgrounds, are conducive to large sample sizes, and have a vast array of relevant immunologic tools (ie, antibodies and sequence information) available. Mouse models of ZIKV infection are relatively common, and a number of strains have been used to examine aspects of ZIKV disease.

 </xref> Zika virus has variable replication efficiency in wild-type mouse strains (BALB/c greater than C57BL/6) but does not produce clinical illness in adult mice. Disruption of IFN responses is required for disease manifestations. The most common models are inbred strains on the 129 background that lack the IFNAR1 (A129) or both the IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 (AG129) and a strain on the B6 background lacking IFNAR1. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice also develop disease but at a delayed rate compared with AG129. Mice lacking INF response factors (IRFs) (eg, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7) also exhibit disease symptoms on experimental infection. Unfortunately, the immunosuppressed nature of these animals complicates vaccine development and testing. The use of INF receptor–blocking antibodies can be utilized in wild-type mice to recapitulate disease susceptibility. The use of neonatal mice and/or intracranial inoculation can produce some disease symptoms (eg, neurologic signs or paralysis). A model of intrauterine infection has been established in Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) mice.
