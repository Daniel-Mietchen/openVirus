<p id="p0055">The Zika genome is analogous to that of other Flaviviridae RNA viruses (ie, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue type 1-4 viruses) and encodes for 3 major structural proteins (ie, prM, capsid [C], and E [a primary target of neutralizing antibody development]) and 7 nonstructural proteins (ie, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Notably, the nonstructural NS5 protein is implicated in RNA synthesis and viral replication. Importantly, the proteins documented to have significance in terms of immune response include nonstructural protein NS5 that has been shown to suppress type I IFN signaling through STAT2-mediated degradation in the ZIKV-infected host.

 </xref> During viral shedding, prM is cleaved by furin protein to generate mature infectious virions. Zika virus E protein is the main surface protein that participates in host cell receptor attachment and virus lipid bilayer fusion, while the nonstructural NS1 through NS5 proteins are engaged in virus propagation. Robust adaptive immune responses to ZIKV E, NS1, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins such as production of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses have been detected in animal models of ZIKV infection, which indicates that vaccination may protect against ZIKV disease.
