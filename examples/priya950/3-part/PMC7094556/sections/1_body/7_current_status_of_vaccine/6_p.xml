This construct is based on the measles virus vaccine backbone, which is an approach that has also shown promise with chikungunya virus. The measles vaccine has an excellent safety record and results in robust immunity to measles. It is hoped that these characteristics are retained when novel antigens are added to the measles vaccine virus genome.
