<p>All urinalysis and Xpert testing were conducted by existing staff from Baylor Clinic. Urinalysis was done using Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips (ACON Laboratories, San Diego, CA). All samples were tested with the Xpert CT/NG test as per the manufacturer’s guidelines using the GeneXpert instrument (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Indeterminate results were retested using the same protocol. Approximately 2 mL of the urine from the transport tube was stored in a −80°C freezer for future Xpert TV testing. When Xpert TV testing was being done, samples were thawed, vortexed, and tested using the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
