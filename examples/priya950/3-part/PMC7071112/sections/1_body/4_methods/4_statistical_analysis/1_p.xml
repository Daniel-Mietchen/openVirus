<p>Sample size calculations were performed to detect a difference in sensitivity between NAAT testing and syndromic measurement assuming 95% and 20%, respectively, to achieve 80% power and 5% significance level. The study was also powered to estimate the prevalence of CT, NG, or TV in our population with a half-width of 5% of a 95% confidence interval (CI) [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, we enrolled 300 participants. Descriptive statistics are shown including frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted association between STIs covariates reflecting demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. Variables were included in the model if the 
 <italic>P</italic> value was ≤ .05 in bivariate analysis. Results are presented as odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs. Diagnostic performance of Xpert and syndromic measurement was described using sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value, to compare between the current standard of care and the newly introduced reference standard. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
