<p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) associated with cervicitis and urethritis such as 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT), 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic> (NG), and 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (TV) are associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, adverse birth outcomes for the mother and child, and facilitate the horizontal and vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although surveillance data are limited, persons in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately impacted by STIs, as are adolescents, women, and people with HIV [
