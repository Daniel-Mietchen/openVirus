Most ever sexually active participants (ESAP) (61 of 160) reported having only 1 sexual partner in their lifetime (IQR, 1–5) with a range of 1–25 partners. Of the 160 ESAP, 101 (63.1%) said they had been sexually active in the past 6 months. The majority of ESAP reported “always” using condoms (57.6%). The median age at HIV diagnosis was 10 years of age (IQR, 4–16), with a range of 0–24 years.
