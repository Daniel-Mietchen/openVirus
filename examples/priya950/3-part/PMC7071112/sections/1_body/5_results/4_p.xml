<p>The risk factors associated with STI infection in ESAP were a new sexual partner in the last 6 months (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1–6.4), sometimes to never using condoms (OR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.7–10.2), most recent sexual partner 25 years or older (OR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–8.2), and HIV diagnosis at age 15 years or older (OR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4–8.2) (
