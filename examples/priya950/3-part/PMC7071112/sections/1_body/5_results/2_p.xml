<p>There was a total of 26 (8.7%) participants that were positive for an STI, and the prevalence was highest among 20- to 24-year-old females ESAP at 25.0% (15 of 60) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Only 1 STI was detected among 139 patients reporting no prior sexual activity; therefore, the reported results focus primarily on the 160 ESAP. A total of 38 vaginal swabs and 46 (38 female) oropharyngeal swabs were provided and tested for CT and NG only. The vaginal swabs were 100% (38 of 38) concordant with the urine results for CT and NG. All oropharyngeal swabs came back negative for CT and/or NG, regardless of urine and/or vaginal swab results, which included 8 with positive urine/vaginal results (

 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic> was the most common pathogen identified representing 15 of 32 (47%) of the pathogens detected and was followed by CT (9 of 32; 28%) and TV (8 of 32; 25%). The majority of participants with an identified STI were positive for a single pathogen (21 of 26; 80%).
