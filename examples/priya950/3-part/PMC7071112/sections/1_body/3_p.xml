<p>Existing data suggest that the current paradigm for syndromic STI screening performs poorly and that there is a global epidemic of undiagnosed STIs resulting in PID, an increased risk of HIV transmission, and infertility. In this study, we seek to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for CT, NG, and TV among adolescents and young adults living with HIV enrolled at a family-centered HIV clinic in Mbabane, Eswatini. The aim of the study was to determine the need for and guide development of NAAT-based STI screening protocols for the highest risk adolescents and young people with HIV. In addition, we evaluate the performance of adjunctive diagnostics such as urinalysis, the concordance of urine versus vaginal self-swabs as testing specimens, and rates of oropharyngeal carriage in our population. We also provide evidence on the feasibility of disease-specific treatment and partner management.</p>
