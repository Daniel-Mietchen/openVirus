<p>The WHO currently recommends syndromic screening and management for STIs; however, this approach has poor sensitivity for CT, NG, and TV, low predictive accuracy and low agreement with laboratory diagnosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10â€“13</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of symptoms related to an STI does not correlate with adverse sequelae such as pelvic inflammation and infertility, HIV acquisition, and secondary transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive (CT 97.2, NG 99.9, TV 98.6) and specific (CT 98.0, NG 99.9, TV 99.8) but have not been considered accessible or cost effective in most LMICs [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Self-contained NAAT testing through the GeneXpert platform performs comparably to other NAAT testing platforms and is a platform that is available throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the feasibility of this method for diagnostic testing in these settings. This is especially true for patients already enrolled in comprehensive HIV care and treatment.
