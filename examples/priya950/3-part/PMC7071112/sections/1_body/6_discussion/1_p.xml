<p>The high STI prevalence in this study highlights adolescents and young adults with HIV as a priority population for STI prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Furthermore, these data suggest that STI risks and rates are not evenly distributed among adolescents and young adults with HIV with various demographic, behavioral, and clinical risk factors contributing to STI risk. Targeted testing and treatment of STIs in this population may represent another strategy to reduce HIV transmission.</p>
