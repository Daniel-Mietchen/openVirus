<p>The cohort who were diagnosed with HIV at an older age, generally indicating horizontal rather than vertical transmission, were another group at risk for the presence of an STI on bivariate but not multivariate analysis. This may speak to the different needs of adolescents and young adults who acquired HIV through sexual activity as opposed to perinatally. Attention to distinctions among these 2 patient populations is needed in settings where both populations are engaged in care in large numbers.</p>
