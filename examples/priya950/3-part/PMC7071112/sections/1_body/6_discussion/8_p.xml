<p>Treatment of STIs was successfully provided in 100% of patients through normal clinic processes and providers, and without additional resources provided to study participants, indicating that STI testing and treatment can be integrated into a comprehensive HIV care model. In this cohort, Xpert testing identified an additional 16 patients with STI infections compared with syndromic screening; furthermore, if Xpert testing had been used to exclude an STI as the cause of urethritis, cervicitis, or lower abdominal pain syndromes, antibiotics could have also been avoided in an additional 19 patients within this cohort. Using point-of-care testing in this way allows for antibiotics to target specific infections, such as azithromycin alone for CT, rather than providing syndromic treatment for all potential pathogens. Although the risk of repeat infection among patients diagnosed with CT, NG, and TV is known to be high [
