<p>The relative increased prevalence of NG as opposed to CT and TV in this cohort was remarkable. Prior assessments of STI prevalence among young people in South Africa identified CT as the most common cervicitis- and urethritis-associated STI [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas an assessment of STIs in women of all ages in Eswatini demonstrated a higher prevalence of TV, with relatively equal numbers of patients found to have CT and NG [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this cohort, NG was present at approximately twice the rate of CT or TV. Additional data are needed to determine whether this is representative of larger populations of adolescents and young people living with HIV in high-burden settings; however, this is concerning given the increased risk of PID associated with NG infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It may also reflect the inadequacy of previously recommended oral treatment regimens and increasing antimicrobial resistance among strains of NG.
