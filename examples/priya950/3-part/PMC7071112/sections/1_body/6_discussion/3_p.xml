<p>We did not find an association with STI detection and detectable viremia, although this has been reported previously from a cohort in the United States, which represents a significantly different population [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rates of viral suppression are lower among adolescents and young people than in older adults [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and STIs can increase the risk of HIV transmission in patients with DVLs. This fact, coupled with the high rates of STIs in this population, suggest that testing and treatment of STIs may help reduce HIV transmission among this group of adolescents and young adults with HIV.
