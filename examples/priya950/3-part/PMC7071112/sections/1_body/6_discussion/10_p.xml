<p>The cross-sectional design of this study does not provide data on how integration of STI Xpert testing as a screening diagnostic will impact incidence of STIs within a population or its potential to decrease HIV transmission rates. It is possible that repeat testing, even based on risk factors, may result in a lower yield. Operational research is needed to understand how effective screening impacts the prevalence of STIs overtime within a clinical cohort enrolled in comprehensive HIV care. Assessment of oropharyngeal carriage rates was limited by the small subgroup sample size and should be assessed in larger groups to draw definitive conclusions. Concordance testing with vaginal and urinary specimens was also limited, and we cannot exclude the possibility that additional cases might have been identified through greater use of vaginal self-testing swabs, which may be a slightly more sensitive approach. As with any cross-sectional study, our data may be subject to reporting bias and lack generalizability due to the single-entry point. The results will be confirmed through ongoing enrollment of larger cohorts from multiple-entry points.</p>
