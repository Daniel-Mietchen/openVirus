<p>Although costly at approximately US $15 to $20 per Xpert CT/NG cartridge, the diagnostic accuracy, ease of sample collection (urine or vaginal self-swab), rapid integration into an existing testing platform, and the known consequences of untreated asymptomatic STIs, unidentified by syndromic management, further support the need for appropriate laboratory-based screening. Initial WHO evaluations of Xpert CT/NG and TV test performance support the previously reported high diagnostic accuracy of these assays, further indicating the need to move past syndromic STI screening and management [

Additional data are needed on how to incorporate longitudinal screening for sexually active participants and whether risk factors identified in this cohort—such as recent sexual activity, frequency of condom use, and age-disparate sexual partnerships—could be used to guide the need for repeat screening in females with HIV. Syndromic and LE screening performed better in male versus female participants and may be a more appropriate strategy in this lower risk group. Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening people with HIV for CT, NG, and TV in HIV high-burden settings is urgently needed to support integration of point-of-care Xpert STI testing into the HIV comprehensive care package. Emerging data are identifying clinical and economic benefits to introducing multidisease testing into the GeneXpert platform, indicating that introducing Xpert-based STI testing may have economic benefits beyond the clear clinical need [
