<p>Our work contains limitations. As in some African countries, the weather data are available only from a limited number of observatory stations and thus it is not sufficient to capture more accurate spatial variability. In this work, instead of exploring the spatial differences in the associations between rainfall and LF epidemic, we relaxed the setting and studied a general relationship. We qualified the general rainfall-associated changing rate of 
 <italic>R</italic> in Nigeria. For the transmissibility estimation, our growth modelling framework can provide the estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>, but not the basic reproduction number commonly denoted as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. However, according to the theoretical epidemiology [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> can be determined by 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>R</italic>/
 <italic>S</italic>, where 
 <italic>S</italic> denotes the population susceptibility. Although 
 <italic>S</italic> is not involved in our modelling framework, the information of 
 <italic>S</italic> could be acquired from local serological surveillances. The existing literature reported 21.3% seroprevalence among Nigerian humans by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> can be calculated as 1.63 by using 
 <italic>S</italic> = 1–21.3% = 0.787 and the 
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.28 as the average of the 2016–18 LF epidemics. This was a data-driven modelling study, and we quantified the effect of rainfall as a weather-driven force of 
 <italic>R</italic> based on previous ecological and epidemiological evidences [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Since the transmission of LASV mainly relies on the rodent population, the factors including seasonality, agricultural land-using, subtropical or tropical forest coverage that could impact rodent ecology should be relevant and helpful in the analysis. However, due to availability of data, the agricultural land-using factors, e.g. pastureland, irrigated land, flooded agricultural land usage and forest coverage were absent in our analysis, which should be studied in the future if they become available.
