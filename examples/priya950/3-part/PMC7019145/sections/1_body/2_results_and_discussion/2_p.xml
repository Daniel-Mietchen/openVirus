<p>We fit four different growth models to the LF confirmed cases and estimate the model-average reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>) after model selection. We show the growth model fitting results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref> and the model estimation and selection results in 
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most of the models have positive partial 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared against the baseline AR(2) model. Most of the regions exhibit an epidemic turning point (
 <italic>τ</italic>) ranging from the epidemiological week (EW) 4–10, i.e. from the end of January to mid-March, in each year. Out of four epidemics in the states of Bauchi and Plateau, there are three estimated 
 <italic>τ</italic>s after EW 10 (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Larger 
 <italic>τ</italic> means the more extension in the duration of the epidemics. The turning point (
 <italic>τ</italic>) could be affected by several factors including seasonality, intervention program and depletion of the susceptible pool. The estimated reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>) of the epidemics in different regions varies from 1.06 to 1.62. At the national level, the 
 <italic>R</italic> value for the whole of Nigeria in 2016–17 (
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.23 with 95% CI 1.22–1.24) is significantly lower than in the epidemics of 2017–18 (
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) and 2018–19 (
 <italic>R</italic> ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). The state of Edo has the highest estimated 
 <italic>R</italic> (1.62 in 2017–18 and 1.09 in 2018–19) and this state also has the largest number of LF cases in the epidemics of both 2017–18 (41.9% of all cases) and 2018–19 (36.0% of all cases). Hypothesised spatial heterogeneity in the 
 <italic>R</italic> is tested via Cochran's 
 <italic>Q</italic> test. The testing results for the 
 <italic>R</italic>s in the five states are significant (i.e. 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05) for both the 2017–18 and 2018–19 LF epidemics. Thus, we report the existence of spatial heterogeneity in LF epidemics in Nigeria.
