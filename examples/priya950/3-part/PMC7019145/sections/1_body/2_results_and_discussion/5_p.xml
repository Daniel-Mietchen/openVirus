<p>The association between total rainfall in a state and the LASV transmissibility (
 <italic>R</italic>) is modelled and quantified by the LMER model. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>, we find a positive relation between rainfall and 
 <italic>R</italic>. The estimated changing rate in 
 <italic>R</italic> under a one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall is summarised with different cumulative lag terms from 4 to 9 months (the 
 <italic>t</italic> in Eqn (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref>)). The range of lag in the rainfall from 4 to 9 months had previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the peak of the rodent population [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The estimates of the rainfall-associated changing rate in 
 <italic>R</italic> with different lag terms were summarised in 
 <xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. We report the most significant (i.e. with the lowest 
 <italic>P</italic>-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e. rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The 7-month lag also coincides with the period between the dry and rainy seasons [
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, we consider the 7-month lagged estimation as our main results. Namely, a one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months is likely to cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%) rise in the 
 <italic>R</italic> of the LF epidemic. We also remark that this ‘one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months’ is equivalent to ‘7-unit (mm) increase in the total rainfall over the past 7 months’. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF epidemics suggests that the knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. This speculation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data of the Nigerian regions included in this work. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policymakers in LF prevention and control.
