<p>The LF epidemic reproduction numbers (
 <italic>R</italic>) of the whole of Nigeria in 2017–18 (
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) and 2018–19 (
 <italic>R</italic> ranged from 1.08 to 1.36) are significantly higher than in 2016–17 (
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.23 with 95% CI 1.22–1.24). There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics of different Nigerian regions. We report clear evidence of rainfall impacts on LF epidemics in Nigeria and quantify this impact. A one-unit (mm) increase in the average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%) rise in the 
 <italic>R</italic>. The state rainfall information has potential to be utilised as a warning signal for LF epidemics.
