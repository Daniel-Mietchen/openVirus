<p>To test the credibility of the coincidence between rainfall and LF epidemic, we use a simple statistical regression model of ‘case ~ exp(
 <italic>α</italic> × rainfall) + 
 <italic>θ</italic>', where 
 <italic>α</italic> and 
 <italic>θ</italic> are free parameters to be estimated. The ‘rainfall’ in the model represents the state rainfall time series with lag of 4–9 months. This lag term corresponds to the time interval between the rainfall and the development of rodent population [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We check the least-square fitting outcomes of these regression models and select the model of lagged rainfall with the highest goodness-of-fit. The fitting significance is treated as the initiation of the quantitative association between state rainfall and the LF epidemic.
