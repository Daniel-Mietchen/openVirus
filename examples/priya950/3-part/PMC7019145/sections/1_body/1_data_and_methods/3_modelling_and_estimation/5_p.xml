<p>For the AIC-based model average of the 
 <italic>R</italic>, there could be the situation that no growth model is selected according to the partial 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared. In such cases, instead of the model average, we report the range of the 
 <italic>R</italic> estimated from all growth models.
