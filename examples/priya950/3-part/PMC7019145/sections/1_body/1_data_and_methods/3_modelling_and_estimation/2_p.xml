<p>We fit all models to the weekly reported LF cases in different regions and evaluate the fitting performance by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We adopt the standard nonlinear least squares (NLS) approach for model fitting and parameter estimation, following [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 is regarded as statistically significant and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are estimated for all unknown parameters. As we are using the cumulative number of the LF cases to conduct the model fitting, some fitting issues might occur, as per the studies in King 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], due to the non-decreasing nature in the cumulative summation time series. The models are selected by comparing the AIC to that of the baseline (or null) model. Only the models with an AIC lower than the AIC of the baseline model are considered for further analysis. Importantly, the baseline model adopted is expected to capture the trends of the time series. Since the epidemic curves of an infectious disease commonly exhibit autocorrelations [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we use autoregression (AR) models with a degree of 2, i.e. AR(2), as the baseline models for growth model selection. We also adopt the coefficient of determination (
 <italic>R</italic>-squared) and the coefficient of partial determination (partial 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared) to evaluate goodness-of-fit and fitting improvement, respectively. For the calculation of partial 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared, the AR(2) model is used as the baseline model. The growth models with a positive partial 
 <italic>R</italic>-squared (indicating fitting improvement) against the baseline AR(2) model will be selected for further analyses.
