 </sup>. Therefore, next-generation sequencing was performed on only one gene, the PB2 gene, to determine whether the throat and nose swabs collected from the donor and recipient ferrets contained the A/H1N1, A/H1N1
 <sub>var</sub> viruses or a mix of both viruses. For donor ferrets, swabs collected at 1-day post-inoculation (dpi), at the day that transmission to recipient ferrets was observed and at the last day that donor ferrets were virus positive (as determined by virus titration) were processed for next-generation sequencing. For recipient ferrets, the first and the last swabs that were positive (threshold value in RT-qPCR (Ct value) &lt; 35) were subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus inocula were also processed for next-generation sequencing to confirm clonality (see the “Methods” section).
