<p id="Par10">To allow extrapolation of results from ferrets to humans, it was investigated whether airborne transmissible IAVs also preferentially infect human nasal respiratory epithelial cells. Primary human nasal epithelial cells (Mucilair
 <sup>TM</sup>) were purchased from Epithelix SÃ¡rl. These cells were isolated from 14 healthy donors who underwent polypectomy, pooled, and fully differentiated at the air-liquid interface on a transwell membrane for 45 days. They contain the cell types present in the nasal respiratory epithelium: ciliated cells, mucus-producing goblet cells and basal cells. However, the origin of the respiratory epithelium, i.e., nasal conchae or nasopharynx, is unknown. First, in order to understand whether these primary human nasal epithelial cells can be used as a model for human nasal epithelial tissue, the binding pattern of human (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), avian (A/H5N1) and modified avian (A/H5N1
 <sub>Q222L/G224S</sub>) influenza viruses to these cells was determined using virus histochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 6). Ferret nasal turbinates and duck colon tissues were used as controls for the binding of human and avian influenza viruses respectively. A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H5N1
