<p id="Par9">At 2 dpi, the nasal olfactory epithelium was less infected by the airborne transmissible A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> viruses than the nasal respiratory epithelium (40%, 0% and 7% respectively). In contrast, more cells of the nasal olfactory epithelium were infected by the A/H5N1 virus than of the respiratory epithelium (18% and 2% respectively). Given these observations, it appears unlikely that tropism in the nasal olfactory epithelium plays a role in airborne transmission of IAVs. Infectious virus titers in the nasal turbinates did not reflect these differences, partially because the homogenized nasal turbinate sample contained both nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Mean virus titers in nasal turbinates of ferrets inoculated with A/H3N2 were lower than those in ferrets inoculated with A/H1N1, A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> and A/H5N1. Moreover, despite infecting a lower percentage of cells, the A/H5N1 virus replicated to high virus titers in the nasal turbinates. Together, these data suggest that infection of the nasal respiratory epithelium, rather than replication to high titers in the nasal turbinates, is a driver of airborne transmission. The availability of genetically close viruses with distinct infection phenotypes in the nose of ferrets (A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> and A/H5N1) provided an excellent opportunity to investigate the substitutions that were responsible for the nasal respiratory epithelium tropism. To this end, subsets of mutations that are present in A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> were introducted into the A/H5N1 background. Recombinant viruses carrying either the substitutions in the polymerase and the nucleoprotein genes (A/H5N1
 <sub>POL-mut</sub>, containing PB2-E627K, PB1-H99Y, PB1-I368V, NP-R99K, NP-S345N) or the substitutions in the HA gene (A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-mut</sub> containing HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, HA-Q222L, HA-G224S (A/H5 numbering throughout the manuscript

 </sup>)) were produced using reverse genetics and used to inoculate three ferrets intranasally. Two days after inoculation, the animals were euthanized. The percentage of epithelium that was antigen-positive in the nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia was scored and infectious virus titers in the homogenized nasal turbinates tissue were determined. Eighty-eight percent of the nasal respiratory epithelial cells of ferrets inoculated with A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-mut</sub> were infected, against 13% for ferrets inoculated with A/H5N1
 <sub>POL-mut</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Using combinations of the four HA substitutions, we subsequently found that receptor-binding substitutions Q222L/G224S alone were not sufficient to confer a similar nasal respiratory epithelium tropism as that of A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub>. However, when Q222L and G224S were combined with either H103Y or T156A, the percentage of nasal respiratory epithelium that was infected was similar or higher to that of A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, Panel a and b). Comparable to our previous observations, all viruses replicated to similar titers in the nasal turbinates, independent of the percentage of infected nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium.
