<p id="Par27">MDCK cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus stocks, nose swabs, throat swabs, or homogenized tissue samples. The cells were washed with PBS 1 h after inoculation and cultured in infection medium, consisting of EMEM supplemented with 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> PEN, 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> STR, 2 mM L-Glu, 1.5 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 1× NEAA, and 20 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> trypsin (
 <italic>N</italic>-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone [TPCK]-treated trypsin; Sigma-Aldrich). Three days after inoculation, supernatants of cell cultures were tested for agglutinating activity using turkey red blood cells (TRBCs) as an indicator of virus replication. Infectious virus titers were calculated from four replicates each of the homogenized tissue samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs and from ten replicates of the virus stocks by the method of Reed and Muench
