<p id="Par24">(ii) Ferret infection experiments: Three ferrets per group were inoculated intranasally with a total dose of 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of virus by instillation of 250 μl of virus suspension dropwise in each nostril. The A/H5N1 viruses tested carried subsets of airborne substitutions: A/H5N1
 <sub>POL-mut</sub> (PB2-E627K, PB1-H99Y, PB1-I368V, NP-R99K, NP-S345N), A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-mut</sub> (HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, HA-Q222L and HA-G224S), A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-Q222L/G224S</sub>, A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-H103Y/Q222L/G224S</sub>, A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-T156A/Q222L/G224S</sub>. Two days after inoculation, ferrets were euthanized by cardiac puncture and nasal turbinates were harvested. The left nasal turbinates were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3μm for immunohistochemical analysis. The right nasal turbinates were homogenized in transport medium using a FastPrep system (MP Biomedicals) with 2 one-quarter-inch ceramic sphere balls, centrifuged at 1500 ×
