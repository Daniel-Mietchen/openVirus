<p id="Par25">Sequential slides of nasal turbinates were deparaffinised in xylene and hydrated using graded alcohols. They were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE staining) or for the detection of the IAV nucleoprotein as described here. Antigen retrieval was performed using a 0,1% solution of the protease from 
 <italic>Streptomycus griseus</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. After a wash in PBS, endogenous peroxidases were blocked by using a solution of 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After one wash in PBS and one wash in PBS-0.05% Tween, slides were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against IAV nucleoprotein (mouse IgG2a anti-influenza A nucleoprotein, H16-L10-4R5 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HB-65
 <sup>™</sup>) diluted 1/400 in PBS-0,1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or with an isotype control (mouse IgG2a, MAB003, R&amp;D Systems) diluted 1/200 in PBS-0.1% BSA for an hour at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-0.05% Tween, slides were incubated with a secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG2a coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Biorad, Star133P) diluted 1/100 in PBS-0.1% BSA for an hour at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, HRP was revealed using 3-Amino-9-Ethylcarbazole (AEC, Sigma-Aldrich) in N,N-dimethylformamide (Honeywell Fluka) diluted in a final concentration of 0.0475 M of sodium acetate (NaAc, pH = 5) with 0.05% of H

 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min at room temperature, resulting in a bright red precipitate. A counterstain was performed with hematoxylin and the slides were embedded using Kaiser’s glycerol gelatin (Merck). In each staining procedure, a lung section from a cat infected experimentally with an A/H5N1 virus was used as a positive control. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed blindly by a veterinary pathologist. One slide with all the nasal tissue (including both respiratory and olfactory epithelium) was analysed per ferret. For the scoring, all the fields available on each slide were analysed and a percentage score was estimated for each slide. Pictures were taken using an Olympus BX41 microscope, an Olympus DP27 camera and acquisition Olympus CellSens entry software. The white balance of the pictures was adjusted using Adobe Photoshop.
