 <sub>2</sub> diluted in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, a blocking step with a Tris-NaCl-blocking buffer (TNB buffer, 0.5% of blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer) in 0.1 M Tris HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH = 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature was performed. Hundred hemagglutination units of fluorescin isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 A/Netherlands/213/2003, A/H5N1, A/H5N1
 <sub>HA-Q222L/G224S</sub>) were incubated on the slides overnight at 4 °C in TNB buffer. After two washes with PBS-0.05% Tween, FITC was detected with a peroxidase-labelled rabbit–anti-FITC (DAKO, P5100) diluted 1/100 in TNB buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with PBS-0.05% Tween, the signal was amplified using a tyramide amplification system (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After two washes with PBS-0.05% Tween, slides were incubated with HRP coupled anti-streptavidin antibody (DAKO, D0397) diluted 1/300 in TNB buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, HRP was revealed using 3-Amino-9-Ethylcarbazole (AEC, Sigma-Aldrich) in N,N-dimethylformamide (Honeywell Fluka) diluted in a final concentration of 0.0475 M of sodium acetate (NaAc, pH = 5) with 0.05% of H

 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min at room temperature, resulting in a bright red precipitate. A counterstain was performed with hematoxylin and the slides were embedded using Kaiser’s glycerol gelatin (Merck). Ferret nasal turbinates and duck colon were included as controls for binding of human and avian viruses respectively. Pictures were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope, an Olympus ColorView IIIu camera and acquisition Olympus Cell
 <sup>A</sup> software. The white balance of the pictures was adjusted using Adobe Photoshop.
