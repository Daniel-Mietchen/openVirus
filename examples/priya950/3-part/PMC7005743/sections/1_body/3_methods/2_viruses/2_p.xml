 </sup>. The tagged A/H3N2
 <sub>var</sub> virus contains the following synonymous nucleotide substitutions relative to the untagged A/H3N2 virus: PB2 C354T, C360T; PB1 A540G; PA A342G, G333A; HA T308C, C311A, C314T, A464T, C467G, T470A; NP C537T, T538A, C539G; NA C418G, T421A, A424C; M G586A; NS C329T, C335T, A341G. These mutations were introduced into the pPOL1 reverse genetics plasmids using QuikChange (Agilent) site directed mutagenesis, according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. For A/H3N2 viruses, a 12 plasmid rescue system based on pPOL1 and pCAGGS vectors and co-culture of 293T and MDCK cells were used. Plaque isolates derived from rescue supernatants were amplified in 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs incubated at 33
 <sup>o</sup>C to generate virus stocks and stock titers were determined by endpoint tirations in MDCK cells.
