 <sub>var</sub> virus carries a single synonymous nucleotide substitution per segment relative to the untagged A/H1N1 virus, as follows (nucleotide numbering is from the 5′ end of the cRNA): PB2 C273T, PB1 T288C, PA C360T, HA C305T, NP A351G, NA G336A, M G295A, NS C341T. These substitutions were introduced into the reverse genetics plasmids using QuikChange (Agilent) site directed mutagenesis, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (for a complete list of the primers used in this study, see Supplementary Table
