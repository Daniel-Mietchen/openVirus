<p id="p0115">The important point in this topic is reminding some of neglected matters after natural disasters including the flood. It should be assessed who is most at risk of contamination with dead bodies? How safe dispose of these bodies should be performed? And how can people be protected from infection? It is a great concern after flooding that unburied dead human or animal bodies are potential sources of viruses and microbial agents which can easily contaminate water and soil. An important concern post flooding is the infections among survived populations through contaminated water and soil. The route of contamination is inappropriate burial of dead victims The risk of infection associated with dead bodies and population most at risk is unclear. It is clear that volunteers, rescue team and military personnel are most likely to be infected through exposure with infective agents (

Infection with pathogens including tuberculosis, group A streptococcal infection hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV infection, gastroenteritis and probably meningitis is a great threat for whom carrying cadavers (

Usually flood victims die from trauma and drowning and are less likely to have acute infections or rare diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). In contrast, more probably, infections like tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and enteric pathogens spread from an ill person to the others (

 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Vass et al., 2002</xref>). Concerns about contagious diseases may lead to unplanned disposal of dead bodies and sometimes unnecessary precautions such as burring corpses in common graves and adding lime for disinfection. Finding new burial sites after flooding is a big challenge because the flood leaves huge mas of mud or saturated soil. Also, for protection of water supplies, the distance of at least 30 m from springs or watercourse and 250 m from well or any source of drinking water with burial sites should be considered. However, distance must be chosen based on local hydrogeological conditions. The most important hazards for whom carrying the dead bodies are blood-borne viruses, gastrointestinal infections, and tuberculosis. Basic hygiene and using gloves, mask and body bags can be useful in protecting dead body managers. Precautions to volunteers for preventing from infection are necessary. In lack of enough sites for burial or difficulty in identification of dead bodies, mass grave is used (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Morgan, 2004</xref>). Same precautions are needed for animal dead bodies. Animal dead bodies are potential sources of zoonotic infections and in some cases dangerous bacterial infections (e.g. 
 <italic>Anthrax</italic>) and also they can contaminate water with feces (e.g. 
 <italic>Cryptosporidia</italic>) and discharge from lesions (
 <italic>Listeria</italic>, 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic>) but only when dead bodies are in water as these microorganisms cannot survive long time if the animal body is put in dry land. Therefore, proper disposal of animals is important after natural disasters including flood (PAHO Cataloguing in Publication).
