 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Murray, 2013</xref>). There are numerous reports about outbreaks of leptospirosis after flooding from different countries all around the world (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Murray, 2013</xref>) (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and animals, particularly rodents are known as reservoirs. Human infection occurs directly in contact with urine of an infected animal or indirectly through contaminated water and soil (

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Diaz, 2015</xref>). Post flooding, risk factors such as increasing rodent population, inadequate sanitation, overcrowdings, rising temperatures, poor health care quality, and poverty increases the risk of leptospirosis outbreaks. (

 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2018</xref>) (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to different reports from various regions of Iran, the number of leptospirosis cases in human and livestock has been increased especially in northern provinces close to Caspian Sea (

 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Therefore, awareness of the potential risk of disease and prevention of transmission after flooding, management and urgent care of survivors are needed. Destroying the breeding sites post flooding is an effective protection procedure. Using repellents in biting hours and screens in doors and windows can protect individuals from mosquito bites. These prevention program can reduce human infection and risk of disease in flooding emergency (
