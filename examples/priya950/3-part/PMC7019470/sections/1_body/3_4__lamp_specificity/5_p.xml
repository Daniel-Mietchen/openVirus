<p>Several investigations have demonstrated that carry-over contamination and nonspecific amplifications are some of the major problems associated with the LAMP assay, producing false-positive results [

In one study, Kaarj et al. 2018 developed a wax-printed paper microfluidic chip utilizing RT-LAMP, whose results could be detected by smartphone imaging. They used a previously published primer set and observed that temperature was the most important factor for a specific and efficient RT-LAMP reaction to ensure reliable results and eliminate non-target amplification. Assay specificity was evaluated only against the Influenza A/H1N1 virus, which precludes generalization of this result to other arboviruses [
