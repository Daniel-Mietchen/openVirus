<p>During the initial stages of the LAMP reaction, the inner primers (FIP or BIP) anneal by Watsonâ€“Crick complementarity to regions F2c or B2c within the target region. The outer primers (F3 or B3) then hybridizes to region F3c or B3c on the target and initiates the formation of self-hybridizing loop structures by the invasion of strands of DNA sequences already extended from the inner primers, including FIP and BIP. This results in the formation of a dumbbell-shaped DNA, and the same dumbbell structure then becomes a seed for exponential amplification (

The amplified products can be detected by a variety of methods, including dsDNA binding dyes, turbidity measurement, UV light irradiation, real-time fluorescence, gel electrophoresis, smartphone camera, AC susceptometry, and systems based on lateral flow assays [
