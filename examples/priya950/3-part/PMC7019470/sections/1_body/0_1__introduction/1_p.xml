<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus from the genus

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other notable viruses within this genus include dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Like most flaviviruses, the ZIKV is an enveloped virus with a capsid 50 nm in diameter and an RNA genome of approximately 11 Kb in length. The genome is translated as a single long open reading frame (ORF) and encodes ten proteins. This includes seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5), which mediate viral replication for synthesis of new viral particles, and three structural proteins (C, prM, and E), which comprise the capsid and play a key role in host immune evasion [
