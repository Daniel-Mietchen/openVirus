<p>Chotiwan and coworkers described a LAMP assay for rapid detection of Asian- and African-lineage Zika viruses without RNA extraction [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The authors demonstrated that ZIKV RNA can be detected by the LAMP test using infected C3/36 mosquito cell lines and infected mosquitoes. Results were visualized by turbidity after 1 h of incubation of the sample in a simple heat block.
