<p>More recently, we developed a novel RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV in mosquitoes samples from in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In this study, we reported a one-step RT-LAMP assay, specific and very sensitive for the detection of ZIKV in experimentally and naturally infected mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) without RNA extraction or reverse transcriptase reaction. Importantly, our assay can be performed in a heat block and the results distinguished between positive and negative samples by color change through the naked eye. In addition, the overall performances of the RT-LAMP assay relative to RT-qPCR for the detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples were performed using 60 mosquito samples collected at the epicenter of the Zika epidemic in Pernambuco state, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The ZIKV RT-LAMP assay for detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples had a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 88.06% to 100.00%), diagnostic specificity of 91.18 % (95% CI 76.32% to 98.14%), ZIKV prevalence of 46.03% (95% CI 33.39% to 59.06%), positive predictive value of 90.62% (95% CI 76.64% to 96.61%), negative predictive value of 100%, and the overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP test was determined as 95.24% (95% CI 86.71% to 99.01%). Considering these advantages and satisfactory results, RT-LAMP using Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase is more suitable to be used for molecular diagnostics in field settings, mainly in low-resource scenarios.
