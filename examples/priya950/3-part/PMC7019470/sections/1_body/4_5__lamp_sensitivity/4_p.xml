<p>As mentioned, we have recently developed an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> spiked with a 10-fold serial dilution of ZIKV ranging from 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> PFU without RNA extraction from ZIKV spiked mosquito samples, with positive detection down to 10
 <sup>−5</sup> PFU. Additionally, our RT-LAMP assay was also able to detect ZIKV in mosquito samples that had been previously assayed as negative by RT-qPCR with Ct value ranging from 38.6 to 40.3. Taken together, our results suggest that our modification of the RT-LAMP assay could provide sensitivity 10,000 times greater than RT-qPCR for the detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples, thus corroborating previous studies demonstrating that the sensitivity of the LAMP method can be superior to RT-qPCR [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Importantly, there are a number of reasons that might have involved for this variation in sensitivity, including differences in enzymes and research suppliers, primers, detection systems, and type of biological samples.
