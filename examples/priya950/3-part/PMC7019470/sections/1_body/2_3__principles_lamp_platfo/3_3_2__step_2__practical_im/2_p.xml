<p>In establishing a new LAMP diagnostic assay, it is important to optimize the protocol and include the proper controls to limit the risk of false positives or non-target amplification [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Variables to consider in LAMP optimization include Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations, dNTP mix concentrations, primers, time reaction, and temperature reaction, which all have a key role in producing reliable results [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Lower LAMP temperatures and excessive free Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are associated with non-target amplification [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and, indeed, previous studies have reported false-positive results in RT-LAMP assays [
