<p>Recently, Wang et al. (2016) developed an RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV using the commercially available Loopamp RNA Amplification Kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The kit contains a mixture of Bst DNA polymerase and AMV reverse transcriptase for the reaction. Furthermore, the study evaluated three different sample processing methods (proteinase K treatment, alkaline lysis, and boiling lysis) and compared them with RNA extraction using a commercial kit (QIAmp viral RNA mini kit). They showed that the RT-LAMP assay using proteinase K treatment had similar sensitivity compared to RNA extracted using the commercial kit and better than the other two methods.
