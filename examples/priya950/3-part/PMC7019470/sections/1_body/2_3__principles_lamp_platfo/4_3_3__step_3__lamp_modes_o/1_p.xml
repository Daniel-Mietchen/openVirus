<p>An incredible array of outputs has been designed to allow users to detect positive LAMP reactions. For ZIKV alone, this includes colorimetric detection using fluorescent dyes, UV light irradiation, agarose gel electrophoresis, turbidity, real-time fluorescence, smartphone, lateral flow assay, and AC susceptometry. Below we review each of these output modes, beginning with the fluorescent dyes calcein and SYBR green I dyes, which are some of the most widely used for the detection of LAMP amplicons. Here as target sequences are amplified; the dye binds becoming fluorescent and creating an optical readout of LAMP-mediated detection [

Although it presents adequate sensitivity, SYBR green I could inhibit LAMP reaction if the dye is added during the set-up of the LAMP reaction mixture, and when added after incubation, there is a real risk of cross-contamination between LAMP reaction tubes [

However, our approach was to pre-load reaction tube lids with 1 Î¼L of 1:10 dilution of SYBR green I dye to the center of the tube caps before the reaction. By simply inverting the reactions after isothermal incubation, the SYBR green I mixes with the sample, allowing the results to be observed immediately by eye based on the change in color [
