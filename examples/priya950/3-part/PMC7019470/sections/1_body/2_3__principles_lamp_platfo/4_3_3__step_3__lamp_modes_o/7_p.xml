<p>In another study, Kaarj et al. (2018) developed an RT-LAMP assay using a microfluidic chip combined with a pH indicator and a smartphone to detect ZIKV. Using the pH change of productive LAMP reactions, ZIKV positive samples from urine and human plasma could be quantified with the pH-induced color change after only 15 min using the smartphone camera. Moreover, the assay was specific and provided an impressive 1 copy/ÂµL limit of detection [

(2018) developed an RT-LAMP assay coupled with reverse dot blot analysis (RDB) to detect ZIKV in human saliva. The system was configured as a bench-top isothermal amplification device and was capable of analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection using the RDB technique [
