<p>Several studies have focused on developing lateral flow assays (LFA) coupled with the LAMP method for end-point detection of ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. LFA is a favored technique because it is user-friendly, practical for in-field applications, lightweight, portable, and low-cost. One such study by Song et al. (2016), developed a disposable cassette based on RT-LAMP for rapid molecular detection of ZIKV. The instrument-free POC system uses a chemically heated cup to enable testing without the need for electrical power, which greatly reduces instrumentation complexity, processing time, and cost compared to the gold standard method (RT-qPCR). Using leuco crystal violet (LCV) dye, which is visible with the naked eye, they demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay combined with a microfluidic cassette could detect as few as 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the ZIKV in as little as 40 min [
