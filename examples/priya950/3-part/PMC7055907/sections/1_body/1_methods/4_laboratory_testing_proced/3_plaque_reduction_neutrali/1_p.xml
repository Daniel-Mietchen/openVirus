<p>Samples positive for RVFV antibodies by either IgM or IgG ELISA were further analyzed using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to confirm the presence of antibodies against RVFV. Each virus isolate was diluted to a standard concentration that produced approximately 50 plaques. Serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Each sample was serially diluted in a sterile 96-well plate to determine the end point titer or highest dilution that neutralized at least 90% of the virus at 1:20 to 1:80 concentration in maintenance medium (minimum essential media [Sigma] with Earle's salts, 2% fetal bovine serum, 2% glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 1 μL/mL amphotericin B). A constant amount of diluted virus (1 x 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/ml) was added into each well of the 96-well plate containing serially diluted serum samples and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The virus–antibody mixture was then transferred to a 24-well plate with a confluent Vero cell monolayer and incubated at 37°C in CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1hr for virus adsorption, after which an overlay of 2.5% methylcellulose was added and incubated for 5–10 days at 37°C in CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The plates were retrieved from the incubator and stained with 0.25% crystal violet in absolute ethanol. All reactive sera from the initial screening at 1:20 were further serially diluted to determine the endpoint titer, in the highest dilution that neutralized 90% or greater of the RVFV relative to a serum-free control.
