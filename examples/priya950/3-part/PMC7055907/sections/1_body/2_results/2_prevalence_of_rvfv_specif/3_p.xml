<p>Adjusted Odds ratios for RVFV IgG seropositivity using the GEE model are presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results indicated that after adjusting for other factors, males were at a significantly 67% higher risk of infection by RVFV than females (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.17–2.39). Increasing age was significantly associated with RVFV infection (Wald Chi = 94.2, df = 5,
