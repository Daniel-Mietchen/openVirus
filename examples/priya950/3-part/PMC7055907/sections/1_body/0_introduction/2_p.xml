<p>RVFV is transmitted by diverse species of mosquitoes broadly classified into primary vectors (floodwater 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>) that maintain the virus for variable number of years in their drought resistant eggs deposited on wet soils on low lying depressions on land [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following heavy persistent rains with flooding, the eggs hatch with a proportion already infected that emerge as infected adult female mosquitoes initiating transmission to nearby livestock which serve as amplifiers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subsequently, secondary vectors (
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes) are infected taking over transmission, potentially coupled with livestock and wildlife movement, and spread the virus far and wide resulting in outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. RVF mainly affects ruminants, especially cattle and sheep, and the transmission to humans is through direct contact with infected blood, animal tissue, abortus foetus, or birthing fluid, or through infected mosquito bites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RVFV infection in livestock causes abortions and more than 95% perinatal mortality in livestock (i.e., sheep, goats, cattle, and camels) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most RVF cases in humans are subclinical with flu-like symptoms and may go undetected, but a small percentage of cases develop severe symptoms such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever disease with high case-fatality rates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Ocular, liver, and kidney disease are also common complications [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a significant association between RVFV infections during pregnancy and an increased risk for miscarriage in humans has recently been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Outbreaks are associated with large economic losses affecting agricultural production due to loss of livestock, vaccination costs, and trade ban on animals and animal products consequently resulting in poverty among communities which rely on livestock production as their economic mainstay [
