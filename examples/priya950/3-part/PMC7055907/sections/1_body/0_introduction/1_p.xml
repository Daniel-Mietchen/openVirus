 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The African continent has been affected mostly with human infections and outbreaks affecting Eastern Africa in 1997/98 and 2006/2007 which was widespread in Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Djibouti, Sudan and South Sudan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The full impact of these outbreaks was not fully quantified but it was documented that Kenya suffered economic losses of up to US $ 32 million due to losses of animal herds, vaccination costs and trade bans [

In Kenya, the 1997/98 and 2006/2007 RVFV outbreaks led to 600 and 150 human deaths and over 27,000 and 700 estimated cases respectively, overstretching the limited public health resources and facilities in the North-Eastern regions of Kenya [
