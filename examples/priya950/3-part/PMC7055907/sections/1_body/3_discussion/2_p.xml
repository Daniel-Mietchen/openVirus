<p>We monitored five herds that were found to move long distances in search of water and pasture. The Garissa county herd moved to Boni forest and back each year, passing through Fafi, Ijara, and Lamu sub-counties. The Tana River herds moved from Fafi and Bura sub-counties to the Tana Delta. The Tana River and Garissa county livestock were converging along the Tana River delta. The Isiolo herds moved long distances as well, with the Isiolo North and Isiolo South herds converging in some areas on their way back. The intense practice of pastoralism by these communities in search of pasture and water is a possible factor that could lead to increased exposure to RVFV infections as they move into new ecosystems, e.g. the Tana River delta. The climatic conditions in the three study sites are characterized by high temperatures and occasional flooding during the rainy season, favoring the emergence and survival of RVFV primary and secondary vectors that have the potential to cause outbreaks [
