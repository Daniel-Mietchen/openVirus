<p id="Par45">It is interesting to compare our results with the recent debate whether a potentiating mutation could occur during an epidemic or whether it usually occurs before the start of the epidemic

 </sup>. For instance, in the case of the Ebola outbreak 2013-2016 it was suggested that one or several mutations identified during the outbreak caused the strong infectivity of the virus

 </sup>. Potentially this question might also determine the chances of a severe mutation of the Ebola virus from a droplet to an airborne transmission route

 </sup>. It has been argued that within-host selectivity provides a much quicker adaptation than between-host selectivity since the time-scale of selectivity is much shorter within a host than between hosts. In the context of our study, the within-host scenario is one of well-mixed dynamics (large

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), where we found a domination of the non-mutated form. Only for intermediate small-worldness do we find the mutated form to be competitive. Our results suggest that the decisive mutation benefits from the small-worldness and may thus arise during the epidemic wave on a network with the suitable properties. This finding substantiates the claims for a mutation during the epidemic
