<p id="Par43">Qualitatively the behavior we describe is similar for the cases of discrete and continuous mutational spaces. The scalings of mutation probabilities, however, are different for the two cases. While in the discrete case the probability to a supercritical mutant state scales with the mutation rate in power law form, we found exponential behavior for the continuous case. For both models, we presented analytical derivations of these relations. The scalings with the small-worldness parameter 
 <italic>p</italic>, however, are more complex and our discussion in Appendix S2 gives a first hint on the differences of the continuous and discrete cases. For the limit of a continuous mutation space, our simulations suggest that long-range links additionally help to overcome a local blocking to the spreading of pathogens in intermediate genetic states (see Appendix S2 for more details).
