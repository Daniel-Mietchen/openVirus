<p id="Par26">This points to a very distinctive feature of epidemic outbreaksÂ with critical mutations: If the average fraction of infected nodes is, e.g., 30%, it could either mean that in each run around 30% of the nodes are infected, or, in an extreme case, in 30% of the runs almost all nodes are infected, while in 70% of the runs most nodes stay healthy. From a public health point of view we think that the second case is the more alarming one, since an outbreak of a deadly virus could lead to extinction of the entire population. Therefore, in our model, with short-cuts and random mutations, the outcomes and assessments of risks are different exactly in this respect that the chance of extinction rises dramatically.</p>
