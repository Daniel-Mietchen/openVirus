<p id="Par25">The difference of our scenario with mutations to this former mutationless case of SIR in small world networks is the generation of an explosive giant component in a fraction of the runs. For the usual percolation, close to the transition point, the size of a giant component is smaller than the total population. Accordingly, for small mutation rate it is found that the distribution of the fraction of infected nodes per run has a peak at a value between 0 and 1, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. This means that in a given run the infection either hits the giant component at, e.g., 50% of all nodes, or the contagion dies out. However, for sufficiently frequent mutations, in each of our small world networks there is either an almost complete coverage (&gt;90%) or only a tiny fraction of the nodes becomes infected and removed, see Fig.
