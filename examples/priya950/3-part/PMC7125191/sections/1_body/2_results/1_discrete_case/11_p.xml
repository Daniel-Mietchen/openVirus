<p id="Par31">Finally, discussing the probability of a sweep following a mutation, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows that the fraction of sweeps declines again for 
 <italic>p</italic> larger than 0.1 even if the number of critical mutations does not shrink. An obvious scenario is that for large 
 <italic>p</italic> the giant cluster formed by the non-mutated pathogens (
 <italic>γ</italic> = −1) is large and spanning the entire domain quick enough so that much of the network is sufficiently covered with the subcritical infection before the supercritical form can spread. This would particularly effect those cases in which the mutation rate is small, such that a critical mutation needs much time to develop.
