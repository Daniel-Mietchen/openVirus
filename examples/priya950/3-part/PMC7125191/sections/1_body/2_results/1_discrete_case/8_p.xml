<p id="Par28">To understand the causes of the described phenomenon, we now analyze the scaling behavior of the percentage of sweeps in dependence on the mutation rate, 
 <italic>χ</italic>, and the fraction of shortcuts, 
 <italic>p</italic>. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> presents a double-logarithmic plot in which the sweep fraction is plotted versus 1∕
 <italic>χ</italic>. There is a clear linear relation on the log-log scales for small 
 <italic>χ</italic>, which is characterized by a slope independent on 
 <italic>p</italic>. With increasing 
 <italic>p</italic>, the lines are shifted to larger values in sweep fraction. For larger mutation rates, the linear dependence is lost and the fraction of sweeps saturates for all 
 <italic>p</italic>. For very large 
 <italic>p</italic>, we note that the trend reverses and much a smaller sweep fraction results for a large range in 
 <italic>χ</italic> (red curve, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5).
