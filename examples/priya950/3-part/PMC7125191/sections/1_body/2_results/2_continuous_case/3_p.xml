<p id="Par34">At first glance, we find a similar qualitative behavior as in the discrete case: sweeps in general occur for larger \sigma and 
 <italic>p</italic> values, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>. The mutation probability scales now exponentially with several regimes. For very small noise, the mutation probability disappears exponentially with 
 <italic>σ</italic> (data not shown). Similar to the discrete case, the slopes of these graphs do not depend on 
 <italic>p</italic> in this regime.
