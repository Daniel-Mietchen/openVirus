<p id="Par38">A few words on the limitations of this approximation are in order. The dependence of 
 <italic>C</italic> on the network properties or, in our case, on 
 <italic>p</italic>, however, remains phenomenological. Additional numerical analysis shows that the described prevalence of supercritical mutations for larger 
 <italic>p</italic> does not occur in a grid-like network. SI Appendix, Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows that the probability for supercritical mutations is much smaller for a local network (without short-cuts) even if the mean size of the infected clusters is similarly large as in the small-world case. This suggests that increasing the number of long links in the network helps the mutations by way of (i) increasing the percolation cluster (i.e., lowering the percolation threshold) and (ii) by lifting local blocking of mutated nodes. Thus, we conclude that, besides the increasing percolation cluster, it is the topology of the small-world network that drives the occurrence of mutations and global epidemics in our continuous model.
