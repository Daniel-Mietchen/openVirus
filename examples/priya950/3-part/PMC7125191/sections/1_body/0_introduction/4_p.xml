<p id="Par5">Since small-world networks are so ubiquitous in our world, interest in dynamical processes for such networks has grown quickly. This particularly holds for epidemics where spatial relations between hosts (e.g., transport between villages, city, or countries) are relevant. Importantly, it was found that generally small-worldness lowers the threshold for percolation and thus also promotes the global contagion on networks with this property

 </sup>. We here built on this earlier modeling work for epidemics on small-world networks. We assume a network of nodes which are inhabited by individuals (hosts of the pathogen). Because of transport of individuals between nodes, infecting agents can travel with them to a connected node and infect the nodeâ€™s community. This process is modeled here by the established Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in which, for simplicity, individuals at each node are collectively in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered or removed (R).
