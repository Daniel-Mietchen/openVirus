<p id="Par9">Generally, the concept of the fitness landscape relates the genotype of an organism to its survival and reproductive success. If the fitness landscape is flat, all genotypes of a population have the same chance of replication. If however, the landscape exhibits regions of different height, with peaks surrounded by deep valleys, a population usually climbs uphill by series of small genetic changes. In our model we specifically consider the generic case where we have two peaks and one valley in the fitness space, i.e., states between the maxima are selectively disadvantageous (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Thus the non-spatial part of our model is similar to point models of stochastic tunneling through a fitness valley
