<p id="Par8">Our model comprises a two-dimensional spatial network of nodes that adopt one of the three SIR states. A one-dimensional fitness variable is attached to each node that hosts theÂ virus, i.e., that is in the I-state. As motivated above, we have chosen a genetically dependent fitness variable that directly affects the node-to-node transmission probability.</p>
