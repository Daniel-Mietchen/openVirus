   <italic>R</italic>) of new cases adjacent to clusters of known cases. The points correspond to the number of clusters of known cases with edges to new cases, which we refer to as ‘active’ clusters. (left) This plot summarizes the trends obtained when cases are stratified by year of sample collection. Trends in 
   <italic>R</italic> and numbers of active clusters are coloured with respect to data set (see inset legend). (right) This plot contrasts the trends obtained from the Tennessee data set when cases were stratified by year of sample collection (lighter red) versus the year of diagnosis (darker red). Note that the collection date trend is not identical to the trend in the left plot because we downsampled cases to match the availability of diagnosis dates.
