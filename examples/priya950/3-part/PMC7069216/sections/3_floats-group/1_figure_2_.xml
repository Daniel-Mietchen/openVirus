  <p>Decay in bipartite edge densities with increasing time lags. Each point represents a bipartite graph at a given time lag (difference in years, 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis), coloured with respect to the data set (see inset legend). We added random noise along the horizontal axis to separate overlapping points. The log-transformed 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the frequency of edges between cases in different time points below the threshold 
   <italic>d</italic>
   <sub>max</sub> = 0.04 (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E3">Equation 3</xref>). (left) Decay of edge densities with respect to dates of sample collection. Each trend line summarizes the binomial regression model (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E4">Equation 4</xref>) for each data set. (right) Decay of edge densities with respect to dates of HIV diagnosis in Middle Tennessee. Each point was scaled in proportion to the mean degree size among known cases in the earlier time point. Bipartite graphs without any edges are represented by × marks at the arbitrary value of 0.005, since zero cannot be displayed on a log-transformed axis. The dashed line indicates the fit of the binomial regression to these data, while the solid line indicates the fit of an extended model (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E5">Equation 5</xref>) that controls for variation in the mean degree size.
