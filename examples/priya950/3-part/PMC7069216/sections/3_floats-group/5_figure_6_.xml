 <caption>
  <p>GAIC plotted against the cut-off threshold for five progressively right-censored subgraphs with respect to sample collection (left) and diagnosis (right) for the Middle Tennessee data set. The minimum GAIC for each plot is indicated by a circular mark. Arrows and dashed lines indicate where the GAIC-optimized threshold from the previous result would carry over to the subsequent year.</p>
