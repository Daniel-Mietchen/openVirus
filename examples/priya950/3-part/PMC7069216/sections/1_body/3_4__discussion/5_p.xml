<p>An important caveat to our approach is that the expected probability of an edge between specific known and new cases is very small. Consequently, our method requires a substantial number of new cases to parameterize models of the variation in edge densities among clusters and, ultimately, to discriminate between the null and weighted models. (Note that the number of cases sampled in a given year does not correspond to the annual incidence.) Given the results summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa011-F6">Fig. 6</xref>, if those requirements are not met, the minimal GAIC that results from the theoretical MAUP trade-off may be masked by the initial noise of a graph with low case coverage and the merging of clusters with increasing thresholds. The results that we obtained with the smallest data set (Northern Alberta) and our sub-sampling experiments (

In addition, our comparison of sample collection versus diagnosis dates (
