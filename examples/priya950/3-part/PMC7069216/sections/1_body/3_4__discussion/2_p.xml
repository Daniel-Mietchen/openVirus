 </xref>), our outcome variable (the number of new cases per genetic cluster) is directly dependent on the same parameters that reshape the partition of the spatial distribution of covarates into units. This dual dependency results in an asymptotically increasing model likelihood with increasing distance thresholds, plateauing at the point where all known cases were assigned to the same giant cluster, such that any new cases are effectively guaranteed to be adjacent to this cluster. We addressed this unique problem by formulating a null model where the predicted growth of a cluster was directly proportional to its relative size in the number of known cases. Hence, this null model provided a useful baseline that controlled for the proportionate effect of the largest cluster with increasing cut-offs, thereby enabling us to focus on the predictive value of variation in covariates among clusters.
