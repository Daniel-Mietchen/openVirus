 <italic> </italic>2,779 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences predominantly from the middle Tennessee region of the USA were collected by the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic in Nashville between 2001 and 2015. These data were linked to patient records to extract limited data (e.g. year of HIV-1 diagnosis) and anonymized before being made available for this study; further details are available in 
 <xref rid="veaa011-B10" ref-type="bibr">Dennis 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)
 </xref>. All sequence data were annotated with years of sample collection. We used the pre-existing HIV subtype annotations from the sequence records to filter each data set for non-B subtypes, and excluded repeated samples from the same individual. Next, we filtered each data set to remove any sequences with a proportion of ambiguous nucleotides above 5 per cent, which affected 1 sequence from each of the northern Alberta and Seattle data sets, and 163 sequences from Tennessee. Given the relatively small number of sequences collected in part of 2013 for the Seattle data set (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>35, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa011-F1">Fig. 1</xref>), we excluded this year to maintain a consistent sampling rate. We retrieved the sample collection dates for Seattle and North Alberta by querying GenBank with the respective accession numbers and extracting this information from the XML stream returned from the server using the BioPython module (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cock 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>) in Python. Next, we used an open-source implementation of the

All other options for the TN93 analyses were set to the default values.
