<p>For each data set, we calculated the TN93 (

For instance, the TN93 distance at the 1 per cent quantile was 0.013 in northern Alberta, while the same quantile was roughly twice this distance for Seattle (0.026) and Tennessee (0.023). Overall, these distributions were significantly different (Kruskal–Wallis test,
