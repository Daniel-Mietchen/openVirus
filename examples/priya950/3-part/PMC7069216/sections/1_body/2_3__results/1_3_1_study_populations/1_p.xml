 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. The lowest mean sampling rate was obtained in northern Alberta, with 114.7 cases per year, compared to 122.4 and 174.4 cases/year for Seattle and Tennessee, respectively. Cases from the final years of sampling were omitted to adjust for studies being terminated before the end of the calendar year. For instance, there were only thirty-five cases sampled in 2013 in the Seattle data set, where sample collection was ended on March 2013 (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B45" ref-type="bibr">Wolf 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>)—since the cases in the final year were reserved to evaluate the predictive models, an artificially low sample size would have a disproportionate influence on model validation. Hence, we proceeded with 110 cases collected in 2012, 110 cases from 2013, and 153 cases from 2015 for Seattle, northern Alberta, and Tennessee, respectively. We refer to the cases sampled in these final years as ‘new cases’, and those sampled in the preceding years as ‘known cases’.
