 </inline-formula> that optimizes the trade-off between case coverage and the number of active clusters, where both quantities have a significant impact on the information content of clusters for public health. We propose that the best criterion for optimizing a clustering method is our ability to predict where the next cases will occur among the resulting clusters. Specifically, we adapted the GAIC (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B22" ref-type="bibr">Nakaya 2000</xref>) to select the optimal threshold. Our implementation of the GAIC is a comparison between two Poisson regression models, where the count outcomes are the number of new cases adjacent to each cluster. In the null model, we assume that the rate parameter is proportional to cluster size as a fraction of all known cases (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Equation 1</xref>), assuming no variation among individual known cases. In the weighted model, the rate parameter is the total weight of known cases in the 
 <italic>i</italic>th cluster, where each weight can be calculated from a linear combination of individual- or group-level attributes. For our analysis, we weighted cases by their predicted edge densities from the extended binomial model (
