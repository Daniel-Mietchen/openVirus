<p>Finally, to assess the stability of GAIC-optimized thresholds over time, we generated additional sub-samples by progressively right censoring the Seattle and Tennessee data sets. If the information content of pairwise TN93 clusters is stable over time, then we should expect the optimized threshold from fitting models to ‘new cases’ in a given year should be similar to the optimized threshold with an additional year of case data. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa011-F6">Figure 6</xref> summarizes our results for the Tennessee data set where the four most recent years were progressively censored by dates of sample collection (left) and diagnosis (right), respectively. Results for the complete Tennessee data set (including cases with missing diagnosis dates) and the Seattle data set are provided in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>. In general, we observed that the optimal threshold identified by the minimum GAIC was relatively stable over time. Although the exact thresholds varied slightly, the optimal threshold from the previous year tended to confer a GAIC similar to the threshold estimated from that year. In our analysis of the Seattle data set, however, the optimal distance thresholds fluctuated between two local minima around
