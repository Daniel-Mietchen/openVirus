<p>The difference in optimal clustering thresholds between northern Alberta and the other sites implies that a globally optimal threshold does not exist. However, variation in thresholds may also be a stochastic outcome due to incomplete sampling. To measure the effect of sampling variation, we repeated our GAIC analysis on random sub-samples of the Seattle and Tennessee data sets to 40 per cent, 60 per cent, and 80 per cent of the data (thirty replicates each). The comparably low number of cases per year in the northern Alberta data set precluded sub-sampling. The results for the Seattle data set are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>. As expected, we observed shallower GAIC trends and more variable GAIC-optimized thresholds with decreasing sample size. However, the optimal thresholds remained clustered around the original value
