<p>To address the MAUP in the context of genetic clustering and public health, we develop an information criterion-based framework inspired by work from 
 <xref rid="veaa011-B22" ref-type="bibr">Nakaya (2000)</xref>. The objective of our framework is to identify the clustering criteria that maximizes the information content of the resulting clusters for forecasting where the next cases will occur. We evaluate our approach on anonymized HIV-1 sequence data from three populations, and demonstrate how this framework can also be used to select between predictive models of cluster growth that utilize different cluster attributes. Furthermore, we examine the problems associated with the selection of clustering criteria or the application of criteria from one population to another, and evaluate the stability of information-optimized criteria for a given population over time.
