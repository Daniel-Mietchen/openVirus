<p>For many infectious diseases, the molecular evolution of the pathogen is sufficiently rapid that genetic differences can accumulate between related infections on a similar time scale as disease transmission. Consequently, it can be effective to cluster cases in a high-dimensional 
 <italic>genetic space</italic> in addition to clustering in physical space and time. In these studies, a case of infection is represented by a pathogen-derived molecular sequence that maps to some point in genetic space, and it may be associated with subject-level metadata such as the diagnosis date or treatment history. Clustering infections by their evolutionary relatedness is a popular method to identify and characterize subgroups with potentially elevated transmission rates. For example, pairs of sequences can be clustered if the number of genetic differences between them falls below some threshold. The resulting clusters are often visualized as a network or undirected graph, where each node (vertex) represents an individual case of infection, and each edge connecting vertices indicate that the sequences of the corresponding cases are within a threshold genetic distance of each other. Sampling a group of cases that are nearly genetically identical implies that they are related through an unknown number of recent and rapid transmission events. A substantial number of genetic clustering studies have focused on the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 (

 <xref rid="veaa011-B20" ref-type="bibr">Levi et al. 2016</xref>), greater proportions of HIV cases are being diagnosed, and new diagnoses are more frequently screened for drug resistance by genetic sequencing prior to initiating antiretroviral treatment. As a result, public health organizations are beginning to use genetic clustering methods in ‘near real-time’ to identify ongoing HIV-1 outbreaks (
