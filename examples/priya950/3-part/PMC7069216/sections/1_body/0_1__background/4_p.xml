<p>Here we propose that the most useful approach to select clustering criteria is to base this decision on our ability to predict where the next cases will occur. A high, permissive clustering threshold tends to result in a single cluster that comprises the majority of known cases. The next cases are proportionately more likely to connect to this cluster simply because it is large, but its size will also average out the individual- and group-level attributes that are informative for predicting the next cases. Put another way, a single large cluster is not likely to confer a public health benefit because it is akin to prioritizing the entire population. Conversely, setting a low, strict clustering threshold results in a large number of small clusters. This increases the variation of attributes among clusters, resolving greater information. As cluster sizes continue to decline with progressively lower thresholds, however, the variation in attributes among clusters is less associated with the emergence of new casesâ€”in other words, the distribution of new cases among clusters becomes increasingly random. This trade-off is analogous to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), a concept in spatial statistics first fully conceptualized by

Areal units are derived from a partition of a geographic range by drawing boundaries that separate households or neighbourhoods. The MAUP formally recognizes the inconsistency of statistical associations with changing boundaries. For example, aggregating units into larger spatial units, such as cities or countries, can prevent an investigator from detecting a strong association between water quality and gastrointestinal illness (
