 <p>An early version of this work was presented at the 26th International HIV Dynamics &amp; Evolution meeting in Cascais, Portugal. We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful commentary, John R. J. Thompson for a helpful discussion on applications of spatial statistics to model forest fire risk, which motivated us to look beyond autoregressive models; and Dr Tomoki Nakaya for encouraging feedback at an early stage of this study.</p>
