<p id="Par21">This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate changes in smoking patterns among people living with HIV, globally. Although a high heterogeneity between studies was observed, the proportion of current and former smokers decreased slightly over time, around 2.5 and 3.8%, respectively. However, the proportion of never smokers decreased sharply by 22.5%, and there were 2.1 and 1.5% PLWH who shifted from never and former smoking to current smoking, respectively. On the other hand, 10.5% PLWH shifted from current to former smoking, 7.1% tried to quit tobacco consumption but failed, 10.1% stayed in the “never smoking” category over time and 0.4% willed to quit smoking but did not initiate any quitting attempt.</p>
