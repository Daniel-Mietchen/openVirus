<p id="Par27">The present study should be interpreted in the context of some limitations. First, a substantial heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis was observed, which is quite common to most systematic review of this kind and somewhat inevitable as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, due to low number of studies, it was not possible to perform subgroup and meta-regression analyses to investigate sources of heterogeneity that may have influenced smoking pattern changes. These sources of heterogeneity might have included geographic, legal, cultural, clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics in different studies. Second, studies were disproportionally represented across various regions of the world, were not all population-based and nationally representative of PLWH; these facts may impede the translatability of these results to the entire globe. In addition, most studies were from high-income countries and only one study was from Africa, the epicentre of HIV infection with more than 70% of PLWH. It is therefore important to take this into account since findings of this study could more reflect the face of the public health concern in high income countries. This calls for more research in the context where it is most needed. Third, history of smoking was self-reported in these studies and some parameters were present in only one study, which may have introduced underestimation or overestimation of smoking status and changes. Nevertheless, and to the very best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis which has investigated changes in smoking behaviours among PLWH. A rigorous methodology was developed and robust statistical procedures were applied to examine the review’s research questions.
