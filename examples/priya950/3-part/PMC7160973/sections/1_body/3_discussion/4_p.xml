<p id="Par24">This puts in light the paramount role that health care providers should play in helping PLWH to quit tobacco use, which commands that these care givers receive appropriate knowledge and competencies to deliver the right support. A recent review showed for instance that the success of a smoking-cessation intervention is also tributary of care providers’ knowledge and confidence to deliver the intervention [

Many types of healthcare providers are able to provide support towards smoking cessation including nurses, physicians, community and social workers, and health educators, all of whom are part of the HIV care givers’ team. It was shown that using multiple providers in a team approach (such as a physician and a nurse) could further enhance quit rates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, and considering the overwhelming task of managing HIV infection and its complications, smoking cessation may represent less of a priority from both providers’ and patients’ perspectives. Additionally, the heavy workload and shortages of health personnel which are particularly characteristic of low-income countries make time to be provided for extensive counselling very limited [

Integration of tobacco use services in HIV programs and strengthening skills of HIV healthcare workers on strategies to help quitting tobacco consumption should be prioritized in this region as well as resources to be allocated for the task.
