<p id="Par12">We considered prospective and retrospective cohort studies, before-and-after studies and control arm of randomized controlled trials which have assessed changes in smoking behaviours among PLWH. Studies had to include global adult (&gt; 15 years) populations living with HIV infection who have experienced any change in their smoking habits at the time of HIV diagnosis or ART initiation. These changes might have been from current smoker (people who actually smoke) to former smoker (people who smoked and who stopped), from former smoker to current smoker, from former smoker to current smoker, or from never-smoker (people who have never smoked) to current smoker. Studies included in this review had to measure the prevalence (or enough data to compute this estimate) of tobacco smoking pattern (current, former, and never) at least two times (at initiation and completion). Studies lacking primary data or explicit method description were excluded, if after contacting authors at least twice the information was not provided. We also excluded studies wherein HIV-negative individuals had been included without the possibility to extract data only for HIV-infected people. Similarly, we did not consider cross-sectional or case–control studies, letters, reviews, commentaries, editorials, case reports, or case series.</p>
