<p id="Par13">A comprehensive search of databases was performed by a review author to identify all relevant articles published from January 1, 2000 to April 19, 2018 regardless of either the language of publication or the geographical location. The following databases were screened: MEDLINE through PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, Web of Science, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus. A predefined strategy using combination of relevant terms and their variants was used. Both text words and medical subject heading terms were used, including “HIV”, “AIDS”, “smoking”, “tobacco” and “cigarette”. The literature search strategy was adapted to suit each database. The search strategy conducted in PubMed is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. To identify other sources, reference lists of eligible articles and relevant reviews were manually scanned.
