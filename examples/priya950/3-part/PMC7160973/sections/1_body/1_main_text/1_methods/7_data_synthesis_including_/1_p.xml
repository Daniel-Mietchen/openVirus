<p id="Par17">Meta-analysis was performed using ‘
 <italic>meta</italic>’ packages in R version 3.6.1 (
 <italic>R Core Team, R foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria</italic>). We pooled the study-specific estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis model to obtain an overall summary estimate of the prevalence and mean across studies, after Freeman-Tukey double arc-sine transformation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>) and 95% prediction interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using the 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test on Cochrane’s Q statistic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and quantified by calculating the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Values of 25, 50 and 75% for 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> represented low, medium and high heterogeneity, respectively. We assessed the presence of publication bias using the formal Egger’s test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.10 was considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias.
