<p id="Par15">The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale version for cohort studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Considering that there is no validation study that provides a cut-off score for rating low-quality studies, we arbitrarily established that a study rated 0–3, 4–6, or 7–9 points would be considered at high, moderate, or low risk of bias, respectively. Two authors independently assessed the study quality, with disagreements resolved by consensus.
