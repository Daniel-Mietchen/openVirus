<p id="p0210">In conclusion, the RVP has unveiled many viral pathogens that have not been routinely detected or cultured in clinical settings. In comparison to patients with negative detection for viral pathogens, those with positive detection for viral pathogens had significantly lower rates of leukocytosis, evidence of bacterial infection, and shorter duration of hospitalization. Multiple viral infections were more common in younger children and did not predict a worse outcome such as duration of fever and hospitalization. The most common identified virus remained HRV whilst HBoV was present in a high percentage in multiple viral infections. Moreover, LRTI was independently associated with multiple viral infections, RSV infection and longer hospitalization duration. Further studies on the pathogenesis, disease severity and outcome of different viral combinations are needed to clarify the interplay of host and viruses in multiple viral infections.</p>
