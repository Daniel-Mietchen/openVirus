<p id="p0190">In this study, 27% of children had multiple viral infections. The result is similar to the previous studies that detection of multiple viruses simultaneously in pediatric patients ranges from 10 to 30%.

 </xref> Similar to previous findings, the three most commonly detected viruses in multiple viral infections were HRV, RSV, and PIV in this study.
