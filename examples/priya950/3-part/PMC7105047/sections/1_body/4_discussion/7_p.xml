<p id="p0200">Flu-B infection and HCoV infection were independently associated with URTI whereas multiple viral infections, RSV infection, and longer hospitalization duration were independently associated with LRTI. To minimize the confounding effects of concurrent bacterial infection, we excluded patients with AOM, acute sinusitis, and evidence of bacterial infection. Those patients with a positive influenza antigen test were not enrolled for analysis so the case number was small. Previous studies have shown four subtypes of HCoV (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1) lead to milder URTI.
