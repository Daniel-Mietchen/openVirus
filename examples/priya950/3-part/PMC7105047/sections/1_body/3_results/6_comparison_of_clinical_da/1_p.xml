<p id="p0165">We further compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory data, clinical diagnosis, and outcome between URTI and LTRI groups (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). After patients with AOM, acute sinusitis, herpangina and evidence of bacterial infection were excluded from analysis, there were 58 and 167 patients in URTI and LRTI groups, respectively. Using multivariable logistic regression with comorbidity adjustment, we identified three factors independently associated with LRTI, including multiple viral infections (OR = 2.996, 95% CI 1.17–7.65, p = 0.022), RSV infection (OR = 6.477, 95% CI 2.17–19.27, p = 0.001), longer hospitalization duration (OR = 1.306, 95% CI 1.06–1.60, p = 0.011). By contrast, Flu-B infection (OR = 0.060, 95% CI 0.006–0.57, p = 0.015) and HCoV infection (OR = 0.255, 95% CI 0.06–0.96, p = 0.044) were independently associated with URTI. There was no statistical difference in duration of fever, CRP level, and duration of antibiotics treatment between URTI and LRTI infections.
