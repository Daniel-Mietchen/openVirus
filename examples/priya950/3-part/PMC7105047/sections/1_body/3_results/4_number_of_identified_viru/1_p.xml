<p id="p0155">As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> , HRVs (36%, n = 113) are the most commonly identified virus among all the 311 patients, followed by RSVs (28%, n = 88), and PIVs (22%, n = 70). Notably, HBoV was detected mainly in multiple viral infections (79%, 19/24), followed by HAdV (62%, 18/29) and HRV (49%, 56/113). Among the 83 patients with multiple viral infections, the most common combination of viral infections was RSV + HRV 20.4% (17/83), followed by HRV + HBoV 8.4% (7/83) and HAdV + HRV 8.4% (7/83) (
