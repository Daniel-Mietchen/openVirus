<p id="p0160">Next, we analyzed the clinical data of patients with single virus infection (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). To minimize the confounding effects of bacterial infection on outcome analysis, patients with AOM, acute sinusitis and evidence of bacterial infection were excluded. As a result, HAdV infection was noted more in older children (5.65 ± 3.56 years) whilst HBoV infected patients at a younger age (0.88 ± 0.09 years). Moreover, patients infected with HAdV had a longer duration of fever (5.60 ± 0.54 days) in comparison to the shorter duration of fever (2.00 ± 1.00 days) caused by HBoV infection. Notably, HAdV infection raised a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level (3.53 ± 4.51 mg/dL). There was no single viral pathogen correlating with longer antibiotics treatment, more ICU admission or longer duration of hospitalization.
