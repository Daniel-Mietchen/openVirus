<p id="p0120">We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of hospitalized patients with a report of xTAG RVP from December 30, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Those enrolled patients had fever with or without respiratory symptoms on the general ward or intensive care unit (ICU) of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. RVPs were performed to investigate the possible viral etiology. Of note, three rapid antigen tests, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (HAdV) were available on the ward. If one of the quick antigen tests came back positive, further RVP test may not be conducted. The clinical characteristics, laboratory data, comorbidities (congenital heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic neurological disease, prematurity, malignancy), clinical diagnosis, duration of antibiotics use, ICU admission and duration hospitalization of the patients were recorded. Patients were divided into three age groups (≤2 years old; &gt; 2 and ≤5 years old; &gt;5 years old).</p>
