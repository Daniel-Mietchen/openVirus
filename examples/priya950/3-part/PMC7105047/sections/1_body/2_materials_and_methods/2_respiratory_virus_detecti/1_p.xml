<p id="p0130">The extraction of nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens was done using QiaAmp Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nucleic acids were immediately frozen at −80 °C until further testing. A commercial kit, xTAG RVP Fast Assay, Version 2.0 (Luminex Molecular Diagnosis Inc. Toronto, Canada), was used for respiratory viral detection. xTAG RVP FAST v2 includes two controls (MS-2 and Lambda DNA) to ensure assay performance. This kit allows simultaneous screening for 18 common respiratory viral pathogens and subtypes in the nucleic acid samples, including influenza A virus (Flu A subtype H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1), influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs, NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1), human parainfluenza viruses (PIV) type 1–4, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (EV/HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human adenovirus (HAdV). We further differentiated enterovirus from rhinovirus based on the symptoms, signs, and the confirmed diagnosis. The duration of antibiotics treatment and hospitalization were also recorded.</p>
