<p id="p0110">In comparison to traditional viral culture and polymerase chain reaction detection for each viral pathogen, the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) assay offers simultaneous testing for several common respiratory viruses with improved diagnostic sensitivity along with comparable sensitivity to individual real-time nucleic acid tests.

  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> The sensitivity and specificity of RVP were reported to be 95.2% and 99.6%, respectively.

 </xref> Furthermore, RVP can detect the presence of new viral pathogens which are not routinely cultivated or tested in clinical laboratories, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), and human bocavirus (HBoV).
