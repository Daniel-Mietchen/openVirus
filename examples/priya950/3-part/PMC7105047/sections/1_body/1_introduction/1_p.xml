 </xref> Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most frequent human illness and the most common disease in childhood; on average, infants and preschoolers develop six to eight URTIs per year.

 </xref> URTIs can cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for the continuous circulation of pathogens in the community. Moreover, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) may also develop severe disease and is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than five years of age.

  <sup>3</sup>
 </xref> For both URTI and LRTI, viral infection is the primary cause, especially in children. Clinically, the febrile presentation could lead to the use of more diagnostic tools and antibiotics. Therefore, accurate and timely identification of the responsible viral pathogen could reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and length of hospital stay.
