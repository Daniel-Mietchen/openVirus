  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Subtype/CRF-specific reference sequences and Nigerian sequences were aligned and ML phylogenies determined as described previously
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Nigerian transmission clusters were defined as clusters with aLRT-SH support ≥0.90 and composed of ≥80% Nigerian sequences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. Clusters of two sequences were defined as dyads, 3–14 sequences as networks, and &gt;14 sequences as large clusters
