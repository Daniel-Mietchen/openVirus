<p id="Par6">Putative unique recombinant forms (URFs) and sequences that were difficult to subtype were analysed by Bootscan in Simplot
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Briefly, 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were aligned with the LANL 2010 Reference sequences for subtypes for G, CRF4302G and CRF02AG as putative parental sequences. Recombination breakpoints were identified using a sliding window size of 300 bp and step size of 50 bp. URFs consisting of non-subtype G related forms were excluded from the Simplot analysis.
