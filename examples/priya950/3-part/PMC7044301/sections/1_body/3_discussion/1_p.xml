<p id="Par26">In this study, we aimed to disentangle the history and spread of HIV-1 subtypes/CRFs in Nigeria using state-of-the-art phylogenetics to a large set of HIV-1 sequences collected in the five most populated Nigerian geopolitical zones. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous nationwide molecular epidemiology study from Nigeria have been presented

 </sup>. In this study, 55 HIV-1 
 <italic>gp41</italic> sequences (approximately 400 bp) collected throughout Nigeria during 1999 were analysed by neighbour-joining phylogenetics. However, the analysis was unable to distinguish between subtype A and CRF02_AG sequences – likely due to insufficient phylogenetic information in this relatively short gene fragment, as suggested by the authors. In-depth phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis was therefore not possible in this study. In comparison, we analysed 1442 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (approximately 1000 bp long) collected throughout Nigeria between 1999 and 2013 using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics. Importantly, the HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (which is the most targeted genetic region for HIV-1 sequencing and by far most commonly analysed region in studies of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology) holds sufficient intrinsic genetic variability to permit the reconstruction of transmission histories by phylogenetic approaches

 </sup>. Hence, the larger size of our dataset, the relatively long time-window of sampling, and the use of state-of-the-art phylodynamic methods enabled us to perform the first in-depth nationwide HIV-1 phylodynamic study in Nigeria. In line with other previous studies from different geographic regions in Nigeria, we found that CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G and subtype G were the most prevalent strains (previous estimates ranging from 19–60% for CRF02_AG and 22–50% for subtype G

 </sup>). The prevalence of CRF43_02G has only been reported in one previous study from Abuja (estimated to 19%)

 </sup>. Non-representative sampling or local fluctuations between geographic regions in Nigeria could explain the large variations and discrepancies between studies. It could also be explained, in part, by the use of different subtyping tools between studies (which can differ in accuracy in assigning the correct subtype/CRF based on partial genome sequences)
