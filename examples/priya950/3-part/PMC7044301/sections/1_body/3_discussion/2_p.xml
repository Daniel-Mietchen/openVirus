<p id="Par27">We found one large well-supported monophyletic cluster for both subtype G and CRF43_02G, respectively. Each of these clusters harbored the majority of Nigerian sequences, suggesting single strain introductions that grew out to dominate the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic. Previous studies have used different nomenclatures of subtype G. A comparison of accession numbers showed that our subtype G cluster is partly consistent with the subtype G’ cluster identified by Chaplin 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>

 </sup>. Further dissection of the subtype G’ cluster showed that approximately half of the sequences belonged to subtype G, whereas the other half clustered with the CRF43_02G sequences in our analysis. In a more recent study, Delatorre 
 <italic>et al</italic>. suggested a nomenclature based on geographic dissemination
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. The clustering pattern of the West African strain defined as subtype G
 <sub>WA-II</sub> was largely overlapping with the Nigerian subtype G cluster in our analysis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. We estimated the date of origin for the subtype G cluster to 1975 (95%HPD: 1969–1982), which is consistent with the origin of the subtype G
 <sub>WA-II</sub> cluster that was estimated to 1979 [95%HPD: 1973–1984])
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the estimated date of origin also fits with the fact that the first AIDS cases were identified in Nigeria in 1986, approximately one decade after the introduction of this virus strain
 <sup>

 </sup>. The CRF43_02G was first described and isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2008
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. Interestingly, the G
 <sub>WA-I</sub> cluster determined by Delatorre 
 <italic>et al</italic>. consisted of 140/168 (83%) sequences from Nigeria
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. In our analysis, more than half of the G
 <sub>WA-I</sub> sequences clustered with the CRF43_02G strain. Spatiotemporal analysis of the G
 <sub>WA-I</sub> cluster indicated that this strain emerged in Nigeria in the mid-1970’s
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. This is consistent with our estimate of 1971 (95%HPD: 1952–1983) for the CRF43_02G cluster. Moreover, the majority of CRF43_02G sequences in Genbank are of Nigerian origin (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>), and both the putative parental strains of CRF43_02G in Nigeria (CRF02_AG and subtype G) are highly prevalent. Altogether, this suggests that CRF43_02G originated in central West Africa, in or close to Nigeria.
