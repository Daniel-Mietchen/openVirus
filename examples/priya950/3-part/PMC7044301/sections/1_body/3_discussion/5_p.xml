<p id="Par30">The recombination analysis indicated several URFs and potentially novel CRFs. Recombination does not occur randomly on the HIV-1 genome as its frequency varies along its length with several so-called hotspots for recombination

We identified seven groups of URFs with similar recombination breakpoint patterns. These could represent novel CRFs or second-generation recombinants circulating in Nigeria. However, full-length genome sequencing is needed to confirm whether these groups represent similar URFs or previously unknown subtype G-related CRFs.
