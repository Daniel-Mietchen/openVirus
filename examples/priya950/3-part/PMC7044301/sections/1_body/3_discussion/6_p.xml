<p id="Par31">In summary, this is the first in-depth HIV-1 phylodynamic study based on a nationwide set of HIV-1 sequences from Nigeria. We found a high number of URFs and potential new CRFs, and our analyses suggested that HIV-1 first emerged and expanded within large urban centers before migrating to smaller rural areas. The number of effective infections declined in the early 2000s, coinciding with the introduction of free ART in Nigeria. This study increases our understanding of the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may inform HIV-1 intervention strategies to reduce the spread of HIV-1 in Nigeria.</p>
