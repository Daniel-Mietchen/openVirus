 </sup>. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for approximately 70% of all infections. In addition, HIV-1 represent one of the most fast-evolving pathogens known to science. This has led to the classification of HIV-1 into subtypes, sub-subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Of relevance, previous reports have suggested that the genetic composition of the infecting HIV-1 strain may influence transmission, disease progression, virus-host interactions, antiretroviral treatment responses, and vaccine development

 </sup>. Moreover, it has been suggested that targeted HIV-1 prevention may be a cost-effective way to decrease the number of new HIV-1 infections – not least in low-and-middle-income countries
