<p id="Par22">Next, we sought to investigate the spatiotemporal spread of HIV-1 in Nigeria using both asymmetric and symmetric discrete phylogeographic diffusion models. From the asymmetric analysis, various sample locations (cities) had well supported exchange rates that dominated the diffusion process of the different subepidemics. For subtype G, significant transition between Lagos and Ibadan (Bayes Factor [BF] = 241), Damaturu (BF = 109), Minna (BF = 174), and Jos (BF = 98) were identified. Frequently invoked rates were also identified between Abuja and Lagos (BF = 81), Kaduna (BF = 220), Ibadan (BF = 223), Damaturu (BF = 293) and Minna (BF = 138). Supported rates from Kaduna, Jos and Ibadan to the other locations within Nigeria were also found. Finally, the analysis also indicated significant international linkages to and from Lagos (BF = 74), Abuja (BF = 80), Kaduna (BF = 21), Jos (BF = 501), Damaturu (BF = 80), and Ibadan (BF = 207). The symmetric models gave similar results as the asymmetric model.</p>
