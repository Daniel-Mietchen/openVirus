 <italic>pol</italic> sequences collected from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria between 1999 and 2013 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CRF02_AG was the most common strain (44% of the analyzed sequences), followed by CRF43_02G (16%), subtype G (8%) and CRF06_cpx (4%). Three-hundred-and-twenty-eighty of the sequences (23%) were unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereas the remaining sequences were minor variants (each variant accounting for &lt;2%).
