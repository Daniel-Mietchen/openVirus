<p id="Par16">Most sequences were from Abuja (697 sequences, 48%), followed by Lagos (346 sequences, 23%) and Jos (216 sequences, 15%). The distribution of different subtypes/CRFs varied within these regions/states with fewer CRF02_AG infections following a North East direction from Lagos (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Analysis of trends over time showed an overall decrease in the proportion of CRF02_AG infections in Nigeria (from 55% in 2006 to 38% in 2013, p = 0.015, LBL, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Moreover, the analysis also showed an increase in the proportion of unique recombinant forms (URFs) from 16% to 32%, 2005–2013 (p = 0.015, LBL). The time trend analysis for other CRFs and or subtypes was non-significant.
