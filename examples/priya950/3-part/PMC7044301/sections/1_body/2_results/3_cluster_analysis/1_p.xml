<p id="Par18">To determine transmission clusters of the major circulating strains within Nigeria, we analyzed the three dominating forms: subtype G, CRF02_AG, and CRF43_02G. Analysis of 206 subtype G sequences (119 Nigerian and 87 non-Nigerian) showed four dyads, one network, and one large Nigerian subtype G cluster (consisting of 81 Nigerian and 11 non-Nigerian sequences, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The 1161 CRF02_AG sequences (636 Nigerian and 555 non-Nigerian) formed 12 dyads, 12 networks and six clusters (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Finally, analysis of the 295 CRF43_02G sequences (236 Nigerian and 59 non-Nigerian) showed that all the Nigerian sequences clustered monophyletically (SH-aLRT = 0.99, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), suggesting that CRF43_02G predominately circulates in Nigeria.
