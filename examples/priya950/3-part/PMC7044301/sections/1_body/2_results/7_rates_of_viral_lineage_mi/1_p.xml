<p id="Par25">The rates of viral lineage migration within Nigeria were estimated using a robust counting approach. For subtype G, 42% (95%HPD: 35–48%) of all virus migrations originated in Abuja; of these 17% (95%HPD: 12–22%) were directed to Jos, 10% (95%HPD: 8–13%) to outside Nigeria, and 7% (95%HPD: 4–10%) to Lagos. Similar results were found for the CRF02_AG clusters, except for slightly higher migration rates from Abuja to Lagos for cluster 1 (30%, 95%HPD: 25–34%, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Overall, the CRF02_AG migration rates originating in Abuja was 61%, 52% and 21% for cluster 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
