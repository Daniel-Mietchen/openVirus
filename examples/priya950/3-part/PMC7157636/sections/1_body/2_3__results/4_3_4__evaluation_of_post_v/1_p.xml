<p>Pigs were clinically scored, and rectal temperatures monitored for 7 days following prime and boost immunization (

Immunized animals in all three vaccine groups showed only a minimal increase in rectal temperature on 1 dpv and no clinical signs were observed at any time post-vaccination. In order to investigate potential virus shedding of BoHV-4 from vaccinated pigs, nasal and rectal swabs were collected from BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FÎ”TK and G immunized pigs 3, 1, 4, 7, and 11 dpv. All swabs were tested by PCR and confirmed to be negative for BoHV-4 genome (
