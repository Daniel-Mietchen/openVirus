<p>Since the BoHV-4 vector has a bovine origin and we wanted to immunize swine, we considered several important aspects. First, the generation of a protocol to produce BoHV-4 vectors free of bovine antigens. BoHV-4 vectors are typically propagated in bovine cells and in the presence of FBS. Thus, a protocol to grow BoHV-4 recombinants in a permissive porcine cell line in absence of FBS was established. Starting from a primary pig aortic endothelium (PEC) cell culture, an endothelial cell line was immortalized with a plasmid delivering human

 <italic>neo</italic> selectable marker. A G418 selected cell clone was expanded and proven to be fully permissive to BoHV-4EGFPΔTK infection (
