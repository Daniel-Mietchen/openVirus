<p>To overcome this limitation, cells were expanded with medium containing 10% of FBS, infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.1) with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK or BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK and after 2 h the viral inoculum was removed from the cells and substituted with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h of infection the medium was changed and 10% of PS was supplemented into the fresh medium, replacing the need for FBS. The medium containing recombinant virus was then harvested and titrated when the CPE affected only the ~20% of cell culture monolayer (typically after 24 h) (
