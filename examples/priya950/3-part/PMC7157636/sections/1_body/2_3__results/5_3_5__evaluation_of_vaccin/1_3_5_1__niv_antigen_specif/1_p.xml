<p>NiV G and F specific-antibody responses were assessed longitudinally by sera by indirect ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f003">Figure 3</xref>). NiV G specific-antibody responses were only observed in the BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK and ALVAC NiV G immunized pigs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Statistical differences were analyzed using a mixed-effects model followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparison test. OD values, corresponding to antibody levels, increased in the BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK group from 14 dpv, with a significant increase from 21 dpv onwards (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In the ALVAC NiV G group, specific antibody levels were significantly elevated from 28 dpv (7 days post-boost) and remained so until the end of the study (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). As expected, NiV F-specific antibodies were only detected pigs vaccinated with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). In this group, antibody levels were detected from 14 dpv, showing a highly significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) from this timepoint until the end of the study. NiV G or F specific antibody endpoint titers were measured in sera in the respective groups at 21 and 42 dpv to better quantify responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In all groups, antibody titers at 42 dpv were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than at 21 dpv. At 21 dpv, the antibody titer in both BoHV-4 groups was greater than the ALVAC NiV G group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while at 42 dpv the titers were higher in the ALVAC NiV G immunized animals (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). NiV G or F specific antibody endpoint titers were measured in BAL fluid (BALF) in all groups at 42 dpv (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group) and antibodies were detected in the BALs from the animals analyzed in all groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). These results demonstrated that all the vaccine candidates successfully induced specific antibody responses, which were boosted following the second immunization.
