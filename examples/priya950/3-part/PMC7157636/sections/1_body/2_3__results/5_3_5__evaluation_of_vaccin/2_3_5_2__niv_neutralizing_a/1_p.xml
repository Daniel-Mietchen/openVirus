<p>NiV neutralizing antibody responses were assessed longitudinally in sera using a NiV pseudovirus-based neutralization test (mVNT), a classical virus neutralization test (VNT) and a fusion inhibition assay (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) and NiV-B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) pseudoviruses showed a similar response in all three vaccine groups. Pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers in BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK immunized pigs were similar to ALVAC NiV G immunized pigs and showed highly significant increase from boost (
