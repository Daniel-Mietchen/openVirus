<p>Before attempting to use BoHV-4 vectors for vaccination of pigs, we investigated the capability of BoHV-4 vectors to infect cells belonging to the tissue of the planned site of inoculation, in this specific case the muscle. A fibroblast-like cell line was established from swine muscle explant organotypic cultures and infected with BoHV-4GFP∆TK, a recombinant BoHV-4 delivering an expression cassette for GFP, to monitor cell transduction. Primary cell cultures were readily infected by BoHV-4EGFPΔTK in a time and dose dependent manner, as shown by GFP expression (

After 48 h post-infection, the CPE was evident in cell monolayers, indicating their capability to support BoHV-4 replication and these observations were confirmed by an increase in viral titers in the supernatants between 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection (
