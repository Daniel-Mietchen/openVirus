<p>To further investigate the cellular response, ICS assays were performed longitudinally with freshly isolated PBMCs to phenotype IFN-γ and TNF-α responding cells. The flow cytometric gating strategy employed a standard approach for immunophenotyping porcine T cells i.e., CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8α
 <sup>high</sup> CD4
 <sup>−</sup> (CD8 T cells), CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8α
 <sup>low</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> - (antigen-experienced CD4 T cells), and CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8α
 <sup>−</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8α
 <sup>low/−</sup>CD4
 <sup>−</sup> - (γδ T cells), and CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD8α
 <sup>low</sup>CD4
 <sup>−</sup> - (NK cells) [
 <xref rid="B64-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, assessment of IFN-γ (and TNF-α) staining of peptide stimulated PBMC, showed the majority of responder cells displayed a CD3
 <sup>low/−</sup> phenotype, which was suggestive of CD3 down regulation on the surface of responder T cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00115">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>). A similar down regulation of CD8α surface expression was also observed on responding cells but CD4 expression was less affected (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00115">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>). These data made the accurate gating of responder cell populations problematic, particularly for CD8 T cells. To confirm that responses from CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells were in fact coming from CD8 T cells, peptide stimulated PBMC were stained with mAbs for CD4, CD8α, CD8β (exclusively expressed by CD8 T cells) and γδ T cell receptor (TcR) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00115">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>). This staining confirmed that NiV peptide specific CD8α
 <sup>+</sup> cells were indeed CD8β
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and not γδ T cells or NK cells. Based on these results we proceeded to gate the longitudinal ICS datasets with the exclusion of CD3 and simply gating on CD8α
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>−</sup> and CD8α
 <sup>−</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells to delineate CD8 T cell and CD4 T cell responses, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00115">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Significant cytokine responses from CD4 T cells (IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>TNF-α
 <sup>+</sup> cells) were seen following stimulation with the respective peptide pools in both BoHV-4 vaccine groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). For both groups these responses were significant (compared to both 0 dpv and the other groups) on both 35 and 42 dpv (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). CD8 T cell cytokine responses were also significant in both BoHV-4 groups with significant responses from 28–42 dpv (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The magnitude of both CD4 and CD8 T cell response in the BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK group were greater than the responses seen in the BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK group. Much weaker responses were seen in the ALVAC NiV G group, which did not achieve statistical significance.
