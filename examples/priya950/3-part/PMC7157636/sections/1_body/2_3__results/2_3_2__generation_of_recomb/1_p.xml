<p>Among the 6 genes comprising the NiV genome (3′-N, P, M, F, G, and L-5′), the F and the G viral surface protein products have been shown to be protective against NiV infection eliciting virus neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals [

 <xref rid="B52-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. NiV-M F and G ORFs were chemically synthesized on the basis of published sequence (GenBank accession numbers AY816748.1 and AY816746.1, respectively) and sequences encoding an antibody tag (AU1 peptide tag for F and HA peptide tag for G) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00115">Supplementary Figure S2B and 3B</xref>). Assembled expression cassettes (CMV-NiV-F and CMV–NiV-G) were validated in terms of protein expression by transient transfection in HEK293T cells and western immunoblotting of cell extracts (

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] cloned as BAC, two recombinant BoHV-4 vectors, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK, delivering CMV-NiV-F and CMV-NiV-G, respectively, were created. The TK BoHV-4-A genome locus was utilized as the integration site for the CMV-NiV-F and CMV-NiV-G expression cassettes. The BoHV-4 TK genomic region is strongly conserved among BoHV-4 isolates [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], therefore ensuring the stability of the genomic locus from potential recombination when foreign DNA sequences are inserted. Previous studies have shown that interrupting the TK locus by the insertion of foreign DNA sequences [
 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] of different sizes does not interfere with viral replication in vitro and heterologous protein expression is maintained [

CMV-NiV-F and CMV-NiV-G expression cassettes were first sub-cloned into pINT2, a shuttle vector plasmid containing two BoHV-4 TK sequences [
