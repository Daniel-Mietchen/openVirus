 <italic>coli</italic> and repeated passages could establish altered bacterial phenotypes due to aberrant recombinase transcription, SW102 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> carrying pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK were serially cultured for over 20 passages and checked by 
 <italic>HindIII</italic> restriction enzyme digestion. No differences among restriction patterns at various passages were detected (data not shown), thus ensuring the stability of the clones. To reconstitute infectious BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK, pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK DNA was electroporated into BEK and BEK
 <italic>cre</italic> cells. The recombinant viruses reconstituted from electroporated BEK
 <italic>cre</italic> resulted in depletion of the BAC plasmid backbone containing the GFP expression cassette, as shown by the loss of GFP expression (

Next, the growth characteristics of BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK were compared with that of the parental virus, BoHV-4-A. BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK demonstrated slower replication kinetics compared to BoHV-4-A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,E); however, transgene expression was detected in the whole cell extract of BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK infected cells (
