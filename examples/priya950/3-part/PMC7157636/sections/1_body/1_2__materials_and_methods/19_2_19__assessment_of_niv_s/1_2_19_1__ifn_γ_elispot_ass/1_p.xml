<p>To determine the frequency of NiV G or F specific IFN-γ producing cells, an ELISpot assay was performed on fresh isolated PBMCs weekly at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 dpv. Briefly, multiscreen 96-well plates (MAIPS4510; Millipore) were pre-coated with 1 µg/mL anti-porcine IFN-γ mobs (clone P2G10, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, blocking with 150 µL of cRPMI was completed for at least one hour at 37 °C. PBMCs were plated at 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in cRPMI in a total volume of 100 µL/well. PBMCs were stimulated in triplicate wells with the NiV F and G peptide pools at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. 10 µg/mL concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich) and medium alone were used in triplicate wells as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 18 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, cells were lysed with ice cold water and wells washed with PBS/0.05% Tween20. Plates were incubated with biotinylated anti-porcine IFN-γ mAb (clone P2C11, BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 0.17 µg/mL and the reaction revealed with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzyme conjugate and BICP/NBT substrate (both (R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK)). Once dry, the numbers of specific IFN-γ secreting cells were determined using an ImmunoSpot
 <sup>®</sup> S6 Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). The data were expressed as the medium-corrected number of antigen-specific IFN-γ secreting cells per million PBMC.
