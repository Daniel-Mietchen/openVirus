<p>Two pools of synthetic peptides representing the NiV-M G or F protein (GenBank Accessions AAK50554.1 and AAK50553.1, respectively) were used to stimulate T cells in IFN-γ ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays. Overlapping 16mer peptides offset by 4 residues based on the sequences of the entire G and F proteins from NiV Malaysia strain were designed and synthesized (Mimotopes, Melbourne, Australia) and reconstituted in sterile 40% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 6.5 mg/mL. Peptides pools were added to cells at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL for each peptide within the pool.</p>
