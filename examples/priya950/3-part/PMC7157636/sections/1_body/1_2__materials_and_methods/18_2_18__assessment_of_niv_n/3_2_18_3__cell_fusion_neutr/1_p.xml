 <sup>5</sup>/well in a 6-well dish in phenol red-free DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% HI FBS (Life Science Production), 1% sodium pyruvate solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL; Life Technologies) and 1% L-Glutamine (200 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) (DMEM-10). After 24 h, each well was transfected with codon optimized pCAGGS plasmids expressing NiV G and F from NiV-M or NiV-B using

 <sup>4</sup> cells/100 µL were plated with 25 µL of diluted sera (1:5 in DMEM-10) in triplicate in a white-bottomed, sterile 96-well plate (Corning, Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. No sera controls were also included. HEK293T Lenti-rLuc 8–11 target cells were then co-cultured at 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/100 µL in DMEM-10 and incubated for 18 h. Co-culture of effector cells expressing the viral glycoproteins with target HEK293T cells endogenously expressing the ephrin B2 receptor results in fusion of the two cell populations, mixing of cell cytoplasm and reconstitution of the split reporters. Following addition of 1 µM cell-permeable coelenterazine-h, luciferase activity was measured using the GloMax Multi+ Detection System (Promega). Inhibition of fusion was calculated as the percentage reduction of luciferase expression compared to no sera controls.
