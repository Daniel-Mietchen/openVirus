 <italic>Pseudovirus neutralization assay:</italic> Sera from vaccinated pigs were diluted 1:10 in cDMEM-10 and 50 µL/well was added to a 96-well plate in triplicate and titrated 4-fold. A fixed volume of NiV-Mpp or NiV-Bpp was then added 50 µL/well at a dilution equivalent to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> signal luciferase units and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following this, BHK-21 target cells were added at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/100 µL. After 72 h, firefly luciferase activity was measured as described above. Serum neutralization titers were calculated as the inverse of the dilution which showed a 90% inhibition of luciferase values (IC
 <sub>90</sub>), compared to no sera controls.
