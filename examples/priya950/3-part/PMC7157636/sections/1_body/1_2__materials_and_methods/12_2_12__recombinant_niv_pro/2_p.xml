<p>Codon optimised DNA encoding amino acids 1–483 of NiV F protein together with the proprietary molecular clamp stabilization domain to facilitate stabilization of the pre-fusion conformation was cloned into pNBF mammalian expression vector under the control of a CMV expression vector. Plasmid DNA was extracted using PureYield DNA MidiPrep kit (Promega, Chilworth, UK) and transfected into expiCHO cells using expiCHO expression kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissue culture supernatant containing secreted molecular clamp stabilized NiV F (NiV mcsF) was harvested at 7 days post-transfection and clarified by centrifugation (3000× 
 <italic>g</italic>), passed through a 22 µM filter and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with on an HisTrap NHS-activated column (GE Healthcare) conjugated with a molecular clamp specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). Purified protein was buffer exchanged to PBS, purity assessed via SDS-PAGE and protein concentration quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometry.
