<p>Nasal and rectal swabs were added to 1 mL nuclease-free water and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with vortex mixing every 30 min. Swabs were centrifuged at 800× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min at room temperature before collecting supernatants and storing at −20 °C. DNA was extracted from supernatant using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions and BoHV-4 ORF73 was amplified using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) with primers 5′-GCA CAA TAG ACA GTG ATG TTG TAG TTA CCA TTA TTG CTC CCG-3′ and 5′-ATT CCC TCC ATT GGG ACC AAT ACC CCC GAA ATA TAA AGG-3′ (Sigma-Aldrich). The following settings were used: amplification—35 cycles with denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 30 sec at 55 °C and extension, 30 sec at 72 °C.
