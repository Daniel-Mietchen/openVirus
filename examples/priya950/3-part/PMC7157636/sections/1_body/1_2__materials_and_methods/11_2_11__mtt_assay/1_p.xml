<p>The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) cell metabolic assay was used to measure cell viability. Briefly, 3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PECs were seeded in a 96-well plates in cEMEM and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2.</sub> Medium was refreshed with cEMEM supplemented with either 10% FBS or PS. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h incubation, cells were incubated for a further 6 h with 50 μg/well of MTT before the addition of 110 μL of solubilization solution (10% SDS in HCl 0.01 M) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The optical density was measured at 620 nm in a microplate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Statistical differences among treatments were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).
