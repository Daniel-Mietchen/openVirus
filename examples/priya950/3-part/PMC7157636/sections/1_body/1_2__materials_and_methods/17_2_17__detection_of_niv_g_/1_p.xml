<p>ELISA plates (Nunc MAXIsorp, from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 100 ng/well of recombinant NiV sG protein or 50 ng/well of recombinant NiV mcsF protein in 100 μL 0.06 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 (Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were blocked with 5% skimmed milk (Marvel) in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. Porcine serum samples were diluted two-fold starting at 1:400. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-porcine IgG rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Merck, Livingstone, UK) were added at 1:10,000 for 1 h at 37 °C. TMB solution (Merck) was added and plates incubated for 3 min at room temperature in the dark before the addition of 2N sulfuric acid stop solution. Absorbance was read at 450 nm using the GloMax
 <sup>®</sup> Multi+ Detection System (Promega, Chilworth, UK). Antibody end-point titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which the OD value was greater than the cut-off value (mean + 3 standard deviations of a negative serum).
