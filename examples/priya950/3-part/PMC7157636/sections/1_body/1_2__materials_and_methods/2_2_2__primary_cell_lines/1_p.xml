<p>Primary porcine endothelia cells were isolated from collagenase treated pig aorta as previously described [
 <xref rid="B47-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with some modifications. Aorta was incubated in Hank’s balanced saline solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL of collagenase P (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37 °C. Detached cells were washed with cEMEM without serum and resuspended in cEMEM containing 20% FBS. Cells were cultured for 2 passages prior to immortalization. Cells were electroporated (300 V, 25 μF, 240 V, 1050 μF, and 481 R; Opty-Puls, Equibio apparatus from Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 μg of pBabe-neo-htert DNA (Addgene), a plasmid delivering both human 
 <italic>telomerase</italic> gene and 
 <italic>neo</italic> selectable marker, in DMEM with 10% FBS (cDMEM). Electroporated cells were cultured in cEMEM. Twenty-four hours post-electroporation, cells were selected with 400 μg/mL of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) until visible colonies appeared on the surface of the flask. Selected clones were independently passaged in the presence of G418 for 13 passages to obtain an immortalized porcine endothelial cell (PEC) line. Primary fibroblast-like cells were obtained from pig muscle explants. Explants were prepared by slicing muscle into 2–3-mm
 <sup>3</sup> pieces. These pieces were then minced against the surface of the 60mm
 <sup>2</sup> dishes (Falcon, BD) and allowed to dry within the culture hood for 5–10 min to facilitate adherence of cells. 3 mL of cEMEM was added before incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. When cells reached confluency, they were detached from the dishes by standard trypsin treatment, plated at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells in 2 mL per well using 24-well plates (Nunc from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and expanded.
