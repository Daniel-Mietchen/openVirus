A two-way ANOVA or a mixed-effects model were conducted to compare antigen-specific IFN-Î³ and antibody responses from 0 dpv onwards for each vaccinated group and between vaccine groups at different time points post-vaccination as detailed in results. Antibody titer data were log transformed before analysis.
