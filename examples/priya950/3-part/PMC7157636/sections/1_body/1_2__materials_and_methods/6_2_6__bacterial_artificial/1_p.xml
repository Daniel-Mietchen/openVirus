<p>Recombineering was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with some modifications. For heat-inducible homologous recombination in SW102 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, containing the BAC-BoHV-4-A-TK-KanaGalK-TK genome targeted into the TK locus with KanaGalK selector cassette, the 
 <italic>PvuI</italic> linearized pTK-CMV-NiV-F-TK or pTK-CMV-NiV-G-TK expression cassettes were used. After recombineering, only those colonies that were kanamycin resistant and chloramphenicol positive were isolated and grown overnight in 5 mL of LB containing 12.5 mg/mL of chloramphenicol. BAC-DNA was purified and analyzed through 
 <italic>HindIII</italic> restriction enzyme digestion. DNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. Original detailed protocols for recombineering can also be found at the recombineering website (
