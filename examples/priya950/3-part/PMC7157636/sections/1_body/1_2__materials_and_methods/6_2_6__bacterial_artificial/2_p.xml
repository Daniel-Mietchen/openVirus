<p>Non-isotopic Southern blotting with a probe specific for NiV-G or NiV-F sequences was performed. DNA from 1% agarose gel was capillary transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche, Basil, Switzerland) and cross-linked by UV irradiation by standard procedures. The membrane was pre-hybridized in 50 mL of hybridization solution (7% SDS, 0.5 M phosphate, pH 7.2) for 1 h at 65 °C in a rotating hybridization oven. NiV-G probe labeled with digoxigenin was generated by PCR with G-sense (5′-TGTACTTTCCCGCCGTGGGTTTC-3′) and G-antisense (5′-GTGATGGTTTTCTGGGCGTTGGTATCATC-3′) primers; NiV-F probe digoxigenin labeled was instead obtained by PCR with this couple of primers: F-sense (5′-CCCCGCTAGCCCACCATGGTGGTGATCCTGGACAGG-3′) and F-antisense (5′-CCCCCCCGGGTTAGATGTACCGGTAGGTGTC-3′). The PCR amplification reaction was carried out in a final volume of 50 µL, containing 10 mM Tris–hydrochloride pH 8.3, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 0.02 mM alkaline labile digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche) and 0.25 µM of each primer. 100 ng of DNA was amplified over 35 cycles, as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 60 °C, and 2 min elongation with 1U of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in addition to 1 µl of Digoxigenin-11-dUTP, alkali-labile (Roche) at 72 °C.
