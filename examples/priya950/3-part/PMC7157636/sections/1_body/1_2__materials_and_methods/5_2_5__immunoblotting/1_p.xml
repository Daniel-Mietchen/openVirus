<p>Protein cell extracts were obtained from pTK-CMV-NiV-F-TK, pTK-CMV-NiV-G-TK, and pEGFP-C1 transfected HEK293T cells by adding 100 μL of cell extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP-40; pH 8). After BCA total protein quantification (Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), cell extracts containing various amount of total protein were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nylon membranes by electroblotting, and membranes were incubated with anti-AU1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (A190-125A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Texas, USA) diluted 1:10,000, or mouse monoclonal antibody anti-HA tag (G036, Abm Inc., Vancouver, Canada) diluted 1:10,000, for NiV F or NiV G, respectively. After washing, the membranes were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (A0545, Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:15,000 for NiV-F and with a rabbit anti mouse IgG, diluted 1:15,000, for NIV-G (A9044, Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Clarity Max Western ECL substrate, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA).</p>
