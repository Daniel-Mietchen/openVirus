<p>BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK, BoHV-4EGFP∆TK, and BoHV-4-A were propagated by infecting confluent monolayers of BEK cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 tissue culture infectious doses 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) per cell and maintained in medium with only 2% FBS for 2 h. Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1, strain Oregon, ATCC VR-2066) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV, strain NADL, ATCC VR-1422) were propagated by infecting confluent monolayers of MDBK cells at an MOI of 0.5 and maintained in complete EMEM with 2% FBS for 2 h. Medium was replaced with fresh cEMEM. When CPE affected the majority of the cell monolayer (~72 h post infection), the virus was harvested by freezing and thawing cells three times and pelleting the virions through a 30% sucrose cushion. Virus pellets were then resuspended in cold cEMEM without FBS. TCID
 <sub>50</sub> were determined on BEK or MDBK cells by limiting dilution.
