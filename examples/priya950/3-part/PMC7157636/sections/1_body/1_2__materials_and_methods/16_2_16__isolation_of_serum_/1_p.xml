<p>Sera were isolated with serum separating tubes (SST) by centrifugation at 1300× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature and stored at −80 °C. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, heparinized blood was diluted 1:1 in PBS and layered over 15 mL of 1.077 g/mL Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) using Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One, from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and centrifugated at 800× 
 <italic>g</italic> with no breaks for 15 min at room temperature. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were aspirated from the Histopaque-plasma interface, washed with PBS and red blood cells lysed with 5 mL RBC Lysis buffer (Biolegend, London, UK) for 5 min, washed again and resuspended in complete RPMI media (cRPMI) (RPMI 1640 medium, GlutaMAX supplement, HEPES (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% HI FBS (New Zealand origin, Life Science Production, Bedford, UK), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL; Life Technologies from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mM; Gibco)) at the desired cell density by analyzing 20 µL of cell suspension in a MACSQuant Analyzer volumetric flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Bisley, UK) and gating on events with typical forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) for PBMCs and used immediately for the immunological assays or cryopreserved in cold 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) in HI FBS for later analysis.
