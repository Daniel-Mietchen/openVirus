<p>The study was performed at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Weybridge, UK, in accordance with UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and with approval from the local Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (ethical approval number: P986D55-1-002). Eighteen 8–10-week-old, weaned, female [
 <xref rid="B48-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], large white-landrace-Hampshire cross-bred pigs were randomly allocated to three treatment groups (

Vaccines were delivered by intramuscular injection and animals received identical immunizations on days 0 (prime) and 21 (boost). Animals were monitored daily post-vaccination (dpv) and clinical signs and rectal temperature were recorded. Nasal and rectal swabs (DNase and DNA free viscose swabs, Deltalab, Barcelona, Spain) were collected from BoHV-4 immunized pigs on; 3, 1, 4, 7 and 11 dpv. Blood samples were taken from all pigs on a weekly basis at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 dpv by venipuncture of the external jugular vein. 8 mL/pig in BD SST vacutainer tubes (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) for serum collection and 30 mL/pig in BD heparin vacutainer tubes (Fisher Scientific) for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation. Pigs were euthanized at the end of the study (42 dpv) by pentobarbital overdose. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was collected from the left lung lobes with 100 mL of transport medium (RPMI 1640 with glutamax-Hepes (Gibco, from Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% heat-inactivated (HI) FBS (New Zealand origin, Life Science Production, Bedford, UK) supplemented with field antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 80 µg/mL neomycin, 160 µg/mL polymixin B, 3 µg/mL amphotericin B, (all from Sigma-Aldrich)). BAL samples were centrifuged at 500×
