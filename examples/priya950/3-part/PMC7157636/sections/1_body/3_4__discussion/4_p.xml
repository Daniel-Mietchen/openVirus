<p>Vaccine production methods can significantly influence manufacturing capacity and cost of goods and hence availability. In the case of a viral vectored vaccine, one of the main drawbacks is the purification step when the viral vector is grown on cells and in the presence of serum of different species than the host to be immunized. The purification serves to reduce antigenic competition between the antigen delivered by the viral vector with xenoantigens antigens coming from cells and serum, which are usually very abundant. Therefore, BoHV-4 was propagated (to 10

Furthermore, leaving infected cells in the inoculum preparation meant the presence of specific antigen ready to be processed by the immune system. This simple procedure could be used to rapidly scale-up vaccine preparation at low cost for an urgent program of immunization in the case of potential epizootic circumstances. Cost-effectiveness is a very important issue for the veterinary sector, especially if the vaccine is intended to livestock use in a low-and-middle income country.
