<p>The paradigm we wanted to exploit was that BoHV-4 infected cells expressing NiV antigen are detected by dendritic cells (DCs) scanning peripheral tissues. Upon antigen recognition, internalization and migration to the draining lymph node, DC induce adaptive immune responses through MHC presentation of peptide antigen to cognate T cells leading to their activation and proliferation [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The cross-presentation of internalized and processed antigens on MHC I molecules is crucial for the induction of CD8 T cell responses against viruses that do not infect DCs directly [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], as is the case of BoHV-4 [
 <xref rid="B75-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Therefore, BoHV-4 cell infection at the site of vector administration, the muscle was tested ex vivo. Muscle-derived, fibroblast-like cells were successfully infected with BoHV-4 GFP suggested that BoHV-4-based vectors could infect at least a population of cells within the muscle and a CMV promoter could be employed to generate NiV-F and G expression cassettes integrated into BoHV-4-based vector. Next, we demonstrated productive replication and antigen expression of BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FÎ”TK/-G in pig cells and produced the vaccine inocula in a porcine culture system. Since the nasal and rectal swab of inoculated animals were negative for BoHV-4 DNA, we could assume that recombinant BoHV4 did not spread significantly in the body of the inoculated animals; suggesting that viral replication occurred only at the site of inoculation, as suggested by the ex vivo with organotypic cell cultures.
