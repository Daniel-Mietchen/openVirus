  <p>Generation of recombinant BoHV-4 vectors. Diagram (not to scale; (
   <bold>A</bold>) showing the retargeting event obtained by heat-inducible homologous recombination in SW102 containing pBAC-BoHV-4-A-TK-KanaGalK-TK, where the Kana/GalK cassette was replaced with the CMV-NiV-F, and CMV-NiV-G expression cassettes flanked by BoHV-4 TK sequences, located in pINT2 shuttle plasmid vector. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative 2-deoxy-galactose resistant colonies (1, 2, 3 and 4) tested by 
   <italic>HindIII</italic> restriction enzyme analysis, agar gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting performed with specific probes for the NiV-F, and NiV-G ORFs. The 2650 bp band, corresponding to the un-retargeted pBAC-BoHV-4-A-TK-KanaGalK-TK control (C), has been replaced by a 2956 bp band in pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK and by a 2526 bp band in pBAC-BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK.
