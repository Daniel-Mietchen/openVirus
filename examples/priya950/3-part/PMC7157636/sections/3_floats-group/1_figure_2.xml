  <p>Reconstitution and characterization of recombinant viruses. Representative phase contrast and fluorescent microscopic images of plaques formed by viable reconstituted recombinant BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK (
   <bold>A</bold>) and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK (
   <bold>D</bold>) after the corresponding BAC DNA electroporation into BEK cells or BEK 
   <italic>cre</italic> (Magnification, ×10). Replication kinetics of BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK (
   <bold>B</bold>) and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiVGΔTK (
   <bold>E</bold>) growth on BEK cells, compared with those of the parental BoHV-4-A isolate. The data presented are the means ± standard errors of triplicate measurements (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all time points as measured by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test). (
   <bold>F</bold>) Western immunoblotting of cells, infected with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiVFΔTK (1) (
   <bold>C</bold>) and BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiVGΔTK (1) (
   <bold>F</bold>). The lanes were loaded with 20 μg of protein extract. Negative control (2(−)) was established with BoHV-4-A infected cells. (L) mass ladder.
