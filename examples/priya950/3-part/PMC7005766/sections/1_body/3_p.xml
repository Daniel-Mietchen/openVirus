 </xref> With a 5-year survival of 18%, HCC is the second most lethal tumor after pancreatic cancer and is the main cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. The stage of disease at the time of diagnosis largely determines the effectiveness of treatment. In developing countries, HCC often comes to medical attention when the tumors are at an advanced stage and curative therapies are of limited benefit. In developed countries, in contrast, at-risk populations of patients are often under close surveillance and, as a result, HCC is usually detected when tumors are small and treatment is more likely to be successful. Expert Society Guidelines recommend HCC surveillance every 6 months using ultrasound – with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) – in at-risk individuals. Despite these recommendations, the effectiveness of HCC surveillance remains a subject of debate, largely related to concerns regarding the quality of existing evidence. Furthermore, the choice of surveillance modality must balance sensitivity to optimize early HCC detection, specificity to minimize surveillance-related harms, and costs to remain cost-effective. Although surveillance ultrasound and AFP tests have minimal direct harm, downstream harms from follow-up tests (over one-quarter of patients with cirrhosis experience physical harm for false-positive or indeterminate surveillance tests) must be weighed against surveillance benefits when determining the value of HCC screening programs, a circumstance that will likely increase with the obesity and NAFLD epidemics.

 </xref> The underuse of HCC surveillance can be attributed to several failures in the process, including provider failure to identify either liver disease or the (silent) transition to cirrhosis, provider failure to order HCC surveillance, and patient failure to adhere to surveillance recommendations. Morris Sherman examines current evidence on HCC surveillance outcomes and proposes measures to overcome obstacles at every step of the process, from identification of cirrhosis in any patient known to have liver disease to defining the utility of risk scores, the role of biomarkers and/or of biopsy. The author underscores the importance of better education to improve the awareness of primary providers and the need to adequately test each new combination of surveillance tests prospectively. Given the obesity and NAFLD epidemic, the sensitivity of ultrasound may be reduced in this population.
