 </xref> report on a case of hepatitis A virus-related fulminant hepatic failure complicated by Takotsubo syndrome, where standard volume plasma exchange was successfully used as a salvage therapy to initiate rapid liver and cardiac recovery. This case suggests that standard and not only high-volume plasma exchange can be an effective therapy for patients with fulminant hepatic failure and potential contraindications for liver transplantation.
