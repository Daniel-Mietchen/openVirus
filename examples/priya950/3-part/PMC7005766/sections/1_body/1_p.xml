Both animal and human data have shown that the duodenal mucosa is an important metabolic regulator determining systemic insulin sensitivity, with bypass of the duodenum after bariatric surgery leading to improvements in insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, improvement in NAFLD/NASH, including reversal of fibrosis, has been described after bariatric surgery. Unfortunately, this is limited as a population-wide treatment for metabolic disease by its invasiveness. Clinical data suggest that DMR is well tolerated and elicits an improvement in hyperglycaemia in patients with poorly controlled T2DM. In the current paper where data were pooled from 2 single arm, open-label studies primarily designed to determine safety and efficacy of DMR as a procedure to improve glycaemic endpoints in patients with T2DM,

 </xref> the authors report the effects of DMR on hepatic metabolic indices. DMR was found to be a safe procedure that improves glycaemic and hepatic indices, with a metabolomic signature that suggests an insulin sensitising mechanism of action. While encouraging, the lack of an appropriate control, as well as the absence of imaging or histologic data, underscore the need for additional research to better understand and confirm the clinical utility of DMR, a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, as an actual disease intervention for both T2DM and NAFLD.
