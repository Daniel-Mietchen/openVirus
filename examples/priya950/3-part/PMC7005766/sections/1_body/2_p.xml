 </xref> examine the role of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 PCSK9 in liver fat accumulation and injury in response to saturated fatty acids (FAs) in a variety of cultured hepatocytes and in a mouse model of diet-induced hepatic steatosis. PCSK9 is a circulating protein known to reduce the abundance of receptors on the surface of liver cells charged with the task of lipid uptake from the circulation. One such receptor is the fatty acid translocase, also known as CD36. In the liver, CD36 is known to contribute to the progression of NAFLD to NASH by promoting triglyceride accumulation and subsequent lipid-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, the authors show that PCSK9 deficiency in cultured hepatocytes increases the uptake and accumulation of saturated and unsaturated FAs, resulting in lipid accumulation in cultured cells and mice. Further, and in contrast to normal dietary conditions, a high fatty metabolic challenge resulted in a significant increase in the expression of markers of ER stress, fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis, as well as plasma levels of ALT in 
 <italic>Pcsk9</italic> knockout mice. The inhibition of CD36 ablated the observed accumulation of lipid 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, highlighting the role of CD36 as a strong contributor to steatosis and liver injury in the context of PCSK9 deficiency. Importantly, PCSK9 is also known to induce the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (LDLR) once secreted from the liver. This discovery has led to the development of human anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies capable of reducing circulating LDL levels by 60% in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.
