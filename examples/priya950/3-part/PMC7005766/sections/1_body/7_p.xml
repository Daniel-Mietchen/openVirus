 </xref> Despite the increase in incidence and potential impact on health outcomes, relatively few advances in therapy have been made in the last 4 decades, since the original landmark trials – corticosteroids in combination with azathioprine have remained the established therapy since the 1970s, in contrast to many other immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis or inflammatory bowel disease in which steroid-based treatment regimens have not been used for years. Steroid-based therapies interrupt the adaptative immune process globally and are thus associated with significant side effects, while 10–20% of patients have an insufficient response that requires additional agents. Interestingly, while AIH has been traditionally classified as a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it is increasingly clear that B cells also play a role in its pathogenesis. Rituximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody that promotes depletion of B lymphocytes via binding to the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of B cells. A few reports have indicated the potential benefit of this compound in AIH, findings confirmed in the present study. Data from 22 patients with “difficult-to-treat” AIH showed that rituximab improved aminotransferase and albumin values for up to 2 years. In addition, 71% of patients had no clinical disease flares during this period and a reduction of prednisolone dose was possible in 62% of cases, though never to below 10 mg, which would ensure lower rates of side effects. Although retrospective, this is the largest cohort of patients with AIH to be treated with rituximab, opening the door for further research. Only a better understanding of immune pathogenesis will pave the way for more effective and better tolerated therapies that will replace the non-specific immunosuppressive agents currently used; a phenomenal challenge for scientists and clinicians!
