<p id="p0125">Enteric viruses are generally nonenveloped particles, which gives them a very good stability in the environment. The fact that the virions attach to the suspended material contributes to the protection from the inactivation; these particles can stay in the environment for a long time without being deactivated (

The limits of the common techniques of disinfection with respect to the elimination of human enteric viruses have led some researchers to focus on physical methods of elimination of viral particles. The membrane ultrafiltration is in this case a way to ensure a good quality of the drinking water (
