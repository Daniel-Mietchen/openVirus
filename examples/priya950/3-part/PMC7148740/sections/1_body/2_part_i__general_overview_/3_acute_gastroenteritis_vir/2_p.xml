<p id="p0190">In the first study (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">FSA, 2000</xref>) the sapoviruses (SAVs) are detected under the appellation calicivirus. We note that very little of caliciviruses are then detected in adults in comparison to the second study (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">FSA, 2012</xref>). This can be explained by the progress in terms of sensitivity of detection methods between these two studies. In the first study, 26.5% of consultations among general practitioners for intestinal viral infection involved children less than 5 years of age with a rotavirus infection. This figure rises to approximately 12% during the second study. This difference can be explained by the fact of the improvement of techniques for the detection of the whole of the enteric viruses between the two studies (
