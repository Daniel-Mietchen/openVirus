<p id="p0105">The development of molecular biology techniques allowed a considerable expansion of the Environmental Virology from the middle of the year 1980. This expansion could be explained by the fact that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) becomes a technique of choice because it is faster, less costly, and more specific than the detection method by cell culture (

Also, the virus as enteric adenoviruses (40/41), calicivirus, Norwalk-like virus [Norovirus (NoV)], hepatitis A virus (HAV), and other enteric viruses could not be amply sought in the environment. This is due to the fact that the cell lines available did not allow the growth of the so-called pathogens, or at least not enough to give a cytopathic effect. The 1990s will be marked by a real passion for the Environmental Virology, through the technique of PCR for enteric viruses to DNA as adenoviruses and the reverse transcriptase PCR for the RNA viruses (
