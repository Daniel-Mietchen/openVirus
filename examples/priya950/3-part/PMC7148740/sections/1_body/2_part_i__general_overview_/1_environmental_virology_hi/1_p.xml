 <italic>poliovirus</italic> was described in 1908. Thirty years later, it was confirmed that the transmission of 
 <italic>poliovirus</italic> infection was by air where the 
 <italic>poliovirus</italic> would multiply in the olfactory bulb and then borrow the track of the nerve fibers to access directly to the central nervous system (

 <italic>Coxsackievirus A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> of the same that the 
 <italic>echovirus</italic> allowed to define a new family of viruses characterized by their human enteric origin, involving their contamination of waters. Then in the year 1950, researchers showed a particular interest for the research on the enteroviruses in the waters. Many of the techniques developed for the purpose of how to concentrate the virus before moving to the cell culture, which is the historical method for the detection of enteroviruses. Research in the field devoted a place of choice to the techniques of concentration (
