<p id="p0410">The HEV has a worldwide distribution. It is endemic in the regions where sanitary conditions are low, responsible for large-scale outbreaks of viral hepatitis (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Pelosi and Clarke, 2008</xref>). It is also found in the developed countries but is at the origin of sporadic cases. The genotypes of HEV have different geographic distributions. Genotype 1 is endemic in Asia and is also found in Africa. Genotype 2 was originally identified with a strain responsible for an epidemic in Mexico City and has since been found mainly in Africa. The Genotype 3 is associated with sporadic cases, mainly in the industrialized countries despite its world distribution, and the genotype 4 is associated with sporadic cases and circulates mainly in Asia (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Pelosi and Clarke, 2008</xref>; Yugo and Meng, 2013). Approximately 150 cases of viral hepatitis due to HEV are reported each year in France, 50–100 in Germany, and 30 in Italy, the seroprevalence is 6% in the Netherlands, 7.3% for adults in Spain, and 15%–30% in the United States.
