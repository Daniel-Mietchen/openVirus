<p id="p0400">The HEV was discovered in the 1980s as the agent of viral hepatitis non-A and non-B was transmitted by fecal–oral route (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 1980</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Khuroo et al., 1980</xref>). It has been classified in 2004 as the only member of the genus Hepevirus in the Hepeviridae family. HEV is a nonenveloped virus, icosahedral capsid, and 27–30 nm in diameter. Its genome consists of a positive polarity single strand RNA, approximately, 7300 nt (
