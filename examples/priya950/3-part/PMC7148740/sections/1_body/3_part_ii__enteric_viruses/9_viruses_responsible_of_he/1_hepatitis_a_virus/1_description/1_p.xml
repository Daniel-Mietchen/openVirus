<p id="p0385">The HAV belongs to the family of the Picornaviridae and is classified in the genus Hepatovirus. It is a nonenveloped virus consisting of an icosahedral capsid. Its genome of about 7500 nt is composed of a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity. It is composed of two noncoding regions located in the 5′ and 3′ ends of NTR, as well as of a single ORF comprising the region P1, coding for the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 (VP4 putative), which constitute the capsid and regions P2 and P3, encoding for NSP involved in the replication of the virus (
