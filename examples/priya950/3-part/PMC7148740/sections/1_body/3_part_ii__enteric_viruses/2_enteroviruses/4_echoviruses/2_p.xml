<p id="p0250">The infections with 
 <italic>echovirus</italic> are usually asymptomatic. However, these viruses remain capable of causing serious and very varied pathologies. These disorders can be transmitted according to an epidemic mode similar to the polio cases. Some echoviruses are attacking the central nervous system causing aseptic meningitis. Echoviruses are also responsible for myocarditis and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and even some chronic diseases such as diabetes (2006). It should be noted that notwithstanding their replication in the intestinal tract, it is observed that echoviruses do not cause gastroenteritis (
