<p id="p0225">The enteroviruses are the viruses of the Picornaviridae family. They are characterized by a single-stranded RNA genome, of 2.5×10
 <sup>6</sup>  Da that ends by a poly-A chain at the 3′ end. The other 5′ end is blocked by a protein called V of approximately 2.4 kDa. The capsid of the Picornaviridae consists of 60 under protein units. Each of these subunits is formed of four polypeptides. The enteroviruses are nonenveloped viruses; their capsid has a diameter of 27 N m (
