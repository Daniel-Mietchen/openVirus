<p id="p0065">Polio is a viral disease that is usually spread through fecal contaminated water and food. Early symptoms of infection include fatigue, fever, vomiting, headache and pain in the neck, and extremities. The virus invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis in hours. Incubation takes between 3 and 30 days, but a person begins to shed the virus in their stool 7–10 days before, and 3–6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. A small minority of cases (0.5%–1%) result in paralysis, and at least 50% of cases occur in children 3–5 years old. Because most infected people have no symptoms at all while spreading the highly contagious virus for weeks, once introduced, polio usually infects many people before an outbreak is detected.</p>
