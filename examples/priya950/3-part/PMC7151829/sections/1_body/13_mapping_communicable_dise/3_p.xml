<p id="p0140">Moonan etÂ al. based a recently successful TB intervention on geographically targeted screening of clustered TB isolates. Because it assumed that persons with clustered strains of disease from geographically related areas represent ongoing community transmission that can be identified and interrupted through treatment, the study focused resources on zip codes with high incidence and clustered isolates. During the 28-month intervention, the number of cases of TB decreased from 28.5 cases per 1000 screenings to 2.4 cases per 1000. The rate of developing latent TB infection fell from 14.3 to 2.2 per 100 person-years of exposure. The intervention was successful because it distinguished between high incidence areas with high and low levels of clustered strains and deployed resources not just on the basis of incidence but on the basis of genotype. Since unique isolates represent remote transmission, location-based screening in areas with high rates of unique isolates would be less likely to identify either persons with active TB or recent acquired latent TB infection and thus not as cost-effective. Despite their incredible potential, these approaches are rarely employed in developing countries where they are most needed.</p>
