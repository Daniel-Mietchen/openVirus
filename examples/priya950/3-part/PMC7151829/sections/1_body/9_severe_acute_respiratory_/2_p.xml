<p id="p0100">Canadians returning from Asia imported SARS into Canada. The first cases involved a Canadian family of Hong Kong descent who lived in Toronto. A 78-year-old woman and her husband traveled to Hong Kong and stayed at a hotel where a cluster of 13 persons with suspected or probable SARS are known to have stayed. Two days after returning home, the woman developed what is now known as SARS and died. Several family members who had close contact with the index case then developed SARS symptoms, and one was later admitted to a hospital that subsequently became the epicenter for the Toronto outbreak. SARS killed 44 Canadians, caused illness in hundreds more, paralyzed a major segment of Ontario's healthcare system for weeks, and put more than 25,000 residents of the Greater Toronto Area in quarantine.</p>
