<p id="p0075">Sexual behavior of travelers is contributing to spatial mixing of different strains of sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide. Consequently, sexually active travelers risk being infected with new strains of known sexually transmitted infections. For example, gonorrhea, which causes an estimated 78 million cases worldwide each year—about 820,000 in the United States—is becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics. Early in 2018, a superresistant strain was reported in the United Kingdom, diagnosed in a man, who developed symptoms after sexual contact with a woman in Southeast Asia. The bacterial infection was resistant to the two major antibiotics for treating the disease—azithromycin and ceftriaxone. This case confirms one major concern for sexually active humanity: drug-resistant gonorrhea is spreading around the globe.</p>
