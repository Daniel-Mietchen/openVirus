<p id="p0015">Diseases are not distributed uniformly across the world; certain locations have diseases that are not present in others. Even when a disease occurs in multiple locations, its severity usually varies between places. Generally, tropical regions with warm, humid climates are ideal for the proliferation of disease-causing organisms, or vectors. For instance, swampy vegetation in low-lying areas of the tropics is ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes and thus, endemic malaria. Similarly, sociocultural practices, including living arrangements, diet, behavior, and occupation, also contribute to geographic variations in health and disease. Medical geographers study the spatial differences in disease occurrence and also the spatial distribution of healthcare resources. They seek to answer the question of who is getting what diseases/healthcare where and why? This article examines the geographic distribution of leading communicable causes of sickness and death. We begin with a description of the disease ecology modelâ€”a conceptual framework commonly used to account for spatial variations in disease.</p>
