<p id="p0090">As of March 2017, a total of 84 countries globally had reported local mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission. Determining accurately the complete global burden of ZIKAV disease is extremely difficult due to significant underreporting. Because disease is often clinically mild, patients might not seek medical care. Among those who do, the disease may be easily mistaken for another illness with similar presentation (e.g., dengue or chikungunya virus disease), testing may not be available or requested, and diagnosed cases may not be reported.</p>
