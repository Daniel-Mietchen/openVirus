<p id="p0080">Long known to be endemic in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, Zika virus (ZIKAV) was first identified in Brazil in 2015 (where it threatened cancellation of the Rio Olympics) and subsequently spread throughout the Region of the Americas. ZIKAV is spread primarily by the mosquito vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, and also by sexual contact, blood transfusion, and congenitally—from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby during pregnancy or around birth. Symptoms include mild rash, fever, red eyes, body pains, and headache. Infection during pregnancy can cause miscarriage; congenital microcephaly—babies with abnormally small heads; or other serious brain anomalies.
