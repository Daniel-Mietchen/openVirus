<p id="p0055">Despite treatment advances, TB remains an uncontrolled communicable disease worldwide and about 9 million persons are diagnosed and 2 million die yearly. Currently, more than 90% of the global TB burden occurs within developing countries due to widespread HIV/AIDS infection, crowding, medication shortages, and poor healthcare programs. In developed countries, newly diagnosed TB occurs most frequently among foreign-born immigrants, and native-born homeless who typically live in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions. For example, in Germany and France immigrants are three times and six times, respectively, more likely to be diagnosed with TB than are native-born persons. In 2016, 10 countries in eastern and southern Africa (Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) were listed among the countries with the highest TB burden.</p>
