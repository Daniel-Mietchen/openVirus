<p id="p0020">The disease ecology model attributes spatial variations in disease to three major variables: environment, genetics, and behavior. 
 <italic>Environment</italic> includes not just the physical environment of livelihood, environmental pollution (e.g., indoor pollution such as radon), and water quality, but also the socioeconomic environment, including relative deprivation, healthcare quality and access, land mines, and the politicalâ€“economic context. For example, low vaccination rates anywhere produce higher rates of vaccine-preventable diseases in those locations. Genetic predisposition is important particularly for noncommunicable diseases. People with light skin pigmentation are more prone to skin cancer than are others with a darker pigmentation. Similarly, recent research suggests that Ashkenazi Jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to other women. The human genome project is not only identifying genes responsible for serious diseases such as Parkinson but also developing effective therapies for them. Human behavior is the final component in the disease ecology model. Put simply, behavior facilitates or inhibits disease. Unhealthy behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption, overeating and failure to exercise, unsafe sexual practices, and smoking are associated with various diseases. In contrast, regular exercise and other positive health behaviors, including proper diet, enhance health and prevent disease. Thus, spatial variations in Africa's environment and cultural practices, including widespread poverty, poor healthcare resources with limited access to antiretrovirals, and unsafe burial practices, combine with other factors to produce the highest risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and Ebola in the world. Similarly, variations exist between and within countries.
