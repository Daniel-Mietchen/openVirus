<p>These are A/H1N1 pdm09 HA segment-specific primers tagged with flanking universal M13 primers to facilitate ease of sequencing. We have included a citation in the revised manuscript to address this (line101). The HA segment was amplified using two sets of primers to yield two overlapping PCR fragments: frag 1: ⁓ 976 bp and frag 2: ⁓ 890 bp. The contig of the two fragments (1.8 kb) covers the complete open reading frame of the HA gene (lines 106 – 107). </p>
