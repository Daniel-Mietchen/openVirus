<p>Thank you for this observation. The Kenyan A/H1N1 pdm09 HA gene sequence data used in this study is not new but are the ones already available in the genetic databases under accession numbers: ANH22064 - ARK18942; MH316121, MG815810; MH356637 - MH356647 and MK692755 - MK692776 in the manuscript (lines 119 â€“ 120). The study focused on the sequence data generated during 2015 to 2018 influenza seasons in Kenya.</p>
