<p>1. It is unclear if the strains used in this analysis are new, or are what is already available on the Influenza Research database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">fludb.org</ext-link>) and on GISAID (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">gisaid.org</ext-link>)â€¦if these are new strains, then the 46 available H1N1 strains from Kenya on IRD with addition of non-duplicates from the 121 strains available on GISAID should be included in this study as it will greatly increase the power of the analyses performed. This will alleviate the first limitation of the study, somewhat.
