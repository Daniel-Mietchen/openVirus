<p>Thank you for this comment. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference method. The MCMC was run for 10 million generations, with sampling every 1000 generations and a 10% burn-in. These statements have been incorporated in the revised manuscript (lines 124 â€“ 128). </p>
