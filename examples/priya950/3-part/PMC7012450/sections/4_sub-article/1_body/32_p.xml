<p>We concur with the reviewerâ€™s comment. A score of (++) describes an N-glycosylation with high specificity. However, as stated in line 146 of the manuscript we considered as score cut-off value of &gt; 0.5 suggestive of an N-glycosylation. We took (+) and (++) scores as evidence of potential glycosylation.</p>
