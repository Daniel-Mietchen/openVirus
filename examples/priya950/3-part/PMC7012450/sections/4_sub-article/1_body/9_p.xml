<p>In their manuscript, Opanda et. al. describe an in silico study of A/H1N1 viruses circulating in Kenya from 2015-2018. The paper is well written, clear, and the data is important in showing the natural drift in influenza A/H1N1 viruses in Kenya and issues that might arrive from decreased vaccine effectiveness. However, to increase the novelty of the manuscript, more work should be done with data available from other sources as well as in vitro analysis to confirm these in silico results. A few major comments for improvement exist.</p>
