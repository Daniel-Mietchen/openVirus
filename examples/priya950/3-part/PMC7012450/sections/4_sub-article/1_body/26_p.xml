<p>We did not clone the amplicons into a vector. Instead the M13 primer tags were incorporated to provide anchors flanking the amplicons to facilitate sequencing of the amplicons. The statement has been edited accordingly in the revised version of the manuscript providing the source detailing the process of sequencing the PCR amplicons with the M13 primers (lines 111-112).</p>
