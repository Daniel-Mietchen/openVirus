<p>We concur with the reviewer. A statement highlighting the difference in vaccine efficacies between A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/Brisbane/02/2018 vaccine strains against Kenyan 2018 A/H1N1 pdm09 isolates has been incorporated in the revised manuscript results section (lines 231 â€“ 235). Unfortunately, we could to provide HAI assay antigenic data between the Kenyan 2018 isolates and A/Brisbane/02/2018 reference anti-serum, since our lab ceased being recognized as an NIC in 2018 and therefore we no longer receive HAI assay Kits from WHO CC reference labs. </p>
