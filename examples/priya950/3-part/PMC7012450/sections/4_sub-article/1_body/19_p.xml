<p> Actually, the drifting the A/H1N1 pdm09 strains reported here is not unique to Kenyan viruses. The bulk of amino acid changes observed affecting antigenic sites of the HA1 domain among the Kenyan isolates have also been noticed in the sequences of foreign strains included in the study. To address this question, additional supporting information S1 Fig, S2 Fig, S3 Fig and S4 Fig has been added in the revised manuscript. </p>
