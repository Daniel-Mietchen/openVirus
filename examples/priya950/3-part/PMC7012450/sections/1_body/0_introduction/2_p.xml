<p>The annually formulated influenza vaccine comprises HA antigens from A (H3N2), A (H1N1) pdm09 and one lineage of B (trivalent vaccine) or both lineages (quadrivalent vaccine) as predicted from circulating strains in the preceding seasons [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines fluctuate yearly in part due to genetic evolution of the virus leading to antigenic distance between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Different methods including hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and P
 <sub>epitope</sub> model may be used to estimate antigenic distance amongst influenza viruses and thus evaluate vaccine efficacy [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, previous works have demonstrated that data generated by the P
 <sub>epitope</sub> model correlate fairly well with vaccine efficacy [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The P
 <sub>epitope</sub> model calculates genetic changes in dominant epitopes of the vaccine strain and circulating viruses, providing a measure that corresponds linearly with vaccine efficacy [

After an antigenic stasis of about six years characterized by little change in the antigenic epitopes of the HA1 protein, new antigenically distinct variants of the virus emerged in 2016 globally necessitating a change in the vaccine formulation for the first time in the 2017 influenza season [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present study sought to evaluate antigenic and phylogenetic aspects of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya during 2015/2018 when there was increased evolution of the virus, focusing on the HA1 domain of hemagglutinin protein.
