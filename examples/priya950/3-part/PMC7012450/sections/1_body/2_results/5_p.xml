<p>A summary of the HAI assay titers for Kenyan A/H1N1 pdm09 isolates and vaccine viruses A/California/7/2009 (2015/2016 influenza seasons) and A/Michigan/45/2015 (2017/2018 influenza seasons) is shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The Kenyan 2015/2016 isolates exhibited lower HAI titers with the A/California/7/2009 reference antiserum relative to the vaccine antigen A/California/7/2009, suggesting reduced antibody recognition and binding to antigenic sites among the Kenyan viruses. Conversely, all the Kenyan isolates, including those obtained in 2017/2018 exhibited higher HAI assay titers with the A/Michigan/45/2015 reference antiserum, suggesting enhanced recognition and binding to antigenic sites among the study isolates.
