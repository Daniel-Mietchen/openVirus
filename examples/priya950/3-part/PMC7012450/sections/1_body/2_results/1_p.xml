<p>Thirty-eight (38) HA sequences of A (H1N1) pdm09 strains isolated in Kenya during 2015 (N = 5), 2016 (N = 2), 2017 (N = 2) and 2018 (N = 29) were analyzed. Homology analysis based on HA1 showed that Kenyan 2015/2016 strains shared 97.6–98.4% (nucleotide) and 93.3–97.2% (amino acid) sequence identities with the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009, whereas the 2017/2018 strains had 97.9–99.4% (nucleotide) and 97.5–99% (amino acid) identities with A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus (
