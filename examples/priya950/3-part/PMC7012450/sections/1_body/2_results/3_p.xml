<p>Natural selection analysis by the SLAC method showed that the mean dN/dS (Ï‰) value for Kenyan A (H1N1) pdm09 strains in the HA1 sub-unit was 0.65 (95% CI), suggesting negative (purifying) selection. No specific codon sites within the HA1 sub-unit were detected to be evolving under negative or positive selection by either the SLAC or FEL methods at P-value &lt; 0.05). All 2015/2016 Kenyan strains retained four potential N-glycosylation sites (at amino acid residue positions 11, 23, 87 and 287) present in the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. The 2017/2018 strains (with exception of a strain designated A/Kenya/066/2018, accession no: MK692755) had an extra N-glycosylation site (at amino acid residue position 162) present in vaccine component A/Michigan/45/2015. The gain of a glycosylation motif in 2017/2018 A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses was due to a S162N amino acid substitution.</p>
