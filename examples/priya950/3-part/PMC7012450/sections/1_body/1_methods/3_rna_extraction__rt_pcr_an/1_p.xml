<p>RNA extraction from the isolates was carried out using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR amplification of the HA gene was performed using Superscript III One Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen Corporation, USA) and a set of previously described M13 tagged primers [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A final reaction mix of 25μL containing 2 X Reaction Mix, 20pmoles/μL of both Forward and Reverse primers, Superscript RT/Platinum 
 <italic>Taq</italic> enzyme mix, Nuclease-free water (Promega Corporation, USA) and 3μL RNA template was prepared. The reaction mix was run at 50°C for 30 min, 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of (94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 1 min) and 68°C for 7 min on a 9700 FAST ABI Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR amplicons (frag 1: Σ 976 bp; frag 2: Σ 890 bp) were resolved on a 1% Agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) and visualized using the E-box gel documentation system (Vilber Lourmat, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR products were cleaned using Exonuclease I/Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (ExoSap-IT) enzyme (Affymetrix, USA) and sequenced directly on both strands using universal M13 forward and reverse primers, as previously described [
