<p>Nucleotide sequence fragments were processed into contigs using DNA baser v3.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and aligned with Muscle v3.8 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference method implemented in MrBayes v3.2 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], under the best fit HKY+G nucleotide substitution model as predicted by the jModelTest software [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The MCMC was run for 10 million generations, with sampling every 1000 generations and a 10% burn-in. Sequences of relevant reference strains comprising those of known clades and WHO recommended vaccine strains for the southern hemisphere [A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (2015–2016) &amp; A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (2017–2018)] were retrieved from GenBank/ GISAID databases (
