<p>Adaptive selection pressures within the HA1 domain were inferred from the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS) using methods available in Datamonkey web server [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Selection pressure across the HA1 (mean dN/dS = Ï‰) and specific codon sites were estimated by the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) and fixed effects likelihood (FEL) methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The dN/dS ratio was calculated based on neighbor-joining trees under the HKY85 substitution model [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Strong evidence of selection was accepted at a P-value &lt;0.05.
