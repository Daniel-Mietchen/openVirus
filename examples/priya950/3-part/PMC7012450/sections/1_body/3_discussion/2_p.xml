<p>Scrutiny of our analyzed data revealed nine to thirteen antigenic amino acid alterations in HA1 sub-unit of Kenyan 2015/2016 strains compared to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009, parallel to 2018 strains which showed fifteen disparate antigenic variations with respect to A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus. This result indicates that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses that circulated in Kenya during 2015/2016 and 2018 seasons were genetic variants of the vaccine strains and reverberates findings of similar studies reported elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Previous works have shown that four or more amino acid modifications at different HA1 epitope sites of an influenza virus is antigenically significant as it can give rise to new drift variants with altered antigenic properties [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These observations suggest that besides being genetic variants of the vaccine strains, the Kenyan viruses were antigenically divergent from those vaccine strains, plausibly implying that the vaccines provided sub-optimal protection against the A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses.
