<p>The predicted vaccine efficacy of A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strains circulating in Kenya during 2015/2016 season was 32.4%. The sub-optimal vaccine efficacy suggests antigenic drift and corresponds with our genetic analysis data. This result corroborates findings of previous works and buttresses the WHO September 2016 decision to update southern hemisphere A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine strain [

The estimated vaccine efficacy between A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya during 2017 season ranged from 39.6 to 41.8%. These estimates imply improved vaccine efficacy and reflect findings of related studies conducted elsewhere [

This observation is attributed to several antigenic amino acid alterations noticed among Kenyan 2018 strains and yet again supports the WHO February 2019 decision to update influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus vaccine component for northern hemisphere during the 2019â€“2020 season A/Brisbane /02/2018 [

Assessment of the vaccine efficacy of A/Brisbane /02/2018 vaccine strain against Kenyan 2018 viruses indicated a predicted vaccine efficacy range of 32.2% - 42.1%, suggesting that the new vaccinating virus will not provide improved protection against the circulating viruses.
