<p>The average dN/dS (Ï‰) value indicated that the A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya during 2015/2018 were evolving under purifying selection in HA1 protein. Additionally, no specific codon sites in this hemagglutinin protein region were found to be positively or negatively selected. Our result is consistent to findings by Tewawong
