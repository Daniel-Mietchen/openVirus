<p>To investigate whether antigenic drift observed among the Kenyan A/H1N1 pdm09 strains was attributable to the lower vaccine efficacy predictions, HAI assay characterization of the isolates using reference post-infection ferret antiserum was conducted. Data generated revealed that the A/H1N1 pdm09 strains isolated in Kenya during the 2015/2016 influenza seasons had lower HAI titers (â‰¥2-fold) compared to the vaccine strain, suggesting that despite reports indicating that the A/H1N1 pdm09 viruses that circulated in the world during this period were antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009 [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], those circulating in Kenya had undergone considerable antigenic divergence from the vaccine strain, leading to sub-optimal vaccine efficacy. This finding is consistent with that of a similar study reported elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consequently, those viruses isolated during 2017/2018 exhibited high HAI titers with the reference antiserum, indicating higher antigenic relatedness with the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 and improved vaccine efficacy.
