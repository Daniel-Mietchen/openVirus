<p>This study had a few shortcomings. First, the small number of sequences analyzed for viruses that circulated in Kenya during 2015 /2017 was somewhat not representative. Secondly, we predicted antigenic drift and vaccine efficacy using H3 numbering system [

 <sub>epitope</sub> calculation in A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Despite these shortcomings, we have provided evidence that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses isolated in Kenya during 2015/2018 belonged to phylogenetic clade 6B, subclades 6B.2 and 6B.1. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine strain A/ California/07/2009 exhibited sub-optimal vaccine efficacy against Kenyan 2015/2016 strains, denoting antigenic drift among these viruses. Overall, these findings indicate a swiftly evolving A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in recent post pandemic era, underscoring the need for sustained surveillance coupled with molecular and antigenic analyses, to inform appropriate and timely influenza vaccine update.
