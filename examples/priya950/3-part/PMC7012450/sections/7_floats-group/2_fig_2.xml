   <bold>WebLogo depicting frequency of amino acid changes at the epitope sites (A-E) within the HA1 protein of Kenyan influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strains isolated between 2015 and 2018.</bold> Amino acid alignment positions along the x-axis in (A) indicate variable sites among Kenyan 2015–2016 strains relative to the vaccine strain A/California/2009 while those in (B) depict variable sites among the 2017–2018 isolates relative to the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015. The height of the residue indicates the relative frequency of each amino acid at that particular position. These graphics were created using WebLogo (
