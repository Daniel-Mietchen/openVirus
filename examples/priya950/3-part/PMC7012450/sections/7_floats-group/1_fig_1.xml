  <title>Phylogenetic relationship of HA1 protein sequences of A (H1N1) pdm09.</title>
  <p>Sequences of Kenyan isolates (shown in blue) were analyzed relative to reference strains of known clades (shown in green), vaccine reference strains for southern hemisphere (shown in red) and other reference strains (shown in black). The tree was re-constructed using MrBayes v3.2 with a HKY+G nucleotide substitution model. Numbers at the nodes represent percentage posterior probability values while the scale bar indicates number of amino acid substitutions per site.</p>
