<p id="Par39">Immigration data from the National Institute for Statistics and Census in Ecuador (INEC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] between 1997 and 2017 indicated a sharp rise of Colombian citizens entering Ecuador, starting 2009–2010, and peaking around 2014. The influx of Venezuelan citizens into Ecuador was steady until 2007, when an increase of 30% was observed compared to the previous year. Another sharp increase started in 2012, by 54% compared to the year before, and by 2014 the number of immigrants had increased by 305% since 2011. In 2017, the influx of Venezuelan citizens had increased by 900% compared to 2011 (Fig.
