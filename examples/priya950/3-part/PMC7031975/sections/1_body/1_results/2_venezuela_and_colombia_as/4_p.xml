<p id="Par36">Full genome BEAST analyses of both small (BEASTFGD2.small, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and large (BEASTFGD2.large, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) datasets for DENV2 produced concordant results pertaining to their respective genetic relationships, TMRCAs (time of the most recent common ancestor) and the locations of viral origins. The only differences were in their estimated location probabilities (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The smaller dataset in general produced lower location posterior probabilities, while the larger dataset had high confidence probabilities for viral location origins (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In addition, and unsurprisingly, the larger dataset was able to detect more viral introductions, such as an additional dissemination of DENV2 from Brazil to Peru. E gene analyses of DENV2, however, did not produce results that were completely concordant with full genome analyses. For DENV2 E gene (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), the origin of Ecuadorian genomes was estimated to Colombia and this country was also estimated to have disseminated the virus at several time points into Venezuela (all posterior probabilities &gt; 0.97) and once into Nicaragua. E gene analyses also suggested viral dissemination from Venezuela into Colombia (2012) and Peru (1998), and from Peru into Ecuador (1999). As observed for DENV1 E gene results, DENV2 also indicated viral spread between Brazil, Paraguay and also Bolivia.
