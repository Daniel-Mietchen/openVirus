<p>These BSL-2 assays are simple and flexible for testing viral mutations of interest like NP-R111C, which emerged and quickly became a dominant substitution during the 2013â€“2016 EVD epidemic. In particular, the BRET assay for NP oligomerization can be performed in high-throughput. BRET signal is quite reproducible between replicates and plates because the assay includes normalization based on NLuc luminescence to adjust for differences in transfection or protein expression efficiency, and subtraction of background luminescence to compensate for luminescence spillover from NLuc into the BRET channel. With more rigorous screening and quantification of key metrics of variability like Z-factor, these assays could be used for high-throughput screens of hundreds of EBOV NP mutants, interactions with host factors, or antagonism by drug candidates. The flexibility of BSL-2 reporter assays makes them ideal as first-line methods to probe mutations and mechanisms prior to cumbersome BSL-4 studies with live virus.</p>
