<p>Here, we developed and modified BSL-2 assays to study in-depth a key EBOV NP substitution, NP-R111C, which arose during the 2013–2016 Western African EVD epidemic. Though the NP-R111 residue has not been previously annotated as functional, the residue’s proximity to a key NP–NP electrostatic interaction led us to consider that substitution at this residue could affect multiple viral phenotypes. Because EBOV NP plays many critical roles during the life cycle, we developed assays for NP oligomerization and VLP budding in live cells with controls. These assays are biologically relevant for EBOV and may also be appropriate for other viral nucleoproteins as well. Our data reveal that NP position 111 is importantly positioned to affect both phenotypes as well as viral transcription and replication. NP-R111, the adjacent basic residues K109 and K110, and the K109-E349 salt bridge identified by cryo-EM [
