<p>The ability of NP to oligomerize likely affects its role in virion assembly and budding. During the viral life cycle, the EBOV matrix protein VP40 induces curvature of the cellâ€™s plasma membrane and engages with EBOV nucleocapsids (composed of NP oligomers, polymerase cofactor VP35, and minor capsid protein VP24) to form EBOV particles that exit the cell by budding [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Co-expression of NP with VP40 significantly increases the number of VLPs released from cells [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but the mechanism by which NP increases VLP production is not fully elucidated. For example, NP oligomers could physically stabilize VLP structure, or NP could engage with host proteins to promote VLP assembly and budding.
