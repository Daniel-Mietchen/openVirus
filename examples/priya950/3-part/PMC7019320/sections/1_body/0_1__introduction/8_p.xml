<p>For this study, we adapted and modified BSL-2 methods to study key functions of EBOV NP in cell culture—oligomerization and VLP budding—and used established minigenome systems to measure viral transcription and replication. Such tools are critical for rapidly characterizing unknown or emerging mutants since studying live EBOV requires limited BSL-4 facilities. Moreover, existing recombinant live virus systems typically use a genetic backbone that is different from the EBOV Makona variant isolate C-15 sequence [

Using these straightforward, modular reporter assays, we found that the NP-R111C substitution slightly increased EBOV NP oligomerization and VLP budding and slightly decreased transcription and replication. Charge-reversal at this position, NP-R111E, significantly altered NP oligomerization, supporting the K110–E349 salt bridge in cryo-EM structures of NP oligomers. Unexpectedly, NP-R111E dramatically ablated viral transcription and replication. Our findings demonstrate the interconnectedness of multiple viral phenotypes controlled by the NP-R111 residue and support the possibility that NP-R111C affects replication of live virus.
