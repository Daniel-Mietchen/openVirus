<p>Though we did not detect differential interactions between the two NP genotypes, our approach yielded multiple members of the adaptor related protein 1 (AP-1) complex as strong candidate host protein interactors (

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] but were not further confirmed. The AP-1 complex mediates intracellular transport, and therefore could be important for viral transcription and replication, or VLP formation and budding. Here, we confirmed that both NP-R111 and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E strongly interacted with AP-1 subunit M1 (AP1M1) and AP1G1 by reciprocal IP-WB (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). Moreover, NP-R111C, NP-R11E, and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E all bound to the AP-1 complex with similar affinity as NP-R111 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>). These results suggest that, though the AP-1 interaction did not explain differences between the mutants in our assays, the interaction could play a role in NP function.
