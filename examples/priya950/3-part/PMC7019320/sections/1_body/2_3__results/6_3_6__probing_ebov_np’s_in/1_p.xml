<p>We wanted to further explore why the charge-reversal mutants were strikingly defective at viral transcription and replication, and considered that charge-reversal might alter NP’s protein–protein interactions. The binding interfaces of VP30 and VP35 are on the opposite face of NP as the R111 residue (

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], all utilizing the NP amino acid sequence from the Mayinga isolate of the EBOV Yambuku variant (EBOV/Yam-May), the first EBOV isolated in 1976. To build upon these previous results, we performed co-immunoprecipitation tandem mass spectrometry (co-IP MS/MS) using myc-tagged NP from EBOV/Makona variant bearing either R111 or K109E/K110E/R111E, which had the most dramatic charge-reversal.
