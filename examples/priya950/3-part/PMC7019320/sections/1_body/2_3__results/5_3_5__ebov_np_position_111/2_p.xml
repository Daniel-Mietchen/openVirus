<p>Using the 1MG system, only the charge-reversal NP mutants affected transcription and replication differently than the wild-type. As expected, the absence of EBOV VP30, L, or the minigenome (gray) resulted in &lt;5% normalized minigenome activity compared to cells expressing the minigenome and the entire RNP complex with NP-R111 (tan,
