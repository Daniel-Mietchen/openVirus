<p>In the 4MG trVLP system, we again observed that NP-R111E abrogated transcription and replication in the producer (P0) cells, though NP-R111C modestly decreased activity as well. As expected, we detected virtually no signal from any cells in the absence of EBOV L (gray). Paired with the ancestral GP-A82 (

Because the P0 cells are transfected with plasmid encoding the 4MG minigenome, these cells primarily account for transcription and replication without the requirement for trVLP entry and spread; therefore, we do not expect the GP-A82V substitution, which only increases viral entry [
