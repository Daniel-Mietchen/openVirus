<p>To verify that our assay was truly measuring NP oligomerization, we generated a loss-of-function (LOF) mutant and disrupted oligomerization with EBOV VP35. We generated NP-∆OD (deletion of oligomerization domain, NP residues 20–38), a LOF mutant that biochemical methods (size exclusion chromatography and multiangle light scattering) indicated to be defective in oligomerization [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We then generated NLuc- and HaloTag-tagged NP and NP-∆OD and performed our BRET assay in live cells. As expected, expression of NP-NLuc and NP-HaloTag resulted in bright BRET luminescence, compared to the tagged versions of NP-∆OD which only resulted in low background signal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This background signal persisted in the presence of NP-HaloTag without NP-NLuc or with NP-HaloTag and free NLuc (not fused to NP), but was absent when NP-NLuc was expressed without NP-HaloTag, suggesting that the background signal was due to autoluminesence of the HaloTag ligand and not oligomerization of NP-∆OD (

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To quantitatively detect VP35[NPBP] expression, we fused enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to NPBP via a bridging porcine teschovirus 1 2A ‘self-cleaving’ peptide [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP]) and co-transfected varying amounts of this plasmid. Increasing expression of eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP] led to a quantitative decrease in BRET oligomerization signal, fitting well to an inverse function (
