<p>Finally, we tested how different NP mutants affected our VLP budding assay and found that only NP-R111C affected VLP production. Expression of viral nucleoproteins, including EBOV NP, is known to significantly increase matrix protein-induced VLP production [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We verified that ancestral NP-R111 (tan) increased NLuc-VP40 VLP production 1.93-fold compared to eGFP control (gray;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). NP-R111C (red) significantly increased VLP production above NP-R111 (1.26-fold; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.039, rANOVA-Dunnett’s test), whereas the charge-reversed NP-R111E (light blue; 1.07-fold; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.847, rANOVA-Dunnett’s test) and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E (dark blue; 1.13-fold; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.484, rANOVA-Dunnett’s test) did not have reproducible effects. To determine whether increased luminescence was due to increased VLP size, we expressed unfused VP40, GP, and NP-R111 or NP-R111C, and visualized VLPs via EM (
