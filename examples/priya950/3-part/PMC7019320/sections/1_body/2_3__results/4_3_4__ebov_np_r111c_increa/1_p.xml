<p>To determine whether the different mutants impact NPâ€™s role in virion structure, we designed and optimized a VLP budding assay. Traditionally, researchers assess viral budding efficiency by harvesting cell culture supernatants, purifying VLPs by ultracentrifugation through sucrose, and detecting VLPs by WB using antibodies to specific VLP components [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, WBs are often insensitive to modest changes in VLP numbers and can suffer from high technical variability. By contrast, luminescence can be reproducibly detected over a larger linear dynamic range. However, the size of firefly luciferase (FLuc; 60 kDa) can severely interfere with incorporation into budding VLPs. Indeed, although the EBOV matrix protein VP40 (40 kDa) alone is sufficient to bud VLPs [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], fusion of VP40 to FLuc decreased luciferase activity to undetectable levels in a budding assay [
