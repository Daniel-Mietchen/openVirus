<p>One major challenge to VLP budding assays is that VP40 can be expelled from cells as a monomer [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] perhaps via exosomes [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. To distinguish between monomeric VP40 and VLPs, we used a LOF mutant, VP40-L117R, which is defective in VLP budding as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy and WB [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We expressed NLuc-VP40 or NLuc-(VP40-L117R) in cells and collected unpurified supernatant or purified VLPs by ultracentrifugation through a 20% (

 <italic>v</italic>) sucrose cushion. We added NLuc substrate and measured luminescence in unpurified supernatant or the VLP-containing pellet. As expected, budding of VLPs containing NLuc-(VP40-L117R) LOF mutant was impaired by &gt;400-fold compared to NLuc-VP40 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). We did not observe as large of a difference between NLuc-VP40 and NLuc-(VP40-L117R) in unpurified culture supernatant (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>, left), suggesting that an appreciable amount of monomeric VP40 was secreted from cells. Moreover, treating cells with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of coat protein complex I (COPI)-mediated transport, did not affect luminescence in unpurified supernatant (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), suggesting that secretion of monomeric VP40 was independent of this major transport mechanism, as reported previously [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. To further verify that we were measuring luminescence from VLPs rather than monomeric VP40, we heated culture supernatant prior to ultracentrifugation. If VLPs were present, heating would dissociate VLPs into VP40 monomers [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], which would fail to pellet after ultracentrifugation through sucrose. Whereas heating supernatant to 60.2 Â°C decreased NLuc activity [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], heating and subsequent ultracentrifugation reduced NLuc activity an additional 15-fold (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.007; paired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting that NLuc-VP40 VLPs were denatured and, thus, were not pelleted and detected (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>).
