<p>We then further optimized our VLP assay to maximize the difference between NLuc-VP40 and the LOF mutant NLuc-(VP40-L117R). We first transfected cells with a range of NLuc-VP40 or NLuc-(VP40-L117R) plasmid amounts and measured luminescence in unpurified culture supernatant. A relatively small amount of NLuc-VP40 plasmid (2.22 ng) produced the greatest difference in luminescence between NLuc-VP40 and NLuc-(VP40-L117R) (

Though NLuc is a relatively small protein (19 kDa), fusion to VP40 (40 kDa) could still impair VP40 interactions and functions. Co-expressing increasing amounts of ‘dark’ untagged VP40 in cells did not increase the difference in luminescence between wild-type NLuc-VP40 and LOF mutant (

Lastly, we optimized the amount of NP plasmid to co-transfect with NLuc-VP40, and, consistent with NP’s role in promoting VLP formation, increasing the amount of NP plasmid transfected always increased luminescence and resulted in greater difference in luminescence between NLuc-VP40 and NLuc-(VP40-L117R) (
