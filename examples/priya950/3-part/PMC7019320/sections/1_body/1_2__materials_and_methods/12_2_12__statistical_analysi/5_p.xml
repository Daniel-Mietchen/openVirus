<p>To measure the impact of NP genotype on VLP production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), we co-expressed NLuc-VP40 and NP-R111 or NP mutants (R111C, R111E, K109E/K110E/R111E, ΔC50—a 50 amino acid truncation of the NP C-terminus [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) or eGFP control. rANOVA revealed significant day-to-day (replicate-to-replicate) variability, so we normalized all NLuc intensities within each replicate to each replicate’s NP-R111 value. We performed Dunnett’s post-test with the NP-R111 group removed (since variance and degrees of freedom of NP-R111 are both 0 after normalization) and compared each NP mutant or eGFP versus 1 to generate corrected
