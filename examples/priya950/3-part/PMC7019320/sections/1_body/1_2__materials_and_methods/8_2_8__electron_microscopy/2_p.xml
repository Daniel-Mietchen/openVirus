<p>We prepared samples for EM based on a previously described protocol [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Briefly, we performed all spreads onto freshly prepared carbon-stabilized Formvar support films on 200 mesh copper grids. We adsorbed VLPs onto a carbon-coated Formvar support films for 30 s. We removed excess liquid with filter paper, and negatively stained the samples immediately by running 6 drops of 1% uranyl acetate over the grid for contrast. We removed excess stain and air-dried the samples in a controlled humidity chamber. We then examined the samples using a FEI Tecnai 12 Spirit BioTwin transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. We captured micrographs at various magnifications to record the fine structure of VLPs and exported micrographs into ImageJ [
