<p>For most assays, we performed lipid-based reverse transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For a 6-well plate, we incubated 2 µg of plasmid DNA with 125 µL of Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 5 min (min). We incubated this mixture with 10 µL of Lipofectamine 2000 in 115 µL of Opti-MEM at room temperature for 45 min. We added all 250 µL of the DNA–lipid mixture to a well of a 6-well plate and then added trypsin-harvested cells. For smaller or larger plates, amounts were scaled accordingly. For BRET experiments, we used Opti-MEM without phenol red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to minimize background fluorescence from culture media.</p>
