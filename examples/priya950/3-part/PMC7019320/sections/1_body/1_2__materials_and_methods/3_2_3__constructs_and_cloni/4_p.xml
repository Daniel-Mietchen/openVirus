 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), we constructed a plasmid to express NLuc fused to EBOV/Mak-C15 VP40 (NLuc-VP40). To create this plasmid, we obtained a pcDNA3.1(+)-based vector expressing Î²-lactamase (Bla) fused to EBOV/Yam-May VP40 (Bla-VP40) from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)/NIAID Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA; #NR-19813) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We replaced the Bla sequence with the gene encoding NLuc from pNL1.1 (Promega) and replaced the EBOV/Yam-May VP40 sequence with that of EBOV/Mak-C15 VP40 from a gBlock (IDT). pNL1.1, which expresses NLuc alone without VP40, was used as a negative control. As an additional negative control, we performed SDM to introduce a L117R substitution into NLuc-VP40 to generate loss-of-function (LOF) [
