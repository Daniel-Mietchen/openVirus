<p>For tetracistronic (4MG) minigenome experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D), we additionally cloned L and VP35 from EBOV/Mak-C15 into a pCAGGS vector. Since no amino acid differences are present between VP30 of EBOV/Yam-May and EBOV/Mak-C15, we were able to express EBOV/Mak-C15 sequences of all ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex members (L, VP35, VP30, NP). We additionally cloned the 4MG minigenome plasmid from EBOV/Mak-C15, expressing a
