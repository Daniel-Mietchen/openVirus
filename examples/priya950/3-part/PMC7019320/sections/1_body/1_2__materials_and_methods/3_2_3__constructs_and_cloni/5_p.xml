<p>For monocistronic (1MG) minigenome experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), plasmids are described in [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this system, EBOV RNA-directed RNA polymerase (L), viral cofactor proteins (VP30 and VP35), and NP were derived from the EBOV/Yam-May isolate and expressed from a pCAGGS vector. We replaced EBOV/Yam-May NP with EBOV/Mak-C15 NP and its mutants before measuring minigenome activity encoded by a firefly luciferase (FLuc) reporter gene.
