<p>For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and oligomerization studies, we generated NP with different C-terminal tags in the pGL4.23-CMV backbone. For the traditional dual-tag co-IP-Western blot (WB) strategy in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, we generated myc-tagged NP (pGL4.23-CMV/NP-myc). For the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) oligomerization assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>), we replaced the C-terminal V5 tag with either HaloTag or NanoLuc (NLuc) from the NanoBRET Nano-Glo Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). As a negative control, we removed NP amino acid residues 20–38, abrogating the oligomerization domain (NP-ΔOD) [
