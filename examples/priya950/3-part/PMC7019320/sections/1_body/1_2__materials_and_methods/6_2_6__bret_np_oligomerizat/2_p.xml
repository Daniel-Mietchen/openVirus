<p>At 24 h post-transfection, we added 1:100 NanoBRET Nano-Glo Substrate, incubated cells in the dark at room temperature for 45 min, and measured luminescence on a DTX880 Multimode Detector (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with emission filters of 625/35 nm (HaloTag ligand acceptor signal), and then 465/35 nm (NLuc donor signal), both over 1-second (s) integrations. We calculated BRET signal as the 625 nm/465 nm ratio with HaloTag ligand, subtracted by the same ratio for the corresponding DMSO vehicle control, as per the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.</p>
