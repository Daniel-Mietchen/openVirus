<p>We grew cells to near confluency, harvested by trypsinization, reverse-transfected, and plated cells in 6-well poly-D-lysine-coated plates (Corning). We reverse-transfected cells in each well with 50 ng of pcDNA3.1/NLuc-VP40 or pNL1.1/NLuc negative control and 2000 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-V5, NP mutants, or pcDNA3.3/eGFP negative control.</p>
