   <bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis of the 2013â€“2016 EVD epidemic. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree based on 1,823 EBOV genome sequences, and colored branches based on GP-82 and NP-111 alleles. No GP-A82/NP-R111C sequences were detected. Arrowheads point to the emergence of the GP-A82V (green) and NP-R111C (blue) substitutions compared to genomes encoding the ancestral GP-A82/NP-R111 alleles (tan). Scale bar denotes substitutions/nucleotide; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Number of EVD cases over time, stratified by genotype. Coloring is identical to
