<p>Since the mid-2000s, measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines have been available [
 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The MMRV vaccine was developed based on the existing MMR and varicella vaccines. Licensed ProQuad (Merck and Co., Inc. West Point, PA, USA; Merk) and Priorix-Tetra (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium; GSK) have different measles virus strains (Edmonston strain and Schwarz strain, respectively), different mumps virus strains (RIT 4385 strain and Jeryl Lynn strain, respectively), the same rubella virus strain (Wistar RA 27/3 strain), and the same varicella virus strain (Oka strain) [

 <xref rid="B99-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Similar seroconversion rates of these four viruses were found between comparison groups [

 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Recent evidence has shown that the MMRV vaccines have comparable immunogenicity and safety profiles in healthy children [
 <xref rid="B97-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The Jeryl Lynn mumps genotype A strain has been used in the MMR vaccine throughout the world. It shows a markedly lower incidence of aseptic meningitis than other strains and higher immune response [
