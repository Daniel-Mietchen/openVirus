This study showed a higher occurrence of aseptic meningitis 3 weeks after Brazil’s national vaccination day (relative risk = 14.3; 95% confidence interval: 7.9, 25.7), compared with the risk in the pre-vaccination period. This result was confirmed by a case series analysis (relative risk = 30.4; 95% confidence interval: 11.5, 80.8). The estimated risk of aseptic meningitis among children who received MMR (containing Urabe strain) vaccination was 1 in 14,000 doses [
