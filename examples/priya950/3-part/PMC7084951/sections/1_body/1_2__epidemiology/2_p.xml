<p>In the vaccine era, the widespread use of mumps vaccines has substantially reduced the risk of occurrence as well as the number of serious complications due to mumps [

 <xref rid="ijerph-17-01686-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The epidemiologic pattern of mumps changing is based on the various vaccination program, such as the number of doses of vaccination, age at vaccination, and vaccine coverage. The coverage rate of mumps vaccination increases, the average age at infection increases until the level of seropositive population needed to stop spread of mumps has been achieved [
