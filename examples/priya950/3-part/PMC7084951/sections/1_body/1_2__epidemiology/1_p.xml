<p>Mumps was a serious disease that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide before the program of mumps vaccination starting [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Several risk factors have been reported in mumps infection including age, exposure, compromised immunity, time of year, travel, and vaccination status. Although there is no evidence of a difference on occurrence of MuV infections between the sexes, males seemly have higher risk to present complications [

They showed that 50% of children aged four to six years old and 90% of children aged 14–15 years old were seropositive, with a steep increase in mumps antibody levels at two to three years of age. These results indicate that almost all individuals without receiving mumps vaccination will eventually become infected [
