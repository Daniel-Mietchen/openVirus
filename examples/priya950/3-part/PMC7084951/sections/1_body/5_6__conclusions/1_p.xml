<p>In summary, although mumps is a benign clinical disease, it has become an important re-emerging pathogen. The reemergence of MuV infection will continue to threaten people unless additional preventive measures are implemented. Mumps vaccine strains have been used in the world and have shown that live mumps vaccines are highly cost-effectiveness for vaccination, despite the occasional occurrence of aseptic meningitis. Improving our understanding of mumps virus infection epidemiology, pathogenesis, and concerns over vaccine safety and efficacy are important steps to better intervene in the mumps virus infection spread.</p>
