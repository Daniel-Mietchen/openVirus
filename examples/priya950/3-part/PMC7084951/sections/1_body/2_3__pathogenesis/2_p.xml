<p>MuV is transmitted to people by respiratory or oral route with infected respiratory droplets or secretions and the incubation time ranges from two to four weeks [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The virus has been isolated from saliva from seven days before until eight days after the occurrence of clinical symptoms [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Following exposure, MuV infects the upper respiratory tract via binding to sialic acid to enter polarized epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and enhance the invasion of mumps virus to neighboring cells [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. MuV is markedly secreted from the epithelial cells, which causes virus growth in the glandular epithelium and shedding of mumps virus in saliva [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. MuV can spread systemically in human body resulting in viremia during the early phase of infection [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Humans are known as the only natural host of MuV. Most (approximately one-half) cases are asymptomatic or suffer from only mild respiratory symptoms or fever after MuV infections [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Classic mumps infection is characterized by parotitis, but inflammation of salivary gland is not a main or necessary clinical manifestation of mumps infection [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], heart, kidney [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and genital organs [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] can also be affected via viremia dissemination. Viremia seems to be inhibited by the humoral antibodies and the virus level in salivary secretion correlates inversely with the local level of virus-specific secretory IgA produced [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It was hypothesized that neutralizing antibody that is produced in salivary glands may play an important role in restricting the replication of mumps virus and its excretion into saliva. In addition, the level of T cell antibody may play a role in the inhibition and clearance of mumps virus. It has been assumed that mumps virus invades T cells and efficiently grows in these cells [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Migrating mumps virus-infected T cells could enhance the mumps virus to disseminate to the various organs and might therefore play a key role in the development of mumps disease [
