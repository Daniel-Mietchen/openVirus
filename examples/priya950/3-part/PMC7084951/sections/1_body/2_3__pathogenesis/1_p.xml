<p>Both mumps and parainfluenza virus belong to the paramyxovirus group and are antigenically related. It has been reported that parainfluenza virus has been isolated from cases of parotitis infection [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and MuV has been isolated from patients with upper respiratory infection without inflammation of salivary gland [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Paramyxoviridae is an enveloped particle containing a non-segmented negative strand RNA molecule of 15,384 nucleotides [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The mumps virus is antigenically stable and does not exhibit great shifts in ways such as influenza virus. The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12–25 days post exposure and parotitis typically occurs 16–18 days after exposure [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are at least 12 genotypes which are defined based on the sequence of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Currently, the most frequently detected mumps genotype in recent outbreaks worldwide is genotype G [
