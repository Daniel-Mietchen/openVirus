<p>With percentages ranging between 37% and 75%, DENV1 had been the predominant serotype detected in DF patients in Lao PDR over several years (2007â€“2011) [

In the following year 2013 (when the majority of patients for the study presented in this work were recruited), the by far predominant serotypes found in DF patients admitted to Savannakhet Provincial Hospital were DENV2 and DENV3. An infection with DENV1 was found only in two out of 99 patients with an assignable DENV serotype and no DENV4 cases were seen in 2013. Similarly, only DENV2 and DENV3 serotypes were detected during the 2013 DF outbreak in Champasak province (southern Laos) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the later phase of the study (2015), only sporadic DF cases were seen at the Savannakhet Provincial Hospital (N = 18) with DENV4 being the predominant serotype (N = 12).
