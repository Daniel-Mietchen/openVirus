<p>In addition to the on-site analysis, the following diagnostic tests were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions: RealStar
 <bold>®</bold> Dengue RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics), RealStar
 <bold>®</bold> Dengue Type RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics), PLATELIA
 <bold>™</bold> Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA (Bio-Rad), Panbio
 <bold>®</bold> Dengue IgM Capture ELISA (Alere/Abbott), Panbio
 <bold>®</bold> Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA (Alere/Abbott). For the DENV IgG indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT), Vero cells infected with DENV serotype 2 were plated on glass slides and fixed with aceton. After blocking, glass slides were incubated with patient sera diluted in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with PBS, glass slides were incubated for 20 min at 37°C with secondary antibody (FITC labeled anti-human IgG (Sifin Diagnostics GmbH), 1:350 in PBS) and washed again with PBS before microscopic examination.
