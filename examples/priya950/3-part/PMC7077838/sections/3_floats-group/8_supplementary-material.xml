  <title>SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test results stratified according to DENV serotype (Lao PDR DF patients).</title>
  <p>Acute phase serum samples from patients infected with DENV1 (N = 2, 
   <bold>A-D</bold>), DENV2 (N = 28, 
   <bold>E—H</bold>), DENV3 (N = 50, 
   <bold>I—L</bold>), and DENV4 (N = 12, 
   <bold>M—P</bold>) were analyzed with the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1, IgM, and IgG test. Samples were stratified according to sampling day (days (d) post onset of symptoms) and Ct value in the RealStar Dengue RT-PCR. Dashed lines indicate Ct-value categories low (Ct ≤ 28.0), medium (28.0 &lt; Ct ≤ 33.0) and high (Ct &gt; 33.0). Open/filled circles represent samples tested negative/positive in the SD Bioline Dengue Duo test.
