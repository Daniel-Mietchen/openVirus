  <title>SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test results stratified according to anti-DENV IgG status.</title>
  <p>Acute phase serum samples from 92 patients with a PCR-confirmed DENV infection were categorized according to their anti-DENV IgG status as defined by DENV IgG IIFT. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Tabular representation of subgroup characteristics. Ct: threshold cycle, dpo: days post onset of symptoms. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> DENV IgG IIFT negative samples (N = 24), 
   <bold>(C)</bold> DENV IgG IIFT positive samples (N = 68). Samples were stratified according to sampling day d (post onset of symptoms) and Ct-value (categories low (≤ 28.0), medium (28.0 &lt; Ct ≤ 33.0), high (Ct &gt; 33.0) indicated by dashed lines). Open/filled circles represent negative/positive NS1 test results. Absolut sample numbers (n positives / N samples in category) and percentages are displayed. ***: p &lt; 0.001, ****: p &lt; 0.0001.
