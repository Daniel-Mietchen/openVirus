<p id="p0065">Humans and pathogens have always been in a dynamic state of interaction; however, current trends reveal that this relationship has become unbalanced as human activities are causing pathogens to appear and spread at an increasingly alarming rate. As aforementioned, the 21st Century has seen a rise in infectious disease, largely due to the societal and global trends that are reinforced by an increasingly technological, globalized, and interconnected world. Between 1994 and 2004, 335 infectious diseases, such as Tuberculosis, SARS, and H1N1, emerged or reemerged in both the developed and developing world. These diseases caused the death of an estimated 17 million people per year, with 41% of these deaths occurring in the concentrated region of South-East Asia and the SARS outbreak in China affecting 32 other countries. By the end of April 2019, a Measles outbreak in the United States affected 704 people, 71% of whom were unvaccinated. Similarly, in the European Region, the WHO reported a total of 83,540 Measles cases by March 2019, with 74 related deaths in the preceding year. Additionally, the world is still battling with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Ebola, H1N1, and dengue fever.</p>
