<p id="p0090">EIDs have been posited by researchers to persist as a global health concern for the next couple of decades particularly in poor and under-resourced settings in the Global South. However, efforts at the global level yield the potential to address incidences of EIDs. In line with these objectives, there have been proposed strategies to address current trends of EIDs. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), created in 2015, identified infectious diseases as a priority area for health policy; SDG 3.3 set out to end numerous infectious disease epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS and Malaria by 2030. The SDGs posit that through increased surveillance and allocating more resources and funding to this health issue, diagnostic and treatment programs will be improved, and the epidemic of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases will once again begin to decline.</p>
