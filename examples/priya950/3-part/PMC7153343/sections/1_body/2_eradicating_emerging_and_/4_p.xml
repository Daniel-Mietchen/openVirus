<p id="p0105">Particularly for EIDs that are asymptomatic, providing access to testing and screening services is desirable to obtain an early warning and to devise a response to outbreaks. This is largely dependent on available resources at the locale by way of laboratory or clinical technology that will be most effective in the timely detection of new incidences of EIDs. For instance, only 9% of people with Viral Hepatitis have been diagnosed due to limited access to testing services. Given that a large percentage of EIDs are concentrated in countries where governments are under-resourced in responding to outbreaks, well-equipped testing and screening facilities for the public at risk are needed. Currently in low-income settings where health infrastructure is under-developed, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have emerged with the potential for inexpensive, effective, and timely diagnoses of infectious diseases. This also calls for the development and deployment of diagnostic techniques that are suitable for specific regions or geographies.</p>
