<p id="p0110">In view of the disproportionate global burden of infectious diseases where some regions are more prone relative to others, a key consideration in eradicating EIDs may be the reallocation of resources, including expertise and clinical technology to areas that are most impacted. Currently, areas least affected by EIDs receive a higher allocation and concentration of resources to respond to outbreaks. In this regard, in the context of developing countries, HBV, HIV, and Ebola have persisted largely due to the absence of funding to secure vaccines and treatment for populations at heightened risk of infection. This is in sharp contrast to the context of the Global North where EIDs are less prevalent but have control of global resources in eradicating infectious diseases.</p>
