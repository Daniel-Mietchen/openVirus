 <p>The history of these diseases includes widespread illness and high mortality rates affecting populations on a global scale. The history of infectious diseases goes back as far as Smallpox being found on Egyptian mummies and the Plague infecting and killing 20â€“45% of the world's population in the 14th Century. However, by the end of the 1960s, most infectious diseases were considered a health issue of the past. With improved public health measures including sanitation processes and sewage treatments, as well as improved healthcare services and the introduction of antibiotics and vaccination protocols, the prevalence of infectious diseases appeared to be declining. As a result, health care professionals and researchers turned their attention and available resources toward the rising issue of chronic disease. Yet, during the last quarter of the 20th Century, infectious diseases began to reemerge with new and resurgent diseases cited as causes of morbidity and mortality for large populations. Since this time, infectious disease rates have continued to rise, new diseases have emerged, and previously eradicated diseases have reemerged. The emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases has mostly been attributed to the unintentional consequences of human behavior, activities, and development.</p>
