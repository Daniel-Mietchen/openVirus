 <p>Vector-borne infectious diseases are spread between humans and animals by vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. These diseases, including Malaria and Lyme disease, impact specific geographic regions. Tropical and subtropical areas are disproportionately affected, and the poorest and most vulnerable tend to face the highest burden of these diseases.</p>
