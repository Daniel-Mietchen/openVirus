<p>The common residues of the epitopes and HBGA-binding sites of the P domain were annotated. Estimation of diversifying and purifying selection sites for the aligned VP1 sequences was performed using Datamonkey. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were calculated for each codon of VP1 using the mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) and fast unbiased Bayesian approximation (FUBAR). The significance level was set at 0.05.</p>
