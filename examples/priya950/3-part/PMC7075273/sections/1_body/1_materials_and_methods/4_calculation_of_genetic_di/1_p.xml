<p>All of the reads from each high-throughput sequencing sample were mapped to the P domain of the reference norovirus genome (accession no. MH229940) using Geneious (v.6.1.4). Diversity was quantified as the mean genetic distance calculated for all pairs of nt sequences using MEGA software (v.4.1). The rates of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) were calculated using the method of Nei and Gojobori with the Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple substitutions, using MEGA software (v.4.1). The dN/dS ratio is an indicator of the strength of the positive (&gt;1) or negative (&lt;1) selection pressure on a quasispecies.</p>
