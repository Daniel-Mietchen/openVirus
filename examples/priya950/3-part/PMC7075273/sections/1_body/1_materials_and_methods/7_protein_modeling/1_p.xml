<p>Homodimeric P-domain capsid models were constructed for syh1, syh2, and syh3 using Phyre
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref>
 </sup> based on the template of NV GII.4 strain VA387 (c2obtA). The aa differences in the antigenic and HBGA-binding sites among syh1, syh2, syh3, and VA387 were plotted onto P-domain homology models to illustrate sequence variations.
