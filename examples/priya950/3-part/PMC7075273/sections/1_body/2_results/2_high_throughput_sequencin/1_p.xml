<p>The three NV-positive samples from the patient were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. A total of 67,770,700 reads was obtained. For syh1, 20,608 of 62,768 viral reads (32.8%) were identified as NV sequences, for syh2, 9057 of 76,531 viral reads (11.8%) were identified as NV sequences, while for syh3, 2372 of 82,009 viral reads (2.89%) were identified as NV sequences. Interestingly, herpesviruses were found in the syh1, syh2 and syh3, with 67, 276 and 63 reads, respectively, suggesting that herpesviruses may persistently exist in the host. Sample syh1 yielded a near full-length NV sequence and called 92.1% of the reference genome (MG214988.1, Henan, China) with 98.7% nt identity, lacking 480 and 150 bp at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The other two samples failed to yield a complete NV genome sequence (syh2, 79.0%; syh3, 78.8%), but the assembled sequences also showed the highest identities to the Henan strain, which belongs to the NV GII.4 Sydney 2012 cluster.</p>
