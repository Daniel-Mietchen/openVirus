<p>Comparing the sequences of syh1, syh2, and syh3, there were notable aa substitutions in the receptor-binding pocket sites and sites 293, 340, 341, 353, 393, and 395 were under positive selection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Homology models of the three samples were constructed to examine the influence of changes at the receptor-binding pocket sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Most of the region directly below the HBGA pocket remained unchanged; however, site 393â€“396 had marked differences and site 374 had small differences among the three samples.
