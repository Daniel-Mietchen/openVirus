<p>The complete major capsid genes of the three NV-positive samples were amplified. syh1, syh2, and syh3 showed the best hit to the NV GII.4 HNZZ201707 strain (MH229940.1) from Henan, China, with nt identities of 98.34, 97.47, and 96.74%, respectively. The three sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession number 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MN764311-13" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MN764311-13</ext-link>. The deduced VP1 aa sequences of three haplotypes (539 aa in syh1 and syh2, 540 aa in syh3) were aligned and examined for aa changes. There were 29 non-conserved aa positions in the complete VP1 alignment, of which 28 were in the P domain and 18 were within defined epitopes and HBGA-binding sites. When compared with the first sample, there were more aa mutants in the third sample (26 aa differences) than in the second sample (12 aa differences) (

The accumulation rate increased over time in the patient. The highest accumulation rate of point mutations was in the P2 subdomain (15.4 variable sites per 100 nt). The accumulation rate was six-fold greater in the P domain than the S domain, with highest rates of 0.9 and 8.4, respectively (
