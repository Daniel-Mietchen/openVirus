<p>To detect the codons that provide stronger evidence of purifying or diversifying selection, the coding sequences of these haplotypes were examined using Datamonkey. All negative and positive selection happened in the P-domain, negative selection was defined at 2 sites (by at least one of the two methods, black plus sign), while positive selection was defined at 11 sites (by at least one of the two methods, red plus sign) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), among which sites 368 and 404 had the strongest support (positive by both the MEME and FUBAR methods). Five (sites 368, 372, 393, 395, and 404) of the twelve positive selection sites were part of known epitopes A, D, E, and F, while six (sites 293, 340, 341, 353, 393, and 395) were a part of HBGA-binding sites. Positive sites 309, 374, and 411 in the P domain were not part of any epitope sites or HBGA-binding regions.
