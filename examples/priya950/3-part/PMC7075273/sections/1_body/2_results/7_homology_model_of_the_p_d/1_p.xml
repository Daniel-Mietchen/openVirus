<p>A structure of the NV VA387 P domain has been generated and used to locate within-host aa changes in the three samples (syh1, syh2, and syh3) to study the effect of within-host evolution. The aa positions of the major blockade epitopes (A, D, E, and F) for GII.4 were plotted onto P-domain homology models for the patient over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The spatial conformation of the P1 domain remained unchanged, but there were many differences in the P2 domain among syh1, syh2, and syh3. Compared with the conformation difference between syh2 and syh1, the difference between syh3 and syh1 was greater, especially in the major epitope sites and their adjacent regions. Because there was no aa mutation in epitopes E and F among the three samples, there was little difference in the spatial conformation between these two epitopes, but there was an obvious conformation difference in the region near epitope E. Because of the aa change in epitope D, the spatial conformation was different in the three samples. Epitope A was the most variable, and that of syh3 showed marked differences in spatial conformation compared to syh1 and syh2.
