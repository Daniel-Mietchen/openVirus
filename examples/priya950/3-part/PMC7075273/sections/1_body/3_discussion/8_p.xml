<p>Overall, our data showed that GII.4 NV can cause prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients, and the immunodeficient NV RNA population in the host with positively selected antigenic and HBGA sites suggested immunocompromised patients to be potential reservoirs for novel NV strains that escape herd immunity. Because of the typically prolonged hospitalization and lack of management after discharge from hospital of immunocompromised patients, there is a marked risk of direct or indirect contact with other susceptible patients and even healthy individuals. Further study is needed to characterize the infectious capacity of NV variants in the study population.</p>
