<p>The number of mutations in the three samples increased over time, and the mutation rate was not equally distributed throughout the gene. It was markedly greater in the P region than in other regions, especially the P2 subdomain, which includes antibody blockade epitopes and HBGA-binding sites. Several aas in the sites are under strong positive selection pressure. Of the 12 positive selection sites, 9 were located at HBGA-binding or antigenic sites. As reported previously, this can result in the generation of new epidemic NV variants (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lindesmith et al., 2013</xref>). Six sites under positive selection were located in HBGA-binding sites, of which residue 293 might influence epitope A structure as it was in the 8 Å expanded area (

Overall, the conformation of HBGA-binding sites showed little change among the three samples; however, a significant difference at 393–396 was observed. Sites 343–347, 374, and 442–443 represent eight conserved aas that constitute the GII conventional HBGA-binding interface (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>); however, sites 346 and 374 were mutated in syh3, which slightly altered the conformation. These results suggested that capsids of chronically infecting NVs interact with HBGAs differently than epidemic GII.4 NVs.
