<p>Epitope A is a known major blockade epitope, consisting of aa residues 294, 296, 297, 298, 368, and 372, of which 296 was reportedly completely conserved during intra-host NV evolution (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bull et al., 2012</xref>), and was conserved (Ser296) in the samples in this study. While sites 368 and 372 in epitope A were under strong positive selection, in particular, site 368 differed among the three samples. As reported previously, changes at 12 sites in the P2 region might contribute to an escape phenotype, among which sites 368 and 372 play direct roles in variation (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lindesmith et al., 2012a</xref>). In this study, the conformation of epitope A in syh3 was markedly different from those in syh1 and syh2, indicating the future appearance of a new phenotype(s).
