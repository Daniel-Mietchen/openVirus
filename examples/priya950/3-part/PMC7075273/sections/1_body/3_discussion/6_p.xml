<p>Sites 393 and 395 of epitope D and site 404 of epitope F were also under positive selection. Epitope D is an evolving blockade epitope and residues 393 and 395 can directly impact Lewis HBGA binding of GII.4 strains (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Shanker et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lindesmith et al., 2013</xref>), so mutation of sites 393 and 395 may change viral binding characteristics. The other sites in epitopes D and F were conserved in the present study. Mouse monoclonal antibodies have confirmed epitope E to be GII.4 2002 Farmington Hills-specific blockade epitope (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lindesmith et al., 2012b</xref>). In this study, all common residues of epitope E were conserved in the evolving haplotypes, indicating that changes in other aas lead to changes in the spatial structure of the adjacent region of epitope E, and so the antigenicity in this region is not affected.
