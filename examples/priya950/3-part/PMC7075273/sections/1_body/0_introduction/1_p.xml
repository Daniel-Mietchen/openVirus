<p>Noroviruses (NVs) are the leading pathogens necessitating community and outpatient visits for acute gastroenteritis (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2012</xref>), and are the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, causing approximately half of all such outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 2009</xref>). Although NV infections typically result in acute and self-limiting gastroenteritis, young children, the elderly people and immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to more severe and prolonged infections. In particular, immuno-incompetent and transplant patients can be chronically infected with NVs. NVs are small, non-enveloped viruses with a genome of 7500 nucleotides (nt) of single positive-stranded RNA. The genome is organized into three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is translated as a polyprotein that is cleaved into six non-structural proteins, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid protein (VP1) and minor capsid protein (VP2), respectively.
