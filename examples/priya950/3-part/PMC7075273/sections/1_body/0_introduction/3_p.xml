<p>The highly heterogeneous NVs are subdivided into ten genogroups (GI–GX), among which GI, GII, GIV, and GIX are associated with human diseases (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chhabra et al., 2019</xref>). GII.4 is the primary genotype responsible for global epidemics and 60–80% of outbreaks worldwide, with new variants emerging every 2 to 3 years (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>); GII.4 has a faster mutation rate and evolution rate than other NVs (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bull et al., 2010</xref>). New epidemic and pandemic GII.4 variants appear and generally spread rapidly through populations and across continents. It appears that low cross-protection by specific anti-NV humoral immune responses play a major role in NV epidemics and pandemics (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Debbink et al., 2013</xref>). It has been hypothesized that immunocompromised patients might be reservoirs where new NV variants emerge (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Karst and Baric, 2015</xref>). Special attention should be paid to this population because of the extended nature of NV chronic infections and the reduced immuno pressure restricting viral mutation.
