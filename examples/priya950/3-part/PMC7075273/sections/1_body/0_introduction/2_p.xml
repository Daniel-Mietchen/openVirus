<p>The NV capsid is formed from 90 VP1 dimers, each of which comprised a shell (S) domain and a protruding (P) domain. The P domain is further divided into the P1 and P2 subdomains. Compared with the S domain and the P1 subdomain, the P2 subdomain exhibits the most variable sequences, and the surface-exposed region contains the antigenic and histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding sites and is characterized by a high mutation frequency (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Schroten et al., 2016</xref>). NVs recognize as receptors HBGAs, which are complex carbohydrates present on red blood cells and the mucosal epithelium or as free antigens in biological fluids. The recognition of HBGAs by NVs is strain specific. Different residues in the P region may evolve in the recognition of different NV GII.4 strains.
