  <p>Within-host aa changes of VP1 blockade epitope A, D, E, and F among the three samples. Red, epitope A; green, epitope D; purple, epitope E; and orange, epitope F. The spatial conformation of the P1 domain was unchanged, but epitopes A and D and their adjacent areas in the P2 domain were markedly different among syh1, syh2, and syh3.</p>
