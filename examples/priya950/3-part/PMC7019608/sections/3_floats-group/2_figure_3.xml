  <p>Encephalitis viruses in equines. Transmission mode (direct transmission in (
   <bold>a</bold>) or arthropod-borne transmission in (
   <bold>b</bold>)), zoonotic potential (zoonotic viruses are marked with an asterisk) and geographical distribution (Af for Africa, Am for America, As for Asia, E for Europe, ME for Middle East, O for Oceania and G for global) are presented. EHV-1: Equid alphaherpesvirus 1; BoDV: Borna disease virus; VEEV: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Black arrows represent established virus transmission between the two partners. Doted arrows indicate limited virus transmission possibility from the infected horse to its reservoir, with the exception of midge-borne arboviruses and of the mosquito borne VEEV epizootic variants for which horses serve as amplifier hosts. The figure was prepared on BioRender [
