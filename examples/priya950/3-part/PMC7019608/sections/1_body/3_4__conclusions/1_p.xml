<p>Many neurological diseases represent an important sanitary and economic threat to the horse population worldwide. Non-vector-borne equine encephalitis viruses, such as EHV-1, rabies and BoDV, are variably reported in Europe, whereas arthropod-borne infections are usually exotic diseases. Viral encephalitis therapeutic strategies are comparable, whatever the etiologic virus. Horses with neurological conditions must be isolated in a quiet box with limited stimuli (noise, light) and an appropriate bedding providing warmth, comfort, and security. Slings can be used to support paretic horses and avoid long and poor prognosis recumbency (

The use of DMSO (0.4–0.9 g/kg for 5–6 days) has been advocated on the basis of its free radical scavenging properties but its efficacy has not been evaluated scientifically [

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to control pyrexia, inflammation and discomfort, while short-term use of glucocorticoids may be beneficial; glucocorticoids proved to be valuable in some EHM horses and it is hypothesized that the treatment reduces the supposed immune-mediated EHV-1 pathogenesis [

Vaccination is controversial in the face of outbreaks and in particular inactivated vaccines take too long to generate immune responses capable to limit disease spread when outbreaks are seasonal (WNV, other vector-borne viruses in temperate areas).
