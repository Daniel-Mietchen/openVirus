<p>Neurological disorders represent an important sanitary and economic threat to the equine industry worldwide. Even mild nervous deficits can result in poor performances and long recovery of athletic horses, while severe clinical signs can induce life-threatening injuries in infected horses and may expose owners, veterinarians and care providers to significant risks [

They indicated that neurological affections accounted as the fifth cause of death (8%) in adult horses, behind foaling (24%), digestive (21%), locomotor (21%), and cardiovascular (9%) causes. In two studies performed in Australia and in France, neurological diseases were first attributed to trauma (26% to 34%), congenital malformations (19% to 20%), while inflammation and infection were reported in 6% to 17% of horses with neurological conditions [

Early recognition of neurological infectious diseases may increase the chance of a positive outcome and is key to the implementation of coordinated management measures designed to prevent large-scale outbreaks when highly contagious pathogens, such as equid herpesviruses, are involved. Many neurotropic viruses affecting equines are also significant human pathogens and rapid identification of zoonotic viruses in horses is pivotal in their surveillance and in the control of corresponding human viral diseases [
