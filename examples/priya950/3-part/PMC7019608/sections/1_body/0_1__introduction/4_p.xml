In Europe, many viruses, including two zoonotic viruses, should be recognized promptly: rabies virus is one of the most important global zoonotic pathogen and has been eradicated from Western Europe by successful vaccination campaigns, while West Nile virus is a (re)emerging arthropod-borne virus that has recently spread in Europe to the Balkans area and northern-most countries (Germany) [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. From an economic perspective, Equid herpesviruses (EHV-1 in particular) are one of the most important equine pathogens in Europe [
