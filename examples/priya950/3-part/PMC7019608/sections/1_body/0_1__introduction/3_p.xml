<p>Equine neuropathogenic viruses generally induce encephalitis or myeloencephalitis, which is an inflammation of the central nervous system (cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum) and/or of the spinal cord characterized by large or multifocal infiltrations of mononuclear cells (

Neurological examination, including testing of reflexes, evaluating postures and movements, is key in the clinical approach and allows assessing the course of disease and therefore its prognosis and response to therapeutic options. However, it is worth to note that such neurological examination and scoring is difficult to standardize—even among highly specialized practitioners [

In addition to posture and gait disorders, hyperthermia and sudden clinical signs peaking after 48 h of infection, guide viral encephalitis diagnosis. Usually, high fever is considered as a warming sign even if infectious diseases are not the only reason of hyperthermia and if they are not systematically detected during the horse clinical examination. Indeed, 14% to 38% of West Nile disease diagnosed in Europe and 52% of equid herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) cases evidenced in France had hyperthermia during veterinary examination [

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings will generally be informative of a viral meningo-encephalitis, comprising an increased protein concentration, normal glucose concentration and pleomorphic leucocytosis with predominating mononuclear cells or neutrophils [
