<p>Most equine neuropathogenic viruses will induce similar clinical presentations and laboratory testing, either by indirect (ELISA, seroneutralisation or other serological assays) or direct assays (PCR, virus isolation, staining of viral antigens from infected tissues) must be provided in order to confirm the etiology of the disease (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00023-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the past few years, direct methodologies, especially for EHV-1 detection, have been promoted. However, for most arthropod-borne viruses as well as for Borna disease virus, indirect assays have sustained interest owing to low and short-lasting viremia in infected horses. Serological screenings are also widely used in epidemiological surveys for the surveillance of equine encephalitis worldwide. Since horses can be vaccinated against most equine neuropathogenic viruses (with the notable exceptions of Borna disease and some exotic equine encephalitis viruses) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00023-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the immunization status must be known for the interpretation of the serological tests. In this review, we will present the major virological, clinical and epidemiological features of the main neuropathogenic viruses inducing encephalitis in equids in Europe, namely rabies virus (
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), equid herpesviruses (
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>), Borna disease virus (
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic>) and West Nile virus (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), as well as exotic viruses. The most relevant information on the diagnosis and prevention from equine encephalitis viruses enzootic in Europe will also be presented in this review.
