<p>Pertaining to flavivirus infections, JEV, SLEV and MVEV induce similar clinical presentations to the ones reported with WNV but mainly differ in their case fatality rate and more restricted host and vector ranges, likely contributing to more limited geographical range (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]). Case fatality rates reported for JEV, SLEV and MVEV are 5% to 30%, 3% to 30%, and 15% to 20%, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00023-f008">Figure 8</xref>). JEV and SLEV infections have been unfrequently reported in horses during the last decade, while MVEV equine outbreaks across south-eastern Australia have been identified in 2011 [

However, among these exotic flaviviruses, JEV presented the highest propensity to spread, with transmission evidenced westward to Nepal and Pakistan, as well as eastward in western Pacific regions in the 1990s (Eastern-most territories in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia in 1995 and 1998), subsequent to changes in human activities (deforestation, irrigation, expansion of pig breeding) [

Subsequent to WNV introduction in Northern America in 1999, probable virus competition for avian amplifier hosts likely contributed to initial disappearance of SLEV from the Western United States (1999â€“2014) [
