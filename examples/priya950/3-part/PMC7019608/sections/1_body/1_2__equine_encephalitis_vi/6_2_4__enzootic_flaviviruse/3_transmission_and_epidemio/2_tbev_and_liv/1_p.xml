<p>TBEV is the most important human tick-borne pathogen in Europe and Asia. The estimated annual incidence rate is 10,000 human infections with a case-fatality rate ranging from 1% to 20%. For TBEV, the arthropod vectors are primarily hard ticks and in Europe, the most important tick vector is 
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>. Contrary to mosquitoes, which become infected only if there is sufficient viremia in the vertebrate host, ticks can become infected during a shared meal or “co-feeding”, not requiring a systemic infection of the host [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In fact, adult and immature ticks, as well as larvae and nymphs are attached to their host for several days and can feed together on the same reservoir. Contamination between naïve (uninfected) and infected ticks can occur during this meal. Co-feeding is facilitated by the proximity of ticks and the action of saliva, which allows for the transfer of arboviruses including TBEV [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The main vertebrate reservoir hosts of TBEV are rodents of the genus 
 <italic>Myodes</italic> and 
 <italic>Apodemus</italic> although other small rodents and shrews can contribute to the natural transmission cycle. Larger animals such as sheep, goats and more rarely cattle can be additional competent hosts. Goats, sheep and cows excrete the virus in the milk. Humans, horses and game (deer, wild boar, fox) are epidemiological dead-end hosts. Human infection can occur through a bite from a TBEV- infected tick, more rarely through the ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products from goats and less often from infected cows or sheep [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Hard ticks (
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>) also transmit LIV. The vertebrate reservoir hosts are the wood mouse (
 <italic>Apodemus sylvaticus</italic>), the common shrew (
 <italic>Sorex araneus</italic>), the red grouse (
 <italic>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</italic>) and the sheep (
 <italic>Ovis aries</italic>). A co-feeding mechanism has also been reported for LIV transmission in 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks feeding on mountain hares (
 <italic>Lepus timidus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Sheep develop the disease and the virus could occasionally been detected in a range of other animal species such as goats, dogs, pigs, horses, humans, deer, llamas, alpacas, and mountain hare [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Finally, very uncommon cases of horse infected by TBEV or LIV have been described [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] and a few serological surveys in equids are available in the scientific literature. TBEV seroprevalence rates of 20% to 30% among asymptomatic horses have been reported in Austria and Germany [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] while lower ones have been reported in the Balkans (3% to 5% in Serbia and Slovakia) [
