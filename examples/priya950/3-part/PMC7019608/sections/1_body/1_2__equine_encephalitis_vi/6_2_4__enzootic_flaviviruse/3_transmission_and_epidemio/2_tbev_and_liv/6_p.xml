<p>Diagnosis: The neurological symptoms and lesions are not specific to flavivirus infection, making laboratory tests compulsory to confirm or exclude viral etiology. The diagnosis of flavivirus infection is delicate and relies on the detection of viral RNA in blood and CSF, viral isolation in cell culture and/or the detection of IgM and IgG in serum and CSF. Flavivirus infection (WNV, TBEV, LIV) diagnosis is primarily based on indirect methods. Indeed, viremia of an infected horse is quite low and fleeting and already vanished by the time horses develop neurological signs. It is therefore quite difficult to identify the pathogen by direct diagnostic assays, even with highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays. Serology tests such as ELISA for WNV and TBEV detection and hemagglutination inhibition assay for LIV are fast and allow for the identification of anti-flavivirus antibodies. These tests suffer from poor specificity because of antibody cross-reactions between flaviviruses [

Several serological tests have to be carried out in order to detect a recent infection (IgM ELISA for WNV or an antibody titer kinetics). A virus neutralisation test, with higher diagnostic specificity, practiced in a biological security 3 level laboratory allows the definitive identification of the flavivirus. WNV infection can also be diagnosed by RT-PCR on EDTA-blood samples collected during the first clinical period (marked by hyperthermia only, a few days after mosquito bites and before the neuro-invasive form of the disease) or on cerebrospinal fluid and brain on post-mortem. Samples must be shipped cold or frozen, as WNV is very sensitive to thermal and chemical inactivation.
