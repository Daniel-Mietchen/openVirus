In respect to these limitations, practitioners have turned toward alternative treatments by using antiviral moleculesâ€”even if no marketing authorization are available in horses. In vivo, valaciclovir, which is the prodrug of aciclovir, was tested in experimental EHV-1 infection, but showed no antiviral effects [
