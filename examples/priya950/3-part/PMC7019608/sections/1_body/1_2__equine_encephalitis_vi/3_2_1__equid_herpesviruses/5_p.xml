<p>Pathogenesis and clinical disease: After primary replication in the respiratory tract, EHV-1 disseminates via cell-associated viremia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subsequently infects the endothelial cells of the pregnant uterus or central nervous system, leading in some cases to abortion and/or neurological disorders [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The incubation period of the disease is 6–8 days (before neurological signs become apparent), both in experimentally and in naturally EHV-1-infected horses [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Histologically, the most frequently observed lesion of EHM is vasculitis in the brain and/or spinal cord, leading to brain damages by hypoxia [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Neurological signs of EHM range from temporary ataxia, paresis, loss of sensation around the tail and perineal area and urinary incontinence to complete paralysis and death [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Affected horses may recover completely, while recumbency often leads to a fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The increased interest of researchers in the manifestations of this disease is not only due to the lack of current scientific understanding but also to the associated economic impact [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Infections that cause severe neurological dysfunction may only involve either one or two horses [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or be associated with larger outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Neurological syndromes have also been observed in various environments open to horses: breeding farms, riding schools, racetracks and, more recently—veterinary hospitals. Furthermore, while several breeds and age groups seem to be at a lower risk of developing EHM [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], other factors, including EHV-1 strains, host immunity and still unknown parameters, could explain why experimental EHV-1 infections were frequently partially successful [
