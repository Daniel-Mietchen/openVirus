<p>Highly successful pathogens of horse populations worldwide, Equid herpesviruses induce latent infections that may cause abortions, respiratory (rhinopneumonia), and neurological diseases (myeloencephalopathy). Nine herpesviruses have been described in the family Equidae, which includes horses, ponies, donkeys and zebras and two natural hosts have been identified key for EHV epidemiology: horses for equid herpesviruses 1 (EHV-1), EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-4, and EHV-5 and donkeys for EHV-6, EHV-7, and EHV-8 [

Equid alphaherpesvirus 8 (EHV-8), formerly known as asinine herpesvirus 3, was recently considered as a new threat to the horse industry; it was shown to cause abortion in horses in Ireland and was associated with one neurological case in a donkey in China [
