<p>Pathogenesis and clinical disease: In horses, the typical course of the disease is characterized by an acute encephalitis that develops following an incubation period which lasts up to 3 months [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. During the acute phase, neurological and neuro-behavioural signs vary but may include unusual posture (crossing legs), repetitive movement disturbance, teeth grinding, circle walking, neck stiffness, nystagmus, strabismus, myosis associated with external stimuli such as hyper excitability, aggressivity, lethargy, sleepiness and stupor. Hyperthermia, which may precede neurological signs, is not always noticed during Borna disease. During the final stage, paralysis may appear followed by seizures associated with specific movements named “push to the wall”. Death occurs in 80% to 100% of cases, in 1 to 4 weeks after the onset of clinical signs. In survivors, infection is life-long, and a chronic form of the disease develops with recurrent clinical events such as depression, apathy, somnolence and scared behavior, in particular following stress [

Histopathological examination of infected brains revealed viral antigens mainly in neuronal nuclei and the characteristic Joest-Degen inclusion bodies, accompanied with massive infiltration of inflammatory cells [
