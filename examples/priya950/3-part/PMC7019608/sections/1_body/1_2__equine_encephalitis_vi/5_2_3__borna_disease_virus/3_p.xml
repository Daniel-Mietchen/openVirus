<p>Transmission and epidemiology: BoDV is the causative agent of the Borna disease, a rare but severe, often lethal, encephalitis, which was first described in horses during a devastating outbreak in the little city of Borna in Saxony/Germany around 1894 [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Later, it was reported to infect a large range of animals, including sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, shrews, ostriches, birds, macaques, and several zoo animals, suggesting that its potential host-range includes all warm-blooded animals [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. BoDV infection, based on antibodies, antigen, RNA and virus detection, has been reported from horses and other animals in many countries in several continents, Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia, suggesting a worldwide distribution of the virus (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]). This should, however, be taken cautiously as diagnosis is not always reliable (see Diagnosis section below). Illustrating these difficulties, viral RNA detection outside central Europe, the endemic area in which the highest clinical incidence was consistently found as well as the verified classical Borna diseaseâ€™s cases, has been suspected to be caused by contamination [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Endemic area includes eastern and southern Germany, the eastern part of Switzerland and the area bordering Liechtenstein as well as the most western part of Austria (reviewed in [
