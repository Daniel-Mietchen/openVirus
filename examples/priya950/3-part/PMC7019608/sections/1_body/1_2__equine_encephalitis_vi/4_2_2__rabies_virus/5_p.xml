<p>Pathogenesis and clinical disease: Rabies virus is primarily transmitted to equids through the saliva of an infected animal. Contamination occurs mainly through bites or contact of a cutaneous or mucous (oral, nasal, eye mucosa) lesion with infected saliva. Rabies pathogenesis is characterized by three distinct phases. Phase 1 corresponds to the ascending or centripetal period during which the virus is transported toward the CNS. Phase 1 occurs after the bite of a rabid animal, and after a short-lasting replication in local muscle cells, the virus enters motor and sensory neurons. Paresthesia at the biting site may develop, which results in rubbing or automutilation through biting. Lyssavirus mainly shows axon-neuronal transport by binding with acetylcholine-receptors at motor end plate and multiply at the ventral horn of the spinal cord before CNS spreading [

Phase 2 in horses is characterized by extensive virus replication in the limbic system (including hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and other nearby areas) and the spinal cord [

Phase 3, also called centrifugal phase, is the period where the virus leaves the CNS and infects other organs in the body. Phase 3 is characterized by neuronal transportation of virus into highly vascularized organs, such as the salivary glands, facilitating virus transmission to new hosts and its excretion into the environment.
