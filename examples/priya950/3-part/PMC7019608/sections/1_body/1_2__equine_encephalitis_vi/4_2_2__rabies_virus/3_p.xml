<p>Lyssaviruses are enveloped, bullet-shaped viruses with a single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome of about 12 kb that encodes five viral proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G), and RNA polymerase (L) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00023-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The RNA genome is encapsidated by the N protein, forming the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which is the functional template for transcription and replication.
