<p>Transmission and epidemiology: Rabies cases have been reported across the globe in more than 150 countries [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to recent estimates by the World Health Organization, 55,000 to 60,000 human deaths due to rabies infection are expected to occur every year [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The majority of them occur in developing countries in Asia and Africa, with about 35,000 and 21,000 human cases, respectively, and rabies virus is usually transmitted by free roaming dogs in these areas [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Two major epidemiological cycles are reported, urban canine rabies, now largely confined to developing countries and sylvatic or wildlife rabies which predominates throughout most of Europe and North America [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Animal species involved in rabies virus transmission along sylvatic cycles may vary. In the United States, skunks, raccoons and bats are the wild species most often found rabid, while in Canada, these are foxes and skunks. In Europe, the red foxes and raccoon dogs serve as the main reservoir hosts and red foxes were found to account for 60% of all reported cases in central and western Europe. Bat species involved in rabies virus transmission also differ between countries: in Latin America, vampire bats are an exceptionally devastating source of infection for cattle and equids, while in North America rabid non-hematophagous bats have occasionally transmitted the disease to horses [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Horses are sensitive to both canine and bat rabies strains. Rabies is fairly rare in horses and usually less than 100 cases are reported in the United States every year: horses and mules (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00023-f005">Figure 5</xref>). A large number of rabies cases (172 out of 467 suspected cases) have been reported in donkeys in Sudan over a period of 10 years from 1992 to 2002 [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In Australia, two equine cases also arose recently in 2013, documenting the first occurrence of ABLV in animals other than bats or humans [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In Europe, 233 cases have been reported between 2010 and 2019, mainly in Eastern Europe (Russian Federation (49), Ukraine (41), Turkey (70), Belarus (27), Moldova (9), Romania (17), Georgia (8), Poland (2), Croatia (7), Serbia (1), and Latvia (1)), while for the same period, only one case was reported in Western Europe, in Italy (2010) [
