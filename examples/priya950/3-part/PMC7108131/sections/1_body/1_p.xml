<p>Ebola virus disease constitutes but one of the priority diseases that the World Health Organization (WHO), in their Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, suggests poses a severe public health risk and for which there are insufficient countermeasures [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The purpose of this priority list is to identify high-threat pathogens for which there is a need to prioritize and advance the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Any diagnostics, drugs, or vaccines that are developed as a result of this and other initiatives, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, will need to be fully evaluated in diagnostic evaluation studies or phase II and III clinical trials.
