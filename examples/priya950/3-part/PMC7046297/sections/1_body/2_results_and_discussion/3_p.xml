<p>When comparing the three two strain models to their single-strain counterparts, composites of the mean absolute error (MAE) in Riyadh (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2A</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s023">S23 Table</xref>) suggest that 2-strain models always outperform the single strain versions in predicting the three targets 
 <italic>(</italic>i.e. peak week, peak maximum, and season totals). Averages of MAE for peak week, peak maximum and for season totals are 11.6, 24.83 and 55.62, respectively. This fact reinforces our earlier inference, confirming that there is more than one strain currently active in Riyadh. Among the single-strain models in Riyadh, the model with SAT incidence is found to have a better predictive capacity for the three targets in comparison to the other two single-strain models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s023">S23 Table</xref>). In Macca instead, the single-strain model with SAT incidence provides better predictions of the peak week, the peak maximum and seasontotals in comparison to all the other models (see for instance MAE values in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>; and values obtained for 1-strain and 2-strain models in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>). Conversely, in Madina, both 1-strain and 2-strain models with SAT incidence provide a similar performance in predicting the three targets (e.g. MAE for peak week 16.7 in comparison to 14.5, for peak maximum of 3.33 compared to 3.6 and for season totals of 5.87 against 9.33; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s023">S23</xref> Tables). The latter may likely represent the best choice of models to form the basis of a future early-warning system for MERS-CoV prediction in the region.
