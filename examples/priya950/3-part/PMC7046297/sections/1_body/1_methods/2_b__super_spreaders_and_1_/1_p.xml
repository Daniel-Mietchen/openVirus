<p>Furthermore, we investigated the potential effects of super-spreading events by incorporating an additional compartment for super-spreaders to our 2-strain model. We also consider the effect of variable zoonotic transmission by incorporating dynamics of the camel population into our 2-strain model. Information about the calculation of the epidemiological parameter values for the newly proposed 2-strain models is provided in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>. Data used corresponds to weekly cases of MERS-CoV for the three provinces in Saudi Arabia where most clinical cases for MERS-CoV occurred for the time intervals July, 6
 <sup>th</sup> 2013 till June, 28
 <sup>th</sup> 2016 (Riyadh), April, 7
 <sup>th</sup>2014 till June, 26

 <sup>th</sup>2016 (Madina), respectively (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>. Parameters estimates are obtained by fitting the models to new MERS-CoV hospitalized weekly data[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We also estimated from data itself some unknown initial conditions for the model. Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm is used here to sample the 95% confidence.The goodness of fitsto compare among 2-strain and single strain models were tested by determining the respective AIC and BIC values (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s019">S19 Table</xref>). To further compare among predictive capabilities of these models with regard to those of their single-strain versions, predictions of raw clinical cases were attempted. Albeit some discrepancies exist, fairly accurate results were obtained despite the low numbers and highly stochastic nature of the three datasets and the nearly operational capacity of these models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In fact, near-operational systems usually require a much longer training period than the scarce three years employed here. Differences arising from the comparison of simulated and observed cases may also be due to the fact that we are fitting the 2-strain and single strain models to cumulative MERS-CoV cases, rather than to new cases.
 <sup>.</sup>The procedure for model adjustment is as follows: for approaching near-operational predictions in each province, we followed former initiatives (e.g. on influenza[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and dengue[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) and partitioned the whole clinical cases datasets into two parts. First part was used for calibrating the models and the remaining part (52 weeks) were left aside for out-of-fit prediction. For Riyadh, Macca and Madina prediction periods were, respectively, from weeks 105–156 (7
 <sup>th</sup> June, 2015 - 11
 <sup>th</sup> June, 2016), weeks 65–116 (11
 <sup>th</sup> July, 2015 - 2
 <sup>nd</sup> July, 2016), and weeks 63–114 (11
 <sup>th</sup> July, 2015 - 2
 <sup>nd</sup> July, 2016)(

 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] namely: (a) peak week: the week during which the maximum number of clinical cases occurred in a season (comprising 52 weeks); (b) peak maximum: the number of cases occurring at the peak week, and (c) season totals: the total number of cases in the entire season. Prediction for each target variable was made every 4 weeks (i.e. week 0, 4, 8, …, 48), with week 0 corresponding to the first week of the prediction interval. In the case of predictions for week

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g004">Fig 4</xref>), highlighting the complexity of the epidemiological situation, particularly in Riyadh. There, where at least there were two strains co-circulating, M2 stands up clearly as the best model function (see bottom panel in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g004">Fig 4</xref>), in comparison with Macca and Madina, with only one strain (
