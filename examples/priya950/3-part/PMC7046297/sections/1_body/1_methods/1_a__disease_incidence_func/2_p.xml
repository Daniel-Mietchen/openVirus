 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g002">Fig 2</xref> represents the BL force of infection. Here, as the number of infected individuals increases the disease transmission also increases linearly. The bottom-left panel represents the NM incidence function. Biologically this incidence function can account for “psychological effects” [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the presence of psychological effects, initially the disease transmission rate increases rapidly when the number of infected individuals is small. However, this rate falls also rapidly in the presence of a large number of infected persons in the community. As in the case of MERS-CoV infections the CFR is about 40%, psychological effects for this infection represents the effect in the community of fear of becoming infected. This fear effect reduces the transmission rate rapidly in the presence of a high number of infections in the community. The bottom-right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g002">Fig 2</xref> represents the SAT incidence function. Biologically this incidence function represents the crowding effect in disease transmission. This crowding effect explains how the number of new infections becomes constant as the number of infected individual increases. This effect is known to reproduce the awareness effect of the disease during the course of an epidemic.
