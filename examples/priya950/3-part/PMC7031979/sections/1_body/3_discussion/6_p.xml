<p id="Par47">Our results showed the highest frequency of infected NHPs in MG and ES, followed by BA and RJ. The prevalence of epidemiological-marker NHPs in MG and ES is consistent with human case reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This reflects the utility and the contribution of a NHPs epizootic surveillance system to provide early warning of disease outbreaks or the prevalence of the disease in affected areas or subgroups of animals. Two studies have described the epidemic scenario in two affected states, ES [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Bahia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, none have assessed the differences prevalence between the most affected NHP genera and the differences in Cqs among them. In 2018, the positive primates were detected in the metropolitan region of RJ to the south, which is different from 2017, where the concentration was higher in the north and center of the metropolitan region. Only one primate has been confirmed in ES.
