<p id="Par42">In the present study, howler monkeys (genus 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic>) and marmosets (genus 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>) were the most frequently infected NHPs. Few cases were encountered in species of the genera 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic>. Lion tamarins (genus 
 <italic>Leontopithecus</italic>) were mostly under active surveillance, and only one animal positive for YFV infection was detected in 2018. These results are consistent with previous findings and confirm that species of 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> are more susceptible to the disease than 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ateles</italic> and 
 <italic>Saimiri</italic> species in this area [
