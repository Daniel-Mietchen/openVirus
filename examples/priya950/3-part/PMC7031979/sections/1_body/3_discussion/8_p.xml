<p id="Par49">We observed that approximately 10% of the NHPs were from specimens not identified to the genus level. Of the unidentified animals, more than 60% showed a positive result for YFV. Together with the fact that significant viral load differences were indirectly detected among NHP distinct genera, these observations reinforce the need for genus identification to improve the correlation data between viral load 
 <italic>versus</italic> genus and to clarify the role of the different genera of NHPs in the transmission and maintenance of YF. The difficulty of retrieving more information about animals is a limitation of the present study. The notification reports sent with the samples were missing important information, such as genus, sex and age, shown to be especially relevant in this study. One of the possibilities beyond the intensification of surveillance actions is to establish the best collection of data and information. Protocols for the genomic identification of animals that do not have a completed form in the future can also be established.
