<p id="Par46">Although East and Central Africa regions experienced a resurgence of YF outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], there are no reports of epizootics as observed in the Americas. The probable reason is that African monkeys are more resistant to the virus and hardly die from infection but rather become immune [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Despite reports of YF outbreaks in the Americas, data on NHP species are scarce in countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru and Suriname [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Only a few molecular epidemiological studies in Peru [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Trinidad [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] have been reported. This poses a difficulty for the comparison of our findings with those from other Latin American countries.
