<p id="Par39">NHP genus classification data were obtained from epidemiological records that accompanied the samples. Out of the 2099 NHPs analyzed, 1505 (71.7%) were 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> spp. with 140 (9.3%) positive, 76 (3.6%) were 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp. with 43 (56.6%) positive, 38 (1.8%) were 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic> spp. with 8 (21%) positive, 5 (0.2%) were 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> spp. with 5 (100%) positive, 24 (1.1%) were 
 <italic>Leontopithecus</italic> spp. with 1 (4.2%) positive, and 448 (21.3%) were from NHPs unidentified to the genus level with 62 (13.8%) positive (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The genus was not determined for many animal samples because the data were not recorded by local surveillance. The samples sent by zoological gardens with identification of the affected species comprised 
 <italic>Aotus</italic> spp., (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1); 
 <italic>Papio hamadryas</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1); and 
 <italic>Papio anubis</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1). ES, BA, and RJ had higher frequencies of samples from NHPs of the genus 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>.
