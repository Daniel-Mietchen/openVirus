<p id="Par35">Negative controls were included in all steps of processing the samples to monitor for possible cross-contamination. To check the RNA isolation efficiency, we used RNase P as an endogenous positive control. The extracted RNA was subjected to TaqMan rtRT-PCR as described by Domingo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which targets the highly conserved 5’ noncoding region (5’ NC). The threshold cycle value Cq was employed as an indirect measure to assess the viral load and discriminate positive samples from negatives. Samples with a Cq value ≤ 37 were considered positive.
