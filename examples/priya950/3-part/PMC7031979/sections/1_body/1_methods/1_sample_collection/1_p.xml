<p id="Par33">NHP specimens were analyzed within the YF surveillance programme at the Flavivirus Laboratory (LABFLA) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. This laboratory is a Brazilian Ministry of Health Regional Reference Laboratory for arboviruses. Diagnostic assays were performed on tissue fragments from NHPs (liver, kidney, brain tissue and whole blood when available) that had been found dead in states in north-eastern (Bahia) and south-eastern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo and Minas Gerais). Samples from Minas Gerais were sent only until March 2017. The eligibility criteria for YF detection were that frozen fresh samples were available and accompanied by a notification report from the Ministry of Health (unfortunately, due to the urgency of the surveillance, we could not exclude the notification forms that did not describe the genus of NHPs).</p>
