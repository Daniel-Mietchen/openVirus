<p id="p0100">Several systems are already in use in health care. But there is far more to develop to benefit significantly from the amount of available data. Progress has been fairly slow in general and mostly due to the fragmentation or nonexistence of data repositories. The contribution of major players in the field of technology (including the GAFA) may help fasten this process. Recently Catalia Health developed a humanoid robot named Mabu, a personal health-care assistant for patients suffering from congestive heart failure. Beside doing an accurate follow-up of medication compliance, it supports an adaptive conversation with the patients regarding the overall health status. Such systematic follow-up in intensive care unit, however, combining conversation with the medical personnel should enable them to better track and reduce the transmission of infections (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The University of Iowa Hospitals &amp; Clinics have used machine learning to reduce surgical site infections by 74% over the past 3 years. Using DASH analytics systems, the hospitals is using the high-definition care platform (HDCP), which integrates with the hospital’s electronic health records to assess the risk for individual patients. Focusing on surgery-derived infections, the system uses the WHO surgical safety checklist. The checklist comprises three phases of the surgery: (1) before the induction of anesthesia, (2) before the first incision of the skin, and (3) before the patient leaves the operating room. This should ensure the correct care protocol has been followed. Once this data and that from the existing electronic health records is collected the DASH system inputs it all into a prediction model and identified potential risks. This enables us to provide costly treatments only to patients who need them. This is a precision medicine approach. In another hospital, a new algorithm could predict a patient’s risk of contracting 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, a life-threatening nosocomial infection. Every year in the United States, &gt; 400,000 people contract a 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection following hospitalization and about 30,000 of them will die because of the infection. Medical doctors and computer scientist from the Massachusetts General Hospital worked together to use AI for prediction. Using a dataset from &gt; 300,000 patients admitted and the knowledge that 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> spreads through physical contacts, every possible interaction between patients was taken into account when developing the algorithm. Another tool developed by Royal Phillips (Connected Care) enables to reduce by 87% the time for identification of nosocomial infection in hospitals, suggesting that wider utilization of such application could significantly reduce hospital-acquired morbidity and mortality.
