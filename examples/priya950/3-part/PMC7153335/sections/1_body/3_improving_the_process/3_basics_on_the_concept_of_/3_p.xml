<p id="p0085">Very often, a single observation is from various sets of numerical data. Additionally, rare events are often associated. Recently it was understood that dependency of extreme values could be viewed under the copulas. In statistics, a copula is a multivariate probability distribution for which the marginal probability distribution of each variable is uniform. They describe the dependence between random variables and have already been used in neurosciences (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Eban et al., 2013</xref>). The copula of a random vector (
 <italic>U</italic>,  
 <italic>V</italic>) is defined by 
 <italic>C</italic>(
 <italic>u</italic>,  
 <italic>v</italic>) as the joint cumulative distribution function: ℙ(
 <italic>U</italic>  ≤  
 <italic>x</italic>,  
 <italic>V</italic>  ≤  
 <italic>y</italic>) =  
 <italic>C</italic>(ℙ(
 <italic>U</italic>  ≤  
 <italic>x</italic>), ℙ(
 <italic>V</italic>  ≤  
 <italic>y</italic>)). Many of the existing methods should integrate the notion of copulas in order to solve problems related to high-dimensional statistics and this is extended to deep and machine learning (
