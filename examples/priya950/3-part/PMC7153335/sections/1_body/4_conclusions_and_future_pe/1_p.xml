<p id="p0105">The utilization of AI and ML are very promising as shown with examples discussed in this chapter. There are a few issues for the full integration of AI in our daily health-care lives. How are regulatory institutions such as the Food and Drug Administration (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Harrington and Johnson, 2018</xref>) going to help AI integration? Guidelines will need to be developed and implemented. This raises another important question: how can we harmonize AI approaches across institution? The Hippocratic oath refers to equity in treatment and the aim to deliver the best treatment with the best of existing knowledge. Harmonizing the integration of AI (

While access to medication is still a (financial) limitation in developing countries, the use of AI to break transmission may become the best long-term affordable strategy. Risk analysis will also depend on how we are able to integrate and verify the quality of input data, especially based on IoT. All this will be for a global benefit (
