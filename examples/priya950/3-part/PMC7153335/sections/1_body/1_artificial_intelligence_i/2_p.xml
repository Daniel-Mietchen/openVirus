<p id="p0030">Detection of weak signals enables the early identification of trends before they become significant and important. This is highly used in the field of cybersecurity. Translated to health care, this would mean identifying a signature in few individuals or a cluster of individuals and predicting the clinical trajectory of the rest of the population. Various sets of data have been elegantly used to predict infectious diseases epidemics. The problem with infectious diseases, as introduced above is their unpredictability as well as the multiple factors that affect the process of infection and transmission. AI is the form of computing that allows machines to act or react to input, similar to the way humans do, by performing cognitive functions. On the contrary, traditional computing also react to data but the output has been necessarily hand coded to react that way. There is no cognitive function performed, as such the independent intelligence is missing. If an unexpected situation is encountered, traditional computing cannot react. In short, AI platforms are constantly adapting their behavior to changes and modify their reactions accordingly. In an AI approach machines are designed to analyze, interpret, and solve a problem. In one of its leading application, machine learning, the computer learns once how to act or react to a certain result and knows in the future to act in the same way.</p>
