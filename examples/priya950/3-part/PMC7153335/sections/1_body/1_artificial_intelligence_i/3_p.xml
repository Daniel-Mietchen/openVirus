<p id="p0035">Recent reports have shown the added value of machine learning for image processing where classical tools could not identify early signs of diseases (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Asch, 2017</xref>). This is particularly true for cancer (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Boon et al., 2018</xref>) which diagnosis and treatment are often assisted by AI approaches. Even in developing countries where the resources, health-care cost, and other limitations prevent from providing optimal care, this is applicable. A group has recently shown the possibility to develop a low-cost point of care for lymphoma diagnosis based on basic imaging and deep learning (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Im et al., 2018</xref>). Several reports suggested the use of Bayesian network (BN) for representing statistical dependencies (
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). A BN is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Belle et al., 2013</xref>). In the era of systems biology and personalized medicine, the development of appropriate analytical is growing. A new class of data, often referred to as recreational data, will become more and more relevant in the context of health care: Internet of things (IoT). The IoT is a growing network of devices and objects that we use in our daily life and that can collect information. Smartphones with their numerous applications and wearables are the typical example of devices that generate continuous streams of data and this can be used to better understand our lifestyle. It is estimated that &gt;Â 7 billion connected things are currently in use worldwide and making use of this would magnify the possibilities to improve our life. Such datasets and classical health-care datasets are being used to better understand infectious diseases, the mechanisms of infections, resistance to treatment, transmission as well as to improve vaccine designs (
