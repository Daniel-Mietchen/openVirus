<p id="p0015">Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. The diseases can be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

The spread of infectious diseases varies from microorganisms to microorganisms. For instance, certain viruses such as HIV are only transmitted upon close physical contacts (sexual transmission or blood contact) while influenza virus infection is transmitted by emitted droplets following sneezing, coughing, or speaking, within few meters of distance. Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease when transmitted to humans.
