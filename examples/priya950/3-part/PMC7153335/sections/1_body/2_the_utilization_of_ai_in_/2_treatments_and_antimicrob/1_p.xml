<p id="p0060">Despite a good ability to diagnose malaria and probably with improved diagnosis in the near future, there is a strong problematic with antibacterial and antiparasitic drugs: resistance (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Blasco et al., 2017</xref>). The adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapies 20 years ago is now being challenged by the emergence of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria parasites with decreased susceptibility to artemisinin-based combination therapies. Mathematical modeling using intrahost parasite stage-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships predicted that ART resistance was a result of ring stages becoming refractory to drug action (
 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Saralamba et al., 2011</xref>). Antibiotic resistance can be better tackled with the existence of databases (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2017</xref>) reflecting this phenomenon. The comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) contains high-quality reference data on the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca" id="ir0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca</ext-link>). CARD is ontologically structured, model centric, and spans the breadth of antimicrobial resistance drug classes and mechanisms. The database is an interconnected and hierarchical structure allowing optimized data sharing and organization. This highlights the importance of the right architecture for the database (big data architecture). Recent studies have also shown the use of machine learning in effectively identifying the potential antimicrobial capacity of candidate compounds (
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In a more systematic way, Ekins et al. have used a series of machine learning approaches to predict responsiveness to tuberculosis infection in mice (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Ekins et al., 2016</xref>). This includes Laplacian-corrected naïve Bayesian classifier models and SVM models using Discovery Studio 4.1. Computational models were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation, in which each sample was left out one at a time, a model was built using the remaining samples, and that model was utilized to predict the left-out sample. As in many studies the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots and the areas under the cross-validated ROC curves are useful validation tools. Bayesian model with SVM, recursive partitioning forest (RP forest), and RP single tree models were compared. For each tree, a bootstrap sample of the original data is taken, and this sample is used to grow the tree. A bootstrap sample is a data set of the same total size as the original one, but a subset of the data records can be included multiple times. Their data clearly suggest that Bayesian models constructed with data generated by different laboratories in various mouse models can have predictive value and can be used in conjunction with other datasets for the selection of the most-fit antimicrobial compound. The same mathematical approaches can be performed either on a very specific target for potential drugs (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Djaout et al., 2016</xref>) or for a more systematic analysis such as performed for the known inhibitors of fructose bisphosphate aldolase, an enzyme central to the glycolysis pathway in 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, in short, an essential player in the bacteria metabolism (
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2016</xref>). Naïve Bayes, random forest, and C4.5 J48 algorithms were used with an approach to improve models by avoiding over fitting and generating faster and cost-effective models. Overall, this and previous studies (
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Zhanga and Amin, 2016</xref>) suggest that machine learning provides good accuracy confirming other studies validating in silico methods to be used for screening of large datasets to identify potential antiinfectious candidates. In line with this, Shen et al. have clearly shown how treatments can be assisted using mathematical models (
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Shen et al. proposed a decision support system can propose an antibiotic therapy adapted to the patient based on factors such as the body temperature, infection sites, symptoms/signs, complications, antibacterial spectrum, and even contraindications and drug-drug interactions. This was possible thanks to the impressive array of data used to construct the model: “the ontology contains 1,267,004 classes, 7,608,725 axioms, and 1,266,993 members of “SubClassOf” that pertain to infectious diseases, bacteria, syndromes, anti-bacterial drugs and other relevant components. The system includes 507 infectious diseases and their therapy methods in combination with 332 different infection sites, 936 relevant symptoms of the digestive, reproductive, neurological and other systems, 371 types of complications, 838,407 types of bacteria, 341 types of antibiotics, 1504 pairs of reaction rates (antibacterial spectrum) between antibiotics and bacteria, 431 pairs of drug interaction relationships and 86 pairs of antibiotic-specific population contraindicated relationships.” Another study has developed models in order to reduce the utilization of antibiotics. Infants can experience symptoms that are cause by pathogens (sepsis) or by noninfectious agents: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). As it is difficult to have a clear diagnosis rapidly using classical laboratory tests, it was shown that applying a random forest approach could identify the best set of predictors out of laboratory variables measured at onset (
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lamping et al., 2018</xref>). Beside antibiotics, antibodies are very effective in protecting against viral infection. The basis of vaccination is to mount an effective memory response when the vaccine will encounter the virus later. This happens via the production of antibodies that play a role in blocking the replication of the virus. Studies have shown that the use of machine learning was very important to identify best candidate vaccines (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Using unsupervised learning as well as unsupervised learning: (i) penalized LR: LR incorporating into the model a lasso penalty term 
 <italic>λ</italic>  ||
 <italic> β</italic>  ||
 <sub>1</sub>, (ii) regularized random forest: DT-based method that generates multiple DTs over bootstrap replicates of the data, and (iii) SVM: kernel-based nonlinear classifier that finds a separating hyperplane between the classes to minimize the risk of classification error, Choi et al. model associations between antibody features and immune functions. The antibody features can predict qualitative and quantitative functional outcomes which provide with a novel and objective approach to assess immune correlates to antibody features. All the aspects of response to treatment depend on an essential parameter: compliance. There are very few systems to verify adherence to infection-related treatments in a large-scale manner. In the case of the HIV, a way to follow the evolution of the infection is to test the blood level of HIV RNA. This is very efficient to adjust the therapy but rarely affordable in poor resources settings. As the evolution of HIV infectivity highly depend on the antiretroviral therapy (
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2008</xref>), it becomes important to ensure the therapy is taken appropriately and that viral loads are not affected because of loose adherence to treatments. In populations at risk for virological failure, the implementation of a sensitive approach may enable us to detect individuals with irregular therapy adherence and help improve their health status, reduce costs of repetitive testing, and raise awareness on necessity to adhere to therapy regimens. The self-reported and questionnaire type data is usually of low sensitivity (50% or less). One way to better track adherence to antiretroviral therapy is by analyzing data from pharmacy. The classification of failure to comply with medication regimen was significantly better with pharmacy refill data than with self-reported data (
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bisson et al., 2008</xref>). This has been the focus of a recent study (
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>) in which adherence was followed by a monitoring system that provides the highest quality of data compared with self-reported, pharmacy data, or others. The device is a cap that fits on standard medicine bottles and records the time and date each time the bottle is opened and closed. The aim was to improve accuracy of data in order to have a better estimate of adherence to treatments and how this impacts virologic failure. The data generated by this type of device is analyzed with Super Learner (
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>), a data-adaptive algorithm based on cross-validation via multiple internal data splits. Again, the use of machine learning was very efficient and could improve classification of virological failure in a cohort of &gt; 1000 patients in the United States. The combination of machine learning with the standard HIV follow-up (CD4 + T cell count) and antiretroviral therapy regimen significantly improved classification (ROC ≈ 0.8) compared to the electronic monitoring system alone. The contribution of machine learning in this context is reducing the necessity to perform viral load tests (by 1/3) with a sensitivity for virological failure detection at &gt; 95%: saving time, resources and lives without low compromise. Altogether, those applications of machine learning, summarized in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> have greatly improved the management of infectious diseases. While this shows the enormous potential of AI, there are still many aspects that seek adjustments in order to fully utilize the capacity of AI to help eradicate unwanted pathogens, reduce the burden of seasonal viruses, and better understand the interactions between pathogens and humans.
