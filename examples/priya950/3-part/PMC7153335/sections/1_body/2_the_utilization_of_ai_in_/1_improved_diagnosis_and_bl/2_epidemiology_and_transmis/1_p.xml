<p id="p0045">Epidemiological studies can be performed at the population level or at the patient’s bed (clinical epidemiology). Epidemiological studies should be acquired along a specific timeline, with infection-related data collected in a longitudinal manner. When done properly, mathematical models can predict the size of emerging infectious diseases. Large datasets and prediction models exist for noncommunicable diseases (NCD). A recent study collated the data from 50 American states for a series of NCD such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and others over a period of 5 years (

This colossal amount of data and machine learning modeling enabled to reach near-reality output. However, what defined NCD is the lack of transmission from patient to patient because of proximity or shared environment in a short period of time. This is what defines infectious diseases, because they can be transmitted from one individual to the other within very short periods of time. The severity of symptoms and mortality associated with the infection are driving the urgency of predict future size and location of the epidemic. Many of the machine learning methods presented in this chapter beside giving indications on size and location, which is often the communicated information, are primarily used by mathematicians to estimate variables related to infection (e.g., incubation time, transmission mode, symptoms, resistance to treatments). The input data for epidemiological studies is very diverse and enables it to utilize various assets of AI (

Using extremal optimization tuned neural network, the team of scientists showed the high prediction rate and proposed localization data to be implemented in future databases in order to better control transmission. Recent life-threatening outbreaks, such as Ebola, have pushed the community to innovate in the field of prediction. Using machine learning, a single-layer artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and SVM classifiers scientists generated an ensemble of predictors that could be applied to different combinations of Ebola-related data (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Colubri et al., 2016</xref>). An important issue in such health crisis is often the lack of immediate response and poor quality of the data from initial foyer of infection. As in forensic science, the history of transmission relies significantly on the early steps. Colubri et al., showed how missing information and/or small sample size issues can be tackled when utilizing machine learning approaches: a composite of machine learning approaches rather than a single model.
