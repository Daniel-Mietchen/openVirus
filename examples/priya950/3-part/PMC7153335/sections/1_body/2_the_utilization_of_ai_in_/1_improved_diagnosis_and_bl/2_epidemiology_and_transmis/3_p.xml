<p id="p0055">A group of experts in game has recently used AI approaches (disease simulation model) to demonstrate success in using AI algorithms to search for the optimal Malaria intervention strategies (
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Wilder et al., 2018</xref>). The variety and volume of existing data for malaria control is quite dense (e.g., Malaria Atlas Project, Malaria Immunology Database, Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa projects, PlasmoDB) and enabled such an approach (

 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Okell et al., 2008</xref>). Very often, it is not the quantity but the quality and specificity of the input data that will influence the accuracy of the predictive model. Following inoculation of the dengue virus by mosquitoes, dengue hemorrhagic fever can occur (5% of cases). Applying SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, scientists were able to forecast the high morbidity rate and take precautions to prevent such cases to happen. The parameter that was able to reach a high level of accuracy was not linked to climate but to the infection rate of the mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus (

Strategies should then identify the best way to communicate and reach the various categories based on age, gender, and other socioeconomic variables. The use of AI for predicting infectious diseases pandemics should also integrate pipelines for adapted solutions. The high-level AI analytical approach presented above is possible when each of the various database has a high level of veracity.
