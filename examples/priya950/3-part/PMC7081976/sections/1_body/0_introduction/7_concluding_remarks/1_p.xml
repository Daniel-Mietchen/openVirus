<p>Transformations in the movement and care of livestock and companion animal populations have altered animal contact rates, disease dynamics, and pandemic risk. At the same time, however, technological developments are underway that could enhance pandemic response. A commitment of resources has mobilized efforts to develop a universal influenza vaccine that could broadly protect humans against all animal-origin strains [

Given these advances, it is possible to imagine a future when pandemic influenza no longer presents a threat to global health and security. However, these initiatives still face a host of technological, logistical, and market-related challenges. In the race between human ingenuity and pathogen evolution, influenza can never be underestimated.
