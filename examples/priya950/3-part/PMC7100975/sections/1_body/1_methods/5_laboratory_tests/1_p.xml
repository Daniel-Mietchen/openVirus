<p>Only CHIKV-viremic patients were recruited in the study. Blood cell counts and biochemical tests (C-reactive protein (CRP), ionogram, urea, creatinine and hepatic transaminases) were performed upon a blood sample testing positive for CHIKV RNA via qRT-PCR (RealStar Chikungunya RT-PCR kit 1.0â€”Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). A biological bank was created but never used, and the viral load of patients was not collected.</p>
