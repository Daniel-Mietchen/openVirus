<p>One of the strengths of our study was the early inclusion and prospective follow-up of patients located at the epicenter of the epidemic. Another strength was that patients were examined physically by a clinician investigator at disease onset and at M3 to monitor clinical manifestations. This objective assessment of symptoms probably prevented an overestimation of symptoms on the part of patients, though some data (e.g., those collected via joint pain assessment) remain subjective.</p>
