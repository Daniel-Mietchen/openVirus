Influenza vaccination is the primary method available to mitigate the effect of influenza on the world&#x02019;s population. Current vaccines rely on specific targeting of the major surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), and are standardized as stimulating anti-HA antibodies as the primary correlate of protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, but these vaccines have limited and somewhat unpredictable efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, particularly in those that most require protection such as the elderly, young, and infirm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Novel correlates of protection are being explored including cellular immunity.

A total of 153 participants were randomized, 52 received one dose of adjuvanted FLU-v followed by one dose of adjuvanted placebo, 51 received two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v, and 50 received two adjuvanted placebo vaccinations. All participants were considered part of the safety population and were evaluated as part of the safety analysis. Only two participants in all of the vaccinated groups were withdrawn prior to challenge due to adverse events (AEs), both of which were considered unrelated to the vaccine. Others were lost to follow-up or withdrew due to lack of further interest in participation, unrelated change in health, or total challenge enrollment completed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, of the 153 participants, 123 went on to receive an intranasal challenge with the (H1N1)pdm09 challenge strain.

At least one other peptide-based universal influenza vaccine candidate inducing T cell immunity has completed phase I and II trials, but that vaccine has not demonstrated efficacy via a primary outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the ability of peptide vaccines to alter the functionality of T cells has been previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and data from various studies demonstrate that low doses induce high T cell avidity while high peptide concentrations favor low avidity T cells and inhibition of the T cell proliferative response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This can affect the available T cell repertoire in vivo and subsequent pathogen clearance. A high and low zone tolerance after immunization with different doses of antigen exists and must be empirically determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The optimal dose and formulation of FLU-v was identified in preclinical and clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The dose administered in this trial, 500&#x02009;ug, provided the best T cell-driven immune responses that correlated with reduction in virus shedding and symptoms in a small Phase IB H3N2 influenza human challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">In this study single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v was safe and efficacious in that it induced a statistically significant reduction in the number of participants positive for MMID compared to placebo. These data demonstrate the efficacy of this broad-spectrum, &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; vaccine candidate and do so in a healthy volunteer human challenge model. In addition, every other secondary endpoint measured to evaluate disease severity and viral shedding, although not statistically significant, demonstrated reductions in favor of single-dose FLU-v.</p><p id="Par15">Previous human studies were carried out administering a single-dose of FLU-v, but in this study two doses were tested in humans. Although the two-dose regimen showed a reduction in MMID compared to placebo, this was not statistically significant. The study was only powered to compare the active groups to placebo so there was no comparison of the active groups. Larger studies are needed to directly compare the single to two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v. However, the lack of a statistically significant effect of two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v may be explained by recent data in mice demonstrating that T cells from thrice vaccinated mice were significantly less effective in adoptive transfer studies than T cells from mice receiving a single vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In that study the researchers observed an increase in the number of regulatory T cells in animals that had received multiple vaccinations. Elimination of these regulatory cells during the second and third vaccinations resulted in a recovery of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure within a short time or prolonged continuous exposure to antigen stimulation can result in T cell exhaustion, characterized by a higher level of activation and differentiation of T cells than seen in acute stimulation leading to reduced effector function. This can include a reduction in the number of cells able to produce cytokines leading to a failure to provide help to other lymphocytes to stimulate an effective antigen response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Further study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and whole-blood RNA collected after vaccination with FLU-v need further evaluation to test the above hypotheses and to define the protective immune responses being generated.</p><p id="Par16">The major limitation of this study is the generalizability of the human challenge model. The human challenge participants in this study represent the healthiest of individuals who could acquire an influenza infection, are somewhat homogeneous, and the disease demonstrated by these participants was therefore mild overall. Less than 10% of participants in a typical human challenge study would likely be medically attended, and even then, most if not all would be considered mild cases of influenza. Therefore, it is possible that conclusions observed in such a model may not be comparable to a general population with a broader spectrum of illness. However, this narrow spectrum of illness also makes it more difficult to detect efficacy of a vaccine suggesting that a vaccine like FLU-v that demonstrates efficacy in this setting could have a more amplified effect in a real-world setting where the spectrum of disease severity is much broader. In addition, further exploration of FLU-v in the elderly may be very useful as the ability to generate antibody responses against the antigens in seasonal influenza vaccine decreases with age leading to lower efficacy of seasonal vaccination while Th1 cellular responses remain unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of individuals who developed at least two symptoms of influenza, regardless of shedding. FLU-v was able to offer protection that reduced the severity of illness, even in this very healthy population. In addition to this, consistent non-statistically significant reductions of duration of symptoms, total number of symptoms, peak number of symptoms, symptom severity, incidence of shedding, viral shedding AUC, peak shedding, and shedding duration further strengthen this conclusion. The primary endpoint of MMID is a strict definition of influenza infection and in a typical human population exposed to influenza naturally a broader spectrum of illness would occur, therefore making it likely that the effect of this vaccine on disease severity may be even greater than observed here.</p><p id="Par18">FLU-v does not contain HA antigens and as such does not provide protection by inducing neutralizing antibodies against HA. As expected, FLU-v did not significantly increase HAI titers, as most participants were observed to have low HAI titers after vaccination at the time of influenza challenge. Overall geometric mean HAI titers did increase after infection indicating exposure to the challenge virus. Titers remained low as has been observed before in human challenge models that screen participants for low HAI titers prior to challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that screening for low HAI titer in challenge trials may select for a higher proportion of individuals than the 10&#x02013;20% found in the general population that do not mount good antibody responses against the HA of influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It is possible that these individuals may have a stronger cellular response to influenza than those who have a strong anti-HA head humoral response. This in turn could have increased the efficacy of FLU-v in this study; however, there is no evidence to suggest that protective cellular responses such as those potentially induced by FLU-v are downregulated by strong systemic antibody responses.</p><p id="Par19">The results of this study were consistent with what was observed in previous phase I trials and a recently conducted phase IIb trial in the field carried out in the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In this 175-participant study, one dose of adjuvanted FLU-v was shown to be safe and to induce long-lasting cell-mediated immune responses.</p><p id="Par20">This study demonstrated that the T cell strategy employed by FLU-v has potential to offer protection against influenza infection as a vaccine. These results demonstrate that T cell immunity against conserved regions of the influenza virus is likely to be an important component for &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; vaccine strategies. Larger studies with FLU-v can further describe the cellular immune response and evaluate how the vaccine interacts with influenza disease in different cohorts, allowing for informed clinical development of FLU-v and other vaccine strategies that induce T cell immunity.</p><p id="Par21">The need for better, more broadly protective vaccines against influenza is a high priority worldwide, and few new vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in humans. The efficacy of FLU-v in this wild-type human influenza challenge study along with the supporting data from previous trials in the field should be further examined in larger field trials where efficacy of FLU-v will be evaluated against a broader set of influenza strains and wider spectrum of disease to determine if these results will be broadly applicable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clinical trial</title><p id="Par22">A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase IIb efficacy and safety trial was conducted at h-VIVO Services Ltd (London, UK).
