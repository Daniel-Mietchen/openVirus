<p id="Par4">FLU-v, developed by PepTcell (trading as SEEK), is a peptide vaccine derived from conserved regions of internal proteins aiming to provide a broadly protective immune response against influenza A and B through viral clearance by cytotoxic T cell release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as perforin and granzyme. It has demonstrated efficacy in animals
