<p id="Par10">Overall, FLU-v vaccination was well tolerated in all participants receiving the vaccine. After vaccination, but before influenza challenge, 98 participants (64%) experienced an AE. The number of participants experiencing one or more AEs in the one-dose adjuvanted FLU-v group was similar to placebo, 55.8% vs 54%, respectively, but a higher percentage of individuals (50% vs 22%) in the one-dose group experienced AEs definitely, probably, or possibly related to vaccination compared to placebo (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The largest number of individuals experiencing AEs was observed in the two-dose adjuvanted FLU-v group at 82.4%, with 75% of participants experiencing AEs definitely, probably, or possibly, related to vaccination (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). No vaccine related AEs were observed after challenge.
