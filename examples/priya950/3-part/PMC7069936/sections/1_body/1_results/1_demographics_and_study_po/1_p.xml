<p id="Par6">The study activities took place between 18 August 2016 and 31 March 2017. A total of 153 participants were randomized, 52 received one dose of adjuvanted FLU-v followed by one dose of adjuvanted placebo, 51 received two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v, and 50 received two adjuvanted placebo vaccinations. All participants were considered part of the safety population and were evaluated as part of the safety analysis. Only two participants in all of the vaccinated groups were withdrawn prior to challenge due to adverse events (AEs), both of which were considered unrelated to the vaccine. Others were lost to follow-up or withdrew due to lack of further interest in participation, unrelated change in health, or total challenge enrollment completed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, of the 153 participants, 123 went on to receive an intranasal challenge with the (H1N1)pdm09 challenge strain. These 123 participants were considered the intent to treat population and were used for the efficacy analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The demographics of each of these populations are summarized in Table
