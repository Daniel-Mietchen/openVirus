<p id="Par12">Participants were selected who had an HAI titer against the H1N1 challenge strain of &lt;1:40 prior to vaccination with FLU-v. As expected, no significant rise in hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titer was observed after vaccination and all but one participant had an HAI titer of &lt;1:40 after vaccination on the day prior to H1N1 challenge. Participants in all three groups demonstrated a statistically significant rise in geometric mean HAI titer after viral challenge from their pre-challenge baseline (Fig.
