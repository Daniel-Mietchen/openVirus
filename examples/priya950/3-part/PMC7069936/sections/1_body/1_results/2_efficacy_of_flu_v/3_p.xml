<p id="Par9">Median duration of symptoms and severity of disease as measured by the FLU-PRO questionnaire was reduced in those receiving vaccine compared to the placebo group in both vaccine groups, but the results were not statistically significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Non-statistically significant reductions in the mean total number of symptoms and mean peak symptoms were also observed in the one-dose FLU-v group compared to placebo but not for the two-dose FLU-v arm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similarly, the presence of shedding was lower in both vaccine groups compared to placebo as was the AUC of total viral shedding, although not statistically significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
