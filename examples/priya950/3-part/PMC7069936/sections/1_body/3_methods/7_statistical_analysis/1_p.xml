 </sup>; therefore, this study was designed with 80% power to detect a reduction in MMID from a predicted placebo rate of 70% MMID to 40% expected in the treatment arms. A one-sided analysis at the 0.05 level of significance was pre-specified. A one-sided test was specified since this is a phase II study and it is only of interest to show activity of the vaccine groups over placebo, it was not of interest to show activity of placebo over vaccine. This decision allowed a smaller sample size to obtain adequate power. Statistical significance of incidence of MMID as well as other binary endpoints was tested using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with
