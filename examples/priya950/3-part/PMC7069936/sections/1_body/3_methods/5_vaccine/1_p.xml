 </sup>. These peptides originate from conserved regions in internal proteins M1, NPA, NPB, and M2 respectively. The peptides are manufactured in the solid phase by fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry, reconstituted, filtered, and lyophilized. It was administered by subcutaneous injection as a water-in-oil emulsion (50:50) with water for injection and Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant (Seppic, France) with 500 μg FLU-v in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The placebo was prepared by emulsifying 0.25 ml of water for injection and 0.25 ml of Montanide ISA-51. Montanide ISA-51 is a ready to use adjuvant composed of light mineral oil and a surfactant (mannide monooleate from vegetable oil) designed to form water-in-oil emulsions in order to enhance the immune response against targeted antigens.
