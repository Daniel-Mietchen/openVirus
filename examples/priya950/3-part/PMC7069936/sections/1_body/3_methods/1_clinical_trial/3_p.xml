<p id="Par24">Adjuvanted FLU-v or placebo was administered subcutaneously on days −43 and −22, prior to intranasal challenge on day 0 with the wild-type (H1N1)pdm09 virus. All participants received two vaccinations 21 days apart. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups on day −43, the first day of vaccination, based on randomization codes generated by the NIAID statistician in R. The participants, investigators, and all other clinical and non-clinical staff remained blinded to this allocation until after database lock and unblinding. The placebo group received two doses of the adjuvanted placebo, the one-dose FLU-v group received adjuvanted FLU-v and then adjuvanted placebo, and the two-dose FLU-v group received two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v. All groups proceeded to intranasal viral challenge.</p>
