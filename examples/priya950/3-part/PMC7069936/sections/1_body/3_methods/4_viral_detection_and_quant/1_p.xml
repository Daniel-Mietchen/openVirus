<p id="Par29">Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected to evaluate viral shedding. MMID and shedding duration was based on viral detection performed using the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel assay (Luminex, Austin, Tx). Quantitation was performed using a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the matrix segment of the challenge virus using standard methods. The assay standard was obtained from an RNA produced by in vitro transcription from a plasmid with a sequence specific to the challenge virus. The lower limit of quantitation was 2.30 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml (200 copies/ml). An arbitrary value of 1.30 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml (20 copies/ml) was given to samples returning a detected but unquantifiable result. Viral shedding peak and viral shedding quantitation (area under the curve) were calculated from day 1 to day 7 post-inoculation.
