<p id="Par18">FLU-v does not contain HA antigens and as such does not provide protection by inducing neutralizing antibodies against HA. As expected, FLU-v did not significantly increase HAI titers, as most participants were observed to have low HAI titers after vaccination at the time of influenza challenge. Overall geometric mean HAI titers did increase after infection indicating exposure to the challenge virus. Titers remained low as has been observed before in human challenge models that screen participants for low HAI titers prior to challenge

 </sup>, suggesting that screening for low HAI titer in challenge trials may select for a higher proportion of individuals than the 10–20% found in the general population that do not mount good antibody responses against the HA of influenza

 </sup>. It is possible that these individuals may have a stronger cellular response to influenza than those who have a strong anti-HA head humoral response. This in turn could have increased the efficacy of FLU-v in this study; however, there is no evidence to suggest that protective cellular responses such as those potentially induced by FLU-v are downregulated by strong systemic antibody responses.
