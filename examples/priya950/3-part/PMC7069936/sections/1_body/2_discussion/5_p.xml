<p id="Par17">Single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of individuals who developed at least two symptoms of influenza, regardless of shedding. FLU-v was able to offer protection that reduced the severity of illness, even in this very healthy population. In addition to this, consistent non-statistically significant reductions of duration of symptoms, total number of symptoms, peak number of symptoms, symptom severity, incidence of shedding, viral shedding AUC, peak shedding, and shedding duration further strengthen this conclusion. The primary endpoint of MMID is a strict definition of influenza infection and in a typical human population exposed to influenza naturally a broader spectrum of illness would occur, therefore making it likely that the effect of this vaccine on disease severity may be even greater than observed here.</p>
