<p id="Par20">This study demonstrated that the T cell strategy employed by FLU-v has potential to offer protection against influenza infection as a vaccine. These results demonstrate that T cell immunity against conserved regions of the influenza virus is likely to be an important component for “universal” vaccine strategies. Larger studies with FLU-v can further describe the cellular immune response and evaluate how the vaccine interacts with influenza disease in different cohorts, allowing for informed clinical development of FLU-v and other vaccine strategies that induce T cell immunity.</p>
