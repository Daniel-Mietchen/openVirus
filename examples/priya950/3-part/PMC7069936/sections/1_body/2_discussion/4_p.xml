<p id="Par16">The major limitation of this study is the generalizability of the human challenge model. The human challenge participants in this study represent the healthiest of individuals who could acquire an influenza infection, are somewhat homogeneous, and the disease demonstrated by these participants was therefore mild overall. Less than 10% of participants in a typical human challenge study would likely be medically attended, and even then, most if not all would be considered mild cases of influenza. Therefore, it is possible that conclusions observed in such a model may not be comparable to a general population with a broader spectrum of illness. However, this narrow spectrum of illness also makes it more difficult to detect efficacy of a vaccine suggesting that a vaccine like FLU-v that demonstrates efficacy in this setting could have a more amplified effect in a real-world setting where the spectrum of disease severity is much broader. In addition, further exploration of FLU-v in the elderly may be very useful as the ability to generate antibody responses against the antigens in seasonal influenza vaccine decreases with age leading to lower efficacy of seasonal vaccination while Th1 cellular responses remain unaffected
