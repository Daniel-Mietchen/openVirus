  <title>Shedding and AUC was evaluated using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a 0.05 significance level.</title>
  <p>Box and whisker plots show the median and interquartile range. Error bars span the 10th to 90th percentile. Outliers are indicated as points outside of whiskers. The mean is shown as a “+”. 
   <bold>a</bold> Days of shedding of participants in each vaccination group after challenge. 
   <bold>b</bold> Peak shedding measured by rt-pcr (Log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/ml) experienced by participants in each vaccination group after challenge. 
   <bold>c</bold> AUC of participants in each vaccination group after challenge. 
   <bold>d</bold> HAI titers were measured in each of the three groups 2 days before challenge (day −2) and 63 days after challenge). Most participants had undetectable titers prior to challenge. Geometric mean titers are shown here with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals.
