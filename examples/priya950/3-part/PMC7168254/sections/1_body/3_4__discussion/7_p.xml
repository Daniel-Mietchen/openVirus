<p>This is not necessarily true for immunocompetent hosts though. Although older serological assays for HEV diagnosis had come in disrepute due to their unacceptable performance, newer assays perform as shown in our and previous studies reasonably well [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to our data, performing HEV PCR in immunocompetent hosts would be advisable only if the HEV serology (IgM or/and IgG) is positive. According to the current EASL guidelines, the performance of an HEV nucleic acid diagnostics is recommended to diagnose HEV, ideally but not necessarily in combination with HEV serology [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is understandable from a European perspective; detection through PCR is reliable, sensitive, specific and readily available. This, however, may not reflect the global situation. In developing countries, HEV remains a major public health concern, causing large waterborne epidemics that are associated with high morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In such countries and situations, resources and availability of specialized laboratory equipment may be limited. A purely serological diagnosis would thus seem an acceptable compromise when dealing with immunocompetent hosts.
