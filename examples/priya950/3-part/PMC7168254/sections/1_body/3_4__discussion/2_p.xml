<p>In immunosuppressed patients, however, things looked different; when comparing the diagnostic accuracy of HEV IgM with the “gold standard” HEV RNA, immunosuppression was associated with reduced sensitivity (76.6 vs. 92.9) and specificity (85 vs. 89.4) compared to the immunocompetent cohort. Inferior performance is not surprising, since poor antibody response/formation has been repeatedly described in immunosuppressed patients previously, an effect observed not only after a natural infection but also after vaccination [

Indeed, immunocompetent HEV RNA positive patients had higher serum total IgG concentration and HEV IgM titers than immunosuppressed HEV RNA positive patients, although the difference in HEV IgM titers did not reach statistical significance (
