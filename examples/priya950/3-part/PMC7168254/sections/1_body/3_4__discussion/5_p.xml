<p>HEV IgA and IgM antibodies appeared at the same time point after infection in serum; the duration of IgA seropositivity, however, slightly exceeded the duration of IgM seropositivity [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In order to investigate if the diagnostic accuracy of HEV serology could be improved with the use of HEV IgA testing, we tested available sera from all four groups of patients for HEV IgA. The results were not encouraging for HEV RNA+/HEV IgM− patients; HEV IgA was undetectable in all of them. In the case of HEV RNA−/HEV IgM+ patients, most but not all patients had detectable HEV IgA as well. Thus, no obvious benefit could be observed when performing the HEV IgA assays in combination with HEV IgM and IgG detection in our cohort.
