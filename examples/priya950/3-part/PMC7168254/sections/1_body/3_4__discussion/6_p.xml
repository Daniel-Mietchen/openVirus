<p>Limitations of our study are its retrospective character and the relative bias due to recruitment of patients from a tertiary hospital. The samples were tested only with the Euroimmune HEV IgM and IgG serological assay (with the exception of the HEV IgA tested samples). This is a limitation of our study, since different assays have demonstrated different and sometimes higher diagnostic accuracy. Amongst them is the Wantai assay, which has been often but not always regarded as the “gold standard” in HEV serology [

Furthermore, we did not evaluate the HEV IgG avidity in the HEV RNA−/HEV IgM+ patient group, which might have helped to differentiate between patients with resolved HEV infection and patients with nonspecific antibodies cross-reacting with the HEV antigen [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A possible caveat, however, is that HEV antibody maturation in immunosuppressed hosts may not follow the same pattern as in immunocompetent hosts, as it has been shown for CMV antibodies [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Generalizing these results and applying them to our cohort with immunosuppressed patients may not be appropriate. A strength of the study is the relatively great number of tested patients and in particular immunosuppressed patients. Diagnosing viral infection or reactivation during immunosuppression is crucial for the optimal treatment of patients, but serological markers can prove sometimes unreliable, as it has been reported for cases with EBV or HBV infection [

 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00137" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As we have demonstrated, the same is true for HEV infection. Performing a PCR to diagnose or exclude HEV infection is necessary for immunocompromised patients. This is of great importance for the clinical routine; HEV diagnosis or exclusion is purely serology-based in many cases in Germany, a strategy promoted by the lack of financial compensation for HEV PCR.
