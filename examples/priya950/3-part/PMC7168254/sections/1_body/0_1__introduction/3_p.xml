<p>HEV diagnosis depends on serological and molecular methods. After infection, shortly before the onset of symptoms, HEV RNA becomes detectable in the serum and stool. HEV IgM antibodies appear first and are followed soon by IgG antibodies. The IgM antibodies usually persist for 3â€“4 months in serum, while the IgG antibodies can be detected for a significantly longer time period [

According to the WHO, definitive diagnosis of HEV is usually based on the detection of specific IgM antibodies in blood, while HEV RNA detection is recommended in areas where hepatitis E is infrequent and in cases with chronic HEV infection [
