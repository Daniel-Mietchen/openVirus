<p>It has been shown that the course of HEV infection might differ between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Therefore, our HEV RNA positive cohort was grouped into individuals according to presence or absence of immunosuppression. Thirteen immunocompetent patients were compared to 48 immunocompromised individuals, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00137-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, immunocompetent patients were older (56.5 (16) vs. 51 (32) in years, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.044), had an increased risk for liver failure (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6, 46% vs. 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, 2%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and overall mortality (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4, 31% vs. 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, 4%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016), had higher serum IgG concentration (13.1 (6.9) vs. 8.9 (5.3) g/L, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and higher HEV IgA S/CO (4.63 (2.75) vs. 1.33 (3.73), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012) than immunosuppressed patients in our cohort. Immunocompetent patients tended to have higher HEV IgM titers, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significant higher in the immunocompetent group, indicating that the immune system might play an important role in the pathogenesis of HEV infections.
