<p>As stated above, some patients with detectable HEV RNA did not have HEV specific antibodies, which complicated diagnosis. To find out if there were specific clinical or virological characteristics explaining why some patients had HEV specific IgM antibodies while others did not, our HEV RNA positive patient cohort was divided into two groups according to their HEV IgM status. Clinical, laboratory and virological data of the subgroups are presented in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00137-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, clinical background, ALT, HEV viral load or outcome. Surprisingly, there was also no significant difference between the immunosuppressed group and the immunocompetent group. However, all patients without detectable HEV IgM and IgG (
