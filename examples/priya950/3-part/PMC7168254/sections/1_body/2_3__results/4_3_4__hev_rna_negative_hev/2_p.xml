<p>As a next step, we focused on the group of HEV RNA negative HEV IgM positive patients and looked for documented history of HEV infection in patient charts. Indeed, in 20 out of 143 cases (14%), previous acute HEV infection had been documented. Interestingly, in some of these patients, the timepoint of last HEV RNA detection and first negative HEV RNA PCR was several years in the past, reaching to 4 and 6 years in two patients. When comparing these 20 patients with documented past HEV infection to the 123 without, there was a difference in the frequency of HEV IgG positivity, albeit a statistically non-significant one (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.075). In the first group, HEV IgG was measured and was positive in 19 patients (100%), while in the second, HEV IgG was measured in 122 patients and was positive in 102 (83.6%). Overall, HEV IgM might not be an ideal marker for screening patients for an HEV infection.
