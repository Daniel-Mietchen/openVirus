<p>Since HEV is typically transmitted fecal–orally, we wondered if HEV IgA testing would be more sensitive, especially in patients without detectable HEV antibodies or with suspected false positive HEV IgM detection. Therefore, we tested available sera from all four groups of patients for detection of HEV IgA, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00137-f003">Figure 3</xref>. HEV IgA antibodies were detectable in about half of the patients without detectable HEV RNA and undetectable in 38% of the patients with detectable HEV RNA. The sensitivity of the method was 61.76 % (95% CI, 43.56–77.83) and the specificity 44.37% (95% CI, 36.3–52.67).
