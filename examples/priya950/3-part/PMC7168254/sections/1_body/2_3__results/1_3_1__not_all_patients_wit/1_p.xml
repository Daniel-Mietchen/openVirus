<p>Our patient cohort is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00137-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Most patients were HEV RNA−/HEV IgM− (
 <italic>n</italic> = 961, 83%); 25% of them had serological signs of a resolved HEV infection (
 <italic>n</italic> = 238) and 13% of all patients had positive or borderline HEV IgM without detectable HEV RNA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 143). In most of these patients, we could also detect HEV IgG antibodies (
 <italic>n</italic> = 121, 83%). Our cohort included 678 (57.8%) men and 492 (42.2%) women; 74 (6.4%) of them were children and 1091 (93.6%) were adults. The average age was 52 (35–62.5) years, while 634 (54.4%) patients were immunosuppressed and 531 (45.6%) were immunocompetent. Forty one patients (3.5%) were screened for HEV (including HEV PCR) without showing biochemical or clinical signs of hepatitis in the context of potential organ, tissue or blood donation.
