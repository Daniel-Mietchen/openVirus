<p>HEV RNA was detectable in 61 patients; in the majority of them (
 <italic>n</italic> = 49, 80%) HEV IgM antibodies were positive or borderline. However, in 20% of patients with detectable HEV RNA, HEV IgM antibodies were not detectable. A third of these patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) developed HEV IgM at a later time point while the others remained negative. Furthermore, 17 patients with HEV RNA had no detectable HEV IgG antibodies (28%), and 10 patients had neither HEV IgM nor IgG antibodies (16.4%).
