<p>We performed a retrospective analysis of 1165 patients treated in the University Hospital Essen, Germany, from 2017 to 2018, most of them with hepatitis of unknown etiology. The HEV diagnostic was performed to exclude or diagnose an HEV infection. In all enrolled patients, HEV serology (HEV IgG and IgM) and HEV PCR were performed at the same time point. Patients were divided into four groups according to their HEV RNA and HEV IgM status: 1. HEV RNA+/HEV IgM+, 2. HEV RNA+/HEV IgM–, 3. HEV RNA–/HEV IgM– and 4. HEV RNA–/HEV IgM+, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00137-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Borderline (S/CO 0.8–1.09) and positive (S/CO ≥ 1) results were grouped together; the negative results (S/CO &lt; 0.8) formed the second group.
