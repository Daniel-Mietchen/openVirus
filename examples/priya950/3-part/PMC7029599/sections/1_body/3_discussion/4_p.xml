<p id="Par48">In the present finding, the seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons in a period from October–December (week 39–51) and from April–June (week 7–15 of the year). Furthermore, the seasonality of influenza using cumulative Incidence rate with in the lower administrative level catchment population from 2012 to 2017 shows that the epidemic season mean start lies on week 42 (October) and the mean end lies week 2 (January) of the year. The highest threshold was recorded by the year2016/16 (R = 8.2, r = 032) followed by 2014/15 (R = 7.9, r = 0.37) and 2012/13 (R = 7.5, r = 0.43)). The average epidemic lengths might last for 11–12 weeks. Based on the applied model the weekly epidemic threshold of influenza ranges from 2.5 (minimum threshold) to 7.66 (Very high threshold) per 100,000 population in the catchment area [Mathew correlation coefficient “r” of 3.4 with 0.42 sensitivity rate and 0.67 positive predictive value]. This finding agreed with the WHO report in which the peak of transmission was observed from epi weeks 7 to 9 of 2016 and 2015, which coincided with the northern hemisphere winter and influenza type A was predominant. It also reported that there was a second increase in influenza activity from epi weeks 48 to 51 of 2016 predominated by influenza type B [
