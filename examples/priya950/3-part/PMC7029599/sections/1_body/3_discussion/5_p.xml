<p id="Par49">The mean annual incidence rate of influenza (52.48 per 100,000) in the present finding is relatively higher in comparable to the finding reported in Kenya (2012–2014) with an estimated annual Incidence rate of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI was 21 per 100,000 population and the mean annual Incidence rate of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI was 81.7 (95% CI 74.1–89.9) per 100,000 persons [

Even if the present finding doesn’t entail on SARI, association of the non-hospitalized influenza associated SARI with the ILI indicates that the finding in the present finding is relatively lower. In addition, the present finding is higher than the estimated mean annual Incidence rate of 30.0 per 100,000 population reported in Madagascar [
