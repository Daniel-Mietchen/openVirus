<p id="Par45">Presenting country-level data from Ethiopia is incredibly useful, especially in a region where country-level data are not well described or published. The frequency distribution, influenza positive case proportion, incidence rate and seasonality of medically attended influenza (ILI and SARI) based on sentinel surveillance data (epidemiological and laboratory data) collected from eight sentinel sites over 6 years period (2012â€“2017) were presented. A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) were enrolled in eight influenza sentinel surveillance sites located in four regions of Ethiopia from 2012 to 2017. The variation in the number of influenza suspected cases among sentinel sites and the case classification might be due to the difference in patient flow in the sites and effectiveness of the surveillance activities in each sentinel sites.</p>
