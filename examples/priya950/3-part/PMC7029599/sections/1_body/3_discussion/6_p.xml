<p id="Par50">The presented finding showed that the overall incidence rate of ILI were higher in the age group of 15–44 years of age [R = 254.6, 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] followed by 5–14 years of age [R = 49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The mean annual incidence rate of medically attended influenza cases showed variation in comparison to other countries report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The variation in the reported incidence rate among the age group might be due to the actual difference in the incidence of influenza in different countries, the quality of surveillance system, the health care seeking behavior of the community and also it might be due to the different approach/method of analysis for calculating the incidence rate.
