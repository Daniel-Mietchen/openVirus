<p id="Par51">The presented study has limitations that warrant discussion. The very low health care seeking behavior of the community for influenza infection might affect the findings of the estimated Incidence rate of influenza in Ethiopia. The adjustment factor for this low health seeking behavior and also to the national level were not applied in the present finding. The presented findings has only based on the surveillance data from eight sentinel sites and it does not provide has limitations in providing the burden at national level. The surveillance system has also enrolled only few SARI patients whereas the influenza positive case proportion of SARI as compared with total admission cases was high in all hospitals. The surveillance system is also capturing only influenza. Hence the estimates in this study should be considered minimum estimates.</p>
