<p id="Par22">The Influenza like Illness (ILI) and Sever Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance data collected in a period from 2012 to 2017 was applied to estimate proportion of laboratory confirmed influenza positive ILI cases (medically-attended) among patients presented to the sentinel sites (health facility) seeking medical care for any kind of illness and influenza positive ILI cases among the catchment population (incidence rate) in Ethiopia. The ILI program is a health center-based sentinel surveillance system that monitors children and adults presenting with sudden onset of fever &gt; 38 °C and cough or sore throat. The three ILI sentinel sites (Shiromeda health center which was established in 2008, Kolfe health center and Akaki health center established in 2010) are located in Addis Ababa. The SARI program is a hospital-based sentinel surveillance system that monitors children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia across five hospitals in Ethiopia. The SARI sentinel sites are located in four regions which are Yekatit-12 hospital (Addis Ababa) established in 2008, Mekele hospital (Tigray region, northern Ethiopia), Felege-hiwot hospital (Amahara region, North weastern Ethiopia), Adama hospital (Oromia region, Central Ethiopia) and Adare hospital (Southern region of Ethiopia) which was established in 2012; Fig.
