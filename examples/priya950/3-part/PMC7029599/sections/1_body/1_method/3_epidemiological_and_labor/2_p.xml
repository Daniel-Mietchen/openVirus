<p id="Par25">Each sentinel site has a protocol to collect throat swab specimens as part of sentinel surveillance system. The sentinel sites focal persons obtained unwritten (Verbal) consent from each patient prior to collection of throat swab specimen. Since it’s a routine surveillance activity under the health care delivery system only verbal consent from the patients are the only requirement. Throat swab samples were systematically collected from out-patients of all ages who fulfilled the case definition for ILI per week at sentinel surveillance sites. Similarly throat swab samples were also collected from patients who fulfilled the SARI case definition and admitted to designated SARI sentinel surveillance sites (hospital). Specimen were collected within 7 days after the first onset of symptoms for ILI and SARI. Throat swabs samples was placed in viral transport media (VTM) and stored at 4 °C until transported to the National Influenza Laboratory (NIL) at Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI). Shipment of throat swab specimens in viral transport media to the NIL at EPHI was conducted within 72 h of collection using a cold chain system. Viral RNA from throat swabs were extracted and subjected to real-time PCR amplification with parameters set for influenza testing, according to Center for disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol using reagents obtained from Influenza Reagent Resources (IRR). Further sub-typing and characterization of influenza A-positive specimens were carried out using the CDC real-time reverse transcription PCR protocol [
