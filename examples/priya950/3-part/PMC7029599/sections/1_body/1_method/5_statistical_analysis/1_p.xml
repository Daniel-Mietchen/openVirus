<p id="Par27">The overall data management and analysis were done using Excel v-13, SPSS V-23 and RStudio (version 3.4.3) applications. The case based surveillance data and weekly aggregated data (aggregated by age specific total admission, number of new cases, number of tested and sampled per week) from 2012 to 2017 were entered and cleaned using excel v-13. The incomplete data set (missing values) and the outbreak investigation results in 2016 were excluded and only the complete data sets recorded in the routine sentinel surveillance system were included to maintain the consistency of surveillance data.</p>
