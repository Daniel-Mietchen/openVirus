<p id="Par40">Of the total 1166 medically attended influenza positive cases (patients) 65% were influenza type A and 35% were influenza type B. Of the influenza type A cases the predominantly circulating influenza subtype (
 <italic>n</italic> = 455, 60%) were Seasonal Influenza A(H3N2) and (
 <italic>n</italic> = 293, 39%) were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Among 4444 out-patient cases presented to three sentinel sites with Influenza-like-illness (ILI), 25% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1130) were tested positive for influenza. Of which, the majority of patients who tested positive for influenza were influenza type A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 724, 64%), and of those, the majority were seasonal influenza A (H3N2) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 433, 60%). On the other hand, among 1271 (22% of all cases) in-patients presented to five SARI sentinel sites with Sever Acute Respiratory 36 (3%) were tested positive for influenza. The overall percent positive for medically attended influenza cases were 20% (1166/5715). Off the total influenza positive cases 27% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 399/1166) were within the age group of 5–14 years of age followed by 15–44 age groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 573, 25%). One percent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 78) of influenza positive cases were missing patient age (Table
