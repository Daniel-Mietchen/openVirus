 <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
 <p id="Par53">This surveillance data analysis was considered to be part of routine surveillance by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute to early detect, communicate and respond to the increment of cases. The institute is mandated to conduct public health surveillance and outbreak investigation by Council of Ministers. In addition this study was conducted based on national Influenza Sentinel surveillance protocol. The National Influenza reference laboratory at Ethiopian Public Health Institute is mandated to provide laboratory support for influenza surveillance and investigation. We officially request Influenza surveillance data from 2012 to 2017 from Ethiopian Public Health Institute. Unwritten (Verbal) consent was obtained from each patient who provided throat swab specimen up on informing the objectives of the study. Since it’s a routine surveillance activity under the health care delivery system only verbal consent from the patients is the only requirement. This analysis is part of the routine surveillance activities and the ethical approval is not deemed necessary from Ethiopian Public Health Institute’s Scientific and Ethical Review Office (SERO) to publish the manuscript.</p>
