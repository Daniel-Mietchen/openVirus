<p>With different combinations of parameters, there was a small but replicable improvement in the accuracy of infection date inference, but at the expense of predicting the correct transmission relationship. There are currently no algorithms flexible enough to infer an integrative evolutionary and epidemiological model explaining within and between patient HIV genetic variability. HIV subtype did not affect inference accuracy, but other biological and technical considerations may still have a role. The parameters underlying within and between patient evolution have been shown to be different [

 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This variability could have been exacerbated by technical procedures that amplify only the most frequent variant. Since cART is widely and intensely used in the SAC patient population, convergent evolution from selective pressures of cART at the population level is possible. However, the proportion of accurately reconstructed relationships indicates that there are enough patient-lineage-specific mutations that P2P relationships can be identified. One way to circumvent complications of genetic similarity would be to compare transmission inferences from other genes, such as envelope or other group-specific antigens.
