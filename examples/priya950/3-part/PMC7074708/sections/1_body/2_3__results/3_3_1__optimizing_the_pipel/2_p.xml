<p>Initially, transmission trees were constructed using default BEAST2 and TransPhylo parameters. The default TransPhylo parameters, in conjunction with the default BEAST2 parameters, predicted nearly three times the number of unsampled patients as source of infection compared to the adjusted parameters. From a clinical perspective, this predicted proportion of unsampled patients (
