<p>Using 1000 replications of the eight parameter combinations, we observed that the best results were obtained for disease transmission by the Muscle aligned BEAST2 adjusted and TransPhylo adjusted parameters. For assessing dates of transmission, BEAST2 adjusted and TransPhylo default gave the best results. The BEAST2 adjusted and TransPhylo adjusted had at the highest end 23/36 accurate predictions and at the low end 12/36 accurate predictions at a 95% confidence interval. The highest recorded accuracy for transmission relationships was 26/36 (Seed value: 552) or 72.22%. The accuracy of our Sanger- and BEAST2/TransPhylo-based method is comparable to more complex heuristic-based phylogenetic methods relying on HIV deep sequencing data [

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The infection dates prediction for Adjusted BEAST2 and default TransPhylo had 43/87 correct predictions as the highest and 31/87 correct predictions as the lowest at the same 95% confidence interval. Here too, the most correct predictions were at 47/87 (seed value: 139) or 54.02%. On average, when taking into account the infection dates predicted for each patient at a 95% confidence interval, it was observed that the pipeline predicted the infection date within an average of a 2-year time period.
