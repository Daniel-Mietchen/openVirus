<p>To enhance the accuracy of P2P transmission inference, further analyses of the parameter choices were conducted on a transmission tree replicate generated by MUSCLE, using adjusted BEAST2 parameters, and adjusted TransPhylo parameters. This identified 17.48 of the 36 known transmission relationships (
