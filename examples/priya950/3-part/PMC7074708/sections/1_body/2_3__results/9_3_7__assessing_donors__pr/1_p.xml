<p>For Donors, 10/29 were incorrectly predicted to be infected by their corresponding Recipients secondary patients. For example, if it was known that A infected B in the SAC dataset, then TransPhylo instead predicted a B-to-A infection direction. All 10 incorrect inferences occurred because of incorrectly inferred infection dates, either for the Donors or the Recipients patient. Again, this demonstrates that the trade-off between correct transmission inferences comes at the expense of accuracy of the infection date inference. However, many of the correctly inferred transmission relationships highlighted in the Recipients analysis occurred despite the predicted infection dates falling outside of a viable infection date range. It is thus possible to identify person-to-person transmission without identifying exactly when it happened, and these novel transmission inferences may in fact have occurred.</p>
