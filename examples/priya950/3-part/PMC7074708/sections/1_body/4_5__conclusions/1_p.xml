<p>We demonstrate that consensus polymerase sequences from routine clinical Sanger sequencing alone achieves robustness at inferring transmission relationships and infection dates [

In addition, it allows for the analysis and use of historical clinical and Sanger data already available in many clinical settings. Applying these analyses to a variety of settings can provide valuable information about population-wide HIV infection dynamics and a detailed understanding of local HIV epidemics, which provides an opportunity for more guided public health interventions.
