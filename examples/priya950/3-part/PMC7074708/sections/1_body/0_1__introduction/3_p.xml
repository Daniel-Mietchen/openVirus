<p>A key assumption of these methods is that the genetic diversity of within-patient populations is correlated with the time since initial infection [

However, the discrepancy between the rates of HIV evolution within and between patients results in inaccuracies from the application of many unified molecular clock assumptions, which are used to estimate phylogenetic tree branch lengths [

Furthermore, confounding factors, including; the founder quasispecies, within-patient selective pressure (e.g., cART), immune selection, and technical considerations (e.g., adequate sequencing coverage and data), will affect the estimation of viral evolution observed within a patient [
