<p>The identification and testing of groups at high risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, combined with successfully engaging Persons Living with HIV (PLWH) in combination Anti-Retroviral Therapy (cART) is critical in controlling the HIV epidemic. At the patient level, early clinical intervention and adherence to cART can improve quality-of-life and achieve a near-normal life expectancy [
