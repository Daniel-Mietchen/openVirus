<p>Furthermore, we established three infection categories (IC) based on the best estimate of date of infection based on their available Last Negative HIV test (LN) and First Positive HIV test (FP) (

 <italic>n</italic> = 87) were patients with both LN and FP dates available. IC 2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) were patients with a documented FP date, but no LN date. IC 3 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were patients for which no LN or FP dates were available. The majority of patients (28/36) in group Donors were also in IC2. The majority of patients overall (88/139) were associated with both last-negative and first-positive HIV tests. Only three individuals had neither transmission relationship nor infection data associated with their records (
