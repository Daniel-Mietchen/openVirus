<p>TransPhylo considers the generation of the disease and the sampling time as Gamma distributions. Variations to the shape and the scale of the distribution seemed to change the accuracy of prediction for the dates and transmission. By an iterative test all possible combinations for a series of gamma distribution curves were tested. Each combination was replicated 100 times. Then the values with the best results were replicated as before 1000 times and we assessed if there were improved prediction rates compared to the baseline adjusted parameters. In this manner we were able to further refine these two parameters and increase the accuracy for the prediction dates (
