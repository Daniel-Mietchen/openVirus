<p>The transmission analysis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) multiple sequence alignment, (2) rooted phylogenetic tree generation, and (3) transmission and infection date inference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Two combinations of parameters at each of the three steps were tested to determine the combination that would provide the most accurate transmission relationship and infection date inferences. These two parameters were dubbed the “Default” and the “Adjusted” parameters. The adjusted parameters were modified to best depict the HIV infection dynamic. Various iterations of adjusted parameters were tested until the best prediction accuracies were reached (
