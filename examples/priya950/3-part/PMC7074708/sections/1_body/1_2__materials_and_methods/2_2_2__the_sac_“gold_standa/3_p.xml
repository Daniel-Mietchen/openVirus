<p>Patients were chosen for the availability of their GART sequencing data, as well as paired clinical data such as reported transmission relationships and/or HIV testing results. Without paired clinical-sequencing data, it would not have been possible to verify the accuracy of the inferred transmission relationships. Multiple HIV-1 subtypes were examined including subtypes A, B, C, D, G, and several recombinants. Patients with HIV-1 subtype B formed a slim majority of the set, which was expected for a North American epidemic (74/139) [

GART was performed by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control/Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS GART program (BC CDC/CfE) (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Sequences of HIV polymerase (pol) gene (corresponding to HIV HXB2 genome positions 2526–3544 or 2526–4024) were generated via Sanger sequencing from the GART closest to the estimated infection date and before therapy initiation. The association of HIV sequence data, reported and confirmed transmission relationships and infection dates established a “gold standard” data set to examine the accuracy of the pipeline, and improve the parameter combinations to better reflect the true transmission network in our local situation.
