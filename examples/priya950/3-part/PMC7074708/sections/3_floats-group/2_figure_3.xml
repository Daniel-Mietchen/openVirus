  <p>The transmission tree generated by MUSCLE, adjusted BEAST2 parameters, and adjusted TransPhylo parameters. Sampled patients are represented by black branches, and unsampled patients by light grey branches. The symbols represent person-to-person transmission events. Green and red triangles represent correctly and incorrectly inferred relationships respectively. Grey squares represent novel inferences of transmission relationships that have no precedence in the SAC dataset. The branches involved in
