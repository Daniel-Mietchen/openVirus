<p>Predesigned small-interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides and a nontargeting MISSION control siRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to deplete the expression of mentioned human caspases and cathepsins. The siRNA oligonucleotides were delivered to cells by reverse transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) by following the manufactures’ suggested protocol. Briefly, siRNA oligonucleotides (10 nM) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (2 µL) were diluted separately in an OptiMEM I medium (Life Technologies), mixed together, and incubated for at least 20 min at room temperature. The siRNA-RNAiMAX complex was then mixed with cell suspension which was then transferred to a cell culture plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h before further processing or infection.</p>
