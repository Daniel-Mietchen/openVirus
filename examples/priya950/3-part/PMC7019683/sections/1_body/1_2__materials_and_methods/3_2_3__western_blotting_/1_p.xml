<p>Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). The amount of protein was quantitated using a BCA kit (Thermo) [

 <sup>®</sup> Premium nitrocellulose membrane (GE healthcare). The membrane was then probed with mouse anti-cortactin (1:500; #05-180, clone 4F11, Millipore), rabbit anti-cortactin (1:500; #3502, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; #632592, Takara), rabbit anti-β-actin (1:2000; #ab8227, Abcam) or goat anti-NP (1:10,000; G150, kindly provided by Richard Webby, St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis (TN), USA) antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; #626520, Life Technologies), anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; #A16023, Life Technologies) or IRDye 680RD-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:50,000; #926-32214, LI-COR) antibody. The protein bands that were visualized by chemiluminescence or fluorescence and images were acquired on Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR). Images were then exported as TIFF files, minimally adjusted for brightness and contrast, and composed in figures in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 [
