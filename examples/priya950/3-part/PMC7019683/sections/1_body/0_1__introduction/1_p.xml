<p>Influenza virus causes a significant burden and remains a threat to global public health [

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and has been a successful human respiratory pathogen. A single-stranded, negative-sense, segmented RNA genome and a broad host range encompassing humans, birds, pigs, dogs, cats, horses, seals, and bats allow IAV to constantly circulate in nature and evolve into genetically diverse variants [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These variants cause regular seasonal epidemics, unpredictable pandemics, and lately frequent zoonotic outbreaks. Moreover, such evolving nature of IAV has prevented the development of a universal vaccine and aided IAV to successfully acquire the resistance against approved anti-influenza virus drugs [

The worldwide annual influenza vaccination programme, alternating in Northern and Southern Hemispheres, spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) is a major tool to prevent or control seasonal influenza virus epidemics. Nevertheless, influenza virus still manages to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide annually [
