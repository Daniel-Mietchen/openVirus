<p>As mentioned above, we previously used a caspase-3 inhibitor to identify the involvement of caspase-3 in cortactin degradation during IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, such an inhibitor could target other caspases too. To ascertain the involvement of caspase-3 and assess whether other executioner caspases, caspase-6 or -7 were involved in cortactin polypeptide degradation in response to IAV infection, we employed RNA interference and depleted the expression of caspase-3, -6, or -7 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in A549 cells using predesigned siRNA obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Then, the cells were infected with WSN, and the level of cortactin polypeptide was analysed and quantified by WB as described above. Consistent with previous data [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the depletion of caspase-3, but not caspase-6 or caspase-7 expression significantly rescued the level of cortactin polypeptide in infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Specifically, compared to a significant 71% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) reduction in cortactin polypeptide level in infected cells transfected with the control siRNA, there was only a nonsignificant 17% reduction in cortactin polypeptide level in infected cells transfected with the caspase-3 siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). In other words, the level of cortactin polypeptide in infected cells recovered from 29% to 83% after the depletion of caspase-3 expression. Whereas, there was no significant recovery in the cortactin polypeptide level in infected cells depleted with caspase-6 or caspase-7 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The depletion of caspase-3, -6, -7 expression was confirmed by qPCR (
