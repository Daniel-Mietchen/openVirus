<p>To quantify such recovery of cortactin polypeptide, we repeated the WB experiment with cathepsin C-depleted cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), and the intensity of cortactin and actin polypeptide bands was quantified using Image Studio Lite software (Version 5.0, LI-COR). Then, the amount of cortactin was normalized with the corresponding actin amount. Finally, the normalized amount of cortactin polypeptide in uninfected cells was considered 100% to determine its amount in infected cells. We found that compared to a significant 79% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) reduction in cortactin polypeptide level in infected cells transfected with the control siRNA, there was only a nonsignificant 41% reduction in cortactin polypeptide level in infected cells transfected with the cathepsin C siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In other words, the level of cortactin polypeptide in infected cells recovered from 21% to 59% after the depletion of cathepsin C expression, which was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>C).
