<p>Previously, by using the RNA interference-mediated depletion and ectopic expression of cortactin, we demonstrated that host cortactin promotes IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We also hypothesised that due to its branched filamentous actin-stabilising function that could be deleterious to IAV progeny assembly and release, cortactin is degraded during the late stages of IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. If this hypothesis was to be true, then the two degradation-resistant cortactin mutants, D93E and D116E generated here would interfere with the titres of IAV progeny released from infected cells. To test this, we expressed these two mutants alongside empty vector, degradation-sensitive WT cortactin and other degradation-sensitive cortactin mutants, D27E and D96E, and subsequently infected the cells with either WSN or influenza virus A/New Caledonia/20/1999/(H1N1) (hereafter referred to as NC) strains. After 24 h, the viral progeny released from these cells into the culture medium was quantified by microplaque assay. Consistent with previous observations, compared to empty vector expressing cells, there was a significant 48% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and 45% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) and 48% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) increase in the amount of WSN progeny released from the cells expressing degradation-sensitive WT cortactin and D27E and D96E mutants, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). However, compared to empty vector expressing cells, there was no significant change in the amount of WSN progeny released from the cells expressing degradation-resistant D93E and D116E mutants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Similarly, compared to empty vector expressing cells, there was a significant 59% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and 51% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and 48% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) increase in the amount of NC progeny released from the cells expressing WT cortactin and D27E and D96E mutants, respectively, and no significant change from the cells expressing D93E and D116E mutants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). These data, at least partly support our above-stated hypothesis. However, further investigations are needed to understand the actin filament-virion assembly/release dynamics on the surface of the cells expressing degradation-sensitive and degradation-resistant cortactin.
