  <p>The D93E and D116E mutations rescued cortactin polypeptide degradation in IAV infected cells. MDCK cells were transfected with plasmid expressing the wild type (WT) GFP-cortactin or GFP-cortactin containing D93E (
   <bold>A</bold>) or D116E (
   <bold>C</bold>) mutations for 48 h and subsequently infected with WSN at a MOI of 3.0. After 24 h, total cell lysates of uninfected (UNI) and infected (INF) cells were prepared, and cortactin (using anti-GFP antibody), actin, and viral NP polypeptides were detected by WB. (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>) The cortactin, NP and actin bands were quantified and normalized with actin as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. Then, the normalized level of WT cortactin and D93E cortactin (
   <bold>B</bold>) or D116E cortactin (
   <bold>D</bold>) in the respective uninfected sample was considered 100% to determine their levels in the corresponding infected sample. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The normalized level of NP in WT cortactin infected sample was considered 100% to determine its level in D93E cortactin or D116E cortactin infected sample. Error bar represents the means ± standard errors of the means of three biological replicates. The asterisks represent 
   <italic>p</italic>-values mentioned in the text calculated by ANOVA and indicate the significant differences in means; ns: Nonsignificant. Letters a and b indicate cleaved cortactin fragments; letter a’ indicates mobility shift in fragment a.
