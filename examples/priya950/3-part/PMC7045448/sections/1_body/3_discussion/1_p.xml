<p id="Par34">The overall findings indicate that mosquito-borne viral infections are an emerging and re-emerging health concern in the DRC. However, little attention has been paid and many questions on its epidemiology, socio-ecology and anthropology need to be addressed. While mosquito-borne viruses are re-emerging or emerging across the whole country, the north-western, north-eastern and western parts of the DRC are the most affected areas, experiencing multiple outbreaks compared to other parts of the country [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This geographical distribution pattern of mosquito-borne viruses appeared to be linked to profile of the distribution, diversity and abundance of their potential vector species; most likely to be influenced by climate distribution pattern in DRC. In the eastern region,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Indeed, the northern regions are experiencing an equatorial climate with rain throughout the year. From the central region to western region the climate is tropical with long rains, while in eastern and southern regions the climate is tropical but semi-arid. The Congo Basin has warmed between 0.2–0.3 °C per decade and reached 1 °C in 1992. The average annual precipitation has declined by 8–12% from 1960 to 1998. Climate change is manifested in DRC by short periods of heavy rainfall leading to multiple flooding events followed by early droughts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This considerable fluctuation in the climate regime causing either drought or flooding has an influence on vector abundance and diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Most probably, heavy rainfalls are creating suitable mosquito breeding habitats, hence transmission of mosquito-borne viruses. Nevertheless, due to climate variability and increasing population movements, these mosquito species might establish successfully over time and change this general trend. Although, there is evidence of ZIKV, DENV and RVFV circulation in DRC, no epidemic has been reported so far.
