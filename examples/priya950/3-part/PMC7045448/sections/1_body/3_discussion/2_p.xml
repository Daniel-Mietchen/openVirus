<p id="Par35">This review indicates that there is a dearth of information as regards to vector and transmission indices of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC. This underlines the importance of better identification of different local vectors in each region or specific area within regions, and to assess competence of the vectors to transmit mosquito-borne viruses. Intensive deforestation activities in Gemena city provided an opportunity for mosquito-borne viruses to emerge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is likely because of the degradation of the forest habitats during these activities, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes invaded the city and successfully established in their new habitats closer to humans, leading to a high human mosquito biting rate in a deforested area. Indeed, the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to deforestation warms up the climate and causes changes in rainfall patterns leading to conditions of flood or drought. The establishment of new suitable habitats is creating an opportunity for new mosquito species to proliferate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It was reported that mosquitoes which are known to be zoophilic and sylvatic have invaded the peridomestic and periurban settlements and started to feed on humans [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. A study in the Amazon concluded that deforestation is responsible for the increase in malaria incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This observation could emphasize the impact of significant deforestation observed across the DRC in relation to the emergence of mosquito-borne viral diseases and repeated outbreaks in the country. There is currently a need to investigate the impact of environmental factors and the role of climate change on current mosquito-borne virus geographical distribution and predicting potential distribution in the future.
