<p id="Par36">Climate change influences the frequency of mosquito-borne disease occurrence by affecting host and vector diversity, abundance, genetics and the pathogen infection load in the host and vector. Climate affects growth, survival and abundance of the vectors and virus replication load in the vector. Temperature is the major climate component susceptible to accelerate or decelerate mosquito reproduction and virus replication in the host depending on low and high temperature thresholds. Increased levels of precipitation lead to multiple microhabitats for oviposition and an efficient larval development pattern [
