<p id="Par17">Using PRISMA guidelines for systematic review, a literature search was carried out using Google Scholar and PubMed databases to find relevant information related to ecology and epidemiology of mosquito-borne viral infections in the DRC. Combinations of search keywords were used (“Belgian Congo” OR “Democratic Republic of the Congo” OR “Zaïre”) AND (“mosquito-borne virus” OR arbovirus OR “arthropod-borne virus” OR “yellow fever” OR “chikungunya” OR “dengue” OR “Rift Valley Fever virus” OR “West Nile virus” OR “Zika” OR “alphavirus” OR “flavivirus” OR “bunyavirus”). Additional information was searched from the World Health Organization (WHO) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.who.int</ext-link>) database. Articles in either English or French were included in the review. Initially, titles and abstracts were screened, then full text of articles identified as possibly relevant were reviewed. The bibliographies of included articles were assessed for further relevant publications. In case of duplicated articles, only one was considered in this study (Fig.
