<p id="Par24">The Democratic Republic of the Congo belongs to an endemic geographical area at high risk for YFV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. YFV transmission in DRC varies from one region to another and within the region. The absence of YFV circulation or lowest seroprevalence (&lt; 5%) has been observed from the provinces located in high altitudes covering the whole eastern region (Ituri, Sud-Kivu, Nord-Kivu, Maniema) and the southern region from former Katanga province (currently divided into Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami, Haut-Katanga, Lualaba) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The identified territories with high YFV transmission were Bosobolo and Mobayi-mbongo in the Province of Nord-Ubangi in the North-West, Ango and Bondo in the Province Bas-Uélé in the North-East region and in the Province of Kongo-Central in western DRC [

Lower seroprevalence rates (10–20%) have been reported along the Equator forest and in the central part of the country (Mai-Ndombe, Equateur, Kasai, Kasai-Central, Kasai-Oriental and Lomami provinces), as well as from provinces of Kwilu and Kwango in the western region [
