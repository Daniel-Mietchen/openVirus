<p id="Par21">A total of 69 articles were retrieved and 37 articles covering a period between 1912 and October 2018 were included in the present review. Seven mosquito-borne viruses belonging to three families, the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Alphaviridae</italic>, were recorded across the DRC. Among the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, four species, YFV, DENV, ZIKV and WNV, were recorded. Among the 
 <italic>Alphaviridae</italic>, two species, CHIKV and ONNV were reported. The recorded mosquito-borne viruses occurred either during an outbreak investigation, immediately after an outbreak, or occasionally during inter-epidemic periods. Most of the records were related to YFV and CHIKV. A number of studies were carried during colonial era before 1960 and around the beginning of the country’s independence in 1960. Most of the reports on mosquito-borne diseases were published between 1998 and 2018 (Fig.

 <italic>Aedes</italic> fauna in Kinshasa [
