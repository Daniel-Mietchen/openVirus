<p id="Par25">The two first reported chikungunya cases in the DRC occurred during a yellow fever outbreak in north-eastern region. The first was in 1958 in Haut-Uelé Province [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since then, no circulation of CHIKV was documented in DRC until 1998 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 1998, of 45 patients sampled during an outbreak of WNV in Kisangani City in Tshopo Province of the north-eastern region, 28.8% patients were found positive for CHIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These outbreaks occurred after heavy rains in the urban areas of Matete and Kingabwa municipalities. The third occurred in the sub-rural area of Ndaku-ya-Mpembe in the Kinkole municipality. More than half (57.9%) the samples tested positive for CHIKV IgM antibodies and nine strains were isolated in C6/36 cells [

In a retrospective countrywide surveillance study carried out between 2003 and 2011, of the 453 sera screened, two positive cases of CHIKV were detected by RT-PCR. One case was from Gemena in the Sud-Ubangi Province in north-western DRC and the other from the Province of Kwilu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a survey carried out in 2015, from 96 patients tested negative for malaria in Kinshasa, the seroprevalence of CHIKV was 9.6% and 5 samples were found positive for CHIKV by RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Based on a genetic study, the isolates of CHIKV that were found to circulate in DRC belonged to the Congo genotype which is closely related to the Central African Republic and Uganda isolates [

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). African buffalo, chimpanzee and elephant from Haut-Uelé Province have been identified as potential hosts or reservoirs of CHIKV by detecting the presence of antibodies from these species (Table
