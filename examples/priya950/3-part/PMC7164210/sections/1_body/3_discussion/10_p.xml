<p id="Par53">The outcomes of this study indicate that the inclusion of spatial and temporal autocorrelation analyses in the existing software (LIRAa System) used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health can provide a new strategy to identify the hotspots neighbourhoods, responsible for the most influence on mosquito infestation. This information is helpful for adopting and directing control vector actions with less impact on material and human resources. There is a gap in the literature in relation to the quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used to predict outbreaks [

Further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission, which could be performed in comparable areas based on spatial autocorrelation methodologies. In the same municipality, it will be possible to compare the hotspot areas with high frequency of vector mosquitoes with those with low frequency to identify characteristics of each.
