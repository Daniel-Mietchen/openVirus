<p id="Par51">To carry out the analysis of the LIRAa, neighbourhoods are grouped into strata with up to 12,000 inhabitants defined mostly by their sociodemographic, economic and physical characteristics. For this set of neighbourhoods, a single LIRAa value is obtained. This study found that the analysis of autocorrelation and spatial dependence between the neighbourhoods does not correspond to the demarcation of the strata. The autocorrelation analysis of mosquito infestation is more useful due to its ability to reveal patterns regarding risk analysis and vector management, including the definition of specific localities to be considered priority or a hotspot for the surveillance services.</p>
