<p id="Par47">Other studies conducted in Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] have shown that larval indices may be closely related to the incidence of dengue epidemics and arboviruses. In Brazil, similar research was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Maranhão [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These studies used the infestation index in isolation; this differs from the present study which shows that patterns of spatial distribution and risk levels from small territorial units of analysis (census tracts, for example), can indicate that these risks can be connected into larger units, especially amongst adjoining neighbourhoods.
