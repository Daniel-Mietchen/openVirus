<p id="Par48">Some studies have examined land use and larval density. In Thailand, it has been observed that settlements around gas stations and workshops nearby swampland, marshes and paddy fields appear to be favourable habitats for vector propagation [

The approach here described may show how these favourable habitats for mosquito proliferation impact on contiguous areas, helping to redefine the risk territories and allow for a better direction of surveillance and resourcing to combat the disease vectors.
