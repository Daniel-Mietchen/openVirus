<p id="Par29">The Moran scatter plot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighbouring locations. For this purpose, the diagram is divided into four quadrants (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) with the following interpretation: (i) Q1: the first quadrant (upper right) shows the areas that have high values for the variable in question surrounded by neighbouring areas which also have above-average values for the variable under analysis. This quadrant is classified as high-high (AA, + +); (ii) Q2: the second quadrant (lower left) shows the areas that have low values for the variable in question surrounded by neighbouring areas that also have below-average values for the analysed variables. This quadrant is classified as low-low (BB, − −); (iii) Q3: the third quadrant (lower right) shows the areas that have high values for the variable under analysis surrounded by neighbouring areas that have values below the average for the variable in question. This quadrant is classified as high-low (AB, + −); and (iv) Q4: the fourth quadrant (upper left) shows areas that have low values for the variable under analysis surrounded by areas that are above the average for the variable in question. This quadrant is classified as low-high (BA, − +).</p>
