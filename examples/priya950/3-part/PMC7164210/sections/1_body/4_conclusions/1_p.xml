<p id="Par55">To our knowledge, this study showed for the first time the autocorrelation patterns of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infestation rates among neighbourhoods in the city of Campina Grande, in northeastern Brazil, using Moran ºs index, Moran mapping and LISA mapping. The use of spatial and temporal autocorrelation revealed hotpots or neighbourhoods that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. The predominance of high infestation rates and greater spatial dependence was observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly in mosquito prevention actions.
