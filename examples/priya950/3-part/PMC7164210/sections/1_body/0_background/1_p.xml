 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a widespread vector of several viruses, is still considered a major challenge for public health authorities, especially in developing countries. In Brazil, epidemics of the diseases transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, i.e. dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been responsible for significant human and economic losses, and led the authorities to formulate strategies to attempt to increase vector control [
