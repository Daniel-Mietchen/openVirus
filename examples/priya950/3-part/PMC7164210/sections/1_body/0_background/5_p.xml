<p id="Par14">The presence or absence of dengue vectors is measured using three key indices: house index (HI: the percentage of houses infested with larvae and/or pupae); Breteau index (BI: the number of positive containers per 100 houses); container index (CI: the percentage of water-holding containers infested with larvae or pupae) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These indices may facilitate understanding of the ecology of vectors in a given control area, but they also serve as useful measures for determining the success of intervention strategies [
