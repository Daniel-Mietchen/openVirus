<p id="Par15">According to the PNCD, HI values above 4% indicate risk of dengue outbreak; above 1% and below 3.9%, alert situation; and below or equal 1%, satisfactory situation. BI above 5 indicates a risk situation. These thresholds are currently used by the surveillance services to plan and execute preventive actions, such as spraying insecticides in some neighbourhoods. However, in the literature, there is no evidence of correlation between larval density and disease transmission. It means that these thresholds cannot be useful to predict outbreaks [
