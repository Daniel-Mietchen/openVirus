<p id="Par17">In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of infestation of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were investigated, using LIRAa data from the period 2014 to 2017 for Campina Grande City, Brazil. This was completed in order to evaluate the potential of using the autocorrelation statistics between neighbourhoods as an infestation indicator. Moreover, the concept of strata within the LIRAa data was devised and investigated for their potential contribution to the targeting of, and possibly greater effectiveness of, vector control actions.
