<p id="Par36">The autocorrelation of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito infestation between the city neighbourhoods studied can be identified by the Global Moran index map (map of quartiles) for HI and BI (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, respectively) which shows the similarity in terms of the infestation of neighbouring areas. The positive values of the LIRAa shown by the increasingly dark shades used on the map indicate the clusters with similar spatial autocorrelation values and with statistical significance. Negative values on the LIRAa are represented by white, showing that there are dissimilar spatial clusters between contiguous areas. On the map, there is a prevalence of darker shades, indicating that most neighbourhoods have similar infestation values. The neighbourhoods with positive correlation did not necessarily correspond to those which belong to the same stratum based on similar LIRAa values indicating that the neighbourhoods belonging to the same stratum are not necessarily autocorrelated.
