<p id="Par40">In 2017, approximately 81% of the neighbourhoods were at high risk in the first LIRAa (February). There was an improvement in indicators in the second LIRAa, but still approximately 65% of neighbourhoods were at high risk, 30% at medium risk and only 5% at low risk, culminating in an overall infestation rate of 4.9%. The final survey of the year, held in July, showed a significant increase again in infestation levels: back up to 87% of neighbourhoods at high risk and 13% at medium risk. The neighbourhoods of Malvinas, President Medici and Cruzeiro remained with a high level of infestation across all the different measurements (10%).</p>
