<p id="Par33">According to the global Moranʼs index (W), a significant spatial autocorrelation among the analysed neighbourhoods (
 <italic>n</italic> = 51) for the most of dependent variables (HI and BI) was observed with 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), during the period 2014–2017. This result indicates that there is a clear spatial dependence in the mosquito infestation proportion among neighbourhoods, demonstrating that those in close proximity have a greater risk of cross-infestation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
