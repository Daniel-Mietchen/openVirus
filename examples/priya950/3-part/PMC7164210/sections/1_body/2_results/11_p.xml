<p id="Par42">Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> showed the Moran scatterplots, the LISA maps, and the Moran maps for HI and BI obtained in 2017. The scatterplots demonstrate the localities that were in the +/+ quadrant (i.e. showed a positive correlation with mosquito infestation) and these are shown on the Moran maps in black. The neighbourhoods in the −/− quadrant, shown in grey, are those with a negative value in the LIRAa data. The Moran maps directly represent the observations on the scatterplot onto the urban map. For example, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> (HI for 2017), Malvinas (in black), which comprises one of the poorest populations of the Campina Grande city, exerts a positive influence on the indicators. The LISA maps for each LIRAa survey show the alpha significance values, ranging from non-significant (white) to significant values (5% in light grey and 0.1% in black). The neighbourhoods in black are those that had the most significant influence on other localities.
