 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> present the global Moran map index (map of quartiles) for HI and BI, respectively, for three LIRAs performed in 2017. The dark shades indicate the clusters with similar spatial autocorrelation values and with statistical significance. It is possible to observe a repetition in the pattern of autocorrelated areas throughout the year.
