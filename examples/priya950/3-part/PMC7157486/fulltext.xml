It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC, the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak. The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance. It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts, often directed against the inhabitants, healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers. EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy&#x02014;previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants, with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%. The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD, being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the &#x000c9;quateur DRC Ebola outbreak. But from the start of the Kivu outbreak, policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts. In June 2019, this policy was reversed, 10 months after the start of the outbreak. Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ebola virus</kwd><kwd>Ebola vaccine</kwd><kwd>Democratic Republic of the Congo</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>maternal death</kwd><kwd>rVSV-ZEBOV</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>hemorrhagic fever</kwd><kwd>excluding pregnant women</kwd><kwd>epidemic</kwd><kwd>filovirus</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>vaccinating pregnant women</kwd><kwd>humanitarian crisis</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd><kwd>conflict area</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-08-00038"><title>1.

It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Throughout multiple outbreaks of EVD, the infection has had a significant case fatality rate (CFR) among all persons who became infected, but historically the mortality has been especially high among pregnant women, fetuses and infants (less than 1 year of age) [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Prior to the West African Ebola epidemic which began in Guinea in December 2013, it was generally believed that EVD occurring in a pregnant woman was close to being non-survivable. Previous Ebola outbreaks had demonstrated that from 75 to greater than 90 percent of infected pregnant women had died as a result of EVD [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>This high mortality rate is typical among filoviruses, a family of viruses to which the Ebola virus belongs. A related group of African filoviruses, the Marburg and Ravn viruses, also exhibit high mortality rates, and especially among pregnant women and their infants [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Until recently, there were no specific forms of treatment or prevention of Ebola virus infection&#x02014;patients were treated symptomatically. However, this situation changed with the advent of the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which was to become the largest in history. By this time, there were not only several medications that had become available for testing, but a recombinant vaccine, the rVSV-ZEBOV (also termed V920) vaccine, produced by Merck that underwent its first human clinical trial during the epidemic.</p><p>This article reviews the history of Ebola virus outbreaks in DRC with particular attention to its effect on pregnant women and their infants, and examines the development, accessibility and distribution of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to pregnant and lactating women during the ongoing outbreak that began in Kivu province in 2018. Also examined is the policy of exclusion of pregnant and lactating women and their infants from the clinical trials, and subsequently the distribution, of this vaccine through the most recent three Ebola epidemics [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-08-00038"><title>2. Pregnancy and the Ebola Virus in Democratic Republic of the Congo</title><p>Up to the present, there have been a total of 10 outbreaks of EVD in DRC. Those occurring prior to 2018 include outbreaks in Yambuku in 1976, Tandala in 1977, Kikwit in 1995, Mweka in 2007, Luebo in 2008, Isiro in 2012, Tshuapa in 2014, and Likati in 2017 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00038-f001">Figure 1</xref>). All outbreaks were caused by the Ebola Zaire subtype, except for the Isiro outbreak which was due to Ebola Bundibugyo. The outbreaks caused by the Ebola Zaire virus were between 51 and 75 cases; the Isiro outbreak involved 52 persons [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There has historically been a higher number of women infected compared with men&#x02014;this is at least partly due to girls and women being the traditional caretakers of the sick and their significant involvement in funerary arrangements.</p><p>During outbreaks of Ebola virus and related viral infections in Africa, pregnant women face more severe consequences of disease, and have increased risks for morbidity, mortality and risk of fetal loss or congenital harm to the developing infant [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is at least partially the result of such biological factors as the altered immune state in pregnancy, the role of the placenta in vertical transmission and immune modulation, and other physiological changes in pregnancy that can affect the clinical manifestations of disease [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In particular, women in the reproductive age group, and especially pregnant and lactating women, constitute a significant percentage of the female population in areas that viral hemorrhagic fevers strike. This is at least partly due to the high fertility rates and early ages of marriage in many regions where outbreaks occur. The DR Congo is the third most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, and is one of the few countries where the current fertility rate is greater than it had been in the 1950s [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Teenage pregnancy in DRC contributes to these metrics&#x02014;27% of women age 15&#x02013;19 have begun childbearing, while 21% are already mothers and 6% are currently pregnant. Adolescent fertility is nearly three times higher among young women living in the poorest households (42%) than among those living in the wealthiest households (15%) [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the latest survey, the mean ideal number of children has been reported at 6.6, with even higher numbers in rural and poor areas [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, greater than one half (52%) of the household population in DRC is made up of children under age 15 [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As a result, women in the DRC spend a greater part of their lives pregnant and caring for infants than do women in other countries. In addition to these factors, the gender dynamics of girls&#x02019; and women&#x02019;s caregiving roles, which include being the primary providers of care for the sick and involvement in funeral procedures, place them at heightened risks of exposure and greater rates of infection [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There can also be greater risks of Ebola virus exposure for pregnant women resulting from more frequent visits to healthcare settings for antenatal and obstetrical care, as occurred in the 1976 Ebola outbreak in Yambuku in which 46% of 177 women infected with Ebola were pregnant [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is clear from these demographic data that withholding vaccine coverage to pregnant women and infants results in a great unmet need for protection during EVD outbreaks and ring vaccination programs.</p><p>While being pregnant and infected with Ebola virus is not new in DRC, having mothers and their infants survive the infection is. The case (maternal) fatality rate (CFR) among pregnant women with EVD during the initial outbreak in Yambuku was high&#x02014;73 (89%) of the 82 infected women who were pregnant died, a case (maternal) mortality rate of 89% [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The rate of spontaneous abortions was 23% (19/82). During this initial outbreak in Yambuku, all 10 liveborn infants that were delivered to infected mothers subsequently died within 19 days of life from Ebola virus infection [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The highest maternal and infant CFRs reported for EVD occurred during the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, DRC (then Zaire). Fifteen of the 105 (14%) Ebola-infected women were pregnant, and only one of the 15 EVD-infected pregnant women survived&#x02014;a CFR of 93% [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Four pregnant women died from Ebola infection during the third trimester. The sole surviving mother among these women had a curettage because of an incomplete abortion after 8 months of amenorrhea [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, it should be considered that all of these women were probably infected by means of the repeated use of contaminated needles for vitamin injections in routine antenatal care without sterilization between patients, and that this parenteral route of transmission is hypothesized to have contributed to the high CFR [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Perinatal infant mortality during the Kikwit outbreak was also high&#x02014;10 women (66 percent) had spontaneous abortions, and one woman delivered a premature stillborn infant.</p><p>Following the Kikwit outbreak, an EVD outbreak occurred in Isiro, DRC in 2012. A 29-year-old mother at 7 months gestation developed EVD and had a premature delivery on day 6 of her infection; the mother succumbed to EVD one day following delivery, and the infant died at 8 days of life [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Isiro outbreak eventually affected 58 persons, with 28 deaths.</p><p>Analysis of all EVD outbreaks in Africa prior to the West Africa epidemic reveals that there were 111 reported cases of pregnant women who had acquired the infection, with an aggregate CFR of 86% [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Every Ebola-infected pregnant woman that had survived did so only after a spontaneous miscarriage, elective abortion, stillbirth, or with a neonatal death [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All Ebola-infected pregnant women sustained vaginal and uterine bleeding and were at a significantly increased risk for both spontaneous abortion and pregnancy-related hemorrhage [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>At the start of the West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014, and based upon prior outbreaks in which close to 90 percent of infected pregnant women and 100 percent of fetuses died as a result of EVD, it was generally believed that almost all, if not all, pregnant women with Ebola infection would soon succumb to the disease [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In an interview performed early in the West Africa epidemic, a representative from a non-governmental organization had opined that the survival rate for expectant mothers was virtually zero [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In a report published in 2015 [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the probability for maternal and infant survival of EVD was summarized as follows:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>Present data suggests that maternal mortality remains high (approximately 95%) and peri-natal mortality virtually 100% for infected pregnant women</italic>.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>In the beginning of the West Africa Ebola epidemic, there existed no approved specific treatments or vaccines for the infection. Clinical interventions consisted of supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte management, analgesia, support of blood pressure, management of coagulopathy, treatment of secondary infections, and a case-by-case management of other complications [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Medical treatments that had been proposed had not undergone clinical trials in Ebola virus-infected populations or at all [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Experimental vaccines were in the very early stages of development, and just a few had entered Phase I safety and immunogenicity trials. As the epidemic progressed and the fatalities increased, numerous proposals for clinical trials were submitted to the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee (WHO-ERC), the committee that evaluated and approved proposed potential clinical investigations including new and amended protocols for experimental interventional (drug, vaccine) and observational studies [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. From August 2014 to April 2016, WHO-ERC evaluated 24 new EVD-protocols and 22 amendments, all of which excluded pregnant and lactating women and infants under 1 year of age. The proposed clinical trials for two promising antiviral drugs&#x02014;brincidofovir and favipiravir&#x02014;also excluded women who were pregnant for a variety of reasons (potential embryotoxicity for brincidofover and lack of insurance coverage for favipiravir) [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The WHO-ERC recognized that excluding pregnant women and their infants from drug and vaccine clinical trials undermined ethical principles of justice&#x02014;fairness, equity and maximization of benefit, and that it would deny them the potential life-saving benefits from what was believed to be an almost universally fatal infection [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because of this, the WHO-ERC systematically requested amendments to these protocols in order to include pregnant women and children. Despite their efforts as well as those of the M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF) Ethics Review Board and Inserm Institutional Review Board to have the applicants reconsider their exclusion of pregnant women, the necessity for rapid implementation of field trials had priority over the delays that would have been encountered in pursuing revision of the protocols to include pregnant women. The West Africa Ebola epidemic included many &#x0201c;firsts&#x0201d; for an Ebola epidemic&#x02014;it was also the first time that a vaccine was fielded for preventative use for this infection. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine had been developed by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory, licensed to NewLink Genetics, and subsequently sublicensed to Merck, which has been the manufacturer and partner in ongoing research, licensure, and compassionate use efforts [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B45-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. rVSV-ZW+EBOV is a live-attenuated vector vaccine using recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus to encode the glycoprotein of the Ebola Zaire strain. During its clinical testing conducted during the epidemic, an open-label, cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial (Ebola &#x000e7;a suffit!) of rVSV-ZEBOV in Guinea and Sierra Leone showed protective effects in non-pregnant adults. The WHO-ERC and Data Safety Monitoring Board requested that pregnant women receive the vaccine. Despite this, 42 pregnant women were denied participation in the trial [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During the West Africa epidemic, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine underwent extensive clinical study including multiple Phase I&#x02013;III human clinical trials in non-pregnant persons to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. But by the close of the epidemic, pregnant women, their fetuses and newborns had been systematically excluded from all vaccine clinical trials [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The first evidence indicative of the safety of administration of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine during pregnancy arose during the Ebola Phase III cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial in Guinea (Ebola &#x000e7;a suffit!) [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because pregnancy tests were not being routinely performed, and a woman&#x02019;s pregnancy status was based upon her own self-reporting, there were 23 pregnant women who were inadvertently administered the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the small sample size is suboptimal for statistical analysis and there was some loss of clinical follow-up, preliminary evaluation indicated that these women did not have significant differences in pregnancy loss when compared with non-pregnant women who received the vaccine [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further preliminary data on the effects of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine among pregnant women have come from the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE), a randomized, unblinded Phase II/III trial conducted in 2015. Despite the exclusion criteria for this study including current pregnancy (pregnancy testing was required for all women &#x0003c;50 years old) as well as breastfeeding, there were 104 pregnancies that developed among 103 women (43 vaccinated, 60 unvaccinated) with an estimated onset within 2 months following vaccination or enrollment. Preliminary outcomes data among those women with known pregnancy outcomes have revealed no significant differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers [<xref rid="B47-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>While the West Africa Ebola epidemic was increasing in severity, on 24 August 2014 district officials in the DRC notified the WHO of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the Boende district in &#x000c9;quateur province. The index case of this outbreak was a pregnant woman&#x02014;the wife of a bushmeat hunter. This pregnancy had a bad outcome&#x02014;the mother died together with her fetus, who remained in utero [<xref rid="B48-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although this outbreak was at first believed to have a connection with the West Africa Ebola epidemic which was occurring at the same time, results of virologic analysis showed that the Ebola strain in the Boende outbreak was related to the Ebola strain that caused the Kikwit, Zaire (DRC) outbreak in 1995, and not the same strain as was spreading in West Africa [<xref rid="B49-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Almost four years after the close of the West Africa epidemic, on 3 May 2018 health authorities from the &#x000c9;quateur province of northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that 17 persons had become ill with EVD near Bikoro, a small market town next to Lake Tumba south of Mbdanka, near the neighboring Republic of the Congo. This &#x000c9;quateur outbreak of Ebola virus was the ninth to occur in the DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976 [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The index case was identified to be a police officer. Following his funeral, 11 members of his family also developed the infection, of whom seven had provided care for him or attended his funeral. On 17 May, the first case of EVD was reported from Mbadanka, the capital city of &#x000c9;quateur province and a busy port city with over one million persons located on the Congo River. This was the first time that Ebola virus had reached a city in the DRC, and it rekindled fears of when Ebola virus had reached urban areas during the West African epidemic.

Conflict in Kivu</title><p>In order to understand the challenges of controlling an epidemic in the Kivu region of DRC, it is necessary to understand the nature of the hostilities that have been ongoing for over 25 years. This armed conflict is the world&#x02019;s deadliest conflict since World War II, with over 5.4 million people dead and greater than 3 million displaced since the violence began in the mid-1990s. Following the multiethnic and multinational First Congo War (1996&#x02013;1997) and Second Congo War (1998&#x02013;2003), a rebel group supported by Rwanda sought the overthrow of the Congolese president Laurent-D&#x000e9;sir&#x000e9; Kabila. A Congolese-borne Tutsi officer in the Rwandan-supported rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (<italic>Rassemblement Congolais pour la D&#x000e9;mocratie or</italic> RCD), A rebel leader, Laurent-Desire Kabila, who was originally backed by Kagame, turned against him and kicked out the Rwandan forces, starting the second Congo war.several thousand Rwandan Hutus came into Kivu due to a political upheaval after the genocide of Tutsis and Hutu moderates by hardline Hutus several thousand Rwandan Hutus came into Kivu due to a political upheaval after the genocide of Tutsis and Hutu moderates by hardline HutusLaurent Nkunda, joined the new integrated national army of the DRC. After his promotion to General in 2004 Nkunda rejected the authority of the DRC government, retreating with RCD-Goma troops to the Masisi forests in North Kivu. Several thousand Rwandan Hutus had fled to Kivu due to a political upheaval after the genocide of Tutsis and Hutu moderates by hardline Hutus. Together with his troops, Nkunda conducted armed rebellion against the government of Joseph Kabila, thus initiating the Kivu Conflict. Nkunda claimed that his actions were to prevent genocide against the Banyamulenge, an ethnic Tutsi people residing in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC. However, many sources consider that the active and illegal trade in minerals and the financial gain in selling these resources to both national and international brokers has fueled this conflict, leading to the term for such minerals as &#x0201c;the engines of chaos&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B53-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

In addition to these groups, smaller cohorts of armed individuals, collectively termed Mai Mai, are involved and led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated pro- or anti-government fighters. Since the Kivu conflict began, the effects of constant armed threats and conflict have resulted in the North and South Kivu provinces regressing into regions controlled by armed militia groups. It has been estimated by some researchers that there are currently greater than 70 armed groups operating in the Kivu region [<xref rid="B55-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; the Congo Research Group of New York University has estimated as many as 134 armed groups are operating in North and South Kivu [<xref rid="B56-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

These data, considered together with the most reliable available population statistics, are indicative of 8.38 civilians being killed per 100,000 people in the Kivu provinces for the single year 2018. Thus, the Kivu region is one of the worst imaginable places for an epidemic of Ebola virus to occur, as it continues to see levels of violence as high as some of the most violent places in the world&#x02014;higher even than in Nigeria&#x02019;s Borno State (the state most affected by Boko Haram and al-Qaeda in West Africa) and Yemen [<xref rid="B57-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

North Kivu province is a densely populated region that borders Uganda to the east and Rwanda to the south. As summarized above, the North Kivu region of DRC had been embroiled in a series of civil wars and armed conflicts for decades.

Vaccination using the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was begun on 8 August, and a ring vaccination program was implemented in an attempt to stop spread of transmission. In this program, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was offered to contacts of known cases and the contacts of contacts, including any individual over 1 year of age. The DRC Ministry of Health, together with WHO and other partners, decided that pregnant and lactating women would, once again, be excluded from receiving rVSV-ZEBOV, the only Ebola vaccine to have completed efficacy testing.

On 19 April, there was an attack against a hospital in Katwa by armed militia members that resulted in the death of Dr. Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a WHO epidemiologist, and injury of two other healthcare workers [<xref rid="B88-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In the same month, it was estimated that up to 60,000 persons fled their homes as a result of fighting around Kamango near the town of Beni, and an additional 50,000 fled in the neighboring Lubero Territory due to violence between the Congolese Army and Mai Mai armed groups [<xref rid="B89-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p><p>The cause of delay in initiating vaccination of pregnant women and infants was the result of modifications to the immunization protocol requested by the DRC&#x02019;s National Ethics Committee [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This months-long delay in vaccinating put hundreds of pregnant women and their fetuses at risk. According to Professor Steve Ahuka, Director of Virology at DRC&#x02019;s National Institute of Biomedical Research, these modifications included women in their first trimester of pregnancy being excluded from vaccination.

The first pregnant women finally received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine on 13 June&#x02014;almost 10 months after the outbreak began.

The Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN Vaccine Becomes Available Including Pregnant Women and Children</title><p>On 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new recommendations that included introducing an additional experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the Janssen Division of Johnson &#x00026; Johnson [<xref rid="B90-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This vaccine, an adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN-Filo (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) vaccine regimen, had been designated as the second vaccine to be used in the outbreak. The two-dose vaccination regimen includes Ad26.ZEBOV as the first dose, which is based on Janssen&#x02019;s AdVac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology, and MVA-BN-Filo as the second dose, which is based on Bavarian Nordic&#x02019;s MVA-BN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology and is administered approximately 8 weeks later. This vaccination regimen uses a viral vector strategy in which viruses&#x02014;adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)&#x02014;have been genetically modified so that they cannot replicate in human cells, while safely inducing the production of Ebola virus proteins in order to trigger an immune response [<xref rid="B91-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Because of the inability for viral replication to occur in vaccinated persons, it was believed that this regimen might provide an option that health officials would be more comfortable recommending for pregnant women.</p><p>On 12 November 2019, the DRC&#x02019;s technical committee (CMRE) announced that vaccination would be initiated on 14 November 2019 in two health areas of Goma, the capital city of North Kivu province, using the newly developed second vaccine. Everyone would be eligible to receive this vaccine, including children over the age of one year, as well as pregnant and lactating women. Women of childbearing age will be offered a pregnancy test, and if declined, will still receive the J&#x00026;J vaccine. Pregnant women who receive the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine will be followed, according to Dr. V&#x000e9;ronique Urbaniak, the Vaccine Project Coordinator at MSF, France [<xref rid="B92-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec6-vaccines-08-00038"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>Pregnant and lactating women and their infants have been continually denied access to vaccination for Ebola virus disease since the development and clinical trials of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, beginning with the West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014. In spite of calls from the public health, biomedical and bioethics communities, this policy of exclusion continued through two subsequent Ebola virus disease outbreaks in DRC, including the &#x000c9;quateur province outbreak in 2018 and, just one week after its termination, the Kivu outbreak. The Kivu outbreak has been a humanitarian crisis that originated in an active conflict zone, which has severely affected the ability of relief efforts and vaccination, and has developed into the second largest Ebola outbreak in history. The previous exclusion of vaccination of pregnant women and infants continued into this epidemic, despite the fact that there was a predominance of women, children and infants who developed Ebola infection. By the beginning of June 2019, there were 131,000 persons, none of them pregnant, who had been administered the life-saving vaccine. Eventually, reevaluation of the restrictive policies resulted in the accessibility of pregnant and lactating women for vaccination, and ten months after the epidemic began the first pregnant women received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The author declares no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-vaccines-08-00038"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Soucheray</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>DRC&#x02019;s 426-Case Ebola Outbreak Now 2nd Largest Ever</article-title><comment>Available online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/drcs-426-case-ebola-outbreak-now-2nd-largest-ever">http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/drcs-426-case-ebola-outbreak-now-2nd-largest-ever</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation content-type="access-date" iso-8601-date="2019-11-02">(accessed on 2 November 2019)</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-vaccines-08-00038"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group><article-title>Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo</article-title><comment>Available online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/17-05-2018-RRA-first-update-Ebola%20haemorrhagic%20fever-Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo.pdf">https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/17-05-2018-RRA-first-update-Ebola%20haemorrhagic%20fever-Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo.pdf</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation content-type="access-date" iso-8601-date="2019-09-08">(accessed on 8 September 2019)</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3-vaccines-08-00038"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Breman</surname><given-names>J.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Heymann</surname><given-names>D.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lloyd</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>J.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Miatudila</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>F.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Muyemb&#x000e9;-Tamfun</surname><given-names>J.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Piot</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruppol</surname><given-names>J.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sureau</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Discovery and description of Ebola Zaire virus in 1976 and relevance to the West African epidemic during 2013-2016</article-title><source>J.
