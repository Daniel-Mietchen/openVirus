<p>The first evidence indicative of the safety of administration of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine during pregnancy arose during the Ebola Phase III cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial in Guinea (Ebola ça suffit!) [

Although the small sample size is suboptimal for statistical analysis and there was some loss of clinical follow-up, preliminary evaluation indicated that these women did not have significant differences in pregnancy loss when compared with non-pregnant women who received the vaccine [

Further preliminary data on the effects of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine among pregnant women have come from the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE), a randomized, unblinded Phase II/III trial conducted in 2015. Despite the exclusion criteria for this study including current pregnancy (pregnancy testing was required for all women &lt;50 years old) as well as breastfeeding, there were 104 pregnancies that developed among 103 women (43 vaccinated, 60 unvaccinated) with an estimated onset within 2 months following vaccination or enrollment. Preliminary outcomes data among those women with known pregnancy outcomes have revealed no significant differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers [
