<p>During outbreaks of Ebola virus and related viral infections in Africa, pregnant women face more severe consequences of disease, and have increased risks for morbidity, mortality and risk of fetal loss or congenital harm to the developing infant [

 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is at least partially the result of such biological factors as the altered immune state in pregnancy, the role of the placenta in vertical transmission and immune modulation, and other physiological changes in pregnancy that can affect the clinical manifestations of disease [

 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In particular, women in the reproductive age group, and especially pregnant and lactating women, constitute a significant percentage of the female population in areas that viral hemorrhagic fevers strike. This is at least partly due to the high fertility rates and early ages of marriage in many regions where outbreaks occur. The DR Congo is the third most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, and is one of the few countries where the current fertility rate is greater than it had been in the 1950s [

Teenage pregnancy in DRC contributes to these metrics—27% of women age 15–19 have begun childbearing, while 21% are already mothers and 6% are currently pregnant. Adolescent fertility is nearly three times higher among young women living in the poorest households (42%) than among those living in the wealthiest households (15%) [

 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, greater than one half (52%) of the household population in DRC is made up of children under age 15 [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As a result, women in the DRC spend a greater part of their lives pregnant and caring for infants than do women in other countries. In addition to these factors, the gender dynamics of girls’ and women’s caregiving roles, which include being the primary providers of care for the sick and involvement in funeral procedures, place them at heightened risks of exposure and greater rates of infection [

 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There can also be greater risks of Ebola virus exposure for pregnant women resulting from more frequent visits to healthcare settings for antenatal and obstetrical care, as occurred in the 1976 Ebola outbreak in Yambuku in which 46% of 177 women infected with Ebola were pregnant [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is clear from these demographic data that withholding vaccine coverage to pregnant women and infants results in a great unmet need for protection during EVD outbreaks and ring vaccination programs.
