<p>The Ebola outbreak continued to rapidly spread, and by November 2018 the infection was reported from two provinces—North Kivu and Ituri—as well as 14 health zones. Surveillance data revealed that there was a predominance of women who were becoming infected, especially in the reproductive age group [

 <xref rid="B77-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], with one in 10 cases of EVD occurring in children less than 5 years of age. As of 12 January 2019, a total of 595 confirmed and 49 probable cases of EVD had occurred in 16 health zones in DRC, with a CFR of 58% among confirmed cases—a total of 59,453 persons had received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, none of them pregnant or less than one year of age [

 <italic>why are some vaccinated and some not?</italic>’ Qualitative data collected by UNICEF from pregnant and lactating women in Beni in October 2018 demonstrated their concern that children (who they regarded to be at high risk because ‘
 <italic>they play in decontaminated houses</italic>’ and ‘
 <italic>sleep in the beds of their mothers</italic>’) were not being routinely vaccinated. In Beni and Butembo, only 66% of respondents agreed with the statement that they ‘
 <italic>believe the Ebola vaccine works</italic>’, and just 63% stated that they would accept the vaccine if it was available to them. Among the 37% of interviewees who had said they would refuse the vaccine, 71% believed it was ‘
 <italic>dangerous</italic>’ and 23% believed that it did not work (in comparison to 12% of the total survey respondents who thought vaccines, in general, were unsafe and 9% that vaccines did not work) [
