<p>The human HEK293T cells were grown at 37 Â°C to approximately 80% confluence in 10 cm tissue culture dishes using DMEM with 5% Hyclone Fetal Clone II (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Logan, UT, USA) and 1X antibiotic and antimycotic (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Expression plasmids containing the heavy- and light-chain sequences for KPF1 or the isotype control were transfected into HEK293T cells using jetPRIME transfection reagent (PolyPlus, New York, NY, USA) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Media was harvested and replenished three times over 8 days. IgG was purified from culture supernatant using Magne Protein A beads (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the elution buffer was exchanged with PBS using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore-Sigma, Cork, Ireland).
