<p>Virus microneutralization assays (MNAs) were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, KPF1-HEK or KPF1-Antx hMAbs, or IgG1 isotype controls, were 2-fold serially diluted in PBS in 96 well plates (starting concentrations of 200 µg/mL). One hundred plaque forming units (PFUs) of each virus (Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, WI/H1N1, GA/H1N1, and Brisbane/H3N2) were then added to the hMAb dilutions and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. MDCK cells (96 well plate format, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, quadruplicates) were then infected with the hMAb-virus mixture for 1 h at room temperature. After viral adsorption, cells were maintained in p.i. medium, with 1 µg/mL of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, MO, USA), and incubated at 37 °C. Virus neutralization was determined by crystal violet staining at 72 h p.i. The neutralization titer 50 (NT
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by a sigmoidal dose response curve (GraphPad Prism, v7.0) [
