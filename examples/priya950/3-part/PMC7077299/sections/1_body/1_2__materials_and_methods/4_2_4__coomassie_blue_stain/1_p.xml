<p>Total amounts of 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, and 0.313 μg of KPF1-HEK or KPF1-Antx hMAbs were mixed with loading buffer and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final volume of 20 μL. After being separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue staining solution (0.05% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, 45% methanol, and 7% acetic acid) overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) at room temperature for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA, USA) at room temperature for another 1 h. The blot was developed with ECL detection reagent (Thermo Fisher, California, CA, USA) in the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad, Pennsylvania, PA, USA).</p>
