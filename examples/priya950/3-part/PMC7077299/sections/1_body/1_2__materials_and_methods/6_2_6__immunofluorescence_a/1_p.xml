<p>MDCK cells (96 well plate format, 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were inoculated with Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, PR8/H1N1, WI/H1N1, GA/H1N1, and Brisbane/H3N2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, or mock infected. At 8 h post-infection (p.i.), cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF; Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) for 1 h and then stained with 1 μg/mL of KPF1-HEK or KPF1-Antx hMAbs, followed by secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) was used to stain cell nuclei. Fluorescent signal images were acquired under an inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan) and analyzed by ImageJ software to measure intensity of the staining (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) [
