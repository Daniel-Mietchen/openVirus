<p>Plant expression vectors were assembled using standard recombinant DNA technology, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The KPF1-Antx and isotype control antibody expression vectors, which included heavy-chain (HC) and light-chain (LC) genes, were co-expressed with an oligosaccharyltransferase from Leishmania major (LmSTT3D) known to enhance N-glycan occupancy of recombinant proteins, using a similar strategy to that previously described [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, a third expression vector was utilized to enhance recombinant protein expression by transiently silencing Argonaute1 (AGO1) and Argonaute4 (AGO4) proteins to minimize post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [Patent WO 2019/023806 A1].
