<p>KPF1-Antx was produced as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. Briefly, expression vectors were transformed into 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain EHA105 and infiltrated at an OD600 of 0.2 into 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plant line KDFX, developed by PlantForm (unpublished) for knockdown of the plant-specific β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Plant foliage was harvested 7 days post-infiltration and total soluble protein was extracted. Antibodies were purified using MabSelect Protein A followed by Capto Q according to manufacturer protocols (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Purified antibodies were concentrated and formulated to ≥25 mg/mL in PBS.
