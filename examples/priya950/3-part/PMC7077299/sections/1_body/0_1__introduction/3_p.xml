<p>Since 1990, plants have been considered as a potential biofactory for production of biologicals, including monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. MAbs produced in genetically engineered plants (or plantibodies) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have been shown to have similar biological activity to mammalian-cell-produced MAbs [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Because large quantities of MAbs are generally required for passive immunization in vivo, plantibodies represent an excellent option for the production of MAbs for passive immunization, including large-scale manufacturing, low cost, and the absence of animal components [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, plantibodies overcome some of the concerns associated with animal-derived therapeutic MAbs obtained from serum or plasma, including intermediate reactions, pyrogenicity, potential contamination with other zoonotic pathogens and/or toxins, and serum sickness [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For these reasons, plantibodies have been proposed for the treatment of several bacterial (e.g., Salmonella, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas) and viral (e.g., Ebola virus, EBOV; Hepatitis B virus, HBV; Human immunodeficiency virus, HIV; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV; Rabies virus, RABV; West Nile virus, WNV) infections or toxins (e.g., ricin and shiga toxin) [
