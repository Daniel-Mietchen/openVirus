<p>In a recent study, we described that a human monoclonal antibody (hMAb) KPF1 produced in mammalian human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (KPF1-HEK) showed broadly cross-reactive activity against H1N1 IAV in vitro [

This is because KPF1-HEK hMAb recognizes a highly conserved and novel epitope in the HA1 globular head region of H1 IAV with high affinity. Importantly, KPF1-HEK hMAb showed broad and potent neutralizing activity in vitro and prophylactic and therapeutic activity in mice against influenza H1N1 IAV [

In this study, we demonstrated that a plant-produced KPF1 hMAb (KPF1-Antx) exhibits broad cross-reactivity and potent neutralizing in vitro and in vivo activity against H1N1 IAV. Importantly, KPF1-Antx hMAb has prophylactic and therapeutic activity and could prevent viral transmission in the well-established guinea pig model of influenza virus infection. Altogether, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of using plantibodies for the treatment of influenza viral infections in humans.
