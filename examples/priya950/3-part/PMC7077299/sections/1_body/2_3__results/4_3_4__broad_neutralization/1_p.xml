<p>We next evaluated the ability of KPF1-Antx hMAb to neutralize a broad range of H1N1 IAV, similarly to the process previously described with KPF1-HEK hMAb [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs showed similar cross-reactivity, as assessed by IFA, against different H1N1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Importantly, quantification of the IFA results indicated that the ability of KPF1-Antx hMAb to recognize the IAV H1 in infected cells was not statistically different than that of KPF1-HEK hMAb (

 <sub>50</sub> KPF1-Antx = 0.195 to 0.780 μg/mL; NT
 <sub>50</sub> KPF1-HEK = 0.195 to 1.106 μg/mL), while neutralization of PR8/H1N1 was slightly less efficient (NT
 <sub>50</sub> KPF1-Antx = 12.5 μg/mL; NT
 <sub>50</sub> KPF1-HEK = 25.0 μg/mL) (

Both KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs also showed similar HAI activity against H1N1 IAV and were potent for Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, WI/H1N1, and GA/H1N1(HAI = 0.271 to 1.106 μg/mL) but were less efficient for NC/H1N1 and PR8/H1N1 (HAI = 8.714 to 17.425 μg/mL) strains (
