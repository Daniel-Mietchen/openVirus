<p>To evaluate the protective efficacy of KPF1-Antx hMAb, Hartley guinea pigs (N = 3/group) received 20 mg/kg of either KPF1-Antx or isotype-Antx control hMAbs 6 h prior to infection with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Sentinel guinea pigs (N = 3/group) were put in contact with the infected guinea pigs at 1 d p.i. to assess viral transmission. In the KPF1-Antx hMAb-treated group, only one infected guinea pig and its sentinel guinea pig showed restricted viral infection and shedding, respectively, in the nasal washes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). We also observed viral shedding that resulted in efficient transmission to sentinel guinea pigs in all animals treated with the isotype-Antx hMAb (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,F). Both infected and sentinel guinea pigs in the KPF1-Antx hMAb treated group showed mild or no multifocal consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis in middle and caudal lobes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,E, respectively), while the isotype-Antx hMAb control-treated group infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) and sentinel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f004">Figure 4</xref>E) guinea pigs showed more severe pathology. Distributions of pathologic lesions on the lung surfaces were measured and compared, and supported the gross observation that the KPF1-Antx hMAb-treated group showed lower lesion values (13.85% to 31.51%) than those of the isotype-Antx control hMAb group (32.81% to 37.05%) (
