<p>To assess the therapeutic activity of the KPF1-Antx hMAb, guinea pigs (N = 3/group) were infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1 and then treated, 24 h p.i., with 20 mg/kg of either KPF1-Antx or isotype-Antx control hMAbs. Sentinel guinea pigs (N = 3/group) were put in contact with the infected guinea pigs at 2 d p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) and evaluated for viral infection and shedding by determining viral titers in the nasal washes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C, respectively). We observed high viral titers in infected guinea pigs treated with KPF1-Antx and the isotype-Antx control hMAbs at 2 d p.i. However, from 3 d p.i., the KPF1-Antx hMAb-treated group showed lower levels of viral replication in one of the infected guinea pigs and no viral shedding in the two other infected guinea pigs as compared with the isotype-Antx-treated control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Importantly, no virus was detected in the sentinel guinea pig group that were put in contact with the infected KPF1-Antx hMAb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). As expected, gross pathological observations of the KPF1-Antx hMAb-treated group showed only mild locally extensive congestion and atelectasis in caudal lobes and surface lesion scores ranging from 12.13% to 25.07% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>F), while guinea pigs in the isotype-Antx hMAb treated group had more severe and larger distribution of pathological lesions affecting the middle and caudal lobes, and surface lesion scores ranging from 34.03% to 37.20% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the plant-produced KPF1-Antx hMAb has both prophylactic and therapeutic activity against pH1N1, including the ability to prevent viral transmission, in guinea pigs.
