<p>We initially characterized the KPF1 hMAbs generated from either HEK293T cells (KPF1-HEK) or tobacco plants (KPF1-Antx) in vitro (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Serially 2-fold diluted (2.5 µg to 0.313 µg) KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx hMAbs showed similar characteristics by SDS-PAGE (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), regardless of mammalian or plant production. A comprehensive binding assessment of KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs to various IAV HA proteins, including Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, PR8/H1N1, A/Christchurch/16/2011 H1N1 (ChCh/H1N1), A/St. Petersburg27/2011 H1N1 (St. Petersburg/H1N1), and Brisbane/H3N2 was performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). As expected, KPF1-Antx hMAb bound only H1 Has, including the more recent ChCh/H1N1 and St. Petersburg/H1N1, and binding of KPF1-Antx hMAb to different IAV H1s was similar to that of KPF1-HEK hMAb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). To evaluate the stability of the binding, two different concentrations (0.1 and 1 µg/mL) of KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs were treated with increasing concentrations of urea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Both KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs maintained similar binding affinity in 4 M urea, and substantially diminished in 8 M urea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). These results indicate similar biological properties of the mammalian- and plant-produced KPF1 hMAbs in vitro.
