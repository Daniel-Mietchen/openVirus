<p>KPF1-Antx was produced in four week old 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. Just one week after infiltration with transgene-carrying 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, IgG was purified from foliage using Protein A followed by Capto Q to remove impurities including endotoxin. KFP1-Antx was expressed at an average of 650 mg/kg of biomass (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3) and the overall recovery was 68% with an endotoxin level of 0.4 endotoxin units (EU)/mg. Antibody recovery and quality were monitored throughout the purification process using standard SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The final KPF1-Antx product was reduced to two independent bands representing the heavy and light chains (50 and 25 kDa, respectively), with no impurities detected. KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK were compared using size-exclusion HPLC analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Area under the curve analysis indicated that KPF1-Antx contained 96.3% monomeric IgG and 3.4% low molecular weight (MW) forms, whereas, KPF1-HEK contained 94.5% monomeric IgG, 3.9% low MW forms, and 1.6% high MW forms. These results indicate a greater purity for the plant-derived KPF1-Antx, which included a polishing step (Capto Q). In addition, N-glycosylation profiles were compared using GlykoPrep
 <sup>®</sup> Rapid N-Glycan Preparation kit (PROzyme, Hayward, CA) and separation by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using a TSKgel Amide-80 column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). KPF1-Antx and the isotype control N-glycan profiles were highly similar, with 85%–87% biantennary N-acetylglucosamine (GnGn). Contrary, KPF1-HEK N-glycan profile contained a mixture of N-glycans typically observed on mammalian glycoproteins, including antibodies (32.8% GnGnF, 29.1% AGnF, 12.8% Man5Gn, and 11.8% AAF).
