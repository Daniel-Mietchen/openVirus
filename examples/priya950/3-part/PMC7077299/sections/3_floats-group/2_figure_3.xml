  <p>Cross-reactivity of KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx hMAbs against IAV H1N1 strains. (
   <bold>A</bold>) IFA: MDCK cells were infected (MOI 10) with Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, PR8/H1N1, WI/H1N1, or GA/H1N1; and Brisbane/ H3N2 influenza A virus; or mock infected. At 12 h p.i., cells were fixed and the cross-reactivity of the KPF1-HEK (top) or KPF1-Antx (bottom) hMAbs was evaluated by IFA. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Scale bar = 100 Âµm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Cross-reactivity intensity: Images in panel A were analyzed for the intensity of fluorescence using ImageJ. n.s.: no significance.
