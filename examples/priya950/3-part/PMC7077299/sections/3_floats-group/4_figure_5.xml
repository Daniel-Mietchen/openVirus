  <p>Therapeutic activity of KPF1-Antx hMAb in guinea pigs against pH1N1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental approach: Female Hartley guinea pigs (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) were infected (i.n.) with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1 and treated (i.p.) with 20 mg/kg of KPF1-Antx hMAb, or with 20 mg/kg of an IgG isotype control (Isotype-Antx) 24 h after infection. At 2 d p.i., sentinel guinea pigs (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) were introduced into the same cages as infected guinea pigs, allowing direct contact between the animals. (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>) Viral titers in nasal washes: To measure viral titers in the upper respiratory tract, nasal washes of infected (B) and sentinel (C) animals were collected on 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 d p.i. Viral titers were determined by IFA (FFU/mL). *

   <bold>E</bold>) Gross observations of lung pathology: All animals were euthanized at 8 d p.i. and lungs were collected from infected (D) or sentinel (E) guinea pigs to observe gross pathological changes such as congestion and atelectasis (arrows). Scale bars = 1 cm. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Macroscopic pathology scoring: Distributions of pathological lesions, including consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis, were measured using ImageJ and have been represented as the percent of the total lung surface area (%).*
