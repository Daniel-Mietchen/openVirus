<p>As noted above, the MWCCS will focus on HIV-related comorbidities and aging with HIV. The study aims to maintain a rigorous process for complete assessment and adjudication of outcomes of clinical importance. Our criteria for an outcome to be routinely obtained and validated are: 1) the outcome should be clinically important for the MWCCS research aims; 2) the outcome should have clear criteria for validation of the diagnosis; and 3) those criteria should be ascertainable from a standard medical record (or testing done as part of the study). The outcomes of interest include hospitalizations, AIDS-defining conditions, cardiovascular outcomes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancies, anal dysplasia, sepsis, pneumonia, and fractures. Further, one of the design strengths of the MWCCS is our ability to launch protocols for measures that are not routinely collected in clinical care. This is reflected in the priorities of our study to collect echocardiograms for characterizing cardiovascular disease, pulmonary function tests for precursors of pulmonary disease, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) responses for understanding mental health, measurements of physical functioning and frailty as precursors to disability, and neurocognitive batteries to examine motor and neurocognitive abnormalities. Understanding subclinical manifestations of HIV allows us to extend the science of HIV.</p>
