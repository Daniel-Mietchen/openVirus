<p>Although the MWCCS is an observational study, and as such we do not specifically offer treatment, we closely monitor these variables among our participants, including reasons for missed health-care visits and barriers to perfect ART adherence. Our large database, linking back as far as 35 years, will enable us to investigate and track predictors of these measures on an individual basis.</p>
