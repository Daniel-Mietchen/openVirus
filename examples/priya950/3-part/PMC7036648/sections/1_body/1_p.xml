<p>In 2019, the 2 cohort studies were merged into a single new prospective study: the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (

With 13 clinical sites across the United States, as well as a single data analysis and coordination center located at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland), the study research team worked for more than a year to define the research goals and methods of the new MWCCS. The study design and methods that emerged reflect dramatic changes that have occurred in the epidemiology of HIV in the United States since the original MACS and WIHS studies were designed. HIV in the United States now affects a range of key populations, and its epidemiology is influenced by both a spectrum of prevention efforts and the successes of the HIV care continuum (

Now that HIV is managed more as a lifelong chronic disease, it is important to understand whether those living with HIV are at increased risk for other comorbidities, particularly as the projected age distribution of the HIV-infected population in the United States continues to shift toward older adults (
