Causality is a vital concept throughout all of science, and philosophers and scientists have been working for centuries on refining the definitions and characteristics of “cause” (

The counterfactual/potential outcomes framework has been particularly important for development of tools that are alternatives to multivariable regression, such as propensity scores, marginal structural models, and g-computational approaches. Observational HIV studies have been a particularly strong setting for the development and refinement of these methods (
