<p>Further, the toolkit for time-to-event data has also been expanded considerably with a full armamentarium of parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric approaches that allow for handling a variety of issues that arise in HIV studies, including internal and external time-dependent covariates (

 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Further, when studying nonfatal outcomes, death is a principal competing risk that precludes the occurrence of age-related comorbid events. In competing-risk settings, it is well known that the complement of the standard Kaplan-Meier survival estimates (with competing events treated as censored observations) will overestimate the cause-specific cumulative incidence. For these situations, it is important to integrate approaches that have been developed for competing risks (
