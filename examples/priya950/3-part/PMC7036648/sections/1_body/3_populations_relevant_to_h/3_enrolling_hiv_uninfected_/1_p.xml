<p>The MACS and WIHS enrolled men and women who were free of HIV infection at enrollment. These individuals contribute in two ways. First, acquisition of HIV at a subsequent study visit can be determined. By providing an anchor for the time of infection, studies of the antecedents of acquisition of HIV can be undertaken, as can studies of the natural history of disease without the impact of bias (

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the occurrence of individuals with defined windows of HIV acquisition will be rare. For example, infection is now estimated at 0.71% per year among men who have sex with men overall, and 1.8% annually among black men who have sex with men (

Given the small number of new seroconversions that will occur without a substantially larger enrollment, the MWCCS will not be suited to efficiently study factors associated with HIV acquisition in the United States, pointing to the need for alternative study designs (e.g., case-control studies).
