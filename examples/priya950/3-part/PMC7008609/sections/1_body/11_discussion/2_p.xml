<p>As with other arboviral diseases, such as yellow fever, that have an urban cycle through 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the MAYV case in Haiti highlights the need for vector competency research and demonstrates the potential for the MAYV transmission cycle to shift into an urban cycle. Urbanization of MAYV could establish new outbreaks of greater number throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and result in a wider distribution of MAYV, including circulation in North America and Europe (
