<p>Cases of MAYV may be going undetected due to a lack of awareness among the medical community. For example, since diagnostic testing is not widely available and little is known of MAYV outside of endemic areas, imported cases may be getting clinically misdiagnosed as dengue. Within Latin America and the Caribbean, coinfection with other arboviral diseases may also misguide the diagnosis of MAYV, further demonstrating that the number of reported cases of MAYV only represent a portion of those that have occurred (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is also important to note that many of the cases of MAYV that were identified in academic literature were only detected because of extensive testing for arboviral viruses such as dengue and Chikungunya, further pointing to the need for differential testing for arboviral diseases. Lastly, since clinical symptoms of MAYV are generic, treatment may not be sought after and cases could go undetected. This would present a large obstacle to timely outbreak detection.
