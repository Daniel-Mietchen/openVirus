<p>Specific recommendations for MAYV surveillance include standardized lab capacities, the proactive seeking of cases, and the creation of standardized case definitions and laboratory diagnosis algorithms. While these recommendations are generally applicable to other arboviral diseases, the application of these recommendations specifically for MAYV will allow epidemics to be identified before they become problematic and also help the data collected to serve as a bridge between research and public health practice. Capacities and differential diagnosis algorithms need to be strengthened to ensure that labs are able to accurately distinguish among arboviral viruses. It is also important that labs be considered an integral data source for surveillance systems. Other recommendations include strengthening entomological surveillance and creating a global arboviral database. Public health practitioners and clinicians should also be made aware of the other arboviral diseases that exist, to be better able to discern the differences between them. Lastly, increased research interest will allow for the ongoing exploration of potentially epidemic diseases, such as Mayaro fever.</p>
