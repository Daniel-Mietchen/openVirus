<p>Transmission of MAYV to humans primarily occurs by the bite of female mosquitoes from the 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> genus in the dipteran family Culicidae, which are not known to be anthropophilic (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In order to assess whether an urban cycle of MAYV could be initiated and sustained, laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the vector competence of anthropophilic mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Studies showed that MAYV can infect 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus,</italic> but 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> demonstrated limited opportunity for MAYV transmission to humans (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); however, the vector competence of the species was demonstrated and suggests the potential for urban transmission (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). MAYV-infected 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> have also been found in the city of Cuiab√°, in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). MAYV was first isolated from 
 <italic>Mansonia venezuelensis</italic> collected from the Rio Grande Forest in Trinidad and Tobago (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A small number of 
 <italic>Psorophora ferox/albipes</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> (
 <italic>Ochlerotatus) serratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> have also contained isolates of the virus (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
