<p>In order to assess the presence of Mayaro fever in Latin America and the Caribbean, databases that included PubMed, ClinicalKey, Scopus, Nature, SciELO, LILACS, and Google Scholar were searched periodically from May 2018 through May 2019. Materials in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English were reviewed. The terms used and adapted to each database were “Mayaro fever,” “Mayaro virus,” “MAYV,” “Mayaro,” “Mayaro AND alphavirus,” “Mayaro AND Semliki Complex,” and “Mayaro AND epidemiology.” In PubMed, 90 articles were identified for the search term “Mayaro fever,” 221 articles for “Mayaro virus,” 79 articles for “MAYV,” 227 articles for “Mayaro,” 158 articles for “Mayaro AND alphavirus,” 9 articles for “Mayaro AND Semliki Complex,” and 71 articles for “Mayaro AND epidemiology.” (The other databases did not generate new, unique journal-article hits that were not in PubMed. Therefore, from this point forward, this report will discuss the journal-article hits only from PubMed.)</p>
