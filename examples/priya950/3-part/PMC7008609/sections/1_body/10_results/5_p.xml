<p>The lack of standardization in Mayaro case definitions and laboratory diagnostics weaken the robustness of reported case data; however, the data was incorporated in this report due to the limited availability of MAYV case data to create the first epidemiological database for Mayaro. To date, epidemiological data on Mayaro continues to be descriptive in nature. Given the lack of accurate and consistent case information, incidence rate calculations were not attempted. Rather, an overview of the number of reported cases and/or epidemics of MAYV was given. Data on MAYV mortality was extremely limited. Of the 901 reported MAYV cases, only one fatality was recorded in academic literature (
