<p>Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a positive-sense, enveloped, singlestranded RNA alphavirus classified in the Semliki Complex. MAYV is the etiological agent of Mayaro fever (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The Semliki Complex is made up of eight viruses of importance in the medical and veterinary fields: Bebaru, Chikungunya, Getah, Mayaro, Oâ€™nyong-nyong, Ross River, Semliki Forest, and Una (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Due to the fact that these eight viruses belong to the same serological complex, it is difficult to achieve an accurate diagnosis of the viruses outside of well-equipped laboratory settings (
