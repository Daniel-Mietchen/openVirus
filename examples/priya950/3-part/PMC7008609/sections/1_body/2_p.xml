<p>MAYV is maintained in an enzootic cycle through continuous evolutions of transmission between diurnal mosquitoes from the forest canopy to nonhuman primates, rodents, marsupials, and birds (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Similar to the yellow fever virus life cycle, the transmission of MAYV to humans is believed to occur in the rural cycle, in which mosquitoes spread the virus to humans who live near to or make frequent use of forest habitats (
