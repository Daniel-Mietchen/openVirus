<p id="p0080">A total of 998 eligible patients were included in our trial, of whom 496 were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 502 to the control group (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The groups were comparable in terms of age and co-morbidities (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). In the intervention group 429/496 (87%) had at least one respiratory symptom on entry; in the control group this number was 412/502 (82%). One-third of the patients were immunosuppressed in both groups. From the 496 patients in the intervention group, 334 (67%) were hospitalized as were 350 (70%) of the 502 patients in the control group.
