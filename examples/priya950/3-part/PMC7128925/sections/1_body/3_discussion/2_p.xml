<p id="p0110">Several randomized studies aiming to reduce antibiotic consumption by means of improved diagnostics have been conducted in recent years. In one randomized controlled trial in the UK, adult patients presenting at hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever were randomized into two groups, for either a molecular point-of-care test for respiratory viruses or routine care. Over 80% of the patients in both groups received antibiotics and the mean duration of antibiotics remained unchanged [

However, a subgroup analysis in this randomized controlled trial conducted with individuals with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections in a US community hospital showed shorter duration of antibiotic treatment in the algorithm-adherent patients, and fewer patients with positive viral testing and low PCT values were discharged with antibiotics. A large randomized trial of 1656 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, covering 14 US urban academic hospitals obtained the same result. There was no difference in days on antibiotics or in adverse events between the standard care group and the intervention group, which had an additional viral testing and PCT measurement provided with graded recommendations for antibiotic use based on PCT levels [

Without counselling, physicians seem to respond less to positive viral results other than influenza and rely more on radiographic findings when deciding on antibiotic treatment, as shown in a prospective observational study conducted in a Canadian tertiary hospital [
