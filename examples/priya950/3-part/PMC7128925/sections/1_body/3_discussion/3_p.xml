<p id="p0115">The reasons for interventions failing to reduce antibiotics in acutely ill adults may be due to clinicians' anxiety in the face of poor outcomes. Lower respiratory tract infections were the sixth most common cause of death in high-income countries in 2016 [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and it is reported that influenza and pneumonia cause over 51 000 deaths annually in the USA [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In an observational study of Medicare patients aged ≥65 years, mortality among hospitalized individuals with community-acquired pneumonia was 11% [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The incidence of pneumonia rose five-fold and mortality was doubled as age increased from 65–69 years to &gt;90 years [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A secondary analysis of the EPIC study, in which in-hospital deaths of pneumonia patients were evaluated, noted that only 2.2% of the patients died in tertiary hospitals but 63.4% of these were at least 65 years old and 61.5% had at least two co-morbidities [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Many patients in internal medicine emergency units belong to these high-risk groups.
