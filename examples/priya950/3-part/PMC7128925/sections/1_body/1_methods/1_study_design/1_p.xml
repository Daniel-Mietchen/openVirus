<p id="p0025">This randomized (1:1) clinical trial involving adults entering the Internal Medicine Emergency Unit was conducted at Oulu University Hospital from September 2014 to October 2015. This is a tertiary hospital with 800 beds and an emergency department working 24 hours a day. Before the study mainly antigen testing for influenza virus was used. We offered the opportunity to participate in the clinical trial in the emergency room to patients older than 16 years having (a) any respiratory infection symptom such as cough, rhinitis, shortness of breath or sore throat, (b) fever (&gt;38°C), (c) chest pain, or (d) poor general condition for an unknown reason. We did not apply any exclusion criteria.</p>
