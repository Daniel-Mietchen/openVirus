<p id="p0060">The primary outcome measures were duration of hospitalization and antibiotic consumption. Duration of hospitalization was defined as number of days in hospital within 1 month after randomization. Antimicrobial consumption was defined as the number of days on antibiotics and the number of defined daily doses of bacterial antibiotics within 1 month of enrolment. We also reported the proportion of patients receiving any antibiotic treatment within 30 days. This outcome was also analysed for the first 7 days when the viral results were available for the patients in the intervention group but not for the patients in the control group.</p>
