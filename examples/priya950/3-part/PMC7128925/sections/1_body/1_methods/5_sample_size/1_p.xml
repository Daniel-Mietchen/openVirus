<p id="p0070">The appropriate sample size was calculated using the proportion of patients receiving antimicrobial treatment during 30-day follow up as the primary outcome measure. The estimated proportion of these patients was 75%. We regarded a 10% absolute reduction in proportion of patients receiving antibiotics in the intervention group as a clinically significant change. To gain a power of 90% with a type I error of 0.05, one would need 920 participants, 460 in each group. To achieve this we decided to recruit 1000 participants.</p>
