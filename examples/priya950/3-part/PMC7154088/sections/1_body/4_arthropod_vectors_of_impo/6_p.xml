<p>The oral susceptibility of several Japanese 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species for AKAV was demonstrated (
 <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>). As the virus isolation from field-collected midges suggested, 
 <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> was susceptible to AKAV, and the viral replication and dissemination were demonstrated in the infected midges. Interestingly, 
 <italic>C. tainanus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. punctatus</italic>, which have not been considered AKAV-competent vectors, were also orally infected with AKAV. During the AKAV endemic in northern Japan in 2010, 
 <italic>C. tainanus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. punctatus</italic> were dominant/subdominant species at cowsheds in the endemic region, but 
 <italic>C. oxysoma</italic> has been never collected there (
 <xref rid="B267" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>). These species, which are common in East Asia (
 <xref rid="B268" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>) probably contributed to the AKAV transmission during that period.
