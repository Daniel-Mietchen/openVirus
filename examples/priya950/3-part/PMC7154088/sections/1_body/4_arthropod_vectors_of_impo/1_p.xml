<p>The identification of the vectors of arboviruses is essential to understand the epidemiology of the arboviruses and to develop control measures against them. In this section, we focus on the potential vectors of arboviruses that affect domestic ruminants in East Asia. Many orbiviruses (e.g., BTV and EHDV) and orthobunyaviruses (e.g., AKAV and SBV) that are pathogenic to domestic ruminants were reported to be transmitted by
