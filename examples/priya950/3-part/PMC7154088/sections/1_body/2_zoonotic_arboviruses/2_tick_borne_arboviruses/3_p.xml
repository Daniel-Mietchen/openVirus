<p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV; species 
 <italic>Huaiyangshan banyangvirus</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Banyangvirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>) was recognized in mainland China, Japan, and Korea (
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>–
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>). Although this tick-borne virus has probably been circulating in East Asia for many years, its association with the severe illness in humans was not recognized until 2011. The seroprevalence of SFTSV in domestic ruminants in mainland China, Japan, and Korea was reported (
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>–
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>), and epidemiological studies suggested that farmers in rural areas are at risk of SFTSV infection (
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>). The continuous monitoring for SFTSV in domestic ruminants is therefore necessary to assess the ruminants' contribution to SFTSV endemics in the affected regions.
