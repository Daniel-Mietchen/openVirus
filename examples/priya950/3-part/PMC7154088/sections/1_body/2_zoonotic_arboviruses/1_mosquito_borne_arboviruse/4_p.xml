<p>Banna virus (BAV), which belongs to the species 
 <italic>Banna virus</italic> of the genus 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, was first isolated in mainland China in 1987 from a patient with meningoencephalitis (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>). Since then, BAV has been obtained from pigs, cattle, ticks, mosquitoes, and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges over a wide range of mainland China (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>). The virus is thought to cause encephalitis in humans, and many cases associated with it might have been misdiagnosed as Japanese encephalitis (
