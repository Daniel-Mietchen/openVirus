<p>With the exception of BEFV, which has a higher incident rate in cattle (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), almost all of the arboviruses generally result in a low morbidity, asymptomatic/mild illnesses or no apparent acute phase in domestic ruminants, and thus they silently circulate in the endemic regions. Active surveillance such as sentinel and vector surveillance systems are therefore needed for the efficient detection of the arboviruses' circulation in the field prior to disease outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B292" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>). The recent increase in the number of emerging arboviruses in East Asia indicates that other undetected arboviruses may have circulated. The expansion of global transportation may also enhance the risk of arbovirus introductions from geographically distant areas. Global warming will certainly affect the distribution and active period of vectors, and thus the ranges of virus spread will expand to higher-latitude regions.
