<p>The circulation of other ruminant arboviruses such as AKAV, AINOV, PEAV, and BATV has also been demonstrated in Southeast Asian countries by serological surveillance and virus isolations (
 <xref rid="B284" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>). Unfortunately, there are not enough reports to determine the current status of these arboviruses in Southeast Asia. Further virological surveillance and genetic characterizations of isolated viruses are essential to elucidate the epidemiological linkage of ruminant arboviruses between East Asia and Southeast Asia.
