<p>The recent emergence of “new” arboviruses in East Asia has attracted interest in their origins and incursion routes. In addition, genogroup shifts of endemic arboviruses in the region have probably been induced by the introductions of viruses from a different genetic pool in other regions. Extensive surveillance in Australia obtained many arboviruses, and some of them are also endemic or were recently emerged in East Asia (
