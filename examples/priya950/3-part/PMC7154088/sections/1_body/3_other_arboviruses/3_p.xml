<p>Fukuoka virus (FUKV) is assigned to the species 
 <italic>Fukuoka ledantevirus</italic> of the genus 
 <italic>Ledantevirus</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> and was initially isolated from 
 <italic>Culicoides punctatus</italic> and the mosquito 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in southern Japan in 1982 (
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>). The virus was first regarded as a member of the ephemeral fever serogroup but was subsequently classified as a member of the Kern Canyon serogroup viruses (
 <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>). FUKV was later isolated from sentinel cattle in a different region in Japan and, simultaneously, the seroprevalence of FUKV in cattle was demonstrated (
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>). Although cattle were identified as a susceptible host of FUKV, the pathogenicity of this virus in cattle remains uncertain. Full-genome analysis of ledanteviruses demonstrated that FUKV has a closed relationship (79.5% nucleotide identity) with Barur virus which has been isolated from ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and a rodent in India and Africa (
 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>). Nishimuro virus from a wild boar in Japan (
 <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>) is also genetically similar to FUKV. Further studies are needed to determine their vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors.
