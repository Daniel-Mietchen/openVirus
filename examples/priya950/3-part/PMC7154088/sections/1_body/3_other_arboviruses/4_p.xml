<p>Sathuvachari virus (SVIV) is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> and was initially isolated in 1963 from starlings (
 <italic>Brahminy myna</italic>) collected in southern India (

 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>). The genetic characterization of SVIV suggested its close relationship with other mosquito-borne orbiviruses (

 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>). No illness in the infected cattle was reported when their blood samples were collected, but the finding demonstrated that cattle are a susceptible host of SVIV and indicated that the virus has a wider host range than previously thought.
