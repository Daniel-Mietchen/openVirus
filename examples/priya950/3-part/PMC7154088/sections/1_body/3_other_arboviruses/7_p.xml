<p>A novel segmented RNA virus which is genetically related to flaviviruses was detected in ticks collected in mainland China in 2010 and was designated as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>). Together with insect viruses that have a similar genome composition, JMTV is tentatively referred as the Jingmenvirus group (
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>). Cattle sera collected in mainland China were reported to contain antibodies against JMTV (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>). The genome of JMTV was also detected in a part of the seropositive samples by RT-PCR screening. JMTV was recently identified as a potential human pathogen, because patients infected with the virus showed clinical manifestations such as fever, headache, and myalgia (
