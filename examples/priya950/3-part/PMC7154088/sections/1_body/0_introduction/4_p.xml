<p>Akabane disease and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) are still problematic in East Asia, despite the widespread use of vaccines against them. Outbreaks of other endemic arbovirus infections such as Aino virus infection and Ibaraki disease have occasionally been reported. In addition, recent progress in the research tools for virus hunting have enhanced the detection of the circulation of arboviruses that were previously unrecognized in East Asia (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, some of the arboviruses are suspected of being associated with ruminant diseases such as epizootic congenital abnormalities, febrile illness, and neurological disorders (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Many reports about arboviruses infecting domestic ruminants have been provided from mainland China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, which are part of East Asia. This review provides a compilation of the available knowledge about the arboviruses that are associated with domestic ruminants in the East Asia region at present. Gaps in the research that remain to be addressed and future research directions are also discussed.
