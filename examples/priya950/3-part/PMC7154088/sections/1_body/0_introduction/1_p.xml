<p>Arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The arboviruses include various taxonomic groups, such as 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae, Nairoviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Reoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). They cause a broad spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to severe and fatal disease in vertebrate hosts. Because some of the arboviruses have affected human and domestic animal health, the efforts to prevent and control the diseases caused by arboviruses continue, but novel arboviruses have continuously emerged and have sometimes been involved in human and animal diseases. The battle thus seems to have no end.
