<p>Vaccination is now the current gold standard to prevent BEF. Commercial attenuated and killed vaccines have been developed and widely used in Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan (

Repetitive outbreaks of BEF in East Asia indicate that continuous vaccination program is essential to provide sufficient immunity against BEFV among naïve population and minimize economical loss caused by BEF. Antigenic association between the vaccine strains and recent field isolates of BEF should be assessed to guarantee the vaccine efficacy.
