<p>BEF is characterized by sudden fever, anorexia, depression, and ananastasia, and it can be regarded as the first recognized arbovirus infection in domestic ruminants in East Asia. Due to the cessation of lactation in dairy cattle and the loss of condition in beef cattle, BEF has had considerable economic impact (

 <italic>Bovine fever ephemerovirus</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Ephemerovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>). The virus was widely distributed through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Phylogenetic analysis based on the surface glycoprotein (G) gene demonstrated that BEFV isolates are grouped into four lineages with different geographical origins: Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia (
