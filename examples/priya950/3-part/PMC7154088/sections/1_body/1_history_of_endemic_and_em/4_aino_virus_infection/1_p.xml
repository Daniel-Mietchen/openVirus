<p>Aino virus (AINOV; species 
 <italic>Aino orthobunyavirus</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>) was first isolated from mosquitoes in Japan in 1964 (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges are currently regarded as incriminate vectors for AINOV (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). During the outbreak of bovine congenital abnormalities caused by AKAV in Japan in 1972–1975, the precolostral sera of several affected calves with A-H syndrome contained antibodies to AINOV, but not to AKAV (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Since then, cases suspected of being associated with AINOV have been sporadically reported in the western part of Japan (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>–
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). AINOV was also obtained from an aborted bovine fetus with brain lesions (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). These findings indicated that AINOV was involved in abnormal deliveries in the region. Later, teratogenicity characterized by arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly, and cerebellar hypoplasia was demonstrated in neonate calves intrauterinely injected with AINOV (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). Several outbreaks (from 17 to 700 cases) of Aino virus infection in Japan were reported between 1995 and 2006 (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). All known Japanese AINOVs likely belong to a single genogroup, but genetically distant from Australian AINOVs (
