<p>From the winter of 1985 to the spring of 1986, an epizootic of congenital abnormalities of calves with hydranencephaly-cerebellar hypoplasia (HCH) syndrome occurred in southern Japan (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Unlike Akabane disease, the affected calves did not show arthrogryposis. Approximately 2,400 affected calves were reported during the epizootic. In the autumn of 1985, a virus classified as a member of the 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> genus was isolated from 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and bovine blood samples collected in the epizootic region; it was tentatively designated as Chuzan virus (CHUV) (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). The etiological role of CHUV in the epizootic was suggested by serological tests for the affected calves (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). In addition, a newborn calf with HCH syndrome was delivered from a dam experimentally infected with CHUV, and the disease caused by CHUV was named Chuzan disease (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). It was later reported that CHUV is serologically cross-reacted with Kasba virus (KASV), which was isolated in India in 1957 and is a serotype of the species 
 <italic>Palyam virus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>). Recent genetical characterization of Palyam virus group also demonstrated the closed relationship between CHUV, KASV, and Vellore virus, which was isolated in India in 1956 (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). After the large 1985â€“1986 outbreak in southern Japan, the disease has sporadically occurred there.
