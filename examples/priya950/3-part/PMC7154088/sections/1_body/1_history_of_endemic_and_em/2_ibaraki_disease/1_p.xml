<p>During a large epidemic of an acute febrile disease in 1959 and 1960 in Japan, deglutitive difficulty based in the esophageal and laryngopharyngeal musculature was observed among affected cattle (

That febrile disease was at one time called “bluetongue-like disease” because its clinical signs resembled those caused by BTV. The etiological agent was isolated from naturally and experimentally infected cattle and was designated as Ibaraki virus (IBAV), which denotes the location from which it was isolated (
