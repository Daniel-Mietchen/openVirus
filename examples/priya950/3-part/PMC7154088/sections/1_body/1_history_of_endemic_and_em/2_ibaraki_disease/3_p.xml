<p>At laboratory diagnosis, detection of neutralization antibody to IBAV and virus isolation from diseased cattle are usually tested (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). IBAV-specific RT-PCR based on segment 2 is available to detect the virus from infected cattle (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A real-time RT-PCR assay for typing of EHDV would be able to detect the presence of IBAV in diagnostic samples (
