<p>In 1997, over 1,000 cases of abortion and stillbirths in cattle occurred in southern Japan. A potential etiological agent was isolated from aborted fetuses, sentinel cattle, and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and was identified as a strain of EHDV (

 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>). The EHDV strain was initially regarded as a variant of IBAV, because the virus was cross-reacted with IBAV by a virus neutralization test, and the sequence of its segment 2 was reported to show a degree of similarity to that of IBAV (
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>). Later research demonstrated that this virus belongs to the serotype 7 group of EHDV, based on phylogenetic studies of segment 2 sequences encoding the outermost capsid protein (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Ibaraki disease-like symptoms (e.g., swallowing difficulty) in cattle were also reported during the epizootic. In 2013, EHDV-7 was also isolated in the southern part of mainland China from sentinel cattle, but its pathogenicity remains unknown (
