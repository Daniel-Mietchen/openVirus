<p>The first recognition of Akabane disease in Korea was in 1979 (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Several AKAV isolates were then obtained from aborted fetuses, affected cattle with neurological disorders, and sentinel cattle between 1993 and 2010 (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>–
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Serological surveillance of domestic ruminants revealed that frequent incursions of AKAV had occurred, and the virus occasionally spread widely (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Ruminants affected by AKAV have been reported since the first recognition (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). In 2010, a large outbreak of epizootic encephalomyelitis in postnatally infected cattle also occurred in the southern part of Korea (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). The causative AKAV isolates were classified into genogroup I (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Before that outbreak, several sporadic cases of bovine encephalomyelitis were reported in 2000 and 2001 (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).
