<p>Even years after the advent of antibiotics and vaccines, infectious diseases remain a significant challenge for public health worldwide, as they are responsible for millions of deaths, mainly among older adults and immunosuppressed or chronically ill people. The potential onset of infectious disease depends on the virulence of the microbe and the efficacy of the host immune response, among others, which envisages the coordinated action of all the elements responsible of defenses against pathogens, from physical barriers to multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this setting, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes play a major role in defense and recovery from infections [
 <xref rid="B1-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These lymphocytes recognize immunogenic peptides presented on cellsâ€™ surface by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and act through different pathways in order to eliminate the pathogen and the infected cells. Because of the key role played by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in protecting the host from microbial invasions, a multitude of studies investigated how alterations in their pathway of activation can affect the efficiency of the immune response, leading to an increased/reduced susceptibility to infections. MHC class I molecules are directly involved in the process of antigen presentation and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell activation, as they are responsible for binding peptides that have undergone precise structural modifications. Based on these premises, this review aims to provide an overview on the role played by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and 2 (ERAP2), which are primarily responsible for the generation of the antigenic repertoire presented by MHC I molecules, in the control of susceptibility as well as progression of different infectious diseases [
