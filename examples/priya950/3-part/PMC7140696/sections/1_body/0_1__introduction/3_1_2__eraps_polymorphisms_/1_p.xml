<p>The human ERAPs are encoded by two genes located on chromosome 5q15 in opposite orientation. The ERAP1 gene is 47,379bp in length and consists of 20 exons. The ERAP2 gene is 41,438bp in length and consists of 19 exons [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These two genes are highly polymorphic, although ERAP2 gene exhibits not as many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as ERAP1. Since these aminopeptidases are involved in the antigen processing pathway, a series of genetic studies have linked their genetic variants to modifications in their functioning that could easily lead to MHC-I-associated disorder onset [
