<p>The majority of disease-related ERAP1 SNPs are positioned near the catalytic site (aa residues 346, 349), within the binding groove (aa residues 725 and 730), or near locations that can influence the conformational rearrangements (aa residues 528 and 575) [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; other SNPs are also present in interdomain areas or in domain IV, a regulatory region responsible for C-terminal residue peptide binding [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Various in vitro and in vivo studies investigating these SNPs have shown that they significantly affect peptide trimming enzymatic activity [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The most prominent ERAP1 SNP is rs30187, encoding the K528R amino acid replacement. Such mutation reduces the peptide trimming efficacy by affecting the kinetic process involved in the modification of ERAP1 from the active to the inactive form [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Associated to this SNP, another one, rs27044, which encodes the Q730E amino acid substitution, was demonstrated to be correlated with modifications in peptide length preference as well as trimming specificity [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Remarkably, ERAP1 SNPs can have a synergic impact, combining their effects on the trimming activity. In this regard, analysis investigating the cumulative effect of K528R and D575N (rs10050860) ERAP1 SNPs, showed that an ERAP1 containing K528/N575 displays a much higher enzymatic activity compared to an ERAP1 containing R528/D575 [
 <xref rid="B27-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. E. Reeves et al. demonstrated the existence of 13 haplotypes which have been grouped into three categories: efficient, hypoactive, or hyperactive. The allocation was based on the degree of alteration in their ability to generate specific antigenic epitopes [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The best known ERAP1 SNP combination encodes an allotype with five variants, whose frequency in the European Caucasian population is nearly 26.2%, each of which is independently related to a series of diseases: ERAP1 rs2287987 (V349), rs30187 (R528), N575, rs17482078 (Q725), E730 [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Intriguingly, this allotype encodes an ERAP1 protein which is non-functional. To further confound this picture, ERAP1 has a co-dominant expression and in heterozygous subjects both allotypes can partake in the global definition of ERAP1 trimming activity in both health and disease. Furthermore, ERAP1 polymorphisms have a wide range of functional degrees that can affect either mRNA synthesis as well as ERAP1 enzymatic activity, which in turn can influence disease onset or susceptibility. Notwithstanding, the strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) among numerous polymorphisms presumably leads to a restricted variability among individuals.
