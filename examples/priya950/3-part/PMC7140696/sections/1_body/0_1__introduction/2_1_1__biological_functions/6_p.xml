<p>In addition to their intracellular role, ERAPs are also endowed with some non-immunological functions, such as angiogenesis and blood pressure regulation. These are mediated by the ability of ERAP1 to cleave angiotensin II into angiotensin III and IV, and of ERAP2 to cleave angiotensin III to angiotensin IV [

 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The localization of angiotensins is extracellular, thus ERAP-mediated cleavage processes can happen only following ERAPs release in the extracellular milieu. In fact, ERAP1 release has been exhaustively demonstrated in immune cells and in murine macrophage cell lines both in soluble and extracellular vesicle (EV) form [
