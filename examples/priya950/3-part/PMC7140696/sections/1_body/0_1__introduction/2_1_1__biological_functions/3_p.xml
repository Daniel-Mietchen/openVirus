<p>The crystal structure of ERAP1 shows a 4-domain protein whose catalytic site is located in domain II. Domain I caps off the active site and provides binding sites for the amino terminus of a substrate peptide; domain III acts like a hinge enabling conformational changes between domains II and IV; domain IV has a concave structure fronting the active site. Conformational changes in the catalytic site lead to the generation of either an open or a closed conformation [

 <xref rid="B10-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The first one confers ERAP1 its receptive properties, owing to which it can bind peptides; the second one allows the protein to close around the peptide and switch to its enzymatically active form [
