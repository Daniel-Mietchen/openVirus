<p>A number of infectious conditions are characterized by an alteration of both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system, which would be sensitive to ERAP manipulation. While the role played by ERAPs in acquired immunity has been extensively investigated, only few studies have analyzed ERAP1 participation in natural immunity [

 <xref rid="B14-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="B19-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and data on the possible contribution of ERAP2 to innate immunity are almost missing. Further studies in this direction could therefore provide novel and unexpected insights to clarify the molecular mechanism by which different ERAPs variants modulate the onset, reactivation, and development of infectious diseases. Likewise, the recent identification of two new ERAP2 isoforms following influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B33-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] justifies the maintenance of a haplotype (HapB) whose value was so far unknown. Similar analyses will be needed to clarify the possible involvement of this haplotype in the control of other microbial infections. Furthermore, considering the concerted action of the two enzymes leading to enhanced trimming activity, even polymorphisms that may affect the quantity and quality of the heterodimers formed should be taken into consideration. Likewise, the two new ERAP2 isoforms produced as a consequence of influenza virus infection could modify dimer interaction exerting a negative effect on the wild type forms [
