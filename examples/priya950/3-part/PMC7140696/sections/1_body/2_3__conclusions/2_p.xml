<p>Expression of HLA-class I risk alleles and their relation with ERAPs involves unusual ER peptide processing leading to altered peptide presentation as a mechanism responsible for increased susceptibility or progression of several infectious diseases. Loss of ERAPs function has also been demonstrated to significantly affect the presentation of epitopes by MHC class I molecules, possibly contributing to the maintenance of chronic infections. However, how ERAPs are functionally associated with infectious diseases, and how ERAPs interact with disease-associated MHC class I molecules, are still unanswered questions. Additional functional studies employing proper comparative analysis and functional confirmation assays in different populations are, therefore, necessary to better understand how ERAP variants can affect infectious disease predisposition and pathogenesis. The investigation of epistasis interaction between ERAPs and HLA variants is also essential in order to properly disclose the mechanism through which ERAP1 and ERAP2 influences infectious diseases and the process of antigen presentation.</p>
