<p>In this review, we have summarized the recent knowledge on the biology of ERAP1 and ERAP2 enzymes and their possible links to several infectious diseases. Polymorphic variations in 
 <italic>ERAP1</italic> and 
 <italic>ERAP2</italic> genes, modifies their function and their skill to produce antigenic peptides and controls cytotoxic responses against antigen-presenting cells. The numerous studies reviewed in this manuscript definitely confirm that such variations in ERAPs expression and/or genetic variants have an important repercussion on the onset and/or progression of infectious diseases. Indeed, ERAPs function as key factors within the antigen presentation pathway, influencing the interaction between pathogens and natural host resistance.
