<p>Microbes and their mammalian hosts have co-evolved for millions of years, resulting in intricate hostâ€“pathogen interactions [
 <xref rid="B37-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Infected cells progressively digest intracellular microbial proteins and display the resulting antigenic repertoire on cell surface molecules for recognition by T cells [
 <xref rid="B37-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As this process initiates cell-mediated immune responses and is essential to detect infections, genetic variants of proteins involved in the antigen presentation pathway play an important role in shaping the susceptibility and response to invading pathogens [
 <xref rid="B38-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In turn, different microbes have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade recognition by the immune system [
 <xref rid="B39-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given the key role played by ERAPs in antigen processing and presentation, it is conceivable that these enzymes may be potential targets and modulators of the pathogenicity of infectious diseases. Viruses, in particular, are obligate intracellular parasites, whose antigenic peptides are expressed on the surface of infected cells in association with MHC I molecules, after being processed inside the host cell (see paragraph 1.1). In this review we will discuss the effect of ERAPs in modulating viral infections including HCV, HCMV, influenza virus, HPV, and HIV (

Surprisingly, new data have recently associated the activity of ERAPs also with infections mediated by extracellular pathogens (bacteria and parasites) whose antigenic peptides, presented in association with MHC class II molecules, are generated through the endosomial pathway independently from ERAPs processing. Such findings, briefly discussed in paragraph 2.6, once more underline that ERAPs activity may rely on mechanisms independent from antigen presentation.
