<p>HCMV life cycle starts with the binding of trimeric or pentameric viral complex to host receptors which differ in fibroblasts (PDGFRα) and in epithelial cells/endothelial cells, (Nrp2 or OR14I1). Such interaction allows viral entry into the cell by fusion or endocytosis [

 <xref rid="B61-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. At the same time, some viral-encoded proteins intervene in the control of cell-signaling pathways and cellular metabolic processes to facilitate viral replication on one hand, immune evasion on the other [

 <xref rid="B63-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The subsequent formation of a nuclear egress complex, together with the rupture of the nuclear lamina, leads to capsid transfer into the cytoplasm, previously assembled within the nucleus [

 <xref rid="B67-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Virions are then shaped and trafficked to the viral assembly complex (AC), which includes components of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomal machinery [

 <xref rid="B70-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Once capsids gain tegument and viral envelope at the AC, the new infectious particles are released together with the non-infectious ones, the so called “dense bodies.”
