<p>The existence of a link between ERAPs and HCMV infection is strongly suggested by analyses performed on viral microRNA (miRNA). MiRNAs are short RNA segments—with a length between 19 and 23 nucleotides—capable of regulating gene expression by completely or partially pairing with their target mRNA. This leads to mRNA cleavage, destabilization, or translational inhibition [

 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Endorsing this finding, ERAP1 levels were shown to be inversely proportional to miR-US4-1 expression. This, in turn, affects the shaping of HCMV-derived immunogenic peptides and translates into viral evasion from CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells-mediated immune response [
 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Such result suggests that HCMV developed a way to specifically and preferentially target ERAP1—despite the presence of other aminopeptidases involved in antigen presentation (i.e., ERAP2 and placental leucine aminopeptidase)—likely because of its leading role in peptide generation, its more ubiquitous presence, and overall higher expression [
