<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus that causes infection in 40% to almost 100% of individuals worldwide, depending on socio-economic and geographical factors [

 <xref rid="B57-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. HCMV infections are typically associated to salivary glands, even though the virus can live and replicate in plenty of different cells, thus facilitating its dissemination throughout the body [
