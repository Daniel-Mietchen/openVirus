<p>Briefly, HIV life cycle consists of four stages. HIV viral entry is characterized by the gp120 binding to the cell surface via the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> receptor and the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptors. Once inside, the viral reverse transcriptase converts RNA genome into a single stranded (ss) DNA copy which is immediately replicated to produce a double stranded (ds) molecule. The viral genome is then transported into the nucleus, integrated into the host cell genome by viral integrase. The proviruses may remain transcriptionally inactive for a long time and this event is partially responsible for the latency of HIV in infected people. Finally, proviral polyproteins are translated and cleaved by the protease and new infective virions are generated [
