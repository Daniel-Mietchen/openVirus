<p>In another study, J. Dinter et al. compared the capacity of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes to produce HIV-derived epitope precursors and epitopes [

Results showed that the expression of cytosolic proteases involved in antigen processing, including ERAP1 and ERAP2, is higher in MDMs than in DCs. As a consequence, the kinetics and amount of antigenic peptide produced as well as the intracellular stability of HIV peptides prior to MHC loading significantly increased in MDMs, leading the authors to conclude that this can result into variations in the timing and effectiveness of recognition of HIV infected cells by CTLs [
