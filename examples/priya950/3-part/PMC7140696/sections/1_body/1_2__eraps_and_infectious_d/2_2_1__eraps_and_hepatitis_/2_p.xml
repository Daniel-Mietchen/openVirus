<p>The HCV life cycle is still far from being fully understood because of the difficulties in developing an in vitro model that can be used to analyze thoroughly the viral replication and viral entry mechanism [

 <xref rid="B43-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Concisely: while circulating in the bloodstream, the HCV virion, covered in host low-density lipoproteins, interacts with a variety of receptor molecules expressed on target cells, thus eliciting a clathrin-mediated endocytosis process. In the cytoplasm, the disruption of the viral capsid allows the release of the single-stranded positively polarized RNA genome. The genomic RNA is then translated into a polyprotein precursor within the ER and then cut into ten single proteins by viral and host proteases [
