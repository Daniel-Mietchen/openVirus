<p>Even more recently, analyses of the microbioma of ERAP1−/− mice showed a significant enrichment for Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, mainly Prevotella, Odoribacter, Bacteroides, as compared to the microbioma of similarly housed and age-matched WT mice [
 <xref rid="B124-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. These findings led to establish a correlation between a role for ERAP1 role in immunodominance and gut dysbiosis in ERAP1−/− mice, possibly because of altered immune tolerance and resulting in the intestinal colonization by aberrant microbial communities. Further studies investigating the possible role of ERAPs variants in intestinal dysbiosis are needed.
