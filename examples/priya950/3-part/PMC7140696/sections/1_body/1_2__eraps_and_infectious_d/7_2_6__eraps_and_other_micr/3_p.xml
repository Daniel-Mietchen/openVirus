<p>In 2011, F-J Tsai et al. conducted a study to identify which genetic factors could predispose to Kawasaki disease (KD), whose etiology has been related to bacteria, viruses or other still poorly defined environmental factors [

They performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 250 KD patients and 446 controls in a Han Chinese population settled in Taiwan and later replicated the analysis on 208 cases and 366 controls from an independent Han Chinese cohort. Notably, two polymorphisms, rs149481 and rs27042, located in an ERAP1 gene intron were found to be associated with KD. These results underline how ERAP1 trimming function may have an important role in activating the immune response in KD, possibly modifying the peptide repertoire of a still unidentified pathogen [
