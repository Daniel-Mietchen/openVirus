<p>Two years later (2010), T.G. Tan et al. in an attempt to make the previously mentioned study applicable to a human context, focused on the orthologous gene of ERAAP in humans, i.e., ERAP1 [

The analysis was performed on a North American cohort which included 124 congenitally infected children: on a total of 32 genotyped SNPs, two of them—rs149173 and rs17481856, in strong LD with each other—were found to be associated with susceptibility to human congenital toxoplasmosis; no correlation with ERAP2 SNPs was found in this study [
