<p>In 2008, N. Blanchard et al. conducted a study on antigen presentation in a murine model of 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="B120-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Results showed that the immune response to 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is mediated by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells specific for an immunodominant and protective decapeptide, HF10, presented by the H-2Ld MHC I, whose generation is critically dependent on ERAAP proteolysis. Actually, ERAAP-deficient mice were extremely susceptible to infection and died rapidly, thus assigning to ERAAP the role of “susceptibility factor” for toxoplasmosis in mice. Certainly, this analysis of H-2d mice opens doors to further studies, aiming to provide the basis for the development of a 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> vaccine for humans [
