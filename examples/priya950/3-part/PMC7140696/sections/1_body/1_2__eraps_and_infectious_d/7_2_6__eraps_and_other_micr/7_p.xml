<p>Studies on in vitro cell-based antigen presentation showed that the high ankylosing spondylitis-risk ERAP1 allotype (Met349/Lys528/Asp575/Arg725/Gln730) destroyed more quickly most of HLA-B27 peptides, whether from viral, bacterial or self-origin [

Therefore, the authors assumed that the co-expression of HLA-B27 molecules and ERAP1 allotypes with greater enzymatic activity modifies the ordinary presentation of pathogen and self-peptides to the acquired immune system setting the conditions to autoimmunity [
