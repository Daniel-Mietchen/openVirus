<p>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection intensely triggers the immune system and is almost entirely controlled by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> CTLs, which proliferate massively upon LCMV infection [
 <xref rid="B115-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In 2006, I. A. York et al. using mice infected by LCMV, described a role for ERAP1 in shaping and handling peptides within the ER. In particular, they reported that the hierarchy of LCMV-derived immunodominant epitopes was extremely different in WT and ERAP1-KO infected mice [
 <xref rid="B116-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. While some LCMV epitopes were immunodominant in ERAP1-KO mice, they were not present in WT mice, because of the trimming activity of ERAP1 provoking their degradation [
 <xref rid="B116-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. On the other hand, LCMV-derived epitopes normally processed by ERAP1 were not present in ERAP1-KO mice. These results highlight the importance of ERAP1 protein in the immune response to the virus and its role in altering antigen shaping as well as epitope abundance on the cell surface [
 <xref rid="B116-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Of note, one year later, Firat and co-workers reported that despite the marked reduction of MHC class I expression levels (40%) in ERAP1 KO mice, they did not detect significant differences, upon acute LCMV infection, in the percentage of splenic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in ERAP1 KO mice compared with WT ones. The authors therefore concluded that owing to the plasticity of the T-cell response, only severe variances in epitope presentation may translate into significantly different CTL frequencies [
 <xref rid="B117-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Exploiting the same ERAP1-KO mice model, J. Yan et al. observed that ERAP1 expression can exert a positive, neutral, or negative effect in the generation of distinct class I epitopes. Indeed, when ERAP1-KO mice were infected LMCV, a drastic reduction of antigen epitope presentation (more than 80%) was observed. Conversely, against several influenza-derived epitopes they observed only a slightly reduced CTL response, but this did not reach statistical significance [
 <xref rid="B118-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Overall, these partly inconsistent findings suggest that ERAPs could exert a different contribution in the generation of antigens hierarchy in different viral infections. Thus, the consequences of ERAPs deficiency could be particularly evident in cases in which the response relies only on very few antigens whose presentation is significantly diminished by ERAP1 or low frequencies of specific CTLs are induced.
