<p>In order to deepen the role of APM in cervical carcinoma, another study on the occurrence of twelve nonsynonymous coding polymorphisms in the LMP2, LMP7, TAP1, TAP2, and ERAP1 genes in relation to disease outcome has been conducted by A.M. Mehta et al. on 75 cervical carcinoma cases [

Actually, results showed the ERAP1-127 SNP and the ERAP1-56–ERAP1-127 haplotype to be highly correlated to ERAP1 expression variability. Moreover, homozygosity and heterozygosity for ERAP1-127 SNP, as well as the ERAP1-56–ERAP1-127 haplotype were associated with decreased and increased overall survival, respectively. As the ERAP1-127 SNP maps in the peptidase M1 domain of the protein, the authors suggested that such SNP could be responsible for modifications in ERAP1 proteolytic function, leading to the presentation of an altered antigen repertoire, which would facilitate immune escape. Alternatively, the genetic variations at the analyzed loci may not have a direct effect on ERAP1 activity, but they could have a remote effect on other loci in LD [
