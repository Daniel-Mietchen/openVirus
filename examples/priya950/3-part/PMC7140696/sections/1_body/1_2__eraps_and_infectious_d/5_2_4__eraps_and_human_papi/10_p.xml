<p>In a subsequent study, A.M. Mehta et al. investigated the causes of ERAP1 downregulation in cervical carcinoma. Thus, they analyzed ERAP1 mRNA expression in tumor cells where the level of ERAP1 protein was known to be downregulated, comparing them to cells from patients with normal ERAP1 levels. Notably, ERAP1 mRNA level was demonstrated to be significantly correlated to decreased protein production. This finding suggests that the causes leading to protein downregulation occur at a pre-transcriptional level and may include mutations as well as complete and partial loss of heterozygosity and haplotype loss. These data represent the first understanding of the in vivo processes responsible for ERAP1 protein downregulation in cervical carcinoma [
