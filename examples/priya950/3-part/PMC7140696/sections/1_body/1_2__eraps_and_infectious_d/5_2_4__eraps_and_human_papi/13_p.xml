<p>To our knowledge, the only data associating ERAP2 SNPs to HPV-induced cervical cancer are those by L. Chuanyin et al. In particular, they established a correlation between rs26653 and rs27044 in ERAP1 and rs2287988 in ERAP2 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, suggesting that different ERAP SNPs may have combinatorial effects on disease susceptibility. However, it is worthwhile to be mentioned that screening for HPV-infection was not performed in the analyzed cohort, therefore the correlation between these ERAPs SNPs and HPV-infection is merely deductive 10.21203/rs.2.21433/v1 BMC Cancer (under review).</p>
