<p>In 2009, A.M. Mehta et al. genotyped 12 nonsynonymous, coding low molecular weight peptide (LMP)2, LMP7, TAP1, TAP2, and ERAP1 polymorphisms in 127 cervical carcinoma patients and 124 controls [
 <xref rid="B82-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. They identified a specific combination of four SNPs in genes encoding components of the APM (ERAP1-127, ERAP1-730, TAP2-651, and LMP7-145), which were associated with an increased cervical carcinoma risk [

In addition, they found that up to 12% of all cervical carcinomas correlated with a particular haplotype combination that include the minor allele at the ERAP1-127 and ERAP1-730 loci, and the major allele at the TAP2-651 and LMP7-145 loci. This haplotype results in a three-fold increase in cervical carcinoma risk. Implications and functional roles of these polymorphisms were not investigated in this study, although the authors hypothesize that they could be responsible for a different modulation of gene expression or for a change in protein functionality or, alternatively, could reflect a causative linkage with other, still unknown gene loci [
