<p>HPV targets epithelial cells of the basal layer in injured regions. HPV infection and growth are absolutely dependent upon the expression of the complete program of keratinocyte differentiation as thoroughly described in Human Papilloma Virus’ Life Cycle and Carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B76-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In fact, there is a strong dependence of viral lifecycle progression on host cells differentiation pathway, considering that new virions egress from terminally differentiated cells of the most superficial layer of the epithelium. As these cells can no longer replicate, HPV synthetizes the E6 and E7oncogenes—two viral proteins engaged on cell cycle control and genome maintenance—which, in turn, inactivate p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), responsible for controlling healthy cell lifecycle [
