<p>Recently, S. Steinbach et al. performed a comprehensive analysis concerning the expression of the APM in a panel of HPV16-positive cell lines, focusing on both mRNA and protein levels [
 <xref rid="B91-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Results showed an upregulation of different mRNA molecules in the APM pathway. Conversely, at protein level only ERAP1 synthesis was significantly increased in HPV16-positive cell lines and in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer lesions. These results did not mirror the ones reported by A.M. Mehta and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B83-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]; however, they complied with the Human Protein Atlas, which indicates cervical cancer as a condition where ERAP1 is upregulated [
 <xref rid="B92-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Since ERAP1 overexpression had already been associated with the elimination of immunodominant epitopes from melanoma [

 <xref rid="B95-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], the study focused on defining the role of ERAP1 upregulation in antigen presentation in HPV16-induced carcinomas. The authors speculated that a progressive increase of ERAP1 level in disease progression is paralleled by a decreased presentation of E7 81â€“91 and other epitopes, leading to a lack of targets for the immune system, perfectly functioning by itself [
