<p>In 2012 a study conducted by A. Hasim et al. investigated the role of ten genes within the HLA-I and APM family on HPV-dependent cervical cancerous lesions in a cohort of Uighur women [

The aim was to analyze the correlation between cancer development and genetic variants or aberrant regulation of HLA-I and APM, including gene promoter methylation, transcription and protein expression. Results showed that cancerous lesion development correlates with the partial or total loss of HLA-I, TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, LMP7, ERAP1, tapasin, calreticulin, and ERp57 mRNA and protein expression [
