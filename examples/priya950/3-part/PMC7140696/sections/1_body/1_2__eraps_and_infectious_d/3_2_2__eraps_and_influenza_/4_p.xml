<p>More recently, considering the role of ERAP2 in peptide shaping and presentation, C.J. Ye et al. investigated the generation of alternative isoforms of this gene in response to influenza infection, examining RNA-seq profiles of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from 243 individuals [
 <xref rid="B33-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. First, they showed that the rs2248374-G allele reduces ERAP2 expression both in resting and IFNB1-stimulated cells. Moreover, in flu-infected cells the presence of two previously unknown short isoforms (ERAP2/ISO3, ERAP2/ISO4) was observed. Remarkably, following IFNB1 stimulation the two short isoforms were not any more detectable, suggesting that their transcription is possibly dependent on viral stimuli, upstream of interferon 1 signaling pathway. The two short isoforms, transcribed from HapB, are different from the full-length one – ERAP2/Iso1, transcribed from HapA —because their transcription begins in correspondence of exon 9 and undergoes alternative splicing of an extended exon 10. Moreover, they differ from each other by alternative splicing at a secondary splice site at exon 15 and they are both translated into proteins lacking the catalytic domain [

Therefore, the author speculates that the expression of the two short flu-specific isoforms may exert a dominant negative effect on wild type (WT) ERAP1 or ERAP2. This would lead to an altered peptide processing, possibly conferring an advantage against infection by presenting a more immunogenic antigen repertoire [
