<p>There are four different types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D, even though the latter has not been demonstrated to cause illness in humans yet. Influenza virus binds to the epithelial cell receptors and enters through an endocytosis process [
 <xref rid="B49-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Once inside the target cell, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm and then transported into the nucleus, where transcription and replication occur. Among the resulting viral proteins, some combine with the replicated RNA fragments generating new virions [
