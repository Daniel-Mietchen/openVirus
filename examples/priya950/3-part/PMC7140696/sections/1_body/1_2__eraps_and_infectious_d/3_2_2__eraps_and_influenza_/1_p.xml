<p>Influenza virus is the etiological agent of influenza, an acute respiratory disease yearly affecting millions of people worldwide. Mostly, influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics of disease with peak illness periods which have a heavy impact on worker and school absenteeism and productivity loss. The majority of individuals who contract the infection require a relatively brief time to recover from fever and other typical symptoms; however, in other cases influenza results in more serious illness and possibly death, particularly among high-risk groups, causing about 290,000 to 650,000 deceases per year [
