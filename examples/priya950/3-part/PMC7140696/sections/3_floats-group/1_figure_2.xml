  <p>Schematic representation of the mechanism of action displayed by ERAP2 ISO3 and ISO4 in the antigen presentation pathway. (
   <bold>A</bold>). Following virus infection rs2248374-A ERAP2 expressing cells produce wild type ERAP2 (ERAP2-wt) which can homodimerize or heterodimerize with ERAP1-wt (ERAP2-wt
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP2-wt; ERAP1-wt
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP2-wt), in order to process viral antigens to be presented on cell surface for recognition by specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. (
   <bold>B</bold>). Following virus infection rs2248374-G ERAP2 expressing cells may transcribe two alternative spliced isoforms: ERAP2-ISO3 and ERAP2-ISO4. This two variants, unlike ERAP2-wt, lack the catalytic domain but can still heterodimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt. As a result, these unconventional heterodimers (ISO3
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP2-wt; ISO3
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP1-wt; ISO4
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP2-wt; ISO4
   <sup>+</sup>ERAP1-wt) may process viral antigens differently from the canonical ones, generating an alternative antigenic repertoire. This in turn may activate other CTL clones and more broadly a more or less protective response by the immune system.
