<p id="P15">The NS1 protein interacts not only with a multitude of host cell factors but also with other viral proteins to regulate viral gene expression (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Mari√≥n et al., 1997</xref>). To address whether the interactions between our NS1 proteins and other viral proteins of the H1N1 background are contributing to the observed changes within the library, we measured viral replication using recombinant viruses expressing A/Moscow/2/2007, A/Tasmania/277/2007, or A/Udorn/1972 NS1 proteins but in an A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo background, both

 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). H5N1 viruses are phylogenetically farther from H1N1 when compared with H3N2 viruses. Thus, if any viral segment other than NS is involved in the phenotypic changes observed, they would become more evident by using an H5N1 viral background. While differences in replication among the three viruses in eggs and in MDCK cells were more apparent than when the PR8 background was used, these differences were consistent with the differences observed in barcode abundance for these NS1 genes when in the PR8 library (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that the host, not the viral strain background, is the major driver for the fitness differences observed within the library.
