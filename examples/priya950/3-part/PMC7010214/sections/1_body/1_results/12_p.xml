<p id="P19">Finally, we analyzed the temporal fitness dynamics of the viral library in WT mice (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Viruses were sorted into different groups following a medoid-based clustering analysis according to their viral fitness properties over time (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2</xref>). Viruses that were phylogenetically related shared similar fitness trends. This is exemplified by cluster 4, mainly composed of human H3N2 NS1-containing recombinant viruses, which displayed a decreasing trend from day 2 to day 5 post-infection because of their inability to establish robust levels of viral replication

 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2f</xref>). In particular, avian-origin NS1 strains like A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) and the phylogenetically related A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013 (H9N2), A/Shorebird/DEBay/2009 (H10N7), and A/Mallard/RGeorgia/2011 (H10N4) were phenotypically grouped with all pH1N1 NS1 recombinant viruses included in the library. Despite their phylogenetic differences, all viruses within this cluster shared similar dynamics over time, with increasing overall fitness from day 2 to day 5 post-infection. Finally, allele B NS1-containing viruses were distributed in different clusters, mainly clusters 3 and 7 (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2g</xref>). These clusters represent a high and stable fitness profile at all post-infection times tested.
