<p id="P8">Current findings of NS1 and its role in viral replication have been studied in the context of single viral infections. Given that influenza virus strains are continuously co-circulating and evolving through selective pressure, studying the spatio-temporal evolution of NS1 in a wider context may provide insights in its contributions to IAV replication and tropism. To address this, we used the influenza H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) virus background to generate a library of recombinant IAVs expressing a selection of NS1 proteins within a modified NS segment. This strategy allows us to determine the abundance of each virus within the library through a barcode-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (

The splicing mechanism of the NS segment was altered to separate both NS1 and NEP open reading frames (ORFs), allowing changes in the NS1 sequence without affecting the NEP sequence. In addition, we inserted a genetically neutral 22-nucleotide barcode in the non-coding region between the NS1 and the NEP ORFs (
