<p id="P12">We next wanted to explore in more detail the relationship between differences in NS1 amino acid sequence versus differences in barcode read abundance among all viruses. For this purpose, we conducted a multiple comparison between differences in NS1 amino acid sequence and differences in fitness between all viruses within the library as described in 
 <xref rid="S4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>. Network analysis in murine lungs (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) revealed clusters of viruses that shared similar fitness profiles but were significantly different in terms of amino acid sequence. This may indicate a converging evolution for some NS1 gene subsets for host-specific factors. Altogether, we conclude that our barcode-based NGS technique can be efficiently used to track fitness of individual viruses in different hosts within the NS1 viral library population and revealed a large diversity of NS1-driven phenotypic behaviors in multiple host substrates, with evidence for both convergent and divergent evolutions within the NS1 sequence space.
