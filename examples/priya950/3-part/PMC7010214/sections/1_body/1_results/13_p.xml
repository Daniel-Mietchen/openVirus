<p id="P20">This clustering analysis allowed us to study the combination of viral trends and fitness profiles within the library over time and revealed that the fittest viruses followed two significantly different profiles (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). While allele B NS1-containing viruses displayed early replication kinetics that were sustained during the time of the experiment, the best adapted viruses containing allele A NS1 (A/Shanghai/02/2013 and A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013) initially exhibited lower levels of fitness followed by a rapid increase in abundance after day 3 post-infection, reaching comparable levels to the allele B counterparts at day 5 post-infection. We propose that this group of NS1, which includes those of some H7N9 viruses, confers enhanced fitness abilities under high inflammatory conditions that in mice start after day 3 post-infection (
