<p id="P13">We also analyzed the recombinant library profile using human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). Although profile comparison between MDCK and A549 cells displayed differences among several clades of the phylogenetic tree, viruses expressing allele B NS1 were overrepresented within the viral population. Viruses containing H5N1 NS1 sequences were more adapted to MDCK cells than to human A549 cells, while viruses containing NS1 derived from equine and canine hosts were overrepresented after passaging in both cell lines. Despite possible cell line-intrinsic differences, only human A549 cells provided a replicative substrate in which human H3N2 NS1 did not became underrepresented, suggesting that human H3N2 NS1 has become specifically adapted to human cells. This was not the case for human H1N1 NS1.
