<p id="P32">Viral infections were performed either at a specific multiplicity of infection (MOI) or by combining 100 pfu per virus when using the viral library. Cell lines were infected with the viral inoculum in PBS supplemented with 0.3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Gemini, West Sacramento, CA) in triplicates. After one hour of incubation at room temperature, cells were washed with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to remove the unbound virus. Cells were incubated in MEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA and either with 0.2 μg/ml (A549 cells) or 1 μg/ml (MDCK cells) of TPCK-trypsin at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. When indicated, cell culture supernatants were sampled at different time points to assess viral replication by standard plaque assay technique using MDCK cells. 10-day-old embryonated eggs were infected with 100 μl of viral library in PBS in triplicates. 48 hours later, allantoic fluid was harvested for downstream processing. Infection experiments in all mouse models tested were done in triplicate by inoculating each animal intranasally with 25 μl of PBS containing either the viral library or individual recombinant viruses. Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs of disease. At the indicated times post infection, animals were euthanized and lung tissue was collected in 1 mL of PBS. Samples were homogenized using sterile ceramic beads after two rounds of mechanical treatment of 10 s at 6.5 m/s. Tissue debris was removed by three rounds of low-speed centrifugations and viral titers in the supernatants were determined by plaque assay in triplicates. Samples were further processed by NGS techniques to measure relative viral barcode abundance.
