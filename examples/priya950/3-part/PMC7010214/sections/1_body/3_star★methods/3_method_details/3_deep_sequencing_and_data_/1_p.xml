<p id="P33">Viral RNA extraction from supernatants of infected MDCK or A549 cells, allantoic fluid and mouse lungs was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), following manufacturer’s instructions. In order to monitor viral populations, Superscript III One step RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used with specific primers to amplify the whole NS segment. This was followed by a nested PCR strategy to amplify the region surrounding the barcode sequence (~300 bp), using specific primers that contained barcoded Illumina linkers. This step was performed using a low cycle count to reduce possible nucleotide mismatches during the amplification process. Up to twenty samples were multiplexed per run and then analyzed on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Barcoded reads were obtained and analyzed with a custom-specific software consisting of R-written scripts and run on Mount Sinai’s high-performance computing cluster following the parameters previously described (

Additionally, all NS1 recombinant viruses in the library were full genome deep-sequenced. For that, previously extracted viral RNA were heat fragmented followed by first and second strand cDNA synthesis using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Then, the 3′ end of each sample was repaired and further ligated with adapters for multiplex purposes. Samples were enriched by PCR and bands with fragment size between 200 bp and 400 bp were cut and purified from an agarose gel for further processing. Finally, DNA amount for each sample was quantified by RT-PCR and viral samples were combined, denatured, mixed with the internal control PhiX and loaded into the Illumina cartridge for sequencing. Circular plots were built using Circos software (
