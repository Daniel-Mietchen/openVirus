<p id="P31">A modified NS segment that introduces a non-coding region between NS1 and NEP was used as previously described (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Varble et al., 2014</xref>). Each NS segment was individually designed with a unique 22-nucleotide neutral barcode, inserted in the non-coding region between NS1 and NEP. This labeling strategy allows to individually track and quantify each NS segment in the Illumina Deep Sequencing platform. A total of 56 NS1 sequences were selected for the final library. As an internal control, two different barcodes were generally used per each NS1 sequence. NS1 sequences were synthesized using the GeneArt Strings DNA fragments platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cloned into EcoRI and NheI sites into the pDZ vector. Standard reverse genetics were used to rescue each individual virus in a A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) backbone, as previously described (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 1999</xref>). Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to transfect a co-culture of HEK293T and MDCK cells with seven ambisense pDZ plasmids in combination with the pDZ NS1 split barcoded plasmid specific for each IAV, and incubated for 72 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Additionally, plasmid-based rescue system for recombinant viruses in the A/Vietnam/1203/04/H5N1 (HALo) backbone followed a slightly different strategy, using 8 pPolI plasmids encoding the viral RNAs and 4 pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding the viral proteins PB1, PB2, PA and NP. Cell culture supernatants containing influenza virions were collected. Final stocks of each recombinant virus were achieved after plaque purification and infecting fresh MDCK cells (80% confluence) with a 1:100 dilution of the purified plaque and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 1μg/ml of TPCK trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay and by hemagglutination assays using a suspension of 5% turkey red blood cells in PBS. Absence of defective interfering particles was confirmed by comparing hemagglutination activity versus viral titers.
