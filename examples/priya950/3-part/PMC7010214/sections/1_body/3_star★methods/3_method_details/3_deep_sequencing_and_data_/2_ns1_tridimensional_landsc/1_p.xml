<p id="P34">Three dimensional landscapes were generated in a similar manner as in a previous publication (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Nachbagauer et al., 2017</xref>). To generate the horizontal plane for the 3D landscapes, amino acid sequences of all NS1 proteins were aligned with the Clustal Omega Multiple Sequence Alignment tool and a Percent Identity Matrix was generated. The distances were calculated by multi-dimensional scaling based on the percent amino acid sequence difference (

 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). The 
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> coordinates therefore represent the relative distance between NS1 proteins based on percent amino acid difference. The z axis indicates the relative up- or downregulation on a log
 <sub>2</sub> scale. The NS1 sequences were separated into two groups (alleles A and B) for presentation. The scales of all axes are consistent between the graphs. The surfaces were approximated from the log
 <sub>2</sub> upregulation or downregulation data for all NS1 proteins using multilevel B-splines. The
