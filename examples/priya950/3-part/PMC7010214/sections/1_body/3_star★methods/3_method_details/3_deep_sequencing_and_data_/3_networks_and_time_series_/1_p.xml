<p id="P35">All distance calculations were done using custom R scripts. Amino acid sequences of the different NS1 proteins were first aligned using the multiple sequence alignment (

 </bold>) R package (
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bodenhofer et al., 2015</xref>) and ClustalW with a BloSum62 similarity matrix and standard parameters. Pairwise distances were then converted into a distance matrix for further processing and phenotypic data was log
 <sub>2</sub> transformed. Organism-individual as well as combined datasets from the individual measurements were further processed. Data from single case/control measurements were converted into distances by Euclidian metric. Time series data was transformed into distances 
 <italic>d</italic> using both Euclidian metric and Pearson’s correlation derived distance 
 <italic>dρ</italic> = (1 − 
 <italic>ρ</italic>)/2. Genotypic and phenotypic distances were normalized to assure 0 ≤ 
 <italic>d</italic> ≤ 1 and further combined by linear combination assuming identical weights ( 
 <italic>= 1</italic>) for both genotypic and phenotypic contributions. Combined distances were then converted into similarities by 
 <italic>sim</italic> = 
 <italic>d</italic>

  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> − 
 <italic>d</italic>. Differential distances between pairs of genotypes and phenotypes were calculated by using the Differential Gene Correlation Analysis (
 <bold>
  <italic>DGCA</italic>
 </bold>) R package (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>). Normalized genotype and phenotype distances were calculated as previously described (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Forst, 2000</xref>). Distances were first converted to similarities for further processing together with corresponding sample size information. Then, resulting matrices of scaled differences in distances were further clustered. Cluster analysis of correlation and distance data as well as results from differential distance analysis was performed by using a 
 <italic>Partitioning Around Medoids</italic> (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2006</xref>). The number of clusters (
 <italic>k</italic>) was estimated by optimum average silhouette width using the 
 <italic>fpc</italic> R package. Similarity graphs were visualized with CytoScape using a force directed layout with weights based on the similarity measure. Similarity clusters have been identified by hierarchical clustering based on the combined distance or by calculating the optimized community structure based on the weighted modularity from the corresponding weighted similarity graph. Outliers between virus duplicates were assessed by a hierarchical linear model using
