<p id="P23">In our study, we cannot distinguish between fitness effects due to the species origin and those due to the substrate origin of the virus growth substrates. In other words, while differences in viral fitness between MDCK and A549 cells are likely related to their species of origin (canine versus human), they might also be influenced by the tissue origin (MDCK cells are kidney cells, and A549 are respiratory epithelial cells) or even by the passage history of the cell line. Nevertheless, differences between these substrates reflect a differential impact of host factors and tissue environment in NS1-mediated fitness.</p>
