<p id="P24">Thus, we propose that differences in tropism among the IAV NS1 genes result from adaptations to specific host factors among the large variety of known NS1 interactors. For instance, NS1 proteins that interact with highly conserved host proteins to enhance viral replication might display a broad host tropism. Such is the case of the host polyadenylation factor CPSF30, which is one of the known host targets interacting with NS1 (
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, NS1 variants that do not interact with CPSF30, like the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, may have adapted to inhibit other host factors with high sequence diversity among the host species, like TRIM25. This would result in host specialization of this subgroup of NS1. Nevertheless, focusing on a particular domain or specific amino acid changes within the NS1 sequence may not be the right approach to understand the virus-host interactions and the mechanisms behind the multiple phenotypes observed in our library experiments. We found evidence of such complexity in our results with a subset of NS1 that confers increased fitness under high pro-inflammatory conditions

Our future work will rely on multiscale, high-throughput studies that will explore protein-protein interactions between NS1 and cellular host factors. This will provide further insights into how the virus modulates the antiviral response and how it evolves through this dynamic selective pressure.
