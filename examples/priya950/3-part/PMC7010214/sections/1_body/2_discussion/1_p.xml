<p id="P21">Overall, we have used an unbiased system to assess the influenza NS1-mediated tropism in the context of a heterogeneous viral population. Our approach takes advantage of the defined sequence space within naturally occurring IAV strains. Using a library of IAVs containing different NS1 representatives of the known NS1 genotypic variation, we found multiple evolutionary lines for this viral protein, leading to a great variety of host tropism phenotypes. We found phenotypic differences between NS1 phenotypes that were evolutionary related, such as the ones of human H3N2 viruses and old seasonal H1N1 viruses. This is unexpected, because H3N2 and H1N1 NS1 share a common H1N1 ancestor (the NS1 of the 1918 IAV) and both have been circulating in humans for decades without reasserting since 1958 (
