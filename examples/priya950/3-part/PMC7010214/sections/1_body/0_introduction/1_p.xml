<p id="P6">Several influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes and strains co-circulate worldwide in diverse hosts, a subset of which causes seasonal epidemics every year in humans. Constant evolution of these heterogeneous viral populations is driven by small, single-point mutation changes or by the result of reassortment within the same host due to co-infection events (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Treanor, 2004</xref>). These evolutionary events can lead to the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential in humans. Thus, developing ways to efficiently and accurately detect viral genotypic changes and predict fitness-based phenotypic outcomes within a viral population is imperative for predicting future pandemics. Influenza viruses are part of the negative single-stranded RNA family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, with an approximately 13-kb-long segmented genome (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Palese and Shaw, 2007</xref>). Segment 8 (NS) is the smallest and encodes for the nonstructural protein NS1, as well as for the NEP protein generated through an alternative splicing event. NS1 is a significant contributor to the pathogenic potential of IAVs and has become an important research topic in influenza research, because it displays multiple mechanisms to antagonize the interferon (IFN)-mediated host antiviral response, some of which are viral strain and host species specific (

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Greenspan et al., 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Kochs et al., 2007</xref>). NS1 is expressed in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of infected cells, interacting functionally with different cellular factors. For instance, the N-terminal RNA binding domain of NS1 binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, thus blocking the activation of the antiviral enzyme OAS (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Min and Krug, 2006</xref>). NS1 also binds and sequesters dsRNA from activating RIG-I Like Receptors (RLRs), Protein Kinase R (PKR), and MDA5, which are triggers of the host innate immune response (

 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hatada and Fukuda, 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, RIG-I and PKR are specifically inhibited by NS1 through direct binding to these proteins or to proteins involved in their activation (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2006</xref>). NS1 also blocks mRNA maturation and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting cellular gene expression (
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Satterly et al., 2007</xref>). Other host factors interacting with NS1 have been described, resulting in the regulation of multiple host pathways related to innate immunity, cell death, transcription, and mRNA processing (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Ayllon and García-Sastre, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, due to potential redundancy among the different NS1-mediated effects, several influenza strains contain NS1 phenotypes that do not possess all functions described to date (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, some host proteins that interact with NS1 do not share identical sequences across species. This opens the possibility for differences in virus-host protein interactions according to the viral strain origin of the NS1 and the host species origin of the cellular factor. Such differences are likely to favor or to restrict the preferred host for viral replication.
