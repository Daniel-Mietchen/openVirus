<p id="P7">Based on amino acid homology, NS segments can be classified into two distinct gene pools: allele A and allele B (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 1991</xref>). The allele A group includes NS variants from both avian and mammal origins, whereas the allele B group mainly contains avian-origin strains that have been recently reported to be also capable of supporting infection in mammalian hosts (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>). Sequence identity within each group is typically above 90%, but it is only around 60% between both alleles (
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Munir et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Zohari et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we have selected 48 allele A and 9 allele B NS1 phenotypes representing the sequence space of the NS1 present in IAV sequence databases and compared the ability of each NS1 to contribute to the replication of IAVs in multiple host substrates.
