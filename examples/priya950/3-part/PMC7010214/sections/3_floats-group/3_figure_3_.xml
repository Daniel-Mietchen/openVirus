  <p id="P48">(A) Three representative viruses showing different viral trends in the library were selected based on differences in barcode abundance.</p>
  <p id="P49">(Bâ€“D) Single-virus infections were conducted in triplicate using 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (B), MDCK cells (C), and 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (D). Viral replication was quantified at different time points post-infection.</p>
  <p id="P50">(E) Body weight loss of infected mice was monitored daily.</p>
