  <title>Phylogenetic and Spatio-temporal Diversity of the NS1-Barcoded Viral Library</title>
  <p id="P45">Phylogenetic tree containing all available NS1 sequences, assembled by following the neighbor joining (NJ) method and using p distances. Selected NS1 sequences used in this study are depicted as colored arrows along the tree based on their host origin: human (red), avian (blue), swine (green), and other mammals (gray). The distance bar is shown below the tree. Strains are depicted as shown in 
   <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>. Asterisks denote isolates that were involved in cross-species transmissions following this order: Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) viruses were included as avian origin (blue arrows), because they came from a zoonotic transmission from an avian host. Similarly, A/Elephant seal/California/2010 is red (human), because it was a reverse zoonotic transmission from humans.
