  <title>Time Course Analysis Revealed Correlating Clusters of Phylogenetically Related Viruses with Similar Trends 
   <italic>In Vivo</italic>
  </title>
  <p id="P54">(A) WT mice were infected with the NS1 viral library, and barcode read profiles for each virus were analyzed at days 2â€“5 post-infection. Fitness trends over time were clustered by similarity. *p &lt; 0.05.</p>
  <p id="P55">(B) Representative viruses exhibiting the highest barcode abundance followed different dynamics over time and can be mainly divided into two groups. For instance, allele B NS1 recombinant viruses showed high levels since early after infection (continuous lines), while others, such as A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) and its phylogenetically closest related A/Chicken/Rizhao/651/2013 (H9N2), gradually increased over time. Error bars depict SD of at least 6 replicates.</p>
