circulate in both mammalian and avian species. The IAV NS1 protein is a
multifunctional virulence factor that inhibits the type I interferon host
response through a myriad of mechanisms. How NS1 has evolved to enable this
remarkable property across species and its specific impact in the overall
replication, pathogenicity, and host preference remain unknown. Here we analyze
the NS1 evolutionary landscape and host tropism using a barcoded library of
recombinant IAVs. Results show a surprisingly great variety of NS1 phenotypes
according to their ability to replicate in different hosts. The IAV NS1 genes
appear to have taken diverse and random evolutionary pathways within their
multiple phylogenetic lineages. In summary, the high evolutionary plasticity of
this viral protein underscores the ability of IAVs to adapt to multiple hosts
and aids in our understanding of its global prevalence.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="P4"><graphic xlink:href="nihms-1547119-f0001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></p></abstract><abstract id="ABS3" abstract-type="summary"><title>In Brief</title><p id="P5">Mu&#x000f1;oz-Moreno et al. report that influenza A virus NS1 undergoes

in diverse hosts, a subset of which causes seasonal epidemics every year in humans.
Constant evolution of these heterogeneous viral populations is driven by small,
single-point mutation changes or by the result of reassortment within the same host
due to co-infection events (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Treanor, 2004</xref>).
These evolutionary events can lead to the emergence of new strains with pandemic
potential in humans. Thus, developing ways to efficiently and accurately detect
viral genotypic changes and predict fitness-based phenotypic outcomes within a viral
population is imperative for predicting future pandemics. Influenza viruses are part
of the negative single-stranded RNA family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, with
an approximately 13-kb-long segmented genome (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Palese
and Shaw, 2007</xref>). Segment 8 (NS) is the smallest and encodes for the
nonstructural protein NS1, as well as for the NEP protein generated through an
alternative splicing event. NS1 is a significant contributor to the pathogenic
potential of IAVs and has become an important research topic in influenza research,
because it displays multiple mechanisms to antagonize the interferon (IFN)-mediated
host antiviral response, some of which are viral strain and host species specific
(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a-Sastre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Greenspan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Kochs et al., 2007</xref>). NS1 is expressed in the nucleus and
in the cytoplasm of infected cells, interacting functionally with different cellular
factors. For instance, the N-terminal RNA binding domain of NS1 binds to
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, thus blocking the activation of the antiviral
enzyme OAS (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Min and Krug, 2006</xref>). NS1 also
binds and sequesters dsRNA from activating RIG-I Like Receptors (RLRs), Protein
Kinase R (PKR), and MDA5, which are triggers of the host innate immune response
(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Benitez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hatada and Fukuda, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, RIG-I and PKR are specifically inhibited
by NS1 through direct binding to these proteins or to proteins involved in their
activation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2006</xref>). NS1 also blocks mRNA maturation and
export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting cellular gene expression
(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Satterly et al., 2007</xref>). Other host factors interacting
with NS1 have been described, resulting in the regulation of multiple host pathways
related to innate immunity, cell death, transcription, and mRNA processing (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Ayllon and Garc&#x000ed;a-Sastre, 2015</xref>).
Interestingly, due to potential redundancy among the different NS1-mediated effects,
several influenza strains contain NS1 phenotypes that do not possess all functions
described to date (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2010</xref>).
Furthermore, some host proteins that interact with NS1 do not share identical
sequences across species. This opens the possibility for differences in virus-host
protein interactions according to the viral strain origin of the NS1 and the host
species origin of the cellular factor. Such differences are likely to favor or to
restrict the preferred host for viral replication.</p><p id="P7">Based on amino acid homology, NS segments can be classified into two distinct
gene pools: allele A and allele B (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al.,
1991</xref>). The allele A group includes NS variants from both avian and mammal
origins, whereas the allele B group mainly contains avian-origin strains that have
been recently reported to be also capable of supporting infection in mammalian hosts
(<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>). Sequence
identity within each group is typically above 90%, but it is only around 60% between
both alleles (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Munir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Zohari et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we have
selected 48 allele A and 9 allele B NS1 phenotypes representing the sequence space
of the NS1 present in IAV sequence databases and compared the ability of each NS1 to
contribute to the replication of IAVs in multiple host substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P8">Current findings of NS1 and its role in viral replication have been studied
in the context of single viral infections. Given that influenza virus strains are
continuously co-circulating and evolving through selective pressure, studying the
spatio-temporal evolution of NS1 in a wider context may provide insights in its
contributions to IAV replication and tropism. To address this, we used the influenza
H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) virus background to generate a library of recombinant
IAVs expressing a selection of NS1 proteins within a modified NS segment. This
strategy allows us to determine the abundance of each virus within the library
through a barcode-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Varble et al., 2014</xref>). The splicing mechanism of the NS
segment was altered to separate both NS1 and NEP open reading frames (ORFs),
allowing changes in the NS1 sequence without affecting the NEP sequence. In
addition, we inserted a genetically neutral 22-nucleotide barcode in the non-coding
region between the NS1 and the NEP ORFs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). This strategy enables us
to track individual viral fitness within the library based on the relative number of
barcode reads after replication in different hosts.</p><p id="P9">After confirming that expression of the modified NS segment did not
significantly affect viral replication (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>), we validated our approach
to study NS1-mediated fitness in multiple hosts using a mixture of 4 recombinant
IAVs containing the following NS1 sequences: A/Shanghai/02/2013 from an avian H7N9
strain, A/Udorn/1972 from a human H3N2 strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) from a
human mouse-adapted H1N1 strain, and the loss-of-function mutant PR8-R38A/K41A,
which is unable to bind to dsRNA (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Donelan et al.,
2003</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Talon et al., 2000</xref>). Several
models of influenza virus infection&#x02014;Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells,
embryonated chicken eggs, and 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice&#x02014;were infected with a
mix containing either 50 or 100 plaque-forming units (PFUs) per virus. Total barcode
reads per virus were normalized to the initial proportion present on the viral mix
before infection (input) after 48 h of replication and plotted in viral progression
diagrams (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>). As
anticipated, barcode reads of PR8-R38A/K41A NS1 severely decreased compared with
input. This was also the case for the NS1 of A/Udorn/1972, although to a lesser
extent. However, levels of wild-type (WT) PR8 notably increased, followed by
A/Shanghai/02/2013. These results support our barcode-based strategy as a tool to
study individual viral fitness within a library of IAVs only differing in their NS1
sequences. Because generally similar profiles were obtained between replicates at
both concentrations tested in all three infection models, a dose of 100 PFU/virus
was selected for further experiments with our full library of recombinant IAVs.</p><p id="P10">We next selected various NS1 variants from fully sequenced IAV strains based
on their relative phylogenetic distance, their host, and their year of isolation. To
maximize functional representation, we also took into consideration the inclusion of
NS1 sequences with different structural and functional sequence feature variant
types (SFVTs) (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Noronha et al., 2012</xref>). <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> contains our final selection of 56 NS1
sequences from different strains, hosts, countries, and years. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the position of our selected NS1 sequences
within a global NS1 phylogenetic tree. Their widespread distribution among different
clades confirms that our curated viral library is representative of the NS1 sequence
space in circulating IAVs from 1954 to 2013. The selected NS1 sequences were
assembled into split NS segments and assigned to unique barcode sequences.
Recombinant viruses were rescued by reverse genetics in an influenza A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934 virus background (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al.,
1999</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Neumann et al., 1999</xref>). While
each virus contained a unique NS1 sequence, the rest of the viral genome remained
constant within the library.</p><p id="P11">Importantly, each NS1 sequence in our final virus library was represented by
two recombinant viruses, each with a unique barcode. This was implemented as an
internal control of variability, because viruses that carry the same NS1 but have
different barcodes should behave similarly within the library. Moreover, this
duplication approach is used to account for possible differences in amplification
due to the different nucleotide composition among the barcode sequences. Recombinant
viruses were individually rescued, grown in MDCK cells, titrated, and fully
sequenced to confirm that no additional changes were generated during the rescue and
that our virus stocks were generally free of defective interfering RNAs. Finally,
all individual viruses were mixed in a common library preparation using identical
numbers of infectious units. Then, MDCK cells, embryonated chicken eggs, and mice
were infected with the library, and 48 h later, barcode abundance for each virus was
analyzed and normalized to the original library (input) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Viruses containing phylogenetically related NS1
behaved similarly in all three hosts tested, and no major differences were found in
barcode abundance among duplicated NS1 viruses. However, overall fitness diversity
was observed due to the NS1 species-specific tropism within the library (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, avian H5N1
NS1-containing viruses replicated poorly in mouse lungs compared with MDCK
supernatants and egg allantoic fluid. In contrast, viruses carrying human H3N2 NS1
were underrepresented in all three models tested, suggesting poor adaptation to
canine, chicken, and murine hosts. Conversely, viruses containing mammalian
non-human NS1 (H3N8) were overrepresented in MDCK supernatants and in chicken
allantoic fluid. Interestingly, the group of viruses containing NS1 from the allele
B clade were ubiquitously overrepresented in all models tested. This is consistent
with recent studies suggesting that allele B NS1-containing viruses do not exhibit
specific host restrictions or attenuation in replication or in pathogenicity (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, we tested the
reproducibility of our library system approach both <italic>in vivo</italic> and
<italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, two independent library preparations
were compared in infection experiments of murine lungs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1a</xref>) and of MDCK cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1b</xref>), showing high
correlation profiles at 48 h post-infection (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next wanted to explore in more detail the relationship between
differences in NS1 amino acid sequence versus differences in barcode read abundance
among all viruses. For this purpose, we conducted a multiple comparison between
differences in NS1 amino acid sequence and differences in fitness between all
viruses within the library as described in <xref rid="S4" ref-type="sec">STAR
Methods</xref>. Network analysis in murine lungs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), MDCK cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>),
and embryonated eggs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) revealed
clusters of viruses that shared similar fitness profiles but were significantly
different in terms of amino acid sequence. This may indicate a converging evolution
for some NS1 gene subsets for host-specific factors. Altogether, we conclude that
our barcode-based NGS technique can be efficiently used to track fitness of
individual viruses in different hosts within the NS1 viral library population and
revealed a large diversity of NS1-driven phenotypic behaviors in multiple host
substrates, with evidence for both convergent and divergent evolutions within the
NS1 sequence space.</p><p id="P13">We also analyzed the recombinant library profile using human lung
adenocarcinoma A549 cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure
S2</xref>). Although profile comparison between MDCK and A549 cells displayed
differences among several clades of the phylogenetic tree, viruses expressing allele
B NS1 were overrepresented within the viral population. Viruses containing H5N1 NS1
sequences were more adapted to MDCK cells than to human A549 cells, while viruses
containing NS1 derived from equine and canine hosts were overrepresented after
passaging in both cell lines. Despite possible cell line-intrinsic differences, only
human A549 cells provided a replicative substrate in which human H3N2 NS1 did not
became underrepresented, suggesting that human H3N2 NS1 has become specifically
adapted to human cells. This was not the case for human H1N1 NS1.</p><p id="P14">We next wanted to validate whether the viral library profile dynamics can be
reproduced in single-virus experiments using a selection of three viruses within the
library with different barcode abundance profiles in all hosts tested (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs
(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), MDCK cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) were inoculated with 100 PFU of
A/Moscow/2/2007, A/Tasmania/277/2007, or A/Udorn/1972 recombinant viruses, and viral
replication was analyzed, as well as body weight loss <italic>in vivo</italic>
(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). No statistical differences
were found in the replication kinetics of the three viruses in eggs and in MDCK
cells. A possible reason for the lack of differences in viral titers between these
viruses at later time points in these substrates is that they might provide an
unlimited resource of replication that only becomes limited when these viruses are
put in competition. However, levels of viral replication in mouse lungs were
consistent with the data obtained in the context of the library, and this correlated
with significant differences in morbidity and mortality among the three viruses
tested.</p><p id="P15">The NS1 protein interacts not only with a multitude of host cell factors but
also with other viral proteins to regulate viral gene expression (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Mari&#x000f3;n et al., 1997</xref>). To address whether the
interactions between our NS1 proteins and other viral proteins of the H1N1
background are contributing to the observed changes within the library, we measured
viral replication using recombinant viruses expressing A/Moscow/2/2007,
A/Tasmania/277/2007, or A/Udorn/1972 NS1 proteins but in an A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1)
HALo background, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). H5N1 viruses are
phylogenetically farther from H1N1 when compared with H3N2 viruses. Thus, if any
viral segment other than NS is involved in the phenotypic changes observed, they
would become more evident by using an H5N1 viral background. While differences in
replication among the three viruses in eggs and in MDCK cells were more apparent
than when the PR8 background was used, these differences were consistent with the
differences observed in barcode abundance for these NS1 genes when in the PR8
library (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that the
host, not the viral strain background, is the major driver for the fitness
differences observed within the library.</p><p id="P16">Next, we analyzed the multiple NS1 evolutionary directions based on their
host-specific fitness within the viral library. To this end, we generated an
identity matrix based on amino acid sequence differences and analyzed the
log<sub>2</sub> induction over the input at 48 h post-infection for each virus.
Data were plotted as three-dimensional (3D) landscapes to visualize the distribution
of specific viral groups and their contribution to the overall fitness profile
(<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). While allele B NS1-containing
viruses shared similar high viral fitness profiles in murine lungs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), MDCK cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), and allantoic fluid (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure
4F</xref>), allele A H3N2 NS1-expressing viruses showed poor fitness in all
three host models tested. However, the distribution of some avian allele A viruses
was different among mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), MDCK
cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and allantoic fluid (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Among them, recombinant viruses
containing H7N9 (A/Shanghai/02/2013) and H9N2 (A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013) NS1 showed
increased viral fitness in mouse lungs. Intriguingly, multiple H7N9 human infections

mice, which are deficient in IFN signaling, or wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Durbin et al., 2000</xref>) were challenged with the viral

prominent in infected <italic>Stat1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals
when compared with WT, because several viruses replicated more efficiently in
IFN-deficient conditions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>). Such is the case of the
recombinant allele B NS1 viruses, for which enrichment was lost in the absence of
STAT1, despite still exhibiting increased viral fitness compared with the rest of
the library. Viruses containing NS1 sequences from H7N9, H9N2, and H10N4 strains
also showed increased fitness levels in
<italic>Stat1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice when compared with their
WT counterparts. Thus, we concluded that differences in fitness within these viruses
resulted from their NS1-dependent ability to counteract the IFN-mediated antiviral
response in WT mice. However, many other viruses in the library, including those
with human H3N2 NS1 sequences, were still underrepresented after replication in
<italic>Stat1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, indicating an
NS1-regulated host factor independent of IFN restricts the fitness of these viruses
in murine lungs.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to the results in

events of the cellular innate immune system.</p><p id="P19">Finally, we analyzed the temporal fitness dynamics of the viral library in
WT mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Viruses were sorted into
different groups following a medoid-based clustering analysis according to their
viral fitness properties over time (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>;
<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2</xref>). Viruses that
were phylogenetically related shared similar fitness trends. This is exemplified by
cluster 4, mainly composed of human H3N2 NS1-containing recombinant viruses, which
displayed a decreasing trend from day 2 to day 5 post-infection because of their
inability to establish robust levels of viral replication <italic>in vivo</italic>
(<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2d</xref>). Cluster 6
contained a heterogenous group of NS1 recombinant viruses (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2f</xref>). In particular, avian-origin
NS1 strains like A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) and the phylogenetically related
A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013 (H9N2), A/Shorebird/DEBay/2009 (H10N7), and
A/Mallard/RGeorgia/2011 (H10N4) were phenotypically grouped with all pH1N1 NS1
recombinant viruses included in the library. Despite their phylogenetic differences,
all viruses within this cluster shared similar dynamics over time, with increasing
overall fitness from day 2 to day 5 post-infection. Finally, allele B NS1-containing
viruses were distributed in different clusters, mainly clusters 3 and 7 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2g</xref>). These clusters represent a high
and stable fitness profile at all post-infection times tested.</p><p id="P20">This clustering analysis allowed us to study the combination of viral trends
and fitness profiles within the library over time and revealed that the fittest
viruses followed two significantly different profiles (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). While allele B NS1-containing viruses displayed early
replication kinetics that were sustained during the time of the experiment, the best
adapted viruses containing allele A NS1 (A/Shanghai/02/2013 and
A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013) initially exhibited lower levels of fitness followed by a
rapid increase in abundance after day 3 post-infection, reaching comparable levels
to the allele B counterparts at day 5 post-infection. We propose that this group of
NS1, which includes those of some H7N9 viruses, confers enhanced fitness abilities
under high inflammatory conditions that in mice start after day 3 post-infection
(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hermesh et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P21">Overall, we have used an unbiased system to assess the influenza
NS1-mediated tropism in the context of a heterogeneous viral population. Our
approach takes advantage of the defined sequence space within naturally occurring
IAV strains. Using a library of IAVs containing different NS1 representatives of the
known NS1 genotypic variation, we found multiple evolutionary lines for this viral
protein, leading to a great variety of host tropism phenotypes. We found phenotypic
differences between NS1 phenotypes that were evolutionary related, such as the ones
of human H3N2 viruses and old seasonal H1N1 viruses. This is unexpected, because
H3N2 and H1N1 NS1 share a common H1N1 ancestor (the NS1 of the 1918 IAV) and both
have been circulating in humans for decades without reasserting since 1958 (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Medina and Garc&#x000ed;a-Sastre, 2011</xref>). The
different phenotypes of these two groups of human NS1 sequences are reminiscent of
speciation of one species into two when separated by geographical constraints and
highlight the constant evolution of NS1.</p><p id="P22">We also found that sustained circulation of NS1 in a particular host may or
may not result in specialization. Such is the case of viruses containing H3N2 NS1,
which showed preference to human hosts. In contrast, we found that viruses with
avian-origin allele B NS1 were not restricted to a particular host, because they had
efficient replication profiles in all systems tested. While it has previously been
shown that allele B-derived segments efficiently replicated in mammalian hosts
despite their avian origin (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al.,
2016</xref>), the specific contributions of NS1 and NEP were not explored. In
our current study, we addressed the replication abilities of a curated selection of
NS1 proteins in a NEP-independent manner because of our split NS construct strategy.
We can conclude that allele B NS1 is able to provide efficient replication fitness
in a range of hosts.</p><p id="P23">In our study, we cannot distinguish between fitness effects due to the
species origin and those due to the substrate origin of the virus growth substrates.
In other words, while differences in viral fitness between MDCK and A549 cells are
likely related to their species of origin (canine versus human), they might also be
influenced by the tissue origin (MDCK cells are kidney cells, and A549 are
respiratory epithelial cells) or even by the passage history of the cell line.
Nevertheless, differences between these substrates reflect a differential impact of
host factors and tissue environment in NS1-mediated fitness.</p><p id="P24">Thus, we propose that differences in tropism among the IAV NS1 genes result
from adaptations to specific host factors among the large variety of known NS1
interactors. For instance, NS1 proteins that interact with highly conserved host
proteins to enhance viral replication might display a broad host tropism. Such is
the case of the host polyadenylation factor CPSF30, which is one of the known host
targets interacting with NS1 (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Nemeroff et al.,
1998</xref>). In contrast, NS1 variants that do not interact with CPSF30, like
the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, may have adapted to inhibit other host factors with
high sequence diversity among the host species, like TRIM25. This would result in
host specialization of this subgroup of NS1. Nevertheless, focusing on a particular
domain or specific amino acid changes within the NS1 sequence may not be the right
approach to understand the virus-host interactions and the mechanisms behind the
multiple phenotypes observed in our library experiments. We found evidence of such
complexity in our results with a subset of NS1 that confers increased fitness under
high pro-inflammatory conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as fitness
differences in a type I IFN-dependent manner. Our future work will rely on
multiscale, high-throughput studies that will explore protein-protein interactions
between NS1 and cellular host factors. This will provide further insights into how
the virus modulates the antiviral response and how it evolves through this dynamic
selective pressure.</p><p id="P25">In summary, our barcoded library approach can aid in the identification of
IAV strains with increased host tropism and thus higher pandemic risk potential. Our
system can be applied to viruses with high sequence diversity besides IAVs,
facilitating analysis of specific viral genes and their contribution to the overall
viral fitness in different hosts and/or cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>STAR&#x02605;METHODS</title><sec id="S5"><title>LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITY</title><p id="P26">Further information and requests for reagents may be directed to and

Influenza Research Database (IRD) based on different structural and
functional Sequence Feature Variant Types (SFVT) (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Noronha et al., 2012</xref>). To obtain a robust
diversity within the different NS1 variants, two different strains were
selected for each sequence feature (SF): the first included in variant 1
(VT1), that uses A/Udorn/1972 as strain reference, and the second one
corresponded to a different VT containing a relevant number of amino acid
variation for that specific SF. The strain selection was refined after
multiple alignments, discarding NS1 sequences that were identical and only
considering the strains whose genome was fully sequenced and represented
multiple times in the database. In addition, other parameters, such as the
country of origin, host and year were also considered. Following this
approach, a list of the most representative NS1 was created. As an internal
control, each NS1 recombinant virus was rescued in duplicates and associated
to a different and unique 22-nucleotide barcode. Barcodes were designed
using a specific software (Barcode generator) and they were all GC content
matched as previously reported (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Varble et
al., 2014</xref>). A total of 107 viruses out of 112 were rescued,
plaque purified, titered and combined in equal amounts (100 pfu per virus)
to constitute the final library (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>). Only few NS1 recombinant viruses were more difficult to
rescue, thus resulting in ~4% of viruses in the library that are not paired
to a second barcode. This was likely due to variable rescue efficiencies
when different plasmid preparations were used. Nevertheless, these few
viruses represented by a single barcode were included as part of the final
library since no major differences in barcode relative abundance were
detected between viral pairs containing different barcodes. Viruses
represented only with a single barcode are A/Auckland/599/2000,
A/Malaysia/1954, A/Hong Kong/97/98, A/Mallard/Nova Scotia/00088/2010 and
A/Mallard/Sweden/79367/2008. Barcode read ratios obtained for each
recombinant virus within the original library mix (input) were close to
1:1:1, thus minimizing any amplification bias within the library
construction. A small library containing 4 recombinant viruses
(A/Shanghai/02/2013, A/Udorn/1972, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934-R38A/K41A) was used as a proof of principle to our strategy

between NS1 and NEP was used as previously described (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Varble et al., 2014</xref>). Each NS segment was
individually designed with a unique 22-nucleotide neutral barcode,
inserted in the non-coding region between NS1 and NEP. This labeling
strategy allows to individually track and quantify each NS segment in
the Illumina Deep Sequencing platform. A total of 56 NS1 sequences were
selected for the final library. As an internal control, two different
barcodes were generally used per each NS1 sequence. NS1 sequences were
synthesized using the GeneArt Strings DNA fragments platform (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cloned into EcoRI and NheI sites
into the pDZ vector. Standard reverse genetics were used to rescue each
individual virus in a A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) backbone, as previously
described (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 1999</xref>).
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to
transfect a co-culture of HEK293T and MDCK cells with seven ambisense
pDZ plasmids in combination with the pDZ NS1 split barcoded plasmid
specific for each IAV, and incubated for 72 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Additionally, plasmid-based rescue system
for recombinant viruses in the A/Vietnam/1203/04/H5N1 (HALo) backbone
followed a slightly different strategy, using 8 pPolI plasmids encoding
the viral RNAs and 4 pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding the viral
proteins PB1, PB2, PA and NP. Cell culture supernatants containing
influenza virions were collected. Final stocks of each recombinant virus
were achieved after plaque purification and infecting fresh MDCK cells
(80% confluence) with a 1:100 dilution of the purified plaque and
incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 hours in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle
(MEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with
1&#x003bc;g/ml of TPCK trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Viral

Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs of disease.
At the indicated times post infection, animals were euthanized and lung

strategy to amplify the region surrounding the barcode sequence (~300 bp),
using specific primers that contained barcoded Illumina linkers. This step
was performed using a low cycle count to reduce possible nucleotide
