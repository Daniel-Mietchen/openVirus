<p>In conclusion, the results achieved in our work record the exposure of European wild boar to Flaviviruses in Italy, in an area where Flavivirus activity has previously been reported. This could indicate the transmission of Flavivirus outside the enzootic bird cycle. Further studies would be needed to evaluate Flavivirus circulation in other regions, and the degree of exposure of other widely distributed wild mammals would be of interest.</p>
