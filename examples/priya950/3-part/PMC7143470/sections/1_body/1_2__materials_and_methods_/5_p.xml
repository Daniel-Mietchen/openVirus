<p>The samples were analyzed twice and read at 450 nm. The ELISA was validated when the residual binding rations (S/N %) were calculated. Serum samples with S/N ratios equal to or less than 40% were considered positive; samples with ratios greater than 50% were considered negative. S/N values between 40% and 50% were doubtful.</p>
