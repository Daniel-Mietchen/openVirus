<p>Approval from the ethics committee was not required since no live animals were used for this study. Animals were harvested by standard procedures for the hunting of wild boar. Harvested wild boar were carried to a central processing site for cleaning, dressing, and sampling procedures. We collected 1–3 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of whole blood via heart puncture or cranial sinus puncture. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1100× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and frozen at −80 °C until testing [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For each sample, we recorded the location, the date of collection, the sex, and the age of the animal, determined using dentition patterns, classifying them into two age classes: 0–24 months old (juvenile), 25–36 months old (sub-adult), and &gt;36 months old (adults).
