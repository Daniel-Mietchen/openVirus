<p>The presence of antibodies against WNV and closely related Flaviviruses, like USUV, was analyzed using a commercial competitive enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA ID Screen West Nile Competition Multi-Species (Innovative Diagnostics, Montpelier, France),) for detection of West Nile virus antibodies against the pr-E and pr-M envelope proteins containing an epitope common to all Flaviviruses according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol [

 <xref rid="B25-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This Elisa test has a high cross-reactivity, thus it is suitable for the detection of a wide range of flaviviruses, although it has been designed for the diagnosis of WNV infection. The assay used plates pre-coated with WNV recombinant antigens and assessed the competition between antibodies present in the serum samples tested and a monoclonal anti-E antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). These competitive ELISA kits detected essentially every Ig isotype but was primarily used to reveal IgG and was classified between the IgG detection tools.
