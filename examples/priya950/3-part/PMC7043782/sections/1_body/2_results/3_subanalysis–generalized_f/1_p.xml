<p>In a subset of the patients (n = 807),[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] we had detailed data on whether the patient had experienced generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within the last week prior to the STEMI. Compared with the STEMI patients without VF prior to PPCI (n = 520), the VF cases (n = 287) had significantly more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI (14% vs. 5%, p&lt;0.0001, OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.76â€“6.54). In addition, the majority of the symptoms were reported for STEMI patients during influenza season (defined as week 40 to week 20) (76% vs. 24%, p = 0.024).
