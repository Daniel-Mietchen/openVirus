<p>Results from the logistic regression analyses for VF before PPCI are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226936.g003">Fig 3</xref>. We found no association between EV and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.02) or influenza and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.00). We also found no association between week number and VF (p-value 0.94 for EV model and 0.89 for influenza model), confirming the lack of seasonality in the risk of VF found in
