<p>In this study, we focused on seasonal viral infections, but several other CVD risk factors display seasonal variation. Obesity, increased fat intake, reduced physical activity, and higher blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels are more prevalent in winter. However, traditional risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking were not independently associated with VF risk during STEMI in our cohort.[
