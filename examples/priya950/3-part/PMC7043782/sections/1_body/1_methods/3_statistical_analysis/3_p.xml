<p>In a subset of patients (n = 807),[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] we had detailed data on whether the patient had experienced generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within the last week prior to the STEMI. A logistic regression model was fitted on this subset. The model was adjusted for week number, calendar year, sex, age, hypertension, AF, chronic kidney disease, Killip class, culprit lesion, preprocedural TIMI-flow, smoking, and previous history of angina.
