<p>Separate multivariable logistic regressions were performed for the association of EV and influenza exposure on the day of STEMI and the risk of VF. The models included EV and influenza incidences as continuous variables and were adjusted for week number as a nominal variable with 52 levels and calendar year. Moreover, we performed a full adjusted model, including, week number, calendar year, as well as sex, age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease, Killip class, culprit lesion, preprocedural TIMI-flow, smoking, and previous history of angina. Reported were odds ratios (OR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI). The likelihood ratio test was used to test the significance of week number.</p>
