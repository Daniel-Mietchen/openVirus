<p>The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (No. 2012-58-0004). Registers were available in an anonymous setup; individual patients were not identifiable because the personal identification numbers were encrypted. We obtained approval from the Danish Patient Safety Authority to gain information on medical reports and discharge summaries (No. 3-3013-2277/1). In Denmark, ethical approval is not required for retrospective, register-based studies.</p>
