  <p>Malaria life cycle and primary areas of drug activity. The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host [
   <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sporozoites infect liver cells [
   <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and mature into schizonts [
   <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which rupture and release merozoites [
   <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Chemoprophylaxis medications either act at the liver stage preventing a blood-stage infection or at the erythrocytic stage of the malaria life cycle.
