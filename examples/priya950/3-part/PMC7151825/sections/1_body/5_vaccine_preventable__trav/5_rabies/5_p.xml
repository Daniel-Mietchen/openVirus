<p id="p0450">Travelers who sustain a bite, scratch, or exposure of animal saliva to broken skin or mucus membranes should be advised to wash the wound thoroughly for 10–15 minutes as soon as possible. A suitable disinfectant should be used along with a dressing if needed. They should then be carefully and promptly risk assessed by a health professional. This risk assessment should take into account the type of animal, the health of the animal if known, the date of exposure, the country of exposure, where on the body the exposure occurred, any risk of immunosuppression, allergy status, and previous rabies vaccination status [
