<p id="p0460">Nonvaccinated travelers will require a longer course of postexposure vaccination. They will also require human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) following a significant exposure. This is infiltrated around the wound and neutralizes rabies virus at the wound site. Due to the risk of an impaired serological response significantly immunosuppressed travelers should be managed as if they are unvaccinated regardless of their vaccination history. They will require a full course of postexposure vaccination, HRIG, and antibody testing posttreatment to assess their serological response [
