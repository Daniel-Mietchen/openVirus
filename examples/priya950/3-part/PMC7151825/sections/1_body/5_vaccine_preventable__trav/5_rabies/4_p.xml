<p id="p0445">Rabies cases are rare in travelers; however, animal bites and scratches are common. Travelers should be educated about the risks of rabies and advised to avoid contact with wild and domestic animals. Travelers deemed to be at higher risk of rabies, for example those traveling to high-risk areas for over a month, can be vaccinated with a preexposure course of vaccination [

The vaccine can be thought of as an insurance policy; although rabies is rare in travelers and the vaccine is expensive, the consequences of infection are severe. It may therefore be worth paying for extra protection from an unlikely but potentially devastating scenario.
