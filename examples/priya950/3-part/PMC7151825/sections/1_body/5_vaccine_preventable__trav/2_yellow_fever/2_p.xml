<p id="p0380">Yellow fever virus is a flavivirus spread by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito. The virus is endemic in over 50 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Following a bite from an infected mosquito there is a short incubation period of under a week before the onset of the illness. The classic disease has a biphasic presentation with an initial short, nonspecific febrile illness followed by a toxic phase that develops in up to 15% of patients. The toxic phase of the illness consists of fever, renal failure, hepatic failure, jaundice, hemorrhage, and cardiovascular compromise. Multiorgan failure may develop, and up to half of patients in the toxic phase die within 7–10 days [
