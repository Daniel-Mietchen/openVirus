 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Additionally travelers to polio-endemic areas should be vaccinated if their last vaccine dose was over 10Â years ago or if they are unvaccinated [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], although polio is extremely rare in travelers. Two vaccines are in use worldwide; a live-attenuated oral vaccine and an inactivated vaccine [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The inactivated vaccine is safe to use in the immunosuppressed traveler, but immunosuppressed individuals may not mount a full vaccine response and should be advised of this [
