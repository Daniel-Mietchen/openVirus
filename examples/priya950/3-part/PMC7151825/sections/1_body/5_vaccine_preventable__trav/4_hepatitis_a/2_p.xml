<p id="p0420">Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver caused by hepatitis A virus. It is spread via the fecal–oral route and is therefore linked to poor sanitation and food hygiene. It is usually a mild infection, especially in children where the majority of infections are asymptomatic. However, the severity of infection tends to increase with age, and jaundice may occur in 70%–80% of infected adults. Fulminant hepatitis is rare and unlike hepatitis B and C there is no chronic carrier state. The case fatality rate is generally low but is increased in those with preexisting liver disease and older adults [
