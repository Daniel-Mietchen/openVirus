<p id="p0675">HEV typically causes an acute, self-limiting illness presenting with fever and jaundice. The symptoms usually resolve after a few weeks. Pregnancy is associated with severe disease and fulminant liver failure and case fatality rates are as high as 20%â€“25% [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. HEV can also cause chronic infection leading to chronic hepatitis in immunosuppressed patients. This is typically due to genotype 3. Chronic infection has been observed in solid organ transplant patients [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], as well as with other forms of immunosuppression, including a patient treated with rituximab [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Chronic infection in immunosuppressed patients may rapidly progress to cirrhosis [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and treatment consists of reducing immunosuppression where possible and administration of ribavirin [
