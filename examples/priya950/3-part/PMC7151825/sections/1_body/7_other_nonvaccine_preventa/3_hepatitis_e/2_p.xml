<p id="p0670">Hepatitis E infection is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), and there are estimated to be around 20 million infections worldwide each year, with around 3.4 million symptomatic cases [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The highest disease burden is in Asia and parts of Africa. There are four known genotypes, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Genotypes 1 and 2 are thought to only cause human infection and are spread via the fecalâ€“oral route. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been found in several animals including pigs and can also cause infection in humans. In low-income countries with poor sanitation, large outbreaks of hepatitis E occur, most commonly due to genotype 1, and these are thought to be due to fecal contamination of water. Sporadic cases may occur due to genotypes 1 and 2. In high-income countries with safe drinking water sporadic cases of hepatitis E occur, mostly due to genotype 3. These are linked to eating undercooked meat, especially pork products, and can be thought of as a zoonosis [
