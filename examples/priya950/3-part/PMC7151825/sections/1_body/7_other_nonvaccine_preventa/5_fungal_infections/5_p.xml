<p id="p0730">Coccidioidomycosis is caused by inhalation of spores from two species of dimorphic fungi, 
 <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic> and 
 <italic>Coccidioides posadasii</italic>. These species are endemic in certain areas of the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Case series suggest that between 17% and 29% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in endemic areas are due to coccidioidomycosis [

 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The disease can be asymptomatic or subclinical or present as a community acquired pneumonia, sometimes with accompanying cutaneous or rheumatological features. In more severe cases the infection can disseminate and spread to other areas of the body. There are estimated to be 150,000 infections per year in the United States; 50,000 of these are thought to cause an illness requiring medical attention, 10–20,000 receive a confirmed diagnosis, and 600–1000 cases are thought to lead to disseminated infection [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. There are approximately 160 deaths per year, and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis are more common on death certificates associated with coccidioidomycosis than on those of matched controls [
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. One case series showed that patients with inflammatory arthritis treated with infliximab are at greater risk of developing symptomatic coccidioidomycosis than those not treated with infliximab [
