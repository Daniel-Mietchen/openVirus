<p id="p0665">Clinicians should be aware that travel has been associated with acquisition of multidrug resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that confer resistance to many commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics. MDR Enterobacteriaceae were initially recognized in hospitals but are now increasingly common in community settings in low- and middle-income countries. Travel has been associated with ESBL acquisition rates of 21%â€“51%. Travel to South Asia has the highest risk of ESBL acquisition with rates of up to 85%; other areas of Asia are also high risk. Digestive disorders, diarrhea, and antibiotic use during travel were risk factors for ESBL acquisition [
