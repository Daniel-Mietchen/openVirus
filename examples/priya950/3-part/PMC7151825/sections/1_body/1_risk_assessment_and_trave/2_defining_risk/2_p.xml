<p id="p0050">Risk may be defined as the likelihood that a person may be harmed or suffer an adverse health effect if exposed to a hazard [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both the perceptions and realities of risk will be different for each individual traveler. Clinicians may also perceive risks differently based on their training and experience. For example, national malaria guidelines differ in their advice for certain countries, and this will influence the clinician's risk assessment. When considering risk it is important to weigh the possibility of harm from a travel-related disease or event against the possibility of harm from an intervention. As with all areas of medicine, it is important to remember the dictum of “primum non nocere” or “first do no harm”. An example of this might be avoiding yellow fever vaccination in a significantly immunosuppressed traveler who chooses to travel to sub-Saharan Africa.
