<p id="p0195">VFR travelers are often at greater risk than other travelers and therefore merit specific discussion. They may have more compelling reasons for travel at a particular time, such as to visit sick relatives or attend funerals, weddings, and other cultural events. They may therefore be more likely to travel while pregnant or with multiple comorbidities. Lack of pretravel health care is common due to health beliefs, incomplete childhood vaccinations, and other barriers to health care such as language. Malaria is one area in which popular beliefs among VFR travelers may lead to harm. Individuals often develop partial immunity to malaria if they grow up in a highly endemic area, leading to the perception of malaria as a minor illness in adults. This partial immunity can be lost, however, if the person moves away as it depends on frequent reexposure [
