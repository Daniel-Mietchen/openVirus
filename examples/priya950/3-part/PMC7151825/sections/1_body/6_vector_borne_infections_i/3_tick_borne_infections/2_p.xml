<p id="p0565">Ticks are vectors for a number of infectious diseases including Lyme sisease, babesiosis, tick-borne encephalitis, and rickettsial infections. The disease risk depends on the tick species and travel destination. Travelers should be advised to avoid tick bites by wearing long-sleeved tops and long trousers tucked into socks when walking in grasslands or wooded areas. Clothing can be impregnated with insecticide such as permethrin. Travelers should be advised to check for ticks after outdoor activities and remove them promptly with tweezers to reduce the risk of disease transmission [
