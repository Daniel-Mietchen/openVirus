<p id="p0605">Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by protozoa of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>. It can be divided into Old World (found in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Europe) and New World (Latin America) types. Infectious manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous disease, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL or kala-azar has a high fatality rate without treatment. The clinical picture depends on the infecting 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> subspecies and individual host factors. The vector for all 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites is the female sand fly.
