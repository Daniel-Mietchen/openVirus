<p id="p0620">Leishmaniasis is a rare disease in travelers; however, it should be considered in patients with a history of travel to an endemic area and a compatible clinical presentation. Most cases of leishmaniasis in travelers are of the cutaneous form, but cases of VL and mucocutaneous disease have been reported. Latin America is the most common destination for acquisition of CL among travelers, and the Mediterranean has emerged as the main region for travelers to acquire VL. Travelers at risk of acquisition of leishmaniasis, for example adventure travelers or those traveling to rural areas in endemic countries, should be advised to follow measures to promote avoidance of sand fly bites [
