<p id="p0555">While chemoprophylaxis is available for some infections such as malaria, bite avoidance is a crucial part of disease prevention. Indeed for many vector-borne diseases it is the only way to prevent disease transmission. Bite avoidance is achieved via the use of repellants, impregnated bed nets, appropriate clothing, and behavioral modifications. Knowledge of the biting patterns of relevant vectors is also important. For example, the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, the vector for malaria, bites mainly from dusk until dawn so bed nets can be very useful to prevent disease transmission [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito which also bites during the day so bed nets are not sufficient to prevent transmission.
