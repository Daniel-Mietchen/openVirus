Exposure to ultraviolet light in sunlight raises the risks of sunburn, heatstroke, melanoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Travelers should therefore be advised to use an appropriate sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and to reapply this regularly throughout the day, especially after swimming or other exercise.
