<p id="p0810">VTE can be provoked by prolonged immobility associated with any form of travel. The risk of DVT approximately doubles after a long-haul flight of over 4 hours (as well as other forms of travel associated with remaining seated for long periods). The risk increases with duration of travel and taking multiple flights in a short period. The overall absolute risk in healthy travelers remains low, 1 in 6000 in flights over 4 hours [
