<p id="p0215">Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by persistent, abnormal inflammation. Inflammatory cytokines or “chemical messengers” play a key role in driving this inflammation, and the introduction of biological drugs that specifically target these cytokines has revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune disease. This specificity is in contrast to other traditional, “nonspecific” methods of immunosuppression such as steroids. Biological drugs have been developed that target a range of different specific inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, and B and T cells. </p>
