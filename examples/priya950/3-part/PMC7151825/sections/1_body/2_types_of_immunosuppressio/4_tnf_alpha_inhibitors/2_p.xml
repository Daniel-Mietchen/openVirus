<p id="p0220">TNF-alpha is a cytokine that plays a key role in the immune response to infection, as well as in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease. It is produced by activated macrophages and T-cells as a transmembrane precursor protein that is then cleaved to produce a soluble form. TNF-alpha is required for many immune processes including macrophage and phagosome activation, differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, and formation and maintenance of granulomas [
