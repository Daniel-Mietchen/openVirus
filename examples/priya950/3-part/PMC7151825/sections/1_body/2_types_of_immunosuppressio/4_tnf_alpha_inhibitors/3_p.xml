<p id="p0225">There are different types of TNF-alpha blockers available. Human monoclonal antibodies, such as adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab work by binding to TNF-alpha and preventing it from binding to its receptor, thereby inhibiting its effects. Infliximab is a chimeric antibody made from part mouse, part human antibodies. It also binds with TNF-alpha, blocking it from binding to its receptor. Etanercept is a soluble TNF-receptor fusion protein. It prevents TNF-alpha from interacting with its receptor [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] although it is only able to bind to soluble TNF-alpha unlike the other drugs which can also bind to the membrane-bound form [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Etanercept also has a shorter half-life than the other TNF-alpha blockers [
