<p>We expressed qualitative data as relative and absolute frequencies and quantitative data as median and interquartile ranges with 95% CIs. To compare categorical variables, we used Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> and Fischer exact tests when appropriate; to compare continuous variables, we used the Student 
 <italic>t</italic> test (for data that were normally distributed) or the Mann-Whitney U test (for data that were not normally distributed). We used bivariate analyses to compare demographic characteristics and performed multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of exposures and outcomes. We obtained adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs and set the threshold for statistical significance as a 2-sided p&lt;0.05.
