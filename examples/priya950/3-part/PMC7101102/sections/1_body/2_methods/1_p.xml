<p>We based our analysis on a cohort included in the +Redivi network. The network initially comprised 4 centers; however, new centers have been included over the years. Currently, +Redivi comprises 22 health centers (1 primary care center and 21 hospitals, specialized and not specialized in travel medicine) in 8 regions of Spain that share a common online database in which new cases of imported infections are registered. A unique data collection sheet is used to gather information about patient demographics, trip characteristics (destination, return date, duration, type of traveler), receipt of pretravel advice, receipt of antimalaria antiprophylaxis (when applicable), reason for consultation, and final diagnosis variables. Because patients were deidentified at the time of study inclusion, we could not link data back to patients. Cases recorded were those in which the final diagnosis was considered to be an imported disease associated with travel (for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients). Returning travelers/immigrants could account for &gt;1 case in the database if they had traveled &gt;1 time and received a new diagnosis of an imported disease. +Redivi classified persons attending a first consultation as follows: immigrant (person living in Spain but born in any other country), VFR (visiting friends and relatives) immigrant (immigrant traveling back from his/her country of birth after visiting friends and relatives), VFR traveler (Spanish traveler returning from his/her first-degree relativeâ€™s country of birth), and travelers (conventional international tourists returning from travel, expatriates, and missionaries).</p>
