<p>We included in our analysis cases recorded in +Redivi during January 2009â€“December 2018. We identified patients with a diagnosis of arbovirus infection and compared 2 main populations: those with imported arbovirus infection and those with nonarbovirus infection. Acute/recent arbovirus infection was diagnosed for patients with exposure risk and a virus-positive PCR, positive IgM, evidence of seroconversion, or nonstructural (NS) 1 antigen detection for DENV. A diagnosis of ZIKV infection based on positive IgM required a finding of negative DENV IgM and vice versa or confirmation with a neutralization assay (not available at all centers). We classified cases as severe if there was evidence of shock and plasma leakage, severe hemorrhage, or organ impairment (according to the World Health Organization definition) (

We performed a descriptive analysis to assess the distribution of these groups according to patient sex, age, type of case (immigrant, VFR, or traveler), time from arrival in Spain to medical consultation, immunosuppression, country of birth, duration of travel, date of first arrival in Spain, length of travel, date of return from travel, travel destination, and rate of pretravel advice receipt.
