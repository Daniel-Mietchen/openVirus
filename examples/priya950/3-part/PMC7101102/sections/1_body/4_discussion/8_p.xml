<p>Of interest, we found 16 patients co-infected with multiple arboviruses, reflecting co-circulation and transmission by the same species of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV vector during the main outbreak periods in Latin America and the Caribbean. No cases were severe. During periods of intense transmission, co-infections are not infrequent or unexpected (

A recent study that used reverse transcription PCR to investigate patients with acute undifferentiated febrile illness during the CHIKV outbreak in Haiti found that â‰ˆ10% of the children with CHIKV infection during the study period were infected with another arbovirus (ZIKV, DENV, or Mayaro virus) (

 </xref>). These dual infections were diagnosed only after culture of the samples, and the authors concluded that that could suggest a low viral load of the co-infecting virus. In addition, the possibility of sequential infections acquired in areas of co-circulation has been previously noted, and sequential infections in patients returning from travel have been described (
