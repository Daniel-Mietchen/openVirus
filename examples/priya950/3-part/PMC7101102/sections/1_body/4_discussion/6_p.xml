<p>Available data about the outcome of arbovirus disease in immunosuppressed patients is limited. In our study, data were registered for 12 immunosuppressed patients with arbovirus disease; we found no association between infection and immune status, and none of the severe cases (all dengue) occurred in immunosuppressed patients. According to published data, CHIKV in solid organ transplant recipients seems to have a benign course and favorable outcome (

A recent report of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV infections diagnosed in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and oncohematologic patients found prolonged viremia in those with DENV and viruria in those with ZIKV; the most common complication was thrombocytopenia, but all patients survived without sequelae (
