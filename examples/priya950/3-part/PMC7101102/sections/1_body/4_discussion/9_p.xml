<p>Some study limitations include the inability to identify which case-patients were viremic at diagnosis. The database included confirmed diagnoses, but diagnosis of some cases may have been based on detection of virus IgM (with or without IgG; i.e., recent acute infections), and so the proportion of viremic patients who may be considered to potentially pose a risk for ongoing transmission in areas of Spain where competent vectors are present was not known. Because only imported cases were registered, possible secondary cases resulting from sexual transmission were not included, probably leading to underestimation of the real extent of imported disease. In some cases, cross-reactions between antibodies to the flaviviruses DENV and ZIKV may have posed a diagnostic challenge (neutralization assays were available only at some centers), and some cases of probable co-infections were excluded and considered monoinfections. Also, previous yellow fever vaccination was not recorded for most patients and was therefore not analyzed, although prior vaccination would be expected to yield possible false-positive IgG results and should not have interfered in the classification of cases as acute or recent infections (which was based on IgM, seroconversion, PCR, or NS1 antigen for DENV). Recent yellow fever vaccination may yield false-positive IgM results for DENV and ZIKV, but most of these infections in this series were acquired in regions where such vaccination was not required (Asia, Caribbean, Australasia). Basic information on main presenting symptoms was recorded, but more detailed information on individual symptoms, enabling a possible comparison with regard to presentation of each arbovirus infection, was not possible.</p>
