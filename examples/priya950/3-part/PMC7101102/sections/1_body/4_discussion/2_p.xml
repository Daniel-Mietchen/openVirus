<p>Most cases occurred in conventional travelers, followed by VFRs; the small proportion of cases in immigrants may reflect recent acute (nonviremic) infections. Among VFR immigrants, infection with DENV was relatively less frequent than infection with other arboviruses; whereas, for all other groups, the reverse was true. This distribution may reflect a hypothetical protected state if these patients had already experienced multiple DENV infections before immigration. On the other hand, some of the acute infections acquired by persons in this group may have resulted from waning or incomplete immunity to DENV because homotypic reinfections, as well as poor in vitro neutralizing activity of immune human serum for different strains within a single serotype, have been reported (
