thousands annually. Vaccines are used to prevent influenza outbreaks, however,
the influenza virus mutates and annual vaccination is required for optimal
protection. Vaccine effectiveness is also affected by other potential factors
such as the human immune system, a mismatch with the chosen candidate virus, and
egg adaptation associated with egg-based vaccine production. This article
reviews the influenza vaccine development process and describes the implications
of the changes to the cell-culture process and vaccine strain recommendations by
the World Health Organization since the 2017 season. The traditional
manufacturing process for influenza vaccines relies on fertilized chicken eggs
that are used for vaccine production. Vaccines must be produced in large volumes
and the complete process requires approximately 6&#x02009;months for the egg-based
process. In addition, egg adaptation of seed viruses occurs when viruses adapt
to avian receptors found within eggs to allow for growth in eggs. These changes
to key viral antigens may result in antigenic mismatch and thereby reduce
vaccine effectiveness. By contrast, cell-derived seed viruses do not require
fertilized eggs and eliminate the potential for egg-adapted changes. As a
result, cell-culture technology improves the match between the vaccine virus
strain and the vaccine selected strain, and has been associated with increased
vaccine effectiveness during a predominantly H3N2 season. During the 2017&#x02013;2018
influenza season, a small number of studies conducted in the United States
compared the effectiveness of egg-based and cell-culture vaccines and are
described here. These observational and retrospective studies demonstrate that
inactivated cell-culture vaccines were more effective than egg-based vaccines.
Adoption of cell-culture technology for influenza vaccine manufacturing has been
reported to improve manufacturing efficiency and the additional benefit of
improving vaccine effectiveness is a key factor for future policy making
considerations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>cell-culture technology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2515135520908121"><funding-source id="funding1-2515135520908121"><institution-wrap><institution>Seqirus, Inc.</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2515135520908121">N/A</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2515135520908121"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza causes up to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide and between
290,000 and 650,000 respiratory deaths each year.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Its seasonal appearance is associated with increased visits to emergency
rooms and primary care physicians, increased absenteeism at work and school, and
increased hospitalizations&#x02014;particularly in the elderly and persons with chronic conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Influenza vaccines are widely used to prevent outbreaks. However, antigenic
drift (due to mutations in key viral antigens) in the virus and a lack of
long-lasting antibody titers even with vaccination means that optimal protection can
only be achieved with annual vaccinations developed by careful surveillance and
prediction of emerging strains. Despite a well-established system of surveillance
and vaccine production, current influenza vaccines, even when given annually, do not
provide complete protection. There are a number of reasons for this including
characteristics of the human immune system, mismatch between the circulating strain
and the vaccine strain, and egg adaptation of viral seeds.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> New and emerging manufacturing technologies such as cell-culture isolation of
the seed virus may improve the closeness of vaccine virus match to circulating
strains and thereby improve effectiveness and, thus, further reduce the burden of
disease from influenza. In the case of a pandemic, it also offers an opportunity to
provide for a more rapid response, which obviates the reliance on eggs for vaccine
bulk production.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2515135520908121"><title>Background</title><p>Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that has three different genera or
types, A, B, and C, which are antigenically distinct.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Influenza type A is further classified into subtypes, such as A/H1N1 and
A/H3N2, by surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Influenza B
types are differentiated by lineages such as B/Yamagata and B/Victoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2515135520908121">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1-2515135520908121" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Anatomy of an influenza virus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2515135520908121-fig1"/></fig><p>Influenza A is the most frequent cause of influenza in humans.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The A/H3N2 strain has the highest rate of morbidity and mortality. One
analysis of 31 influenza seasons in the United States showed that in 22 seasons in
which influenza A/H3N2 was the dominant strain mortality rates were 2.7 times higher
than in the non-H3N2-dominant seasons.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Similar results were seen in other studies in other parts of the
globe.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the winter of
2014&#x02013;2015 in England, 28,484 deaths were due to influenza with 93% occurring in
persons 65&#x02009;years or older.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the 2017 influenza season in Australia when H3N2 was estimated to make up
55% of cases, there were 745 deaths compared with the 5-year average of 176. Most of
the deaths were in the elderly.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the 2017&#x02013;2018 season in the United States, H3N2 viruses predominated and
there were 172 pediatric deaths due to influenza, which was the highest number of
influenza-related deaths in children reported in a single nonpandemic season.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The more genetically stable influenza B viruses, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, have been
circulating for 40&#x02009;years and yet it is still challenging to determine which one will
be dominant during a season.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Influenza C is less common and has only caused mild respiratory infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Influenza-related complications are myriad and include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus
infections, ear infections, and exacerbation of many chronic conditions such as
asthma, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Most who are infected with influenza experience mild illness that does not
require medical intervention and resolves within 2&#x02009;weeks; however, for others
influenza complications can require hospitalization and can lead to death.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In the United States, an analysis of 31 consecutive influenza seasons
(1976&#x02013;2007) showed that the estimated average number of annual influenza deaths due
to pneumonia and influenza causes was 6309 with a low of 961 in 1986&#x02013;1987 and a high
of 14,715 in 2003&#x02013;2004.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The estimated average number of influenza-associated deaths with underlying
respiratory and circulatory causes was 23,607 with a low of 3349 in 1986&#x02013;1987 and a
high of 48,614 in 2003&#x02013;2004. Most deaths (89.4%) were seen in persons aged 65&#x02009;years
or older.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> When excess mortality is observed, an outbreak is considered an epidemic.
When a new influenza virus emerges due to antigenic shift, a pandemic can occur and
mortality rates can soar.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic up to up to 50 million people died
worldwide; pandemics have also occurred in 1957, 1968, 1977, and 2009.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Although the severity of the outbreak and the groups most affected vary in each
influenza epidemic, certain high-risk groups have been identified who should receive
vaccination and treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In the United States, the recommendation is for annual influenza vaccination
of everyone 6&#x02009;months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends influenza vaccination for all
high-risk groups (e.g. pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, children aged
between 6&#x02009;months and 5&#x02009;years, older adults aged &#x0003e;65&#x02009;years, individuals with
chronic medical conditions, and health-care workers).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section3-2515135520908121"><title>Technology for influenza vaccine production</title><p>Influenza vaccines are available in different forms: inactivated influenza vaccines
(IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). IIVs are produced to protect
against three (trivalent) or four (quadrivalent) influenza viruses; whereas LAIVs
are produced as quadrivalent only. IIVs can be manufactured in different ways. IIVs
can be made from a whole virus that is chemically inactivated, concentrated, and
then purified. Further processing can create split virus vaccines, which are treated
with detergent to separate the viral envelope and expose the interior viral proteins
and subviral elements.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Further purification can create subunit vaccines in which the HA protein is
enriched. Since the 1970s, most vaccines are split virus or subunit because they
have comparable effectiveness with fewer adverse reactions. The split virus and
subunit vaccines are less immunogenic in populations that have not been exposed to
influenza vaccines; in a seasonal setting, two doses of these vaccines are needed
for young children.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> To improve the immunogenicity in certain populations such as the elderly, a
high-dose version of the trivalent vaccine was approved for use in 2010 that has
four times the standard HA dose.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Adjuvants&#x02014;substances that increase immune responses to an antigen&#x02014;can be
added to influenza antigens to improve vaccine immunogenicity, particularly for
vulnerable populations. An influenza vaccine with MF59 adjuvant, which is a squalene
oil-in-water emulsion system, is licensed in the United States, Europe, and some
countries in the Asia pacific region including Australia for persons aged 65&#x02009;years
and older who do not have a history of severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or
its components.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A number of adjuvants are used in pandemic influenza vaccines including
aluminum salt, MF59, and AS03.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Other adjuvants are under investigation including immunostimulatory DNA
sequences and bacterium-derived components.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>A key characteristic of influenza virus is continuous antigenic drift which requires
that the vaccine be reformulated each year because of ongoing viral evolution
through antigenic drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2515135520908121">Figure
2</xref>). This need for annual reformulation is unique to the influenza vaccines.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2-2515135520908121" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Antigenic drift and antigenic shift in influenza vaccines.</p><p>Antigenic drift occurs in all influenza types (A, B, and C) and is caused by
small mutations in the antibody binding sites of hemagglutinin,
neuraminidase, or both. Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza type A and
is caused by exchanges of whole gene segments (often from birds or pigs) in
hemagglutinin or neuraminidase that leads to the development of a new
subtype of the virus. Antigenic shift is associated with
pandemics.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2515135520908121-fig2"/></fig><p>The candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) included each year in the vaccines are chosen by
the WHO based on information gathered by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and
Response System (GISRS).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This system works with 141 National Influenza Centers in 111 countries who
supply specimens to WHO Collaborating Centers to identify the next year&#x02019;s influenza
virus. A network of associated laboratories tests approximately 1 million samples
annually and provide thousands of samples of influenza viruses to WHO for further
evaluation. Twice each year, vaccine consultation meetings are held to recommend
vaccine strains; for the Northern hemisphere in February and for the Southern
hemisphere in August.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Production of the vaccines in such large volumes and the final
release assay for quality assurance requires approximately 6&#x02009;months, therefore
vaccine composition choice must be made expeditiously each year.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Influenza vaccines have a good safety record, but their effectiveness varies widely.
One important issue is the potential for mismatch between the vaccine-selected
strain and circulating strain, which is not uncommon. Between 2002 and 2015, five
virus mismatches to the influenza vaccine had occurred.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The potential effect of these mismatches can be seen in the increase in
outpatient visits seen in those years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2515135520908121">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3-2515135520908121" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Visits for influenza-like illness during selected influenza seasons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2515135520908121-fig3"/></fig><sec id="section4-2515135520908121"><title>Influenza manufacturing processes</title><p>The seed virus isolation and manufacturing process for influenza vaccines can

egg-dependent process.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Viruses to be used in manufacturing are either obtained directly from
clinical samples by the WHO GISRS and passaged directly in eggs to become the
CVV or, if the virus does not grow well in eggs, they will undergo a process
called reassorting in order to obtain a better growing virus. Reassorting is
performed by co-infecting eggs with the chosen potential CVV and with a &#x02018;donor&#x02019;
strain, which is a well-characterized virus that grows well in eggs. As the
viruses grow in the eggs, they may swap gene segments resulting in a virus that
still contains the important antigenic elements of the proposed CVV but now
grows better in eggs because the virus contains genes from the donor virus. On a
larger scale, this new reassorted virus is chosen to be the CVV and many
embryonated eggs are infected with the virus. After an incubation period, the
allantoic fluid is harvested from the eggs, the virus is killed (or
inactivated), and the key viral antigens are purified for use in influenza
vaccine.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>The traditional egg-based process is a time-tested process but can be associated
with some challenges. For inactivated vaccines, each dose of vaccine requires
three to four eggs depending on the whether it is TIV or quadrivalent influenza
vaccine (QIV), which means the coordination of the production of more than 100
million embryonated chicken eggs in flocks that must be pathogen free (clean).
Ensuring clean flocks can be challenging as can maintaining sterility throughout
the manufacturing process. Lapses in hygiene can lead to the need to reject
large amounts of vaccine.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In addition, embryonated hens&#x02019; eggs are not the ideal substrate for all
virus strains; the H3N2 strains do not grow well.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Importantly, the manufacturing process for inactivated influenza vaccines
requires that the influenza virus infects the cells used in the process (e.g.
avian cells for eggs). Seasonal viruses grow in humans and thus naturally grow
in some mammalian cells. The influenza virus needs to bind to a cellular
receptor in order to infect a cell. Avian cells have different receptors than
are on the surface of mammalian cells. This means that for a human influenza
virus to grow well in avian cells it needs to adapt to bind the avian receptor
in a process known as egg adaptation. Unfortunately, the region in which the
adaption occurs on the influenza virus is the same region that is dominant
antigenically. This means that as the virus adapts to grow in eggs, it has the
potential to differ antigenically to circulating viruses. This difference may
drive egg-based vaccines to potentially be less effective at preventing
influenza infection than their nonegg adapted mammalian cell grown counterparts.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>In 2012 a manufacturing process was approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) that uses cell-culture technology for influenza vaccine
production. In 2016 this process also extended to include both isolation and
bulk production, which was also approved by the FDA for the development of
WHO-isolated CVVs (<italic>versus</italic> egg-based).<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Starting in the 2017&#x02013;2018 season, WHO has provided strain recommendations
for seasonal influenza vaccines for both egg-derived and cell-derived CVVs.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The cell-culture technology process isolates and grows viruses in Madin&#x02013;Darby
Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells rather than fertilized eggs. The production of
cell-based influenza vaccines and the cell-grown CVVs allows for the elimination
of the potential for egg-adapted changes and grows viruses that are closer to
the circulating strain.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In addition, cell-based production is not dependent on a
supply of eggs; instead MDCK cells can be frozen in large quantities if needed
for a pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2515135520908121" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Cell-based and recombinant influenza vaccines are available for use in

Influenza vaccines are important in minimizing the effects of what can be a
devastating disease. Although vaccines have been available for many years, the
traditional manufacturing process, which relies on fertilized hens&#x02019; eggs is
logistically complicated and egg-derived manufacturing may encounter extended delays
due to the need for a continuous and large supply of eggs. In addition, egg-based
vaccines are often affected by egg adaptation (particularly for H3N2) in seed
strains, which may lead to a decrease in vaccine effectiveness.</p><p>The new process of cell-based isolation and manufacturing offers some advantages
including an improved production process that may allow for faster development and a
minimization of egg-adaptation. Studies indicate that viruses produced in a
cell-based process more closely match the circulating virus than those produced in
an egg-based process, and observational data from the 2017 to 2018 season provides
some supportive evidence of potential improved effectiveness. As a result, both
cell-based and other nonegg technologies used for the production of influenza
vaccines will likely further reduce the burden of disease as investigators continue
to search for the holy grail of a universal influenza vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank C. Gordon Beck (Princeton Biomedical Communications, LLC,
