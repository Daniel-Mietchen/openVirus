<p>In the 2017–2018 influenza season, half of US service members who were immunized received cell-based vaccines. A study analyzed the data from the Defense Medical Surveillance System who had received either a cell-based influenza vaccine or an egg-based influenza vaccine between 1 August 2017 and 28 April 2018. The analysis used two study designs. For the case test-negative design, which included laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, the adjusted RVE of cell-based influenza vaccines (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2467) compared with egg-based influenza vaccines (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3239) was 5% (95% CI: –10, 17). The second study design was based on cohorts as defined by outcomes for influenza-like illness (ILI) or diagnosed influenza. For all cohorts, 50% received the cell-based influenza vaccine. Compared with egg-based influenza vaccines, the adjusted RVE of cell-based influenza vaccines for ILI medical encounters was 2% (95% CI: 0, 4), for ILI hospitalization 16% (95% CI: –9, 35), for influenza-specific medical encounter 16% (95% CI: 11, 20), and for influenza hospitalization 46% (95% CI: –18, 76). These results showed that the RVE of cell-based influenza vaccines was similar to or greater than that of egg-based influenza vaccines but only statistically significant for ILI and influenza-specific medical encounters.
