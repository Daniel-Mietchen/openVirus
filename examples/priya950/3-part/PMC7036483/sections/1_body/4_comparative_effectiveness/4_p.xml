<p>A Kaiser Permanente Northern California study included all members (

 </sup> The study evaluated persons who received an inactivated influenza vaccine that was either cell-based quadrivalent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 84,440) or egg-based (
 <italic>n</italic> = 932,874), which was mostly trivalent (86.5%). Influenza cases were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction. The vaccine effectiveness against influenza A compared with unvaccinated persons was 30.2% (95% CI: 17.1, 41.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) for the cell-based vaccine and 17.9% (95% CI: 12.1, 23.3) for the egg-based vaccine. When compared with each other the adjusted RVE of the cell-based 
 <italic>versus</italic> the egg-based vaccine was 6.8% (95% CI: 17.1, 41.3). When compared with unvaccinated subjects, the adjusted absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) for cell-based vaccines was 30.2% (95% CI: 17.1, 41.3;

 </sup> Similar to the previous study the outcomes are not statistically significant and the authors concluded that increased power may have allowed for a definitive assessment on whether there was indeed a modest advantage with cell based vaccines over egg-based vaccines.
