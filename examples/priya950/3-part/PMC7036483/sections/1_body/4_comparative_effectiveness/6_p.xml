<p>A complicating factor for these studies is that cell-based manufacturing systems still use both egg-based CVVs as well as cell-based CVVs; the 2017–2018 cell-based vaccine included three cell-based CVVs and one egg-based CVV (H1N1). As a result, the egg-CVV virus may retain egg-characteristics and the improvements shown in the cell-based vaccine were most likely due to the cell-based components, particularly for H3N2. All four components for the 2019–2020 influenza vaccine are cell-based CVV for the first time and this offers an opportunity to monitor the outcomes for all these strains in the future.
