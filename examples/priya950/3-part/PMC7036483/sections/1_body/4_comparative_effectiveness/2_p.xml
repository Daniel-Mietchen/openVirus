<p>During this H3N2-dominated influenza season, the IPTW-adjusted results show that for influenza-related hospital encounters cell-based quadrivalent vaccine was modestly but significantly more effective than egg-based quadrivalent vaccine [relative vaccine efficacy (RVE) 11.0%, 95% CI: 7.9–14.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05], egg-based standard-dose trivalent (RVE 10.8, 95% CI 7.4–14.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05), and egg-based adjuvanted trivalent (RVE 7.5, 95% CI 4.1–10.7, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05), but not egg-based high-dose trivalent (RVE 2.3 95% CI: −0.8, to 5.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05). For influenza-related office visits only, the cell-cultured quadrivalent vaccine was significantly more effective than the egg-based quadrivalent vaccine (RVE 5.7%, 95% CI, 1.9–9.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05), the egg-based adjuvanted trivalent (RVE 11.5%, 95% CI, 7.9–15.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05), and the egg-based high-dose trivalent (RVE 5.1, 95% CI 1.6–8.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> ⩽ 0.05), but not compared with the egg-based standard-dose trivalent (RVE 1.0%, 95% −3.5 to 5.3).
