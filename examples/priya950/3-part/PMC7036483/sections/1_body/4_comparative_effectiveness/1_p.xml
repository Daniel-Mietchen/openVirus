<p>Cell-based inactivated influenza vaccines have been shown to be modestly more effective than egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines. A 2017–2018 real-world observational study evaluated the relative effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines prepared in embryonated chicken eggs compared with those prepared in mammalian cells.

 </sup> The study included more than 13 million Medicare beneficiaries age 65 years or older—nearly all the vaccine recipients in the United States in this age group—who had received inactivated influenza vaccines in a cell-based quadrivalent form (
 <italic>n</italic> = 659,249) or four types of egg-based vaccines; quadrivalent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,863,654), high-dose trivalent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8,489,159), adjuvanted trivalent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,473,536), or standard dose trivalent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,018,494). The primary data source was Medicare administrative files with patient details on enrollment, inpatient and outpatient care, physician office visits, and prescription drugs from 6 August 2017 to 4 August 2018. The primary outcome was influenza-related hospital encounters (i.e. inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits as defined by the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for influenza). Other outcomes included only inpatient stays, influenza-related office visits, and hospital outpatient visits. The results were adjusted for imbalances between covariates using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). A Poisson regression was used to evaluate the prevention of influenza-related hospital encounters.
