 </sup> This system works with 141 National Influenza Centers in 111 countries who supply specimens to WHO Collaborating Centers to identify the next year’s influenza virus. A network of associated laboratories tests approximately 1 million samples annually and provide thousands of samples of influenza viruses to WHO for further evaluation. Twice each year, vaccine consultation meetings are held to recommend vaccine strains; for the Northern hemisphere in February and for the Southern hemisphere in August.

 </sup> Production of the vaccines in such large volumes and the final release assay for quality assurance requires approximately 6 months, therefore vaccine composition choice must be made expeditiously each year.
