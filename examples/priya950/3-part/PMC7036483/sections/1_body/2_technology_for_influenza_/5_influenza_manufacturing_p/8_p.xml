<p>Other novel manufacturing processes are being developed to produce effective vaccines more quickly. In one process, recombinant technology is used to isolate the HA gene from a “wild type” influenza virus and then insert the HA gene in a baculovirus based expression system. This recombinant baculovirus infects insect cells and expresses both baculovirus proteins and the HA protein encoded by the inserted genes. The expressed influenza HA protein is harvested and purified.

 </sup> The resulting HA component is genetically identical to the HA of the selected strain. This process can produce some vaccine quantities within 6–8 weeks.
