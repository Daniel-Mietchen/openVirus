<p>The cell-culture technology process isolates and grows viruses in Madinâ€“Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells rather than fertilized eggs. The production of cell-based influenza vaccines and the cell-grown CVVs allows for the elimination of the potential for egg-adapted changes and grows viruses that are closer to the circulating strain.

 </sup> In addition, cell-based production is not dependent on a supply of eggs; instead MDCK cells can be frozen in large quantities if needed for a pandemic.

 </sup> Cell-based and recombinant influenza vaccines are available for use in the United States and, recently, a cell-based QIV was also licensed in the EU. Efforts are underway for these vaccines to be made available in more geographies.
