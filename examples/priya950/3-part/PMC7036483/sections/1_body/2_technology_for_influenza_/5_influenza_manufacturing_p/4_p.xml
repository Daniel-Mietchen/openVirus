<p>Importantly, the manufacturing process for inactivated influenza vaccines requires that the influenza virus infects the cells used in the process (e.g. avian cells for eggs). Seasonal viruses grow in humans and thus naturally grow in some mammalian cells. The influenza virus needs to bind to a cellular receptor in order to infect a cell. Avian cells have different receptors than are on the surface of mammalian cells. This means that for a human influenza virus to grow well in avian cells it needs to adapt to bind the avian receptor in a process known as egg adaptation. Unfortunately, the region in which the adaption occurs on the influenza virus is the same region that is dominant antigenically. This means that as the virus adapts to grow in eggs, it has the potential to differ antigenically to circulating viruses. This difference may drive egg-based vaccines to potentially be less effective at preventing influenza infection than their nonegg adapted mammalian cell grown counterparts.
