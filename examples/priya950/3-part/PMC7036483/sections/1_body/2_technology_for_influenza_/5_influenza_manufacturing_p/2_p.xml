<p>For more than 70 years, influenza vaccines have been manufactured through an egg-dependent process.

 </sup> Viruses to be used in manufacturing are either obtained directly from clinical samples by the WHO GISRS and passaged directly in eggs to become the CVV or, if the virus does not grow well in eggs, they will undergo a process called reassorting in order to obtain a better growing virus. Reassorting is performed by co-infecting eggs with the chosen potential CVV and with a ‘donor’ strain, which is a well-characterized virus that grows well in eggs. As the viruses grow in the eggs, they may swap gene segments resulting in a virus that still contains the important antigenic elements of the proposed CVV but now grows better in eggs because the virus contains genes from the donor virus. On a larger scale, this new reassorted virus is chosen to be the CVV and many embryonated eggs are infected with the virus. After an incubation period, the allantoic fluid is harvested from the eggs, the virus is killed (or inactivated), and the key viral antigens are purified for use in influenza vaccine.
