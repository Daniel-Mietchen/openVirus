<p>The traditional egg-based process is a time-tested process but can be associated with some challenges. For inactivated vaccines, each dose of vaccine requires three to four eggs depending on the whether it is TIV or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), which means the coordination of the production of more than 100 million embryonated chicken eggs in flocks that must be pathogen free (clean). Ensuring clean flocks can be challenging as can maintaining sterility throughout the manufacturing process. Lapses in hygiene can lead to the need to reject large amounts of vaccine.

 </sup> In addition, embryonated hensâ€™ eggs are not the ideal substrate for all virus strains; the H3N2 strains do not grow well.
