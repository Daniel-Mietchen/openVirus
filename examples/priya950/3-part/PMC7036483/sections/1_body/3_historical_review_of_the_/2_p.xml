<p>A more recent meta-analysis of test-negative design studies of egg-based influenza vaccine effectiveness included 56 studies from 2004 to 2015. Test-negative studies enroll patients who seek medical care for acute respiratory illness and whose clinical samples are then tested for influenza with RT-PCR. Those who test negative are used as controls in the analysis.

 </sup> The meta-analysis showed that the vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 was 67% (95% CI: 29–85), for H1N1pdm09 was 61% (95% CI: 57–65) and for type B was 54% (95% CI: 46–61). For H3N2, the overall pooled effectiveness was much lower at 33% (95% CI: 26–39)

 </sup> with even lower effectiveness from seasons with mismatch (23%). This lower effectiveness with H3N2 vaccine effectiveness was seen across all age groups; pediatric (43%), working-age adults (35%), and older adults (24%).
