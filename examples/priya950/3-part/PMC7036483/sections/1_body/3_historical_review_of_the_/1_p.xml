<p>Although influenza vaccines are widely recommended as influenza prophylaxis, actual effectiveness can be suboptimal. There are several reasons for this: natural drift, population level immunogenicity, study methodology, seasonal variation, and strain selection issues (including egg adaptation). A meta-analysis of 10 randomized control trials found that the pooled effectiveness for conventional egg-based trivalent inactivated vaccines against all influenza strains over 12 seasons (between 1967 and 2011) was 59% [95% confidence interval (CI): 51–67] in adults aged 18–65 years.
