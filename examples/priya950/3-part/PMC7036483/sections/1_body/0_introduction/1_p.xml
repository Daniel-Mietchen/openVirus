<p>Influenza causes up to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide and between 290,000 and 650,000 respiratory deaths each year.

 </sup> Its seasonal appearance is associated with increased visits to emergency rooms and primary care physicians, increased absenteeism at work and school, and increased hospitalizationsâ€”particularly in the elderly and persons with chronic conditions.

 </sup> Influenza vaccines are widely used to prevent outbreaks. However, antigenic drift (due to mutations in key viral antigens) in the virus and a lack of long-lasting antibody titers even with vaccination means that optimal protection can only be achieved with annual vaccinations developed by careful surveillance and prediction of emerging strains. Despite a well-established system of surveillance and vaccine production, current influenza vaccines, even when given annually, do not provide complete protection. There are a number of reasons for this including characteristics of the human immune system, mismatch between the circulating strain and the vaccine strain, and egg adaptation of viral seeds.

 </sup> New and emerging manufacturing technologies such as cell-culture isolation of the seed virus may improve the closeness of vaccine virus match to circulating strains and thereby improve effectiveness and, thus, further reduce the burden of disease from influenza. In the case of a pandemic, it also offers an opportunity to provide for a more rapid response, which obviates the reliance on eggs for vaccine bulk production.
