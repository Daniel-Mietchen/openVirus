<p id="par0040">Extensive microbiological investigations (direct examinations, culture preparations) failed to detect any bacterial pathogens in body fluids (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, urine, pericardial) or organs (lungs, liver, brain, heart, lymph nodes, digestive tract). Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of respiratory secretion samples targeting pertussis toxin, legionella, mycoplasma, and chlamydia were also negative. However, a multiplexed PCR analysis with Anyplex II RV16 of respiratory secretion samples that detects a panel of 16 viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus) yielded positive results, namely, the presence of both human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and bocavirus (HBoV). hMPV had a high early cycle threshold value (24.1), which indicated a high viral load, whereas HBoV had a value close to its lower limit of detection. As confirming evidence, hMPV was also detected in lung biopsy samples, as well as biopsy samples of other organs. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was identified in a lung biopsy sample, but the copy number was low (&lt; 500 UI/mL). The overall results of post-mortem virologic samples are summarized in
