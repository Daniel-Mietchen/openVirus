<p id="par0010">During the winter season, a 33-month-old girl in a day care centre had an isolated, well-tolerated fever that did not justify further medical evaluation. The fever, which occurred in the afternoon, was resolved by taking paracetamol, and the parents noted nothing amiss in the evening. Unfortunately, she died during the night between midnight and 3:30 am. Her body was sent to the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University Hospital, and a sudden death investigation was initiated. On admission, various imaging studies were performed, biological samples were collected about 12 h after death, and the autopsy was completed 36 h after death. As an additional measure, children attending the day care centre underwent surveillance for signs of infection.</p>
