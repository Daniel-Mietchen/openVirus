<p id="par0025">Macroscopic examination during autopsy revealed a very heterogeneous and edematous region in the lung parenchyma without suppuration or abscesses. Bilateral pleural effusion and multiple cervicothoracic lymphadenopathies, as well as four black intestinal patches without perforation or peritoneal effusion, were also observed. There was no cardiac malformation, including normal implantation of the large vessels and a closed foramen ovale. Macroscopic findings were not suggestive of pericarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or ischemic lesions.</p>
