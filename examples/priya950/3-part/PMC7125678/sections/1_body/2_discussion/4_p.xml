<p id="par0065">Pediatric cases of severe ARDS due to hMPV are rare, with only five cases are recorded in the literature, three of which resulted in death 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One patient died of uncontrolled ARDS 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, whereas another died after acute pulmonary hemorrhage soon after admission 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; neither patient had any significant medical history. Another patient presented with a secondary immunodeficiency owing to immunosuppression for hepatic transplantation 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Immunodeficiency has been linked to severe viral respiratory infections. Additional associations include TLR4 mutations with severe RSV bronchiolitis 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, IFIH1 loss-of-function mutations (which prevent sensing of viral RNA) with severe RNA virus (RSV and human rhinovirus) infections 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and IRF7 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and IRF 9 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> with severe influenza pneumonitis. All these genes are involved in innate immunity and interferon pathways and have been implicated in a theory proposing that monogenic inborn errors of immunity underlie susceptibility to specific infections 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the diseases noted above, the patient might not have any additional infections, and hence standard immunological tests would have yielded normal results. This premise is compatible with our case, as there was no remarkable medical history.
