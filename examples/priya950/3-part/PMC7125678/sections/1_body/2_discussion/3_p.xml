<p id="par0060">hMPV-induced pneumonia was indicated by a high viral load detected in respiratory secretions and lung biopsies. As further support, no other well-described human pathogens besides HBoV and CMV were detected. HBoV was present at low levels in one nasopharyngeal sample and may have simply been a bystander as it was not found in lung parenchyma samples and its pathogenic potential is debated 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. CMV was present at a low level in one lung biopsy sample in the absence of CMV viremia. Specific anti-CMV IgM immunoglobulins are likely unrelated to the sudden death observed in this case, and asymptomatic CMV reactivation frequently occurs during infections caused by other agents. Immune system evaluation (weight dosage of immunoglobulins) was performed on post-mortem samples, but a diagnosis of immunodeficiency was impossible without precise functional and quantitative analysis of lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and monocytes. However, we did not try to quantify T-cell-receptor excision circles (TRECs) from the neonatal screening sample.
