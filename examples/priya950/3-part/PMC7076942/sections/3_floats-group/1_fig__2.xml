  <p>Associations between microbial gene expression, compositionÂ and antibiotic resistance. 
   <bold>a</bold> Bacterial taxa with metatranscriptomic reads present at different relative abundance between the two groups were identified using DESeq2 and LEfSe, and plotted with log2 fold change. The red bars correspond to taxa for which genes were overexpressed in group 1 as compared to group 2, while the blue bars correspond to taxa overexpressed in group 2 compared to group 1. 
   <bold>b</bold> Reads were assigned to antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by aligning to the MEGARes database; gene assignments were summarized at the level of classes of antibiotics to which the genes confer resistance. The heatmap shows the abundance of reads originating from antibiotic resistance genes relative to the total number of metatranscriptomic reads for each sample
