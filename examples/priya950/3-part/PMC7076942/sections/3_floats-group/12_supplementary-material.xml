    <bold>Additional file 8: Figure S2.</bold> Subnetworks of genes clustered in M47. Each node in the graph represents one gene and it is labeled with the gene name. Red nodes are up-regulated genes and blue nodes are down-regulated genes comparing samples collected 1-2 days after onset of symptoms and samples collected at 30-45 days. The diamond shaped nodes are key regulators while the circular nodes are regular genes in the network. The sizes of the nodes represent node degree.
