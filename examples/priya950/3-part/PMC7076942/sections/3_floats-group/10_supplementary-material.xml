    <bold>Additional file 6: Table S6.</bold> DEGs in the host modules upregulated and downregulated within the groups identified from metatranscriptomic data. Host modules with significant responses to influenza infection (Table S5) were further subjected to enrichment analysis for up- and down-regulated and group specific DEGs. Empty fields indicate non-significant enrichment. A cutoff of 0.05 for corrected p-values was used after FET.
