  <p>Microbial gene expression profilingÂ of subjects. 
   <bold>a</bold> The samples were clustered into two groups, with red indicating group 1 and blue indicating group 2. The groups were identified by using hierarchical clustering on the Euclidean distance between microbial gene expression profiles of the samples. 
   <bold>b</bold> The pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes between group 1 and group 2 were plotted. The intensity of the color indicates number of genes being overexpressed in one group versus the other
