<p id="Par27">Since influenza virus infection impacts the host immune response and can lead to bacterial co-infection, we explored the interactions between the systemic host response to influenza virus infection and microbiome activities, including ARG expression in the airways, to better understand host-virus-bacteria dynamics during infection. We used novel data integration methods, such as Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], to build a host gene co-expression network that correlates host modules in influenza virus infection with microbial profiles, ARG expression, and microbial gene expression pathways.
