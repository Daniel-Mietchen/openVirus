<p id="Par50">The samples were clustered by using the gene expression profiles with hierarchical clustering on the Euclidean distance. DESeq2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] was used to identify differentially expressed ARG genes between the groups. The FDR-corrected 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05, combined with a log2 fold change greater than 2 or smaller than âˆ’ 2, was used as thresholds to filter the significantly differentially expressed genes. The bacterial taxa with differential abundant metatranscriptomic reads between the two groups were identified by overlapping the results from DESeq2 and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].
