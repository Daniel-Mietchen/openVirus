<p id="Par46">Genomic DNA was isolated from the remaining volume of each sample with the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) and stored at − 20 °C. The 16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified according to previously published methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). Reactions were purified using 0.65× volumes of Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA). Each sample was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA), pooled with equal input mass and repurified with 0.65× volumes of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA). The final sequencing pool was quantified by qPCR with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) on a Roche 480 LightCycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The library was sequenced at the Genomics Core Facility (Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, New York University) using an Illumina PE 2 × 250 V2 kit on an Illumina MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).
