<p id="Par49">The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data was processed through the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] pipeline. The reads were joined by using join_paired_ends.py and demultiplexed with split_library_fastq.py, and the chimeric sequences were identified and filtered out with ChimeraSlayer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity threshold with the closed reference OTU picking method and the greengene database (gg_13_8_otus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A negative control with water replacing DNA was used to detect potential contamination from the reagents; however, no bacterial sequence passed the quality filter in the pipeline. Taxonomic assignment of the representative sequence from each OTU was made using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Taxonomic information was summarized at the genus and family levels using summarize_taxa.py. The biom file output from QIIME was analyzed in Rstudio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] using the phyloseq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] R package. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were calculated, and the MDS plot was generated, based on the distance matrix on the samples (data not shown).
