<p id="Par55">Correlations between modules and traits (ARG expression, bacterial taxa abundance, and metatranscriptome expression) were calculated as follows: Spearmanâ€™s correlation between the first principal component of the module gene expression and the corresponding traits was determined. In the case of metatranscriptome expression, KEGG reactions were considered as traits. In a second step, KEGG reactions that were significantly correlated with a particular module were then further tested for enrichment with KEGG pathways. All module/trait correlation 
 <italic>p</italic> values were corrected using perturbation of the input data.
