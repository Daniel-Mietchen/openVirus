<p id="Par51">The metatranscriptomic reads classified as antibiotic resistance genes were extracted from the datasets; taxonomic assignments were made to these reads using Kraken [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] with default parameters. The percentage of reads assigned to each taxon was calculated. Taxonomy assignments on all the metatranscriptomic reads in the datasets were also made by using Kraken.
