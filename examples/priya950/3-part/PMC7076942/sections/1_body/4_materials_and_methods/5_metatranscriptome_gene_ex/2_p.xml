<p id="Par48">The antibiotic resistance genes were annotated by aligning the filtered metatranscriptomic reads to the antibiotic resistance gene database, MEGARes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The reads assigned to genes that confer resistance only by mutation were removed from the final results (as these genes are unrelated to antibiotic resistance when they do not carry mutations). The alignment was done on the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] using the BWA-MEM alignment method and default parameters. The alignments were filtered such that each antibiotic resistance gene needed to have matching reads in at least two regions for the reads to be kept, and the antibiotic resistance gene matrix was filtered so that each gene needed to have at least ten matching reads.
