<p id="Par47">The metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were demultiplexed, and quality was assessed using the FastQC Toolkit (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Contaminating human, ribosomal RNA, and adaptor sequences were removed from each dataset using DeconSeq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], SortMeRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and Trimmomatic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], respectively. The duplicated reads were removed by using Fastuniq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The filtered reads were assigned to the orthologous gene families using the FMAP bioinformatics tool (FMAP: Functional Mapping and Analysis Pipeline for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies) and with the default KEGG-filtered Uniref90 reference cluster [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The reads were mapped to the database using the DIAMOND [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] mapping program with default parameters. The KEGG orthologous gene family abundance file for each sample was generated using the FMAP_quantification.pl script with default parameters. The pathways enriched with differentially expressed microbial genes between the two groups were also identified using the FMAP_comparison.pl and FMAP_pathway.pl scripts with 5% FDR.
