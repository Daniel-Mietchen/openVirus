<p id="Par43">Samples were collected from 37 individuals participating in the Household Influenza Transmission Study (HITS) in Managua, Nicaragua. Respiratory specimens consisted of pooled nasal and throat swabs collected at 1–2 days post illness onset from individuals with influenza-like symptoms between July 2013 and October 2014 in Managua, Nicaragua. Samples were shipped to the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, New York University, and stored at − 80 °C. The HITS sample cohort included child index cases enrolled in the Nicaraguan Influenza Cohort Study and their family members who developed influenza. An acute blood sample was collected from all participants at enrollment into the study, and a convalescent sample was collected 30–45 days later. Blood samples were immediately transferred to the Centro Nacional de Diagnostico y Referencia, the Nicaraguan National Laboratory, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated using Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One) containing 3 mL of Ficoll Histopaque (Sigma) following established protocols [

The HITS study was approved by the institutional review boards at the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and the University of Michigan. Informed consent or parental permission was obtained for all participants and children aged 6 years and older provided assent.
