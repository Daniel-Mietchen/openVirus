<p id="Par53">Feature selection in spls was done using 10-fold cross validation to tune the parameters (sparsity); the latent component number was decided by decomposing the covariance. Bootstrapping and random permutation were used to determine the significance of a featureâ€™s contribution to the model. The bacterial genera with bootstrapping

As only genes conferring resistance to beta-lactam, tetracyclines, MLS, and multidrug resistance are abundant enough to yield good predictions, these four classes of antibiotics were kept with the identified associations.
