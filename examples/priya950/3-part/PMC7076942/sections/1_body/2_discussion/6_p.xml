<p id="Par41">The novel method we used to integrate information from the host responses to influenza infection with microbial composition and gene expression highlights the complex interplay between the microbial community and the influenza-infected host. However, there were a number of limitations to this study: First, the analysis was limited to sequence similarity to known ARGs, and thus novel antibiotic resistance genes could not be detected. It also did not include the analysis of point mutations that are known to be associated with antibiotic drug resistance, thus the profiling of ARG expression was conservative. Secondly, for the correlation analyses, we were unable to test for familial effects because of the limited number of index-household contact pairs. In a follow-up study that is currently ongoing, we collected respiratory samples from more than 50 subjects in 10 households, with multiple contact cases within households, including from healthy controls. This expanded study will also allow us to determine whether ARG transmission is a common occurrence and the respiratory tract an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes, as implicated by our current analysis.</p>
