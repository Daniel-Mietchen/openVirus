<p id="Par38">Previous studies have reported on the dynamics of antibiotic resistance expression in the gut and in the environmental microbiome, and have shown the diversity in ARG expression and niche specificity [

In our study, we identified bacteria-expressed genes that confer resistance to classes of antibiotics that the infected individuals were not taking, according to their antibiotic use history in the 12â€‰months preceding influenza diagnosis. The three antibiotics reported to have been prescribed to this group of individuals include Beta-lactams, macrolides, and Nitroimidazole (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), but ARGs were also found against classes of antibiotics that are currently rarely taken, such as phenicol. Although we may not have a complete record of past antibiotic use because antibiotics taken over-the-counter are often not reported, it is also possible that some of the ARGs expressed are unrelated to antibiotic use by the individuals in which these were detected and could be the result of transmission of antibiotic resistant strains between individuals. Transmission of drug-resistant bacteria both within the human population and between environmental reservoirs and humans is known to occur [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and thus antibiotic resistance is a secondary effect.
