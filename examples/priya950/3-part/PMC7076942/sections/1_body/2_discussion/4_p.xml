<p id="Par39">We determined a number of correlations between antibiotic resistance and specific bacterial taxa. For example, 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> had positive correlations with beta-lactam resistance gene expression. In several studies, species in these genera, such as 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic>, were found to carry beta-lactam resistance genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Given that harboring ARGs can exact a fitness cost on the host bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], it is possible that other taxa compete with the bacteria that express or maintain the ARGs, leading to the observed negative associations. For example, we observed that the relative abundance of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> determined from the 16S rRNA gene data was negatively correlated with tetracycline resistance gene expression. We also observed previously unreported correlations between ARG expression and several bacterial taxa, such as multidrug resistance and 
 <italic>Rothia</italic>. Mapping of the ARG reads to the bacterial taxa databases also revealed an enrichment of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Neisseria,</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus,</italic> especially clinically important bacterial species, such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Indirect correlations suggest that although some taxa present in the respiratory tract do not specifically express ARGs, they could play an indirect role in ARG expression by affecting microbial composition and function.
