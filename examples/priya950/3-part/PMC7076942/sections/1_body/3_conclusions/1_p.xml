<p id="Par42">The analysis of individuals from a Nicaraguan household study reveals how host response to influenza virus infection could indirectly impact antibiotic resistance gene expression in the respiratory tract by affecting the microbiome. It highlights the importance of understanding these associations in individuals infected with influenza virus and possibly other respiratory viruses. The correlations identified between host responses to influenza infection and the bacteria present in the airways show the possible effects of the host responses on the microbiome. This is important as both the host response and the microbiome can influence the risk of secondary bacterial infections because of interactions between potentially pathogenic bacteria and the commensals present in the respiratory tract. This analysis also suggests that the respiratory tract is possibly an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in humans and should be further explored, especially regarding inter-host transmission of antibiotic resistance genes during influenza epidemics.</p>
