<p id="Par33">To investigate the correlations between the microbiome in the upper respiratory tract and systemic host responses stimulated by influenza virus infection, we analyzed host genes that were differentially expressed during influenza virus infection and after recovery. We also looked specifically at the correlations between host systemic responses and the respiratory tract microbiome and ARG expression. We analyzed patient blood samples collected 1–2 days after onset of symptoms and at 30–45 days—this last time point as a proxy of a pre-infection baseline—and determined global host transcriptome expression. We performed Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] on the host transcriptomic data, and correlated corresponding MEGENA modules with ARG expression, and taxonomic assignments from the 16S rRNA gene data.
