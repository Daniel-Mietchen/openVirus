<p id="Par35">To further understand the interactions between the microbiome and the host response, we integrated data from bacterial taxa, bacterial pathways, and antibiotic resistance gene expression profiles with the top 20 host gene modules. We found significant correlations between host modules and bacterial families (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>Veillonellaceae</italic> had positive correlations with many host modules, including M49 and M5, which are enriched with genes involved in the type I interferon signaling pathway. We also observed correlations between specific host modules, bacterial pathways, and ARGs. For example, host module M47, also enriched with genes involved in interferon signaling, had a positive correlation with the expression of sulfonamide resistance genes and a negative correlation with the bacterial secretion system. Several key regulators of the network—i.e., hubs with high connectivity—were identified for each of the host modules. These key regulators are genes with the most impact on neighboring genes in the subnetworks. GBP1 (guanylate-binding protein 1), for example, appeared to be a key regulator in host modules M47 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) and M5, and was upregulated during influenza virus infection (FC = 3.5, adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.003). GBP1 has a known function against influenza virus infection and it is associated with anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions. Thus, the correlations observed from the network between the host modules and the microbiome in the upper respiratory tract could be due to the direct impact of influenza virus infection on the host and the respiratory microbiome. The network topology suggests potential connections between specific host pathways, key regulators, the microbial community composition, and gene expression—including ARG expression—during influenza virus infection.
