<p id="Par32">To study the correlations between ARG expression and bacterial taxa, we characterized the relative abundance of genera for each sample using the 16S rRNA gene profiles analyzed with the QIIME pipeline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To determine whether any bacterial genera contributed to explaining specific variations in ARG expression, we used sparse partial least squares regression (spls) analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which can perform simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection. We did a feature selection with spls using ARG expression profiles as response variables and the taxonomic assignments of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the 16S rRNA gene data as the predictors. Several bacterial genera correlated with specific ARG expression. For example, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> had positive correlations with the expression of beta-lactam resistance genes, while other common respiratory tract bacterial genera, such as 
 <italic>Neisseria,</italic> had positive correlations with multidrug resistance gene expression (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Conversely, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> had negative correlations with tetracycline resistance gene expression (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Metatranscriptomic reads that mapped to ARGs were further assigned to bacterial taxa using Kraken, a tool used to make taxonomic assignments from metagenomic type data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A significant proportion of these reads mapped to 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>and Neisseria.</italic> On average, 47% of the reads originating from ARGs mapped to 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, while 10% of the reads mapped to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Thirty-four percent of the 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> ARG reads mapped to 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, while the majority of the 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> ARG reads corresponded to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).
