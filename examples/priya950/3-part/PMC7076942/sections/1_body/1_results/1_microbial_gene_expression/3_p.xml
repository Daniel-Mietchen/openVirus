<p id="Par30">By comparing the metatranscriptomic datasets between the two groups, we identified several bacterial genera, including 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic>, 
 <italic>and Haemophilus</italic>, that were differentially expressed. For example, 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> had a higher relative abundance of mapped RNA sequence reads in group 1, while 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic> (primarily 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>) and 
 <italic>Haemophilus (H. parainfluenza</italic>) had a higher relative abundance of mapped reads in group 2 (Fig.
