<p id="Par29">We characterized overall microbial gene expression profiles by aligning metatranscriptomic sequence reads to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-filtered Uniprot database from the Functional Mapping and Analysis Pipeline for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies (FMAP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our samples clustered into 2 major groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) based on the hierarchical clustering of overall microbial gene expression profiles. We did pathway enrichment analysis on the genes differentially expressed between group 1 and group 2. Several bacterial pathways, including the ABC transporter pathway and the bacterial secretion system, were enriched with differentially expressed genes between the two groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).
