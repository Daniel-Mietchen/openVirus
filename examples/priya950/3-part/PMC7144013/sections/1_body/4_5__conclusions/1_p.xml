<p>The obtained results suggest that liver transudate, used at an appropriate dilution (1:10), may be a good alternative matrix to serum for detecting anti-HEV antibodies by ELISA in pigs and wild boars. This matrix may be useful in postmortem analyses for diagnosis, surveillance, or research in field studies, particularly when obtaining blood is impractical. Although HEV could be detected by RT-qPCR in the liver transudate, further studies with more samples are needed to obtain any conclusion.</p>
