<p>Although other alternatives to serum have been tested for the detection of anti-HEV antibodies, they are scarce, and the results have not always been compared with the serum results. A previous study detected anti-HEV antibodies in body cavity transudate obtained from raccoons, raccoon dogs, cats, and dogs [

 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similarly, other reports also demonstrated the utility of meat juice to determine the prevalence of different agents such as

 <italic>Trichinella</italic>, influenza virus or 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> [

 <xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Meat juice, like other body fluids, contains fewer antibodies against HEV, 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, and other pathogens than serum [

 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], so the dilution factor in serological assays should be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, liver transudate was tested undiluted and at different dilutions to determine this factor.
