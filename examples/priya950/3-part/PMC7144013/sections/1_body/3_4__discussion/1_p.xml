<p>The present study is the first to demonstrate that liver transudate may be a good alternative matrix for the detection of anti-HEV antibodies in pigs and wild boars, since our results suggest a good agreement between the qualitative results and the optical densities of both matrices in the ELISA technique, especially with the 1:10 liver transudate dilution.</p>
