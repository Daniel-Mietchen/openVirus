<p>In this study, anti-HEV antibodies were successfully detected in the liver transudate of pigs and wild boars, and their detection rate showed an elevated agreement with their paired serum samples. The specificity and sensitivity obtained with liver transudate were high, which indicates that it could be a good alternative to serum, which is in concordance with other studies made in another matrix [
 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Both serum and liver transudates at all dilutions presented a range of very similar OD values. In general, seroprevalence in serum was slightly higher than the one obtained with the liver transudate, which could be explained by the presence of inhibitors of the ELISA in the latter type of samples. Meat or liver exudates are tricky analytical templates and, as other many food items, they contain components, such as fat or haemo group, that can produce a matrix effect in the ELISA reaction [

 <xref rid="B62-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; we found 1:10 to be the best dilution for detecting anti-HEV antibodies using a commercial indirect ELISA test. Although this dilution did not always give the best individual values of specificity, sensitivity, PPV, or NPV, it gave overall the best results. In addition, the 1:10 transudate dilution showed the best concordance of serum results with qualitative and optical densities in ELISA results.
