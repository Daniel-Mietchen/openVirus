<p>RT-qPCRs was performed on 58 paired serum and liver transudate samples from subsets of the animals (35 white pigs, 5 Iberian pigs, and 18 wild boars). These subsets were selected based on the amount of sample available. HEV RNA was obtained using the QIAmp Viral Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. The obtained product was stored at −80 °C until RT-qPCR was performed. HEV viral genome was detected using a previously described RT-qPCR assay [

RT-qPCR was performed using the QuantiFast Pathogen RT-PCR + IC kit (QIAGEN) in a 20-µL reaction volume containing 10 µL of RNA. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Samples showing PCR inhibition were diluted 1:10 in RNase free water.
