<p>A total of 125 paired serum and liver transudate samples from 44 white pigs, 46 Iberian pigs, and 35 wild boars were included in the present study. Blood samples and liver samples (25 g) were collected at the different slaughterhouses in the case of pigs from the Spanish provinces of Cuenca, Pontevedra, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Burgos, Málaga, Córdoba, Girona, Toledo, Murcia, and Badajoz. Wild boar samples were recovered in the field after approximately 6 hours after the animal’s death by hunting, in the province of Madrid, Spain. All samples were taken by authorized veterinary personnel and transported to the laboratory in refrigerated containers. Once in the laboratory, blood was preserved at 4 °C until the next day, when serum was obtained and stored at −40 °C for the ELISA and at −80 °C for the RT-qPCR. Liver samples were stored at −80 °C. In order to obtain the transudate, liver samples were frozen and thawed once at room temperature. The resulting liquid was collected between four and eight hours later and then stored at −40 °C for ELISA and at −80 °C for RT-qPCR. All animal experiments in this study were conducted according to Spanish regulations (RD 53/2013) and European regulations (EU Directive 2010/63/EU).</p>
