<p>Animal type and the number of frozen-thaw cycles were tested in univariable logistic regression models using HEV positivity as the outcome variable. Risk factors that were significant in the univariable model with a generous 
 <italic>p</italic>-value range &lt; 0.2 were considered for inclusion in a multivariable model. The agreement between the qualitative results obtained in serum and liver transudate at different dilutions was measured using the Kappa statistic (κ). The corresponding optical densities (ODs) were compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). When appropriate, results were reported together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated with the “pROC” [
