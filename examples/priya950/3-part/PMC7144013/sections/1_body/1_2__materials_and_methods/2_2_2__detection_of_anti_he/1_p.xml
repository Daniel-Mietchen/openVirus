<p>All sera and liver transudate samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-HEV antibodies using the commercial ELISA kit ID Screen Hepatitis E Indirect Multi-species (IDvet, Montepellier, France) according to the manufacturerâ€™s specifications, with a cut-off value set at 70 (S/P%). This is a duplicate-well test in which even-numbered wells are coated with a recombinant antigen from the capsid of HEV genotype 3, and odd-numbered wells are uncoated. Serum was diluted at 1:20 in the dilution buffer provided by the kit, while transudate was tested using the original undiluted sample as well as the dilutions 1:2, 1:10, and 1:20 in the dilution buffer. All plates were read at 450 nm with a Zenyth 3100 microplate multimode detector (Anthos Labtec Instruments GmbH, Salzburg, Austria).</p>
