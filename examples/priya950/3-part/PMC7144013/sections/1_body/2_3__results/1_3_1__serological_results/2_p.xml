<p>The prevalence was different among the different animal species (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00450-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The difference in HEV prevalence between transudate and serum assays ranged from 2 to 23.2 percentage points, depending on the dilution (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00450-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the HEV ELISA are displayed in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00450-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, together with the area under the curve (AUC) using confidence intervals of 95%, and a cut-off value of 70%. The highest overall specificity was obtained with the 1:20 transudate dilution (95.0%, 95% CI 87.5–100) followed by the 1:10 transudate dilution (90.0%, 95% CI 80.0–97.5). The highest sensitivity was obtained with the 1:2 transudate dilution (85.9%, 95% CI 77.6–95.9), followed by the undiluted transudate (82.3%, 95% CI 74.1–90.6). The best PPV corresponded to the 1:20 transudate dilution (96.5%, 95% CI 91.1–100), followed by the 1:10 transudate dilution (94.4%, 95% CI 89.2–98.6). The best NPV was obtained with undiluted transudate (69.1%, 95% CI 59.3-79.6), followed by 1:2 transudate dilution (67.6%, 95% CI 55.3–81.3) and 1:10 transudate dilution (66.7%, 95% 58.2–77.1). Finally, similar AUC values were obtained across the samples, with pairwise differences ranging from only 0.6 to 1.2 percentage points (
