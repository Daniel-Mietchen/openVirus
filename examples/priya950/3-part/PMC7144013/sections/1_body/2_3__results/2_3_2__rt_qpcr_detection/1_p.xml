<p>A total of 58 paired serum and liver transudate samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00450-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In total, 13 serum (22.4%, 95%CI 13.5–34.6%) and four liver transudate samples (6.90%, 95%CI 2.71–16.4%) were positive. Of the four positive liver transudates, three of the paired serum samples were also positive, with threshold cycle values (Ct) of 33.27, 36.90, and 37.28 for the serum and 27.91, 24.98, and 32.78 for the transudate samples (

Interestingly, the animal with an RT-qPCR positive transudate sample but RT-qPCR negative for serum-tested ELISA positive for both serum and all liver transudate dilutions. Of the 13 RT-qPCR-positive serum samples, eight were from the white pig while the remaining five were from wild boars. All four of the RT-qPCR-positive transudate samples were obtained from wild boars. Generally, Ct values were lower in transudate (27–40) than in serum (28–42).
