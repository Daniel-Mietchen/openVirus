<p id="par0050">The detection of influenza viruses was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in accordance to the protocol of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The viral RNA was extracted using commercially available kits (Quick-RNA™ Viral, Zymo Research, and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, QIAGEN) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers. Specimens whose crossing point in the amplification curve was between 16 and 37 were considered as positive. The detection of respiratory viruses other than influenza was made using direct immunofluorescence assays (Light Diagnostics™ Respiratory Viral Screen and Identification DFA Kit, Millipore; and D
 <sup>3</sup> Ultra™ DFA Respiratory Virus Screening and ID Kit, Diagnostic Hybrids).
