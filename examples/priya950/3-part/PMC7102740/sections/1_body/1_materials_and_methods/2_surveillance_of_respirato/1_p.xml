<p id="par0030">Respiratory virus surveillance data from 2009 to 2016 were available for the analysis. There were two major changes in the surveillance system over that period. Data were initially (weeks 1â€“19 in 2009) collected from influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients swabbed in only four provinces in the country. Because of the short duration, limited geographical coverage, and small sample size (679 specimens overall), data from this period were not used in the analyses. From week 20/2009 to week 9/2011, a universal surveillance scheme was implemented whereby all ILI and SARI patients presenting at all hospitals, local health units, airports and harbours in the country were swabbed. Finally, from week 10/2011 until the end of the study period, a sentinel surveillance scheme for SARI was in place that included selected hospitals and local health units in the whole country.</p>
