<p id="par0060">The overall and virus-specific positive detection rate (PDR) were defined as the proportion of specimens testing positive on at least one or, respectively, each given respiratory virus. Patients infected with parainfluenza virus type 1, 2 and 3 were analyzed together due to limited numbers. Overall and virus-specific PDR were calculated overall and separately by: surveillance scheme, patients’ age group (0–1, 2–5, and 6–11 months; 1–4, 5–17, 18–39, 40–64 and ≥65 years), gender, and region (Coast and Sierra; Oriente and Galápagos Islands were not considered because of the limited number of samples).</p>
