<p id="par0070">A multinomial logistic regression model was fitted to compare the age distribution of patients infected with each respiratory viruses. The multinomial logistic regression model generalizes binary logistic regression to problems where the dependent variable is nominal with more than two values. Here, the dependent variable was the result of the diagnostic test (with “no virus detected” as the reference), and the patient’s age was the independent variable; the model was further adjusted for year, type of surveillance scheme, region, and gender. The distribution of the dependent variable was compared across age groups using patients aged 18–39 years (young adults) as the reference group. The regression coefficients are expressed as relative risk ratio (RRR), which should be interpreted as follows: a RRR equal to 1.43 for influenza B among patients aged 5–17 years means that their relative risk of testing positive for influenza B (instead of testing negative) is 43% higher than among young adults.</p>
