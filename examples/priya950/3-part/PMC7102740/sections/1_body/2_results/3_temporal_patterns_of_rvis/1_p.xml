<p id="par0100">The weekly number of specimens, and the PDR for influenza (any type) and RSV, which were the two most frequently detected respiratory viruses, are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> . There appeared to be interference between the epidemics caused by influenza and RSV, as the epidemics caused by those two viruses never peaked in the same period, RSV epidemics often started when the number of influenza cases had begun to decline, and vice versa. For instance, the peak in RSV-specific PDR occurring in early March 2012 was preceded and followed by influenza epidemics, that peaked in January and June of the same year, and were caused by A(H3N2) and B influenza virus, respectively.
