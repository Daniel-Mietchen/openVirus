<p id="par0115">Information of final outcome of respiratory infection was available for 84.9% of patients during 2011-2016. The overall CFR was 4.0%: this varied by causal agents (from 2.0% for RSV to 11.0% for the 2009 pandemic strain) and age group (from 1.6% among children aged 1–4 years to 13.9% among the elderly), while there were no differences by gender (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). In the multivariate logistic regression, the odds ratio of dying was significantly increased among patients who tested positive for A(H1N1)p (1.73, 95%CI 1.38–2.17, p &lt; 0.001), and significantly decreased for those testing positive for RSV (0.75, 95%CI 0.57–0.98, p = 0.033), compared to test-negative patients. Compared to young adults, the risk of dying was significantly reduced for children of any age, with the lowest OR for those aged 1–4 years (0.13, 95%CI 0.10–0.17, p &lt; 0.001), and significantly increased among the elderly (OR 1.58, 95%CI 1.29–1.93, p &lt; 0.001).
