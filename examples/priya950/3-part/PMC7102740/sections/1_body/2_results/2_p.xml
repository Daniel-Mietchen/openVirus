<p id="par0095">The overall PDR during the study period was 26.8%: influenza (14.3%) and RSV (9.5%) were the most frequent causes of RVI, while parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and hMPV were respectively detected in 1.8%, 0.6% and 0.5% of respiratory specimens (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The most frequently detected influenza virus (sub)type was A(H1N1)p (9.5%), followed by A(H3N2) (2.6%) and B (1.2%). Circulation of viruses varied by period: during 2009–11, the overall PDR was 31.3% and the 2009 influenza pandemic strain was found in 20.3% of specimens, while during 2011–16, the overall PDR was 24.8% and RSV accounted for nearly half of positive specimens (11.7%). Differences emerged also by region, as the most frequently detected virus was RSV in the Coast (11.0% of all specimens) and the pandemic strain in the Sierra (12.0%). In contrast, there were no differences in the overall and virus-specific PDR by gender.
