<p id="par0145">In conclusion, our findings showed that the epidemiology (including the temporal occurrence of epidemics), age distribution, and severity of respiratory infections in Ecuador vary greatly across viruses. Influenza was the most frequent cause of RVIs in 2011â€“16, and the A(H1N1)p subtype was that associated with the highest CFR. However, much of the burden of disease of respiratory infections is caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses (especially RSV), which represent a public health priority that needs to be addressed through adequate allocation of resources and coordinated research effort.</p>
