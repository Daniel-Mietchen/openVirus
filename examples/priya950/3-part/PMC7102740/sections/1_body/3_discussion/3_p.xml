<p id="par0130">Diversity in the age distribution of subjects infected with the different respiratory viruses can be explained by the variability between viruses in terms of factors that co-determine their transmission dynamics among humans, such as the reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), the rate of mutation accumulation, the duration of immunity, and the presence of cross-protection. RSV has two major antigenic group (A and B), but some antigenic variability may also occur within each group 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; its reproduction number is high (between 5 and 7) 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and immunity wanes over time 
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Because of these features, RSV has the highest incidence among young children but causes repeat infections throughout life and represents a health threat for the elderly as well 
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. RSV infection can also induce cross-protection against human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus, affecting the epidemiological dynamics of those pathogens 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Influenza viruses evolve via antigenic drift and (only for type A virus) antigenic shift, and novel variants are introduced constantly into the community. The A(H3N2) subtype has shown an accelerated mutation accumulation rate in recent years 
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, which may explain its higher incidence in the elderly compared to other (sub)types.
