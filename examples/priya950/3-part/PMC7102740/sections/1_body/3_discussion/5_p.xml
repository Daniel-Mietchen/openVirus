<p id="par0140">The main strength of this paper is the availability of a very large sample of subjects of any age who were tested for multiple respiratory viruses within a surveillance system covering an entire country. The study has some limitations as well. The surveillance system underwent a major transition during the period covered by the study, and patients with different syndromes were sampled in different sub-periods: although all analyses were stratified or adjusted to account for this change, some residual confounding cannot be ruled out. No information was available on patientsâ€™ vaccination status, underlying conditions, and use of antivirals and antibiotics. While influenza viruses were searched by RT-PCR throughout the study period, the identification of the other respiratory viruses was performed using direct immunofluorescence, which is a less sensitive technique
