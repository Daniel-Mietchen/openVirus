<p id="par0125">Viral interference between epidemics of influenza and RSV was observed previously 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This phenomenon seems to affect other respiratory viruses as well (like rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus and others

 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>), although it was not possible to verify this in the available data due to limited numbers. Viral interference is associated with prolonged shedding from the primary virus infection in ferret influenza models 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and hypothesized mechanisms include the production of interferon and other cytokines by infected cells 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. There was an evident, yet distinct seasonality for influenza (two main periods of activity, in December–January and June–August, consistently with previous reports 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>) and RSV (in March), and a less evident pattern for parainfluenza. Ecuador is a geographically and climatically diverse country, and meteorological parameters like humidity, temperature, and rainfall are known to affect virus survival and transmissibility 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Viral interference, diverse association with climatic parameters and other factors 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> may contribute to shape the seasonal cycles of RVIs in Ecuador, although their relative importance is difficult to establish.
