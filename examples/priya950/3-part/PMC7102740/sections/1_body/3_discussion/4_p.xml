<p id="par0135">The relationship between oneâ€™s age and the risk of death was J-shaped: infants were more likely to die than older children, and the CFR was highest among the elderly. The high incidence among infants and the greater severity among the elderly explain why these population subgroups suffer the largest RVI burden of disease 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. After adjusting by age, patients infected with A(H1N1)p had a 73% higher risk of death compared to test-negative patients. This is consistent with recent literature reports and contrasts the common belief that the most clinically severe influenza virus subtype is A(H3N2) 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In contrast, RSV patients had a significantly reduced risk of death compared to test-negative patients. Given the high raw CFR (4.8%) of test-negative patients, a possible explanation is that the latter could actually be infected with untested viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, bocaviruses, or respiratory enteroviruses), bacteria (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae), or other micro-organisms
