<p>The diagnosis of other respiratory viruses negative to influenza was only made in hospitalized and deceased patients. 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00085-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the classification of hospitalized patients at the time of the sample process, it is important to mention that the status of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection is not always updated by clinicians, thus, it is unknown if non-serious patients (not intubated with severe acute respiratory infection) evolved to severe patients (intubated with pneumonia) or if severe patients left the hospital for improvement or died.
