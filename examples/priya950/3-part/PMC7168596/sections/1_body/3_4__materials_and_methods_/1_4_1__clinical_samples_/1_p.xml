 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00085" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The samples were collected by the Influenza Network of Monitoring Health Units from all across the 32 states of the Mexican Republic. These were taken with the help of rayon or dacron swabs with plastic tips in the case of pharyngeal swabs and with flexible tips for nasopharyngeal swabs. In the case of biopsies, 2 cm
 <sup>2</sup> of lung parenchyma were collected from the most affected area. The samples were placed immediately in a viral transport medium and handled from 2 to 8 Â°C prior to transportation to the laboratory. Clinical and epidemiological information was captured on the influenza platform of the National Epidemiological Surveillance System.
