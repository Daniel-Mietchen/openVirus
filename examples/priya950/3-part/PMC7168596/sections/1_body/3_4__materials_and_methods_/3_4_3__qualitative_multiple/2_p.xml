<p>In total, 10 µL of the extract (RNA or DNA) of each sample was used to perform the multiplex RT-PCR. For each virus or internal control present in the sample, PCR amplifiers were obtained, with sizes ranging from 58 to 206 bp, not including the 24-segment tag. Next, 2 µL of the RT-PCR product is added to a hybridization/detection reaction containing a mixture of microspheres and the streptavidin/R-phycoerythrin conjugate. Each population of Luminex microspheres detects a highly specific viral target or analysis control by means of a specific anti-tag/tag hybridization. After incubation of the RT-PCR products with the microsphere mixture, the Luminex instrument classifies and reads the hybridization/detection reactions. A medium fluorescence intensity (MFI) signal is generated for each population of microspheres (viral target or analysis control). Fluorescence values are analyzed in order to determine the presence or absence of virus in each sample analyzed.</p>
