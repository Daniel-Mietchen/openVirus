<p>In Mexico, the circulation of HMPV was observed mainly in the northern and the central areas of the country where winter temperatures fluctuated between 5 °C and 7 °C, while in the areas of the southeast and the peninsula where the circulation of HMPV is lower, winter temperatures are higher (14 to 17 °C). The predominance of HMPV in the states with the lowest temperature in winter is consistent with a study that mentions that HMPV sees an increase in winter is due to the fact that the decrease in air temperature causes a decrease in nasal airway temperature (compromised cooling of the nasal airway), which leads to a poor defense against infection [
