<p>A study reported that viral co-infection rates in patients with HMPV range from 6% to 23% [

There are different studies that mention that HMPV and RSV, two common pathogens, overlap at the same time [

Another study reported that during the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 epidemic, influenza-like illness in children under 5 was caused by influenza viruses (25%), RSV (19%), HRV (17%), HMPV (9%) and PIV (7%). All these viruses circulated at the same time [

Another study stated that HRV is responsible for the majority of common colds in winter and occurs in co-infection with other respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, HMPV, PIV, CoV, BoV and AdV), and the proportion in viral respiratory co-infection was similar between HEV and HRV [
