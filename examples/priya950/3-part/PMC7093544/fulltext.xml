The hallmark of MAYV infection is a highly debilitating and chronic arthralgia. Although MAYV emergence is a potential threat, there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine. In this study, we developed a murine model of MAYV infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES). Intraplantar inoculation of a WT strain of MAYV into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses. Inoculation of MAYV/IRES in BALB/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses. Moreover, MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain. Thus, this study describes a novel model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate in host&#x02019;s protection from disease induced by a virulent MAYV strain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Live attenuated vaccines</kwd><kwd>Viral infection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004901</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation | Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Mayaro virus</italic> (MAYV) is an arbovirus of the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family, <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus. It is enzootic in South America and endemic in some rural areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Since its discovery in 1954 at Mayaro county, Trinidad and Tobago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, MAYV has been reported in different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In Brazil the first MAYV outbreak was reported in 1957, near the River Guama, in Par&#x000e1; State<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, most of the clinical and epidemiologic knowledge on this virus came from an outbreak that occurred in Belterra, Par&#x000e1; State, in 1978<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Since then, MAYV circulation has been reported in several Brazil States, mainly in the Central-West and North regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> including Par&#x000e1;, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Amazonas and Goi&#x000e1;s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although it was initially restricted to forest areas, mainly in the Amazon region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, there is growing evidence of MAYV spread to other regions of Brazil, making it an emerging new threat along with other endemic arboviruses such as dengue, zika and chikungunya viruses.</p><p id="Par3">Canopy-dwelling mosquitoes of the <italic>Haemagogus</italic> genus transmit MAYV. Despite generally being confined to forested areas, it has been shown that there is potential for urbanization and consequently generation of large epidemics. A similar phenomenon was recently reported for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a genetically and antigenically related arthritogenic alphavirus that acquired mutations that allowed it to be transmitted efficiently by additional anthropophillic <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that MAYV can also be transmitted by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Since many people work or live in forested areas and due to the ability of MAYV to be transmitted by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, higher number of Mayaro fever (MF) cases could occur in the coming years. For example, there are rising concerns about a broader circulation of this virus to other countries of Central America and Caribe. For example, MAYV was identified in 2010 as the etiologic agent of a febrile illness with arthralgic manifestations that occurred in 77 individuals, in which 19 cases were confirmed as seropositive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Another study conducted by Terzian and colleagues (2015) reported the complete genome sequence of a MAYV isolated from a symptomatic patient in Acre/Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Authors have shown that MAYV belongs to the genotype D which is very close to the Bolivian strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Finally, a MAYV case in Haiti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> was particularly important because this country is a central route of entrance of this arbovirus in the southern regions of the USA, as previously observed for chikungunya and zika virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">MF is a dengue-like febrile syndrome. The incubation phase lasts for 7 to 12 days, followed by onset of high fever, frontal headache, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, articular edema (mainly in wrist, knees and ankles), retro-orbital pain, malaise, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea among others. Arthralgia and arthritis are common hallmarks of MF, which is painful and very debilitating, sometimes lasting for weeks-to-years after the clearance of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The similarity of the clinical presentation of MF with other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, along with the absence of good diagnostic kits in areas of co-circulation of multiple arboviruses suggest that the precise number of cases is probably underestimated and the incidence of MAYV infection could be much higher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, e.g., it has been suggested that about 41.5% of riverside inhabitants have antibodies against MAYV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Another study estimated that about 1% of all dengue-like diseases in northern Latin America could be due to MAYV infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The previous studies suggest that circulation of MAYV is probably broader and the number of cases higher than currently reported. Nevertheless, there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for MF and the development of a vaccine is essential to prevent future outbreaks of this potentially important human disease.</p><p id="Par5">Here, using a wild-type (WT) strain of MAYV, we developed a model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice that emulates several aspects of the human disease, including arthritis and hypernociception. In parallel, we evaluated the response profile of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> by conducting an in-depth characterization of clinical, virological and immunological parameters in comparison to the WT strain. Finally, we investigated the protective role of MAYV/IRES vaccination in both immunocompetent and A129<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (interferon type I receptor-defective) mice followed by a challenge with the virulent wt MAYV strain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of MAYV disease in immunocompetent mice</title><p id="Par6">Experiments were conducted in 6-week-old immunocompetent (BALB/c strain) mice inoculated with 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> PFU/50 &#x003bc;L of MAYV via the s.c. intraplantar (i.pl.) route and several analyses were performed to assess kinetics of infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

The number of cells peaked at day 7, when neutrophils partially replaced muscle layer inducing loss of muscle architecture. Superficial bone resorption or synovial alterations in joints were not prominent. The inflammatory scenario declined from day 7 on, when mononuclear cells were seen more frequently.

We evaluated the production of inflammatory mediators during the course of MAYV infection in BALB/c mice. MAYV infection induced acute production of several pro-inflammatory molecules in the spleen such as IL1-&#x003b2; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and IL-6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) from days 1 to 7 of infection; IFN-&#x003b3; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) from days 1 to 5 and finally, TNF-&#x003b1; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) at the early time-points of 1 and 3 days post-MAYV inoculation. Indeed, the growth factor VEGF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), the cytokine IL-17 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>) were also elevated from days 1 to 5 post-MAYV inoculation. Finally, several chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment were augmented upon MAYV-inoculation: CXCL-1, involved on the recruitment of neutrophils (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>), CCL2 of monocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>); CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 associated with recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells and activated T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j&#x02013;l</xref>). Most of those chemoattractants were elevated from day 1 to day 5 except for CCL3, which was augmented only from days 1 to 3 and CCL5 that increased at day 3 and lasted until day 7.

This possibility underscores the need for new ways of preventing or treating MAYV infection, including the need for an approved vaccine. Knowledge about MAYV-induced immunopathology frequently derives from studies with other alphaviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, we described a novel model of MAYV infection in adult immunocompetent mice, which emulates the major manifestations of MAYV infection in humans. The major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows: (a) MAYV inoculation into young adult immunocompetent mice induced persistent articular hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines; and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses; (b) Inoculation of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES) in adult BALB/c mice induced stronger cellular and neutralizing antibody responses; (c) MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and A129<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain.</p><p id="Par26">The age of animals in murine models of alphavirus infections has been considered a determinant factor in the susceptibility and severity of the disease.

Of note, Figueiredo and colleagues (2019)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> have shown that MAYV replication, restriction and induction of muscular inflammation are dependent on age, type-I Interferon response, and adaptive immunity. Indeed, MAYV infection of young (25&#x02013;21-day-old) SV129 and BALB/c mice successfully caused arthritis and myositis, common hallmarks of MF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. As for other arboviruses, such as Zika and Dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, resistance of adult mice to alphavirus infection is especially due to innate immune components such as type I interferons, which quickly provide an antiviral state of non-infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Accordingly, infection of type I interferon receptor-deficient mice (A129<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) with CHIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, as well as infection of adult A129<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or recombination activation gene-1 deficient mice (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) with MAYV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> provides a model that reproduces many of the clinical manifestations of human MF disease. Recently, MAYV infection of 3-4-week-old mice resulted in non-lethal models that emulated several clinical signs of MF in immunocompetent young-adult mice, such as footpad swelling, viremia and hepatic injury, although the arthritogenic effects of the virus were not investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Adding to previous studies, in the present work MAYV infection of 5-6-week-old immunocompetent BALB/c mice caused arthritis and hypernociception, major manifestations of the disease in humans. Although infection of immunocompetent mice with MAYV did not reproduce symptoms to the same extent as in type I interferon receptor-deficient mice, it did induce most symptoms in the setting of a functional immune system, suggesting it may be a useful model for understanding the immunological response against MAYV. Indeed, using this model, we have demonstrated that the inoculation of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES) in young BALB/c mice induced stronger cellular and specific humoral responses and protected from the clinical and laboratory changes induced by the WT infection.</p><p id="Par27">Chronic joint inflammation and pain are the hallmarks of disease in patients with alphavirus infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

The sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors leads to a state of hyperalgesia and/or allodynia, in humans, better described as hypernociception in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Articular hypernociception is usually indirectly evaluated in mice by mechanical and thermal tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Using these methods, we have shown significant hypernociception in response to mechanical stimulation upon Dengue virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> have demonstrated that infection of mice with wild type strains of MAYV induces increased mechanical hypernociception up to 21 days of virus inoculation. Interestingly, MAYV-IRES vaccination of mice was able to prevent the hypernociception induced by WT MAYV challenge.</p><p id="Par28">Histopathological lesions, such as necrosis of cartilage and bone loss have been identified in experimental models of alphavirus infections such as CHIKV and RRV viruses. In patients with CHIKV, imaging studies have revealed the presence of tenosynovitis, synovial thickening, periostitis, periosteum proliferation and bone erosion. These clinical findings show that the acute disease may progress to chronic erosive arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we have demonstrated that MAYV infection also induces histopathological alterations in the ankle joints of mice, as characterized by loss of muscle and bone architecture. Tissues returned to basal conditions on day 21-post infection when hypernociception was not more evident. However, no evident histopathological alterations were detected in distal articulations such as knee joint, probably due to the age of mice and presence of active immune system in these mice, as compared to the other models in literature.</p><p id="Par29">Evaluation of the profile of Inflammatory mediators in the spleen from wt MAYV infected mice revealed that MAYV induced a strong inflammatory response in the early stages of infection, characterized by production of several cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, INF-&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-17 and well the chemokines CXCL-1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.

As in other alphavirus infections, MF causes persistent joint pain and is often disabling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Joint pain is consequence of the action of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as tissue damage, which sensitize nociceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.

The live-attenuated MAYV/IRES strain did not replicate to comparable titers as the WT strain in adult BALB/c and A129<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; however, the vaccine candidate elicited a robust and specific antibody responses, similar to that observed with the wt MAYV strain. The vaccine analyzed in this work showed to confer protection against MAYV challenge and to be safe in an adult immunocompetent model. When compared to the WT, the MAYV/IRES strain induced lower levels of all the cytokines and chemokines analyzed showing lower inflammatory potential. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> analysis with splenocytes confirmed the ability of the MAYV/IRES vaccine to induce strong and long lasting cellular and humoral responses against wt MAYV strain. Accordingly, vaccinated mice challenged with wt MAYV showed reduced hypernociception, lower viral loads and decreased inflammatory markers in comparison to challenged non-vaccinated animals. MAYV/IRES vaccination also elicited augmented cellular responses, characterized by elevation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream. There was reduced level of MPO and increased NAG levels on the inoculated hind paw of vaccinated group as compared to wt MAYV-infected na&#x000ef;ve mice. Plaque assay revealed a massive reduction of infectious virus recovery from the hind paw and a complete prevention of virus spread to the PLN, quadriceps muscle, spleen and serum. Indeed, histopathological analysis from the hind paw of MAYV/IRES-vaccinated mice revealed maintenance of tissue architecture, in contrast to the disruption caused by WT-MAYV injection. Finally, vaccinated mice showed lower levels of the cytokines IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, as well as, the chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.

Finally, flow cytometric analyses of spleen leukocytes showed more robust immune response in MAYV/IRES immunized mice when compared to the WT strain. Immunization with MAYV/IRES induced splenic DC accumulation and activation, accompanied by a greater activation of splenic macrophages. MAYV/IRES also augmented T CD8<sup>+</sup> immune response, as indicated by the higher frequency of cells TCD8<sup>+</sup> cells expressing CD44. Indeed, we observed higher production of IL-17 by CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells in the spleens of in MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice.
