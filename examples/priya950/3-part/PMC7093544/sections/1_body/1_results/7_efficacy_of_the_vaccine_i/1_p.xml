<p id="Par24">Next experiments evaluated whether the vaccine would induce antibodies and protective immunity in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Anti-MAYV humoral immune responses were evaluated at days 7 and 14 after MAYV/IRES inoculation. As seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>, all mice infected with the control strain were dead by day 5. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8l</xref> shows elevated levels of anti-MAYV-specific IgM on days 7 and 14 after MAYV/IRES inoculation in comparison to naïve mice. A slight elevation of anti-MAYV IgG levels was observed on day 7 followed by a 10 times increase of titers at day 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8l</xref>). Once the MAYV/IRES vaccine induced anti-MAYV specific antibodies, we challenged MAYV/IRES survivors with a lethal inoculum of wt MAYV strain (2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU). Vaccinated mice were fully protected against the lethal challenge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8m–o</xref>). We observed absence of hind paw edema (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8m</xref>), body weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8n</xref>) or mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8o</xref>) upon wt MAYV inoculation in vaccinated mice.
