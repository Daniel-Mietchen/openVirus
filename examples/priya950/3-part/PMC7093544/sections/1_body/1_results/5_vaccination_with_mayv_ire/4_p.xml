<p id="Par18">The protection afforded by vaccination with MAYV/IRES was accompanied by a greater immune response in the spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a–l</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice showed higher accumulation and activation of splenic DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref>), showing higher expression of the activation markers CD11b, CD86, as well increased TNF-α production. MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice also showed higher activation of splenic macrophages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e–g</xref>), as indicated by the higher expression of CD86 and TNF-α in comparison to wt MAYV vaccinated mice. Greater activation of T lymphocytes was also detected following MAYV/IRES immunization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h–l</xref>). Splenic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes showed increased expression of the activation marker CD44 in MAYV/IRES versus wt MAYV vaccinated mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h–i</xref>). Indeed, compared with wt MAYV vaccinated mice, MAYV/IRES induced IL-17A-producing T CD4
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in the spleen, with no change in the frequency of CD25
 <sup>+</sup>Foxp3
 <sup>+</sup> Treg cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7k,l</xref>). Taken together, our results show that vaccination of immunocompetent mice with the live attenuated MAYV/IRES virus was safe and induced full protection against a virulent WT-MAYV strain challenge.
