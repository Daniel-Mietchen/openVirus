<p id="Par15">Once we demonstrated that MAYV/IRES inoculation to BALB/c mice resulted in long-lasting cellular and humoral responses, we decided to evaluate if vaccination of BALB/c could eliminate or minimize MAYV-induced disease. For that, 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL of MAYV/IRES attenuated virus via the s.c. intraplantar (ipl) route and 28 days later, when virus was cleared, and elevated neutralizing IgG levels were detected in serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref> and Sup. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), they were challenged with the wt MAYV strain at same inoculum (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL ipl). Analyses were performed three days after wt MAYV virus inoculation. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>. Results showed that vaccination prevented the occurrence of most clinical outcomes associated with MAYV disease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Specifically, while wt MAYV inoculation to naïve mice induced articular hypernociception, MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice were completed protected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). As shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, MAYV/IRES administration to naïve mice induced a mild increase in articular hypernociception as compared to wt MAYV. As a control for this experiment, the dashed line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> represents naïve mice that only received MAYV/IRES and were analyzed 3 days later. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> shows that MAYV/IRES vaccination elicited increased cellular responses, characterized by elevation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream. Accordingly, reduced MPO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) and increased NAG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) levels on the inoculated hind paw were detected on vaccinated group as compared to wt MAYV–infected naïve mice.
