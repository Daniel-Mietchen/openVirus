 </sup>. Infection of BALB/c mice with WT MAYV induced acute production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d,f</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–d,f</xref>), growth factors (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), anti-inflammatory cytokines (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) and several chemokines (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h–l</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h–l</xref>). We also quantified the levels of inflammatory mediators after the inoculation of the attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine. In general, MAYV/IRES inoculation induced milder inflammatory response in comparison to wt MAYV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–l</xref>). More specifically, IL-1β levels were reduced at day 3 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation and augmented at day 5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). IL-6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), VEGF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), IL-17 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>) and IL-10 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) was reduced only at day 1 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation compared to WT MAYV strain while IFN-γ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) and TNF-α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) were diminished at days 1 and 3 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation. Finally, no differences were found between infected groups on CXCL-1 levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>); however, CCL2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>), CCL3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>), CCL4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>) and CCL5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4l</xref>) were reduced from day 1 to day 7 in the MAYV/IRES-inoculated group. Therefore, our results demonstrate that, in addition to the increased cellular and humoral responses observed on the live attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine group, there was an important reduction in levels of systemic inflammatory mediators, suggesting the generation of a more controlled and effective immune response.
