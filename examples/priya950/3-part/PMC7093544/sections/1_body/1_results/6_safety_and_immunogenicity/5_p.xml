<p id="Par23">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h–k</xref> shows that inoculation of 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of wt MAYV in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> induced increased total and differential leucocyte counts, especially of neutrophils and lymphocytes in blood (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h</xref>), recovery of elevated viral loads in several organs such as paw, popliteal lymph node, muscle, spleen, liver, brain and serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8i</xref>), massive hind paw swelling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8j</xref>) and acute liver injury assessed indirectly by elevated ALT transaminase levels in serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8k</xref>). Therefore, inoculation of the same virus inoculum of the MAYV/IRES vaccine strain was associated with lower viral loads in tissues, decreased inflammation and systemic markers of disease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h–k</xref>).
