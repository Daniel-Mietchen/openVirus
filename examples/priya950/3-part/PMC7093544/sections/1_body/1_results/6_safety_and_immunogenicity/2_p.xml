<p id="Par20">Initial experiments evaluated the safety of the vaccine versus the WT strain in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Eight-week-old A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were inoculated with 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> or 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> or 2 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/50 μL of either MAYV/IRES or wt MAYV strains and lethality rates and body weight analyzed every 24 hours until day 14 after inoculation. Results show that at the highest inoculum both wt MAYV and IRES-inoculated mice succumbed to infection; however, lethality was significantly delayed with the MAYV/IRES strain in comparison to the virulent WT strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). There was no weight loss in any of the groups as animals succumbed very quickly to infection (Fig.
