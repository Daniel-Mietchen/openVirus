<p id="Par21">Infection of mice with a 10-times lower inoculum (2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU) resulted in death of all mice inoculated with the wt MAYV strain by day 5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). In contrast, 80% of animals inoculated with MAYV/IRES survived the inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Weight loss was not observed in mice infected with the WT strain; these mice died by day 5. However, in mice inoculated MAYV/IRES, there was progressive body weight loss starting at day 6 and lasting until day 10 after inoculation. At day 14, the mean body mass from the MAYV/IRES inoculated group was similar to non-infected animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>).
