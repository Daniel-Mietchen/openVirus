 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows that neutralizing antibodies were induced by MAYV/IRES inoculation, reaching satisfactory titers 5 days after inoculation. To determine if this response could cross-react with other alphaviruses, a pool of sera from five animals inoculated with MAYV/IRES strain and collected at each time point was tested against CHIKV (Sup. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values revealed that the MAYV/IRES vaccine is effective in inducing humoral immunity against MAYV but not CHIKV.
