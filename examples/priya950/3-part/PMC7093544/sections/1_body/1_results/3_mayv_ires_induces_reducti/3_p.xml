<p id="Par12">Inoculation of MAYV/IRES did not induce any plantar edema (data not shown). Neutrophils but not macrophages levels on mice hind paw, assessed by MPO and NAG activity, respectively, were less in MAYV/IRES mice than in mice infected with the WT virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j,k</xref>). Despite the neutrophil reduction at day 3 after infection, NAG levels were greater in MAYV/IRES mice than in wt MAYV infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>). Finally, histopathological analysis of mice hind limbs revealed greater cellular infiltrated, characterized mostly by neutrophils, on the hind paw of MAYV/IRES at day one after virus inoculation, followed by a massive decrease of this infiltrate in the next time points when compared to wt MAYV-inoculated controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref>). No evident histopathological changes were detected in knee joints of either wt MAYV or MAYV/IRES groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the administration of the attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine was safe to the immunocompetent host, induced significantly less hypernociception and was associated with the induction of stronger local cellular and systemic humoral responses.
