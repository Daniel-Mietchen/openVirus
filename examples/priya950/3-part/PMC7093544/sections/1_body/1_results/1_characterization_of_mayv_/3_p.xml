<p id="Par8">Plantar edema was observed in MAYV-infected mice at days 3 and 5 p.i (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). Neutrophil influx, as determined by MPO activity, was elevated from day 1 until day 7 after MAYV inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>), while macrophages levels, measured by NAG activity, started to increase at day 3 and remained high until day 7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>). At days 14 and 21, both MPO and NAG levels, returned to baseline values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k,l</xref>). Finally, histopathological analysis revealed that MAYV infection induced a time-dependent inflammatory reaction in the hind paws of mice. From days 1 to 3 post-infection, a discrete PMN infiltrate was observed diffusely within muscle fibers beneath the skin. The number of cells peaked at day 7, when neutrophils partially replaced muscle layer inducing loss of muscle architecture. Superficial bone resorption or synovial alterations in joints were not prominent. The inflammatory scenario declined from day 7 on, when mononuclear cells were seen more frequently. Tissues returned to basal conditions on day 21-post infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1m</xref>). No evident histopathological alterations were detected in knee joint samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Overall, our results demonstrate that MAYV inoculation into immunocompetent mice results in a self-limited disease similar to MF seen in humans.
