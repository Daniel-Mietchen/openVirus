<p id="Par3">Canopy-dwelling mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> genus transmit MAYV. Despite generally being confined to forested areas, it has been shown that there is potential for urbanization and consequently generation of large epidemics. A similar phenomenon was recently reported for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a genetically and antigenically related arthritogenic alphavirus that acquired mutations that allowed it to be transmitted efficiently by additional anthropophillic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes

 </sup>. Since many people work or live in forested areas and due to the ability of MAYV to be transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, higher number of Mayaro fever (MF) cases could occur in the coming years. For example, there are rising concerns about a broader circulation of this virus to other countries of Central America and Caribe. For example, MAYV was identified in 2010 as the etiologic agent of a febrile illness with arthralgic manifestations that occurred in 77 individuals, in which 19 cases were confirmed as seropositive

 </sup>. Authors have shown that MAYV belongs to the genotype D which is very close to the Bolivian strains

 </sup> was particularly important because this country is a central route of entrance of this arbovirus in the southern regions of the USA, as previously observed for chikungunya and zika virus
