 <sub>50</sub> was used to quantify the circulating levels of anti-MAYV neutralizing antibodies or to assess possible cross-reaction with CHIKV. Briefly, 24 well plates were seeded at a density of 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero cells/mL in each well. All serum samples were inactivated for 30 minutes at 56 °C before use. PRNT assays were performed as follows: serial dilutions of sera in a pool or from different days were mixed with constant quantities of wt MAYV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL) or with CHIKV strains (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL) and then incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium on each well was discarded and confluent cell monolayers were inoculated with 50 μL of the immunocomplex mixture. Then, the plate was incubated for another hour with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. After that, the virus-serum inoculum was discarded, and the cell monolayers were overlaid with 1 mL of 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) diluted in MEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Plates were then incubated for 4 days in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. CMC medium was discarded by inversion and cells were fixed in 0.2% formalin for 1 h at rt. Cell monolayers were then stained with crystal violet solution (1% w/v) for 20 min. Neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest initial serum dilution inhibiting at least 50% of plaque formation compared with the virus control titration.
