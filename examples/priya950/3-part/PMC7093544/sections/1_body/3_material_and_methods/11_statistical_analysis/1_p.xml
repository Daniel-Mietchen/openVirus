<p id="Par44">Results are shown as mean ± standard error (SEM), except viral loads that were expressed as median. Body weight is converted to a percentage and loss/weight gain calculated by subtracting the basal levels (obtained prior to infection) compared to control and infected mice. Differences were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc analysis. All analyzes were performed using the GraphPad PRISM software 6.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). Results with a p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
