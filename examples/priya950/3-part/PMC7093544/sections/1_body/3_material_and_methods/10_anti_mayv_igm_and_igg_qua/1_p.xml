 </sup>. Briefly, the same MAYV strain used in infections was UV-inactivated (60’) and diluted in 0.01 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) in a concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU per well of microtiter plates and incubated overnight. Plates were washed three times and blocked with bovine serum albumin 1% for 2 h and subsequently washed. Then, four dilutions of each serum sample from 1:50 to 1:6,250 were plated in duplicates and incubated for 3 h. After another wash step, plates were incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgM (Southern Biotech). Toward, ortho-phenylenediamine was used as a substrate, and the reaction was stopped with 1 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm. Samples of MAYV-infected mice were considered positive in the first dilution in which mock samples were negative and were expressed as optical densities (O.D.).
