<p id="Par35">Lethality rates and body weight were analyzed every 24â€‰hours. Disease signs (presence of ruffled fur, partial or complete hindlimb weakness or paralysis and loss in body weight) were monitored daily. Moribund mice with 20% or more body weight loss were euthanized. For hematological analysis, blood was obtained from the cava vein in heparin-containing syringes at the indicated times after infection. Total leucocytes count was obtained by using a Neubauer chamber. Leukocyte (lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils) differential counts were subsequently quantified microscopically from blood smears of each mouse.</p>
