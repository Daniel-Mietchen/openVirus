<p id="Par33">This study was carried out in strict accordance with the ethical and animal experiments regulations of the Brazilian Government (Law 11794/2008). The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee on Animal Ethics of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CEUA/UFMG, Permit Protocol Number 160/2018) and Committee of Animal Experiments of the FAMERP (process #02078812.8.0000.5415). All surgeries were performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Studies with MAYV were conducted under biosafety level 2 (BL2) containment at Immunopharmacology Laboratory from Instituto de Ciências Biológicas (ICB) at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG). Briefly, male 6-week-old (18–20 g) immunocompetent BALB/c mice provided from Biotério Central at UFMG were used. In some experiments, 8-week old male A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> SV129 strain of mice that are deficient to type I Interferon (α/β) receptors obtained from Biotério de Matrizes da Universidade de São Paulo (USP) were utilized. Mice were kept at 23 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle and food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Infection was performed by subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL/paw into the plantar surface of the right hind paw with of the wt MAYV group or vaccine (MAYV/IRES group) strains of MAYV. Groups of 5–6 mice were euthanized at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection (d.p.i.) for serum, spleen, popliteal lymph node, paw and joints analysis. Negative control group was inoculated with 50 μL of cell culture supernatant by s.c. intraplantar inoculation and euthanized at day 21.p.i.
