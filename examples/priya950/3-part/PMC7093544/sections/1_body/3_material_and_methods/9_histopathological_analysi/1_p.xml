<p id="Par42">After euthanasia, mice hind paws and knees were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 7.2). Samples were processed for routine histology, sectioned (5 Î¼m), and stained with Hematoxilyn and Eosin. The hind paws were evaluated using a semi quantitative histopathological score adapted from a previous study

 </sup>. The maximum score grade was 7: inflammatory infiltrate [from 0 (absent) to 4 (severe)], and loss of muscle architecture [from 0 (absent) to 3 (intense)]. The knee score evaluated the inflammatory infiltrate [0 (absent) to 4 (severe)], synovial hyperplasia [0 (absent) to 3 (extensive)] and bone resorption [0 (absent) to 2 (extensive)], being the maximum score 9, following the criteria described previously
