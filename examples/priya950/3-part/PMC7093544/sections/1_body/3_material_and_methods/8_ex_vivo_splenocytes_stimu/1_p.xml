<p id="Par41">Splenocytes from all experimental groups (MOCK, wt MAYV and MAYV/IRES) were isolated at day 28 p.i. Briefly, spleens were macerated using a pestle and a mortar with RPMI medium containing antibiotics. Cells were then isolated, passed through a 0.70 μm filter and conditioned on ice. Cell solution was then centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × 
 <italic>g</italic>. Then, pellet was incubated with lysis buffer ACK (0.15 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl, 1 mM KHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, and 0.1 mM EDTA) for 5 min, it was added PBS to a final volume of 30 mL and the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × 
 <italic>g</italic>. The cells were resuspended in RPMI (10% FBS, antibiotics). 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well were then cultivated in 96 well plates. Splenocytes cultures were then stimulated with 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> heat-inactivated wt MAYV and MAYV/IRES virus (MOI of 1). Some wells received a polyclonal stimulus - ConA at concentration of 2 μg/mL as positive control, or only RPMI media (negative control). For flow cytometry, unstimulated splenocytes were seeded in 96-well plate and incubated with brefeldin A (BD GolgiPlug) for 5 hours, at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> before antibody staining. Cells were spun to remove the supernatant and surface stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD19, -CD11c, -F4/80, -CD11b, -CD25 and -CD86 (Biolegend). Next, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized for 20 minutes with permeabilization buffer (BD, Perm/Wash Buffer) followed by incubation with antibodies against intracellular TNF-α, IL-17 and Foxp3. Cells were analyzed in a FACS Canto II cytometer. Gating strategy is illustrated in Supplemental Fig.
