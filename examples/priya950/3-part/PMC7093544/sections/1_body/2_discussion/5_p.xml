<p id="Par29">Evaluation of the profile of Inflammatory mediators in the spleen from wt MAYV infected mice revealed that MAYV induced a strong inflammatory response in the early stages of infection, characterized by production of several cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, INF-γ, IL-1β and IL-17 and well the chemokines CXCL-1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5. These mediators have also been observed in other alphaviral models of RRV and CHIKV, and more recently in patients with Mayaro Fever

 </sup>. As in other alphavirus infections, MF causes persistent joint pain and is often disabling

 </sup>. Joint pain is consequence of the action of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as tissue damage, which sensitize nociceptors

 </sup>. Accordingly, in patients with MAYV these mediators are also elevated and were associated with presence of chronic arthralgia
