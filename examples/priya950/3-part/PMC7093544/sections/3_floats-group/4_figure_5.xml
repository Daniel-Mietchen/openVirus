  <p>Vaccination with MAYV/IRES strain protects mice from wild-type MAYV challenge. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated or not with MAYV/IRES (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.) and 28 days later mice were challenged with 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL of WT-MAYV at the same hind paw. Three days later, several analyses were performed. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Experimental design. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Mechanical hypernociception was assessed at day 3 after virus inoculation, as described in figure legend 1. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Differential cell counts on blood were represented as number of leukocytes, mononuclear cells and neutrophils normalized on % of total cells counts. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Neutrophil influx to the hind foot was measured indirectly by evaluation of MPO activity. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Macrophage influx to the hind foot was measured indirectly by analysis of NAG activity. (
   <bold>f–j</bold>) Plaque assay analysis of hind paw (
   <bold>f</bold>) PLN (
   <bold>g</bold>), quadriceps muscle (
   <bold>h</bold>), spleen (
   <bold>i</bold>) and serum (
   <bold>j</bold>). Results are shown as the log of PFU per/g of tissue or PFU per/mL of serum. (
   <bold>k</bold>) Shows semi-quantitative analysis (histopathological score) after Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining of hind paw sections of control and MAYV-infected mice three days after wt MAYV inoculation. Representative pictures from hind paw sections. MOCK- not-infected. Results were expressed as median (
   <bold>f–j</bold>) or mean ± SEM (
   <bold>a–e</bold> and 
   <bold>k</bold>) and are representative of two experiments. Original magnification: 200×. Scale bar: 100 μm. * for p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected mice (MOCK). 
   <sup>#</sup>p &lt; 0.05 when compared to naïve wt MAYV infected group, as assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test. Dashed lines are representative of naïve mice, which received MAYV/IRES.
