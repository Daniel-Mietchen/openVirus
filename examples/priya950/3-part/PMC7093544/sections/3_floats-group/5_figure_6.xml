  <p>Vaccination with MAYV/IRES strain attenuates production of inflammatory mediators after wt MAYV challenge. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated or not with MAYV/IRES (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.) and 28 days later mice were challenged with wt MAYV (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.) at the same hind paw. Three days later, protein levels of (
   <bold>a</bold>) IL1-β; (
   <bold>b</bold>) IL-6; (
   <bold>c</bold>) IFN-γ; (
   <bold>d</bold>) TNF-α; (
   <bold>e</bold>) CCL2; (
   <bold>f</bold>) CCL3; (
   <bold>g</bold>) CCL4 and (
   <bold>h</bold>) CCL5 were analyzed in the spleen. Results are expressed as pg/100 mg of spleen. Data is representative of two experiments expressed as mean ± SEM. MOCK- not-infected. 
   <sup>*</sup>for p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected mice (MOCK). 
   <sup>#</sup> for p &lt; 0.05 when compared to naïve wt MAYV infected group, as assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test. Dashed lines indicate naïve mice that received MAYV/IRES.
