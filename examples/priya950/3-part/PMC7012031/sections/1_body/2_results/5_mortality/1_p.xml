<p>Calculating the case fatality rate (CFR) is dependent on estimates of the denominator. Using the denominator of symptomatic (suspected cases) of 113 588, suggests an overall CFR of 0.54% (95%CI: 0.50-0.58) and ranged between 0.12% to 0.90% over the seven years. Confirmed H1N1 CFR was (608/17 094) 3.56% (95%CI: 3.29-3.85), ranging between 2.50% in 2015 to 9.48% in 2013 (
