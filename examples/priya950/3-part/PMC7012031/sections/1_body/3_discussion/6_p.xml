<p>The most affected age group was age 30–59 years, predominantly in all years, which may be because this age group is the most active in society and might be more exposed to infection, followed by the age group 15–29 years. The least affected were children and adolescents, but they still constitute a large proportion of cases (around 40%). All age groups were affected, and the proportions among age groups showed a similar pattern by time of year between clinical and confirmed cases. The occurrence of cases among all age groups indicates a community spread of infection following the 2009 pandemic. Over time, there was an observed gradual but constant decrease in younger age proportions and age shift towards elders.</p>
