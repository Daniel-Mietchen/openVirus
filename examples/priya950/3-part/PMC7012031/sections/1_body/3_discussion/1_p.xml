<p>This report of influenza surveillance was the first, and the only one, to be instituted in response to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in Saudi Arabia; previous studies only concentrated on the few hundred cases first discovered before establishing the surveillance system; one study reported district level data.
