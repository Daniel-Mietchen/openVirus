<p>In addition to horizontal circulation between birds and mosquitoes, WNV maintenance also has been described in the absence of a mosquito vector. There have been multiple reports of WNV viral RNA detected in carcasses and feces in crow roosts during the winter when mosquitoes are unlikely contributors to transmission, although the transmission mechanism was not specifically elucidated [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similar occurrences of WNV disease during the winter have been seen in Bald Eagles, where feeding on the carcasses of infected Eared Grebes was considered the most likely source of infection [
 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Experimentally, non-vector direct transmission also has been demonstrated in geese, with oral and cloacal shedding serving as the most likely sources of viral transmission [
 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Chronic infection may also contribute to winter transmission as infectious virus has been isolated from house sparrows up to 43 days post inoculation [
 <xref rid="B43-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Overwintering of WNV may also occur by vertical transmission from adult female mosquitoes to their progeny, although this process is highly inefficient [

In addition to the maintenance of WNV in nature via non-vector mechanisms, WNV disease has also been reported in humans potentially as a result of non-vector transmission including percutaneous exposure, transplacental transmission, breast milk consumption, blood transfusion and organ transplant [
