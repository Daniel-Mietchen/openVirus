<p>In addition to birds, humans and horses, WNV infects and causes disease in an extraordinary array of vertebrate species (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00048-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In many of these, clinical disease is solely neurological and thus similar to what is seen in humans and horses. This is observed in numerous single-animal case reports including those of an alpaca, harbor seal, reindeer, Barbary macaque, white-tailed deer and polar bear [

 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Histologically, these animals had a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis which frequently and preferentially affected the gray matter of the brainstem and spinal cord. Similarly, convulsions and ataxia in multiple WNV-infected sheep were seen in association with lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis and myelitis characterized by perivascular cuffing and necrosis [
