<p>During the introduction of West Nile virus to the United States, mortality observed in the Bronx zoo and surrounding areas showed that avian species across multiple orders could be affected and included common crows, a fish crow, black-billed magpies, a black-crowned night heron, laughing gulls, a mallard duck, Himalayan Impeyan pheasants, a Blythâ€™s tragopan, Chilean flamingos, guanay cormorants, bronze-winged ducks, a northern bald eagle and a snowy owl [

Interestingly, high levels of mortality do not always correlate with histopathologic signs and this may be a measure of acute infection resulting in death and occurring in such rapid fashion that lesions do not develop histologically [
