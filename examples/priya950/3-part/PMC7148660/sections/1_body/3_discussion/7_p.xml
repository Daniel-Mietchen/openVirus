<p id="p0125">This study has five main limitations. First, RSV-related ALRIs were defined from the data provided by the virology laboratory. Because RSV may not have been screened in a significant proportion of patients with ALRI, this study may underestimate the real burden of RSV infection in our center. This underestimation may be more pronounced in patients with mild symptoms (especially those with isolated upper respiratory tract infection), where RSV may have been less frequently screened than in case of severe infection. However this potential limitation does not hamper evaluation of the efficacy of our infection control strategy, which mainly aims to prevent severe infections. Second, although the ALRIs were primarily attributed to RSV by clinicians in all patients described in this study, we cannot exclude that viral and bacterial co-infections may have influenced their clinical outcome. This confounding factor cannot be excluded in our non interventional study because all other respiratory pathogens may not have been screened for. In order to evaluate the impact of this potential bias, further prospective studies are needed with systematic screening of all potential viral and bacterial co-infections. Third, this observational study does not allow the effectiveness of individual components of our multi-component control measures to be assessed. Similar observation was done by French CE 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in the recent review of published and unpublished literature about the effectiveness of control measures to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission events [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, because similar preventive strategies were applied in all units of our center, this limitation does not hamper the comparison of their efficacy on pediatric versus adult wards. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate to what extent the compliance with each measure of our infection control bundle differs between adult and paediatric populations. Because nosocomial infections may be transmitted by healthcare personnel, visitors and patients, it would be interesting to differentiate the compliance to measures targeting each of these populations in such further studies. Fourth, as previously discussed, the high prevalence of CCC among patients followed in our tertiary hospital hampers extrapolation of our results to other French hospitals. The higher prevalence of CCC among patients with nosocomial versus community-acquired RSV infections (100.0% versus 41.0%) may at least partly explain the longer length of stay in the former than in the latter. Fifth, we used a very large definition of a nosocomial case, by pooling “possibly” and “definitely” nosocomial infections. In previous studies investigating the risk of RSV transmission to patients and providing a clear definition of a nosocomial case, various cut-off were used to define it (mostly 5 days or more after hospital admission) [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we chose a wider definition of a nosocomial case (i.e. infection occurring in a patient hospitalized continuously ≥ 2 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms), because (i) the RSV incubation period may be as short as 2 days [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and (ii) we did not want to minimize the real burden of RSV nosocomial ALRIs. Interestingly, although we used such a wide cut-off, the burden was not high in our center. This limitation does not hamper comparison of the burden of nosocomial infections between pediatric and adult wards at our center.
