<p id="p0085">When compared to all patients admitted to our hospital during the same period of time and free from community-acquired RSV-associated ALRIs, patients with nosocomial RSV ALRIs accounted for 0.08% of all inpatients and 0.17% of the total number of hospitalization days. The proportion of inpatients with nosocomial infections did not differ between children and adults (0.06% versus 0.15%, p = 0.14). However, the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSV-infected patients was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p &lt; 0.0001).</p>
