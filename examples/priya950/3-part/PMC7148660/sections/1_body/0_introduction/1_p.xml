<p id="p0010">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with 19â€“81% of viral acute respiratory infections causing hospitalization in infants and children [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RSV also has a burden on healthcare services and winter mortality in older adults [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Published data on the epidemiology of nosocomial RSV infections are still limited. In infants, a severe course of nosocomial disease has been described, especially in subjects with comorbidities [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], even more severe than community-acquired RSV infections [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In adults, RSV acquisition seems to be frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related, with a higher mortality than with influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study compared the burden of community-acquired versus nosocomial RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in both adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted at the same hospital.
