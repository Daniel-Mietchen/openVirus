<p>Other factors that create challenges in HIS mouse studies are the dynamic relationships between human and mouse cells and their respective immune responses. In HIS mice, much of the murine immune system is absent or non-functional due to genetic modification or irradiation, limiting the influence of the murine immune response. However, residual immune cells and other cells that produce cytokines and innate immune mediators, such as type I interferons are present in HIS mice. This response likely influences not only the outcome of infection, but also the responses of the human immune cells. While murine responses to VHF infection in HIS mice have been described [
