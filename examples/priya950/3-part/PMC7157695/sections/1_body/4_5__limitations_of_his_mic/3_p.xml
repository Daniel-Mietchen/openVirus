<p>Other limitations are more universal to current HIS mouse models, including the inability to research the influence of any antibody isotypes besides IgM on viral infection; this is due to severely limited class switching from IgM to other isotypes in most humanized mouse models [

 <xref rid="B84-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, non-neutralizing antibodies can also fulfill important roles in opsonization, activation of complement [
 <xref rid="B81-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [
 <xref rid="B85-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] during disease. While neither phagocytosis nor ADCC are effectively mediated by antibodies of the IgM isotype, IgM does effectively activate complement. Complement activation is impaired in NSG mice due to a C5 deficiency [
 <xref rid="B86-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] but HIS models based on the C57BL/6 [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or other complement-competent background strains could be used to study this effector mechanism. In vivo mouse studies of complement-dependent tumor depletion by the humanized Rituximab antibody [
 <xref rid="B87-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] suggest that human antibodies would be able to activate mouse complement in HIS models.
