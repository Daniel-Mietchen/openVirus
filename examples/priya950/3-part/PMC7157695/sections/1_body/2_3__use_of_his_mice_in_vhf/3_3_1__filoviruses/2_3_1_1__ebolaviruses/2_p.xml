<p>EBOV isolated from the more recent West Africa outbreak (Makona strain) can also induce a lethal outcome in hu-NSG-A2 mice, but only to a limited extent [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. When other species of ebolaviruses were evaluated in hu-NSG-A2 mice, SUDV, RESTV, TAFV, and BDBV all caused lower lethality rates than EBOV [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], reflecting relative case-fatality rates reported for the respective species in human cases. However, while only non-pathogenic human RESTV infections have been recorded [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], RESTV caused a 20% lethality rate in hu-NSG-A2 mice, a rate previously exceeded only in infected NHPs [

 <xref rid="B61-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Lethality in RESTV-infected hu-NSG-A2 mice also differed from the outcome noted in another humanized mouse model, humanized NOD.

 </italic> Tg (CMV-IL3, CSF2, KITLG) 1Eav/Mloy SzJ (hu-NSG-SGM3) mice. Hu-NSG-SGM3 mice, which are transgenic for human IL-3, CSF-2, and SCF to support improved reconstitution of the human myeloid compartment [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], display no disease signs of RESTV infection, even though they provide a disease model for EBOV infection [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In EBOV-infected hu-NSG-SGM3 mice, murine-origin hepatocytes stained positive for EBOV antigen, and liver damage (histopathology, liver enzyme abnormalities) recapitulated that seen in human disease. In contrast, RESTV infection was mostly restricted to liver macrophages without evidence of hepatic disease. Both EBOV and RESTV replicated to similar titers in hu-NSG-SGM3 mice except in the liver, in which RESTV replicated less efficiently. Although lethality differed in hu-NSG-A2 and hu-NSG-SGM3 mice, notably, both studies indicated an association between viral load in liver and outcome of ebolavirus infection.
