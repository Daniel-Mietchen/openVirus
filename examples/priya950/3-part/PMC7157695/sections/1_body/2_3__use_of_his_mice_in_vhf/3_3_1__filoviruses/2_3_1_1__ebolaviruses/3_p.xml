 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (NSG-BLT) have demonstrated parallels in immune responses to infection reported in humans and in HIS mice. A massive, non-specific release of host cytokines, or “cytokine storm”, [

 <xref rid="B63-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] is one aspect of EBOV pathogenesis implicated in severe disease. Cytokine profiles during EBOV infection of NSG-BLT mice [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] recapitulated those in fatal human Ebola virus disease (EVD), including high expression of M-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα, and the chemokines fractalkin, MIP-1β, and MCP-1 [
