<p>Filoviruses like Marburg virus (MARV) and ebolaviruses have been identified as the cause of small human VHF outbreaks since the 1960s and more recently have been the etiologic agents of large-scale outbreaks with high case fatality rates [

 <xref rid="B48-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], following importation to Marburg, Germany, via infected grivets sourced from Uganda for the development of a poliomyelitis vaccine. The first ebolavirus species,

 <italic>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</italic> (BDBV), 
 <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic> (RESTV), and 
 <italic>Bombali ebolavirus</italic> (BOMV). In vitro studies using human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages have provided strong evidence of the immunotropic nature of filoviruses [

 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which was supported in early non-human primate (NHP) studies [
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Given the central role of immune cell populations in infection and disease, HIS mouse models are particularly interesting for filovirus research by providing a unique opportunity to study human immune cell interactions and responses in vivo.
