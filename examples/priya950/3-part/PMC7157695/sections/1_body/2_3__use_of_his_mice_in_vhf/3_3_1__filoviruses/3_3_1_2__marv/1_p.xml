<p>Studies of MARV infection in HIS mice are much more limited than ebolavirus studies. Only one report, using the TKO-BLT model, investigated MARV infection in HIS mice [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In humans, MARV disease is comparable in severity to EBOV disease. However, in TKO-BLT mice, MARV infection resulted in limited disease compared to EBOV infection; its cellular tropism was more prolific in murine hepatocytes, with lower levels of infection of Kupffer cells than observed during EBOV infection. In contrast to the skewed and dysfunctional myeloid cell phenotypes observed during EBOV infection, flow cytometric analysis of human cells from MARV-infected animals suggested a more functional and balanced immune response to infection.
