<p>Research involving high-consequence VHFs, including studying immune responses to infection, has long been hampered by the limitations of small animal models. Wild-type laboratory mouse strains, for example, are often resistant to disease with non-adapted viruses, or are overly sensitive to infection, as in the case of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [

However, the underlying disease mechanisms in these models might not truly reflect human disease, and the immune systems of these animals are highly divergent from those of humans, thus greatly limiting the translational quality of the research.
