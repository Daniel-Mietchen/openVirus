<p>RVFV (family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>) is a mosquito-borne VHF transmitted by six genera of mosquitos, including 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> [

Modeling Rift Valley fever (RVF) disease in mice has been challenging due to the sensitivity of these animals to infection; immunocompetent mice uniformly succumb to disease in 2–3 days. This rapid and severe clinical course does not reflect the human phenotype and suggests that underlying mechanisms of human disease are not fully recapitulated. RVFV can strongly inhibit the type I interferon response [
 <xref rid="B73-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], which is a critical factor in disease progression in mice. Artificially attenuating the virus by deleting RVFV’s type I interferon-inhibiting NSs gene alleviates the disease in type I interferon-competent mice [

Studies in HIS mice investigated whether the presence of human immune cells could dampen the clinical course to more accurately model human disease. However, intramuscularly infected hu-NSG-SGM3 mice succumbed to disease at similarly fast rates [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Human cytokine expression in the hu-NSG-SGM3 model in part mirrored cytokines seen in fatal patient outcomes, but increased expression of murine cytokines was also observed during infection. This highlights the importance of considering the remaining immune function of the murine background of HIS mice when evaluating the role of immune responses in disease progression.
