<p>Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a diverse group of animal and human illnesses that cause severe multisystem dysfunction syndromes, often accompanied by damage to the vascular system and associated signs of hemorrhagic disease. VHFs are a diverse group of RNA viruses including filoviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, and rhabdoviruses [

Research of these highly pathogenic viral families is often limited to high-containment biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) or BSL-4 laboratories due to the severity of the resulting disease and lack of efficacious therapeutics or vaccines. The overall global burden of VHFs has historically been considered low compared to other diseases, such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and malaria. However, it is substantial; annual cases of Lassa fever, for example, are estimated at 100,000–300,000 [
