<p>The methods used to implant human immune cells and/or tissues into the mouse recipient also impact the level of reconstitution, functionality, and longevity of the human graft. Here we describe three common methods to produce HIS mice. The first method involves injecting peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from a human donor directly into an adult mouse [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The resultant PBL-mice mainly harbor human T cells [
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and are particularly useful HIS models for vaccine studies [

 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, since the immune cells do not develop within the mouse, they are highly xenoreactive, and the mice develop graft versus host disease (GVHD) within months [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A second method of humanization involves transferring CD34
 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into host animals that have undergone myeloablative conditioning to facilitate implantation and long-term hematopoiesis by the graft. HSCs are sourced from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, or induced in peripheral blood, and can be implanted into either newborn or adult recipient mice to produce humanized mice (hu-mice) [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Both B and T cells develop within the murine environment, so reconstitution can be sustained for approximately a year with little or no incidence of GVHD. However, immune functionality is not ideal in hu-mice, at least partly due to the lack of HLA-mediated T cell selection in the murine thymus, which since has been improved by using HLA transgenic strains [

 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Lastly, the bone marrow, liver, thymus (BLT) method of humanization also involves transplanting CD34
 <sup>+</sup> HSCs into preconditioned mice. The HSCs in this model are generated from fetal liver, and small pieces of autologous fetal liver and thymus are additionally implanted under the kidney capsule of the mouse [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The tissue implant develops into a surrogate human thymus for the maturation and selection of highly functional, HLA-restricted T cells. Unlike other methods, BLT humanization results in sustained and high-level multi-lineage reconstitution, mucosal immunity, antigen-specific B and T cell responses, organized lymphoid tissues, and antibody class-switching [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, BLT-mice are the most highly reconstituted and functional HIS model produced to date. Nevertheless, the BLT model also has limitations, including an underdeveloped B cell compartment that diminishes over time [
 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the development of lethal xenogeneic GVHD [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in some mouse strains. To date, a variety of HIS models has been used to study VHFs, representing each of these humanization approaches (
