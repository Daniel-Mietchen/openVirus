<p>While preventing anti-graft immune reactions in the host mouse strain is key to successful reconstitution, additional factors are necessary for optimal development and functionality of the engrafted human immune system. Thus, efforts have been made to remedy these deficiencies by introducing human transgenes into immunodeficient background strains. Mice transgenic for human cytokine genes have improved development of cell lineages reliant on cytokines that are not cross-reactive between mice and humans. For example, mice transgenic for human GM-CSF, IL-3, and SCF support greater development of human myeloid lineages [

Functionality, as opposed to levels of reconstitution, has also been improved through transgenic expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in graft recipient mouse strains. Mice transgenic for class I and/or class II HLA [
