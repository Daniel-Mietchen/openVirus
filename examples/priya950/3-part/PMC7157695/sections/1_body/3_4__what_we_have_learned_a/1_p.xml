<p>Overall, we have learned that HIS mice do not completely model human disease, even though VHF infection may result in clinical disease and pathology. Nonetheless, they serve as useful tools for studying specific events in virus infection. VHF studies to date have demonstrated that HIS models only occasionally recapitulate a subset of features of human disease. This is not unexpected, as the human immune features of each specific HIS model influence the disease process. For example, CTL-mediated pathogenesis has been observed in the hu-NSG-A2 model of EBOV [

 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses and several other compartments of the immune system are deficient, limiting modeling of all immune aspects that contribute to this and other features of disease. Similarly, hepatic pathology has been observed in the hu-NSG-SGM3 model of EBOV [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but likely occurred through an alternative mechanism with myeloid cell involvement. Therefore, although hepatocytes are infected in both models during EBOV infection, independent mechanisms contribute to liver disease in each one.
