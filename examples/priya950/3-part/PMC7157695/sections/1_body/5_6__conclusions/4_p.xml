<p>Current HIS models all have potential benefits and drawbacks that need to be considered during experimental design. Thus, choosing the most appropriate HIS model for any experiment requires careful reflection of whether the hypothesis can be tested based on the specific functional components of the model and the interplay between immune components of both murine and human origin. Ultimately, new HIS models should aim to more fully recapitulate all the interconnected facets of immunity. We envision a time when HIS models are combined to take advantage of key modifications to enhance all aspects of immunity, like, for example, BLT humanization of an immunodeficient strain that exhibits GVHD resistance and expresses full graft-matched HLA class I and II haplotypes and a suite of essential human cytokines.</p>
