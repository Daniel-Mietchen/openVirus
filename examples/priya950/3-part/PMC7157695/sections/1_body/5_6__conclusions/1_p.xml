<p>VHF research in humanized mouse models remains in its infancy, as we continue to learn about the limitations and utility of these models. Although generating HIS mouse models and interpreting data from such studies may be more complex than using other mouse models, HIS mice remain a valuable tool to model HIS responses and interactions in vivo; in particular for analyzing organ-specific immune reactions and infection patterns. For example, while using rodent-adapted virus in mice may generate uniform lethality, these models may not be as informative for human disease when examining the interaction between the virus and various components of the immune system. In addition, aspects of human disease progression may be reflected better in HIS mice. For example, CCHFV studies are restricted to type I interferon-deficient mice, in which infection progresses too rapidly for sufficient investigation of the immune responses [
