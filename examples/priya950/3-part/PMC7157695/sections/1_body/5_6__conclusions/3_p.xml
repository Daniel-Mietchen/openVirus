<p>New HIS mouse models are being developed that may advance our knowledge of VHFs. Numerous methods are being introduced to express human cytokines in HIS models such as transgenic expression, injection of recombinant proteins or plasmid DNA, or use of adenovirus- associated viruses to express proteins of interest. Additionally, mouse backgrounds expressing additional HLA class I alleles, including HLA-A2, A11, A24, B7, B27, and Cw3, and class II alleles like HLA-DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4, and DQ8 [

Efforts are also underway to find ways to enhance the function of the universally underdeveloped and short-lived B cell compartment, including transgenic expression of human MHC II [
