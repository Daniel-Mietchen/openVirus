<p id="p0060">The SARS epidemic in 2002–2003 wreaked havoc on both the society and economy of China [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], highlighting the urgent requirement to establish a modern biosafety management system in China. To achieve this objective, the Chinese government formulated and systematically implemented a long-term plan including a complete architecture for biosafety management. This framework was characterized by a series of laws, regulations, and standards involving different departments, organizations, and institutes in China. Based on this, many BSL-3 laboratories and a few BSL-4 laboratories have been built since. Meanwhile, the largest network in the world for the surveillance of a diverse spectrum of emerging pathogens was established [

This network implemented and maintained strict biosafety regulations in over 800 laboratories with different hierarchical levels, from national to provincial reference laboratories, as well as in sentinel hospitals. This coordinated, nationwide biosafety laboratory network ensures the early-warning and prevention of pathogen spread, and prompts initiation of clinical treatments in China. China has also expanded broad international collaborations with other countries for the improvement of global biosafety. During the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa, a mobile BSL-3 lab and a fixed BSL-3 lab supported by Chinese specialists greatly contributed to the control of further infections [

This conference, the 1st international biosafety conference to be held in China, was co-chaired by Prof. Guizhen Wu from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), and Ms. T.S. Saraswathy Subramaniam, the President of the A-PBA.
