<p id="p0030">Man-made biological threats exist in many countries. A potential major risk stems from stocks of concentrated infectious pathogens stored in laboratories and the absence of adequate biosecurity measures. Non-compliance of approved biocontainment and biosafety protocols could result in the accidental or deliberate release of pathogens into the environment through a laboratory-acquired infection or a bioterrorist attack.</p>
