<p id="p0010">Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have raised global concern in recent years. Urbanization, habitat encroachment, and increased intercontinental travel and commerce, in combination with localized inefficiencies in health-care systems, increase the possibility that infectious diseases will spread rapidly around the world. Unpredictable outbreaks that were previously localized can spread globally, as fast as an international flight. As a result, we must accept the fact that in today's world, “a threat anywhere is a threat everywhere”.</p>
