<p id="p0070">One of the most significant challenges faced by humanity in the 21st century is the rapid, global spread of infectious diseases, which have the potential to cost millions of lives, disrupt social order, and greatly damage global travel and commerce. Thus, it is pivotal to mitigate the risk of biological incidents. Recent outbreaks of emerging and deadly viruses have highlighted a global vulnerability to public health emergencies. Countries around the world and international communities need to boost preparedness, and improve surveillance systems to predict, rapidly identify, and respond to the next public health crisis [

These systems need to be sensitive enough to cope with the challenges of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, risks associated with advances in biotechnology, and bio-terrorism threats. Meanwhile, to address biological threats, more grants and funds should be established for the development of better antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and efficient therapies. In underdeveloped and developing countries, both biosafety-related hardware (i.e. biosafety laboratories) and technical expertise are urgently needed. International collaborations, partnerships, and communication should be enhanced. The proper and timely sharing of biosafety achievements, including infectious diseases prevention and control, AMR, genome editing, and synthetic biotechnology, will promote the capacity of all the partners to control current and future biological-related threats, guaranteeing human health. With this journal,
