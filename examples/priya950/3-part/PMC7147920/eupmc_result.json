    "Biological threats, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate in origin, can result in disasters that are regional, national, or even global in scope if not properly contained. Many global communities, international programs, and governmental organizations have been established to mitigate these risks and challenges. In China, for example, the government has systematically implemented long-term plans including a complete country-wide architecture for biosafety management. It includes the establishment of a series of improved biosafety laws/regulations/standards and of a large number of high-level biosafety laboratories. All countries should encourage preparedness and improve surveillance systems to predict, identify, and respond to the next public health crisis. More grants and funds should be established for research into biosafety and biosecurity. Most importantly, international collaborations, partnerships, and communications should be enhanced. The journal Biosafety and Health aims to provide a global communications platform on biosafety related to human and animal health."
