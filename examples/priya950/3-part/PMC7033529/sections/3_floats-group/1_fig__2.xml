  <p>Optimal conditions for rZNS1-His increased secretion from 1E4-C9 HEK293 cells. 
   <bold>(A-C)</bold> Western blot analysis with anti-ZNS1 monoclonal antibody of supernatants from 1E4-C9 cells incubated in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or in serum-free media for the indicated days 
   <bold>(B-C)</bold>. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Cell survival assessed by MTT reduction assay in 1E4-C9 cells incubated in serum-free media for the indicated days. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Immunoblot analysis with anti-ZNS1 monoclonal antibody of supernatants from 1E4-C9 cells subjected to treatment with 50 nM or 100 nM rapamycin (Rapa), 0.25 % or 0.50 % DMSO, or hypotonic medium (50 mM or 100 mM NaCl), followed by incubation in serum-free media for 5 or 9 days. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> MTT assay in 1E4-C9 cells treated or not with 50 nM rapamycin and incubated in serum-free media for 9 days. In 
   <bold>(A,B,E)</bold> Coomassie brilliant blue staining was used as loading control, filled arrowheads show rZNS1-His position whereas hollow arrowheads show the remaining bovine serum albumin contained in the serum-free culture media following a PBS washing step, and the positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated on the left. Data in 
   <bold>(C,D,E,F)</bold> represent mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. P-values were calculated by one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's in 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> and Bonferroni's in 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold>: *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, n.s. not significant.
