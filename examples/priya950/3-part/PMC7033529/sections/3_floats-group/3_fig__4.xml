  <p>rZNS1-His reactivity with ZIKV infected patients sera and immunogenicity in a mouse model. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> iELISA of rZNS1-His with serum samples obtained from patients with a positive diagnosis of ZIKV. Healthy individuals sera were used as negative control. Each point of the curve represents mean ± SEM of three sample replicates. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Dot Blot analysis with the indicated serum samples of rZNS1-His or ZIKV stock obtained from C6/36 cells infected with ZIKV PRVABC59 Puerto Rico strain. Mock-infected C6/36 cells supernatant was loaded as negative control. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> iELISA showing humoral responses of mice immunized with rZNS1-His. Non-immunized mouse sera was used as a negative control. Each point of the curve represents mean ± SD of two sample replicates.
