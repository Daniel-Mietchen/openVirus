<p id="par0160">Zika virus received little attention until 2015 outbreak in Brazil, where a massive epidemic ensued and congenital neurodevelopmental defects were associated with maternal ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given that ZIKV NS1 hexameric glycoprotein is secreted from the infected cells and released into the patient's bloodstream, typically before or from the onset of the symptoms [

 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], it results in an excellent biomarker for early diagnosis. For these reasons, the present study aimed at establishing a stable and optimized rZNS1 mammalian expression system that would allow the production and purification of the ZNS1 hexamer. Mammalian expression systems are the prevailing method chosen for recombinant protein production among biopharmaceutical companies and academic laboratories. Mammalian cell hosts provide an attractive alternative to prokaryotic hosts since they yield properly folded and assembled proteins, with native-like post-translational modifications [

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the present work, we developed a rZNS1-His expressing mammalian system through lentiviral transduction followed by dilution cloning of HEK293 cells, which are extensively used for protein over-expression studies [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This approach allowed the generation of the 1E4-C9 clone.
