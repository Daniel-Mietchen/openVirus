<p id="par0170">In summary, a stable and optimized rZNS1-His mammalian expression system was developed and characterized. Previous studies have established stable mammalian cell lines that secrete hexameric rZNS1 [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Viranaicken et al. developed stable rZNS1 Vero cells [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], while Liu et al. established stably transduced HEK293 rZNS1- expressing cells [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. As Liu's group, we decided to develop a mammalian expression system utilizing HEK293 cell line because it has the advantage of suspension-growing, allowing large-scale culture and protein production. Nevertheless, these studies did not focus on improving the low yield of purified recombinant protein obtained from these expression systems, but rather developed them for research purposes. This is the first work that describes that rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation can upregulate ―up to 29-fold― recombinant ZIKV NS1 protein production in HEK293 cells, reaching protein yields of ∼10 mg/l of culture medium. These conditions may be useful in enhancing research NS1 protein production efficiency and might be considered for large-scale manufacturing of NS1 recombinant protein. The obtained recombinant ZNS1 hexamer is a reliable biological tool of great value for ZIKV clinical diagnosis and surveillance purposes.
