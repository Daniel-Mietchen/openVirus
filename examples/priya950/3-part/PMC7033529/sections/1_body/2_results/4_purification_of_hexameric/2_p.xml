<p id="par0150">In order to purify rZNS1-His, supernatant of 1E4-C9 cells exposed to 50 nM rapamycin and incubated in serum-free media for 9 days was concentrated ∼10 times by ultrafiltration using a 100 kDa MWCO disc membrane, dialyzed in 100 mM NaCl - PBS and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that rZNS1-His eluted as a single ∼48 kDa band in a defined peak, with purity &gt;95 % (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The average yield of recombinant protein produced in the mammalian expression system described above was ∼1 mg of purified rZNS1-His protein per 100 ml of harvested supernatant. The identity of the purified rZNS1-His protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). In addition, the analysis showed efficient protein manipulation throughout processing of the supernatant prior to purification. To determine whether rZNS1-His purified from 1E4-C9 cells supernatant presented a hexameric conformation as expected, we carried out a dot blot assay with the harvested supernatant, filtrate (10X concentrated supernatant, &gt;100 kDa) and permeate (&lt;100 kDa) fractions collected following ultrafiltration, and the purified rZNS1-His protein. No signal was observed in the permeate fraction, suggesting that rZNS1-His protein contained in 1E4-C9 supernatant is a hexamer (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). To further analyze this notion, a SDS-PAGE with purified rZNS1-His under non-denaturing conditions was performed. In the absence of heat denaturation the dimeric conformation was readily detected, while without heat denaturation and under no reducing condition it was possible to visualize the hexameric conformation of rZNS1-His (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). These results are in line with previous reports, which have shown that NS1 dimer is sensitive to heat denaturation [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and that disulfide bonds contribute to NS1 oligomerization [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, we confirmed the quaternary structure of rZNS1-His through gel filtration chromatography, from which we obtained a single peak with a molecular mass of 292 kDa (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E), a size compatible with a hexameric conformation. Additionally, we performed a cross-linking assay using different glutaraldehyde concentrations, which resulted in the formation of a predominant complex with a molecular mass compatible with a hexameric form (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>F). We observed that the absence of heat denaturation (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D) generates a faster-migrating dimer species on SDS-PAGE than the dimer detected following glutaraldehyde cross-linking of rZNS1-His (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E), which we interpreted as a more compact form of the protein. Collectively, these results indicate that the purified rZNS1-His protein from the supernatant of 1E4-C9 cells is a hexamer as expected.
