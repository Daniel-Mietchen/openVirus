<p id="par0155">In order to study the potential use of the produced rZNS1-His protein to develop diagnostic tests to detect ZIKV infection, we first characterized the reactivity of anti-NS1 antibodies in ZIKV patient's serum towards rZNS1-His protein. iELISA assays were carried out with the sera of two patients with confirmed ZIKV infection. Data showed that these sera contained IgG antibodies that recognize the purified rZNS1-His protein (

Serum from two healthy individuals did not show reactivity to rZNS1-His as expected. Next, we compared the reactivity of ZIKV infected patient's serum against rZNS1-His or the native protein of ZIKV Puerto Rico strain produced to the supernatant of ZIKV infected cells in a dot blot assay. The results revealed that ZIKV patient's serum reacted with rZNS1-His protein as well as with NS1 protein contained in the supernatant of ZIKV infected cells (

Finally, we sought to establish whether rZNS1-His protein could induce a humoral immune response in a mouse model. To this purpose, mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the recombinant protein and the presence of anti-NS1 antibodies was determined by iELISA after the second booster injection. The results demonstrated the immunogenicity of rZNS1-His protein given that both mice developed an anti-NS1â€¯humoral response (

Our rZNS1-His protein could potentially be used in the development of anti-NS1 antibody immunocapture assays, as well as in the development of NS1 capture ELISAs and lateral flow systems.
