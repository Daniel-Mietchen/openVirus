<p id="par0095">To purify secreted rZNS1-His, supernatant of HEK293 rZNS1-His 1E4-C9 cells treated with 50 nM rapamycin and incubated 9 days in serum-free media were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 rpm and subjected to concentration by ultrafiltration as described above. The 10-fold concentrated supernatant was dialyzed in 100 mM NaCl - PBS and loaded on a nickel affinity column (Pharmacia Biotech) O.N. at 4 °C. The column was washed with 50 mM Tris−HCl pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and rZNS1-His was eluted with 50 mM Tris−HCl pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole. The purification process was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and rZNS1-His fractions were dialyzed against PBS.</p>
