<p id="par0100">For gel filtration analysis, rZNS1-His was dialized in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, 0.14 M NaCl, pH 7.4 and used as input for a Superdex 200 Increase 100/300 G L column (GE Healthcare), using the same buffer. Markers used for molecular weight determination were Apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa) and Bovine Serum Albumin (66 kDa), all from Sigma. Eluted fractions were resolved by 10 % SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot (see 
 <italic>2.6. Western blotting</italic>).
