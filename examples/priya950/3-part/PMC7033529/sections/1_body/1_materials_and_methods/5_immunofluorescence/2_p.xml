<p id="par0070">Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT, permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 and incubated with 2 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunostaining was performed using 1:500 ZNS1 mouse polyclonal sera, 1:2000 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg/μl 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei. At least three fields of each stain were randomly selected for analysis. Image acquisition was performed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope at a magnification of 1000 × . Images were processed with the NIH ImageJ software.</p>
