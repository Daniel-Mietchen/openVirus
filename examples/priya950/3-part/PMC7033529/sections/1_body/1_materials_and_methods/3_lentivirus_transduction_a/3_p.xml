<p id="par0060">To produce lentivirus, the transfer vector pLB coding for rZNS1-His was cotransfected with the packaging vector pSPAX2 (Addgene plasmid 12260) and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein vector pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid 12259) into HEK293E cells using polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Supernatant with lentivirus was collected 2 days after transfection, and low-speed concentration was performed by overnight centrifugation of the viral supernatant at 3000 g and 4 °C. Concentrated viral supernatants were supplemented with 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.4 and 12 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). For HEK293 transduction, cells were infected with lentivirus by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 30 min at room temperature (RT). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5 % CO
 <sub>2</sub>, inoculum was replaced with complete fresh medium. rZNS1-His expression was evaluated by flow cytometry (as described in 
 <italic>2.5. Flow cytometry</italic>). Enrichment of HEK293 cells expressing rZNS1-His was performed cloning twice by limited dilution, obtaining 1E4-C9 and 1E4-D11 clones with ∼90 % rZNS1-His-expressing cells.
