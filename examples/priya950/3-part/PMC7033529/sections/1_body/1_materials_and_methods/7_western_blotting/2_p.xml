<p id="par0080">Cell lysates, cell supernatants, purification fractions, rZNS1-His and gel filtration fractions were resolved on 7 % or 10 % sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, GE Healthcare), analysis by immunoblotting was performed using 0.2 μg/ml ZNS1 monoclonal antibody (mAbia labs, Argentina), 1:1000 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.1 μg/ml anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (mAbia labs, Argentina). Bound mAbs were recognized with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:2000 dilution, Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:20000 dilution, or with HRP rabbit anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Dako) at a 1:10000 dilution. The signal was visualized with enhanced chemiluminiscence reagent (GE Healthcare) and CL-XPosure Films (Thermo Scientific), or with an Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor). Densitometric analysis was performed using the NIH ImageJ software.</p>
