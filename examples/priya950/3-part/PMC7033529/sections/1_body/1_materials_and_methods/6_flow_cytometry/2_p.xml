<p id="par0075">Cells were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C, permeabilized with cold 90 % methanol in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, blocked in 2 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT and washed in PBS prior to immunostaining with 4 μg/ml ZNS1 monoclonal antibody (mAbia labs, Argentina) O.N. at 4 °C. Following a washing step in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at RT with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:100 dilution. Samples were measured with a CyFlow Space cytometer (Partec). Data analysis was performed with WinMDI 2.9 software.</p>
