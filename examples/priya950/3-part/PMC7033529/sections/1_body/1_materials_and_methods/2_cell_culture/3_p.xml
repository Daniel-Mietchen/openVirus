<p id="par0050">For hypotonic treatment, cells were incubated in hypotonic medium (PBS 0.45 % glucose, 1 % FBS, 50 mM or 100 mM NaCl) for 1 h. Rapamycin treatment (50 nM or 100 nM, Sigma) was carried out in serum-free DMEM for 2 h. Incubation with Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS, GIBCO) was performed for 2 h. Following a washing step in PBS, the hypotonic medium, rapamycin supplemented media or EBSS buffer were replaced with serum-free DMEM and cells were incubated for the indicated times. For DMSO treatment, cells were washed in PBS and incubated in 0.25 % or 0.50 % DMSO in serum-free DMEM for the times indicated.</p>
