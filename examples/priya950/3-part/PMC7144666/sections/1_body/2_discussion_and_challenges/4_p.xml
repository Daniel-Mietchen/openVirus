 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].To tackle the problems different scientist groups proposed different solutions. To tackle the problem of transporting suspensions of discrete objects like cells or microparticles laser micromachined hybrid open/paper microfluidic chips were developed in which the liquid carrier was transported in a Mylar microchannel but driven by a paper channel, with quantitative flow control [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Then, Ng et al. developed the ES-PCL/FP (Electro-spin-PCL over Filter Paper) which showed incredible cell adhesion of human-Foetal-Osteoblastic cells (hFOB). Lack of sensitivity was tackled by concentrating targets from a larger volume by speeding up intrinsic thermodynamic partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Lastly, the integration of functional groups or surface modification can be controlled by using techniques like initiated-Chemical-Vapour-Deposition (iCVDs). Also, these paper-based-sensors are sensitive to temperature and humidity, as the detection zones are dependent on the temperature and relative humidity of the environment [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Even though the rise in temperature improves enzyme activity, they also evaporate the water from the spots faster and even denature enzymes. The thermal stability can be increased by adsorption of enzymes on paper with conjunction with a humidifier substance.
