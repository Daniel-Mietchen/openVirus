<p id="p0120">A major challenge with paper-based sensors is the composition of paper, which is mostly cellulose and hemicellulose. It is inherently, a non-conducting material; hence paper was primarily used for colorimetric tests. Hence, modification was done in the paper substrate using carbon nanotubes, graphene nanosheets, metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and their nano-conjugates, to fabricate μPADs, like those of Electrochemical-μPAD (E− μPAD); thus improving the performance of the sensor system [

Another challenge was that of amplifying the signals detected using μPADs. Hence, in 2018 Wu et al. developed a μPAD with ultra-sensitive and high-throughput detection of cancer biomarkers by introducing graphene onto the surface of the immune-device which efficiently accelerated the electron transfer and enhanced the detection signal [
