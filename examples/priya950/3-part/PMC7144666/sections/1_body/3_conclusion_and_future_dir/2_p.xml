<p id="p0140">Paper has been used as supporting material in Biomedical Sciences and has shown immense potential for the development of biosensors and scaffolding-material in the field of Biosensors and Tissue Engineering, respectively. This literature review enumerated the applications of paper as a supporting material over a decade and the research and development going on in the field of Biomedical Sciences. Earlier, LFAs were used for diagnostic purposes but they gave only qualitative results; but with further research paper-based devices were prepared which were able to give qualitative as well as quantitative results. For diagnosis purposes using paper, various biomarkers are considered, viz. viral proteins, metabolites viz. NO
 <sub>3</sub>, NO, Creatinine, Uric Acid which can be detected using a Î¼PAD. Moreover, paper has also been used for oncological diagnosis and prognosis and proved to be efficient and easy to handle platform which gave an edge to cancer therapy.
