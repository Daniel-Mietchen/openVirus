<p id="p0145">Paper-based scaffolds have shown the immense capability to revolutionize the field of Tissue engineering. It has been used to develop ‘heart on a paper’ and co-cultures of Liver cells where drug testing showed promising results. The porous, and fibrous structure of paper enabled the transport of nutrients and oxygen across the entire thickness of the paper, which thereby allows cellular remodeling, proliferation, and differentiation of cells. The scaffolds developed were also used as an implantable material on rabbits to replace a damaged trachea. However, out of the various laboratory experiments and researches on μPADs, presented in this paper, none have found commercial utility till now. Therefore, current and future researches need to be more market-oriented and be commercially viable to the masses. For that, the researchers have to overcome the aforementioned challenges in the writing of the paper.</p>
