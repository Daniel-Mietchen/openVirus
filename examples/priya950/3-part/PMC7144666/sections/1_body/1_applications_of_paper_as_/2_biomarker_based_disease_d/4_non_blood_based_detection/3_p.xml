<p id="p0070">Nitrite (NO

 <sup>1−</sup>) is one of the metabolic wastes excreted out with urine [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The detection of Nitrite (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>1−</sup>) in urine analysis indicates some Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). It is due to the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by gram-negative bacteria species like 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, that Nitrite is detected in urine analysis [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Using this concept, Chen and Dong developed a peel-able μPAD attached to diaper for elderly patients, in which the urine sample is collected and analyzed [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The μPAD was made of filter paper with patterned wax with varying concentrations of nitrite in eight segregated chemical reagent zones. A color change from white to red-violet can be interpreted as a positive result. The intensity determines the concentration of nitrite in the sample.
