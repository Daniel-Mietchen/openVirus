<p id="p0035">In this method, biomarkers present in the blood are analyzed using μPAD. For example, in 2016, Hu et al. developed a μPAD with combined blood serum [

 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] extractor with dual-mode iron health tests: fluorescent analysis for Fe3+ and colorimetric ELISA for ferritin, which is a blood protein containing iron [

For CDs rendered different reaction rates for paper and consequently led to two distinguished regions on paper simultaneously: the fluorescent CDs (F-CDs), for serum iron analysis and the non-fluorescent CDs (nF-CDs) for chemical deposition of Au. The high triggering ability for blood coagulation was shown by the surface, which enabled automatic and highly effective serum extraction on the μPAD. Sensing of serum ferritin was enabled by the bio-modification of AuNPs. Subsequently, μPADs were developed to detect viral, cardiac and oncological biomarkers in blood.
