<p id="p0075">In urine, other compounds such as Creatinine (CRN) and uric acid are also released by the body. Creatinine is spontaneously produced in the metabolism of muscle contraction from creatine and phosphocreatine and is excreted by the kidneys. It is an important clinical marker for renal function since the rate of excretion of creatinine is relatively constant. Similar to this design developed by Bhakta et al, Edwardo et al, constructed a μPAD and developed two optimized methods for the simultaneous quantification of two biomarkers in urine, namely creatinine and uric acid, using Jaffe’s method and a Phenanthroline method respectively [

The analytical device used was 19 × 19 mm, with 4 mm width for the main channel, 2 mm width for the arms, and 4 mm diameters for the testing and uptake zones. Using a wax printer, the design was printed on a Whatman No. 1 filter paper with wax toner following the description given by Carrilho et al [
