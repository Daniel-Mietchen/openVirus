<p id="p0065">In non-blood-based detection, biomarkers present in body fluids like, saliva, urine, or tear are used. The advantage that the methods using non-blood-based biomarkers are the fact that there’s no need for any purification methods, unlike blood-based detection where blood plasma needs to be separated from whole blood. Thus, rendering it better than blood-based methods. Nitrates are compounds naturally occurring in the human body and some foods like green leafy vegetables [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the human body, nitrate after absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract, it reaches the salivary gland via blood circulation and is secreted in the oral cavity where the microflora partially reduces it to nitrite [

In 2014, Bhakta et al developed a μPAD for detection of nitrite in saliva, which used Griess reagent for detection, which could indicate chances of developing periodontitis with clinical symptoms like gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding of gums, as it is associated with the concentration of nitrite (NO

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ) were 24 mm by 24 mm, with a 2 mm width for the main channel and a 3 mm diameter for the testing zones. The sample was up taken on the μPAD through capillary action and the solution was driven into the branched channels and the testing zone of the μPAD. In an acidic medium and the presence of nitrite, the two components of the Griess reagent led to the formation of a magenta azo compound, in the presence of nitrite. Later, to maximize the color development, the acetic acid of the Griess reagent was replaced by 5% H3PO4. A quick, easy, and inexpensive analytical method of quantifying nitrite levels in human saliva was offered by the optimized configuration. According to the researchers, this methodology could aid research leading to establish a definitive relationship between salivary nitrite levels and periodontitis.
