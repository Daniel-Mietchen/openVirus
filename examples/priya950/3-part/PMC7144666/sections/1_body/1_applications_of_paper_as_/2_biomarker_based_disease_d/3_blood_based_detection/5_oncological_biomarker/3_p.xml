<p id="p0055">However, all the above-mentioned methods are tedious, time-consuming and need expert assistance. Moreover, the methods are not efficient enough to detect cancer cells at an early stage. In the case of imaging tests, it can find large groups of cancer cells but not single cancer cells or even a small cluster of cells [
