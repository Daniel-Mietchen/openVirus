<p id="p0080">Then, in 2016, Gabriel et al. showed that tears can also be used for glucose and uric acid estimation. They used Sensitive colorimetric detection for chitosan incorporated paper surface resulting in better solid support to adsorb enzymes ensuring a more effective reactive area in the whole detection zone [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These devices were used for the quantitative analysis of glucose and uric acid which yielded an accuracy at the range of 87 to 114%. The remarkable improvements in analytical sensitivity allowed the colorimetric detection of glucose in human tear samples. No statistical difference was found at a confidence level of 95%, in the performance of chitosan-modified μPADs for the detection of glucose when compared to the analysis carried out by the spectrophotometry technique, thus proving the analytical reliability for quantitative analysis. In another instance, Jia et al developed a μPAD for direct detection of glucose from saliva (artificial) using a smartphone-based colorimetric assay, having a LOD of 0.02 mM [

They modified the cellulose fiber of the paper with Graphene-Oxide prohibiting any possible enzyme cross-examination, and also enhanced reagent absorptivity, reactive efficiency, and homogeneity of color distribution. They claimed it to be universally applicable as the modification of the μPAD with Graphene-Oxide can be achieved without the use of any linker, binder or retention aid. Thus, the developed device was disposable and could perform rapid and reliable analysis of samples, when compared with other paper-based sensors, owing to automatic smartphone image analysis.
