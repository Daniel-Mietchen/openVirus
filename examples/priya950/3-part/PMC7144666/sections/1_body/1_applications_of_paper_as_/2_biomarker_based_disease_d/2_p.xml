<p id="p0030">Biomarkers are indicators of the body’s functioning, and their levels in the blood can indicate the occurrence of certain diseases [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To estimate the levels of biomarkers in the body, blood plasma is separated from whole blood using techniques such as centrifugation. This procedure is both tedious and requires the help of technicians. Hence, μPADs like those developed by Yang et al can be used to separate blood plasma from whole blood [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Before this, researchers devised numerous techniques like electro-osmotic flow, bifurcation (Zweifach-Fung effect), membrane filtration and cross-flow filtration for blood plasma separation [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, these methods come with disadvantages like the requirement of external force for the flow of substances through the microfluidic channel but paper can be used to make microfluidic systems that can work without the requirement of such forces. The μPAD developed by Yang et al used the principle of RBC agglutination induced by anti-bodies. The plasma separation zone in the center was made functionalized by spotting anti-A, B onto it, and the reagents of the colorimetric assay onto the test readout zones in the periphery. To perform the assay, a drop of whole blood was placed at the plasma separation zone, which leads to agglutination of RBC and separation of plasma. The plasma obtained using this process was significantly high to perform the colorimetric assay. Similarly, a year later, Songjaroen et al developed a different method of separating blood plasma from whole blood [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They fabricated a μPAD consisting of two types of Paper, i.e. blood filter paper and patterned Whatman No.1 filter paper to separate blood plasma from other components by agglutination of the components and penetration of plasma through the paper by capillary action. By wax dipping method, various layers were incorporated onto the paper for separation of particles greater than 2–3 mm including red cells and platelets from whole blood. Once the plasma is separated from the other components of blood, biomarkers of interest can be analyzed using various biomolecular reactions. In the following paragraphs, we have divided the detection of biomarkers into blood-based and non-blood-based; i.e. biomarkers present in blood and those present in other body fluids like saliva, tears, and urine.
