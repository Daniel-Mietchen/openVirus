<p id="p0100">However, in 2013, Juvonen, et al. developed a 2-dimensional printed paper-based array, which was successfully used for 2-D cell cultures and performed better than PS-dishes. Hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ink was used to print patterned structures on paper substrates for the preparation of arrays used for two-dimensional cell culture and a lipophilic staining agent was preferred for cell imaging [

They considered four different types of coated paper substrates with characteristic roughness and surface energy for analyzing the substrate surface factors that influence the 2-D cell culture. The main components in the top coating layer of the paper Substrates were: (P-1) precipitated calcium carbonate pigments and Latex binder; (P-2) a mixture of two different kaolin pigments and Latex binder; and (P-3) kaolin pigments and a latex binder. The sample P-4 was coated with an aqueous latex blend consisting of a 3:2 wt ratio of low-Tg film-forming (‘‘soft’’) styrene-butadiene and high-Tg non-film-forming (‘‘hard’’) polystyrene. It was found that the PDMS film had the lowest surface energy whereas the Polystyrene (PS) dish had the highest surface energy. Thus, paper proved to be a better alternative to prepare 2D cell cultures, too.
