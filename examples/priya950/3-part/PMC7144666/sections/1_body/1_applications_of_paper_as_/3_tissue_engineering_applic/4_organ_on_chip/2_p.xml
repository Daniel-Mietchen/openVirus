<p id="p0105">Other than using paper to make paper-based-cultures to monitor chemoresistance of cells or metabolic responses; it has also be used to make 3D cell cultures that not only mimic the tissue environment but also develop working implantable tissues. Moreover, they showed similar activity and response to drugs and other chemicals. For instance, in 2014, Park et al. demonstrated the feasibility of paper materials for stem cell culture, differentiation, and implantation to repair tissue defects [

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] regeneration of human-Adipose-Derived-Stem-Cells (hADSCs). In their research, Papers laden with osteogenically differentiated hADSCs and human endothelial cells, when stacked together led to vascularized bone formation in vivo. Fabricating such a paper-based scaffold was met with challenges as papers can be easily damaged by heat or organic chemicals when applied to modify the surface. Hence, they used a method called initiated-Chemical-Vapour-Deposition (iCVD), in which the conformal coating of functional polymer films can be applied over the paper substrate without any damage. Similarly, in 2015, Petersen et al. investigated the applicability of single layer paper-based scaffolds for the three-dimensional (3D) growth and osteogenic differentiation of equine adipose-derived stem cells (EADSC) and achieved a viable culture EADSC [

It was the first attempt to fabricate a paper-based-array for the culture, proliferation, and direct differentiation of human-induced-Pluripotent-Stem-Cells (hiPSCs) into functional beating cardiac tissue. The hiPSC-derived cardiac tissue was able to maintain a long-term spontaneous beating activity of about 3 months [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A year later, Whitesides et al. showed the use of paper to guide the deposition of minerals like Calcium Phosphates by Osteoblasts. The porous and fibrous structure of paper enables the transport of nutrients and oxygen across the entire thickness of the paper, which thereby allows cellular remodeling, proliferation, and differentiation of cells [
