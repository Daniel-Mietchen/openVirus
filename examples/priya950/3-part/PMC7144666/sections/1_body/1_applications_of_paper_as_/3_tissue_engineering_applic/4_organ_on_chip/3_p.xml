It was able to maintain a long-term stable morphology and hepatic functions assessed by secretion of albumin, synthesis of urea and CYP450 gene expression which is responsible for the oxidation of steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, for 60 days. Also, the 3D culture showed hepatotoxic characteristics of well-known drugs like Acetaminophen (APAP) and Pioglitazone [
