<p id="p0095">Again in 2016, Simon et al developed a CiGiP 3D culture system to evaluate the metabolic response of lung cancer cells to ionizing radiation within gradients of oxygen and other nutrients [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These cell-laden scaffolds composed of the paper-plastic composite were placed in an acrylic holder that enabled the exchange of fresh medium with the stack and generate a decreasing gradient of oxygen. This arrangement mimicked the environment of a poorly-vascularized environment of tissues like that of cancerous tumors: top stack was well-oxygenated whereas the bottom stacks were experiencing hypoxic conditions and an increase in expression of HIF-1Î± and CAIX. A similar model was used to study the chemoresistance of colorectal carcinoma cells [

In 2018, Wang and his group developed a multi-layer CiGiP to analyze tumor cell migration in 3D cultures [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To monitor the progression of malignant tumors, the motility of the cells is measured. The developed multi-layered 3D culture was seeded with prostate cancer cell in the middle layer and their heterogeneous motility to the top and bottom layers was measured. Fig 4shows a timeline of the development of CiGiP-based paper cultures. Research Labs, across the globe, uses Polystyrene (PS) Dishes to prepare 2D cell cultures [
