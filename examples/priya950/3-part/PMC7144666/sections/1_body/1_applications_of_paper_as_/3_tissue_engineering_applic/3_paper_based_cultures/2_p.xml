<p id="p0090">Paper is a flexible, porous, low-cost, biocompatible biomaterial offered as a good choice for making scaffolds [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], rapid and profitable methods like roll to roll fabrication methods, like printing can be used for applying chemicals (i.e. pharmaceutical ingredients or Toxic chemicals) in a controlled way and on a large scale. Paper is composed of a cellulose network that acts like the Extra-Cellular-Matrix (ECM). Paper is a 2D substrate, hence they are stacked on top of one another to create a 3D cell microenvironment. In 2009, Derda et al developed a technique of “stacking and de-stacking layers of paper impregnated with suspensions of cells in extracellular matrix hydrogel making it possible to control oxygen and nutrient gradients in 3D and to analyze molecular and genetic responses” called ‘Cells-in-Gels-in-Paper’ or CiGiP [

Before this technique, the majority of 3D cultures based on high throughput assays which were only able to detect the average behavior of cells present in the culture. However, using CiGiP, it was easier to culture arrays of thin planar sections of tissues, either alone or stacked to create complex tissue models and thus, it was simpler to isolate cells from a specific region of the culture and analyze their behavior. This opened new possibilities where paper can be used as a substrate-material to mimic cell microenvironments. For instance, in 2014 Frederique et al developed a similar 96-well cell culture using CiGiP to examine the cytotoxic effects of apoptosis inducer, Phenyl-Arsine-Oxide (PAO) and alkylating agent, Cyclo-Phospho-Amide (CPA) on human breast cancer cells [
