<p id="p0020">On the other hand, paper is also revolutionizing the field of Tissue engineering, viz. paper-based cell cultures and scaffolds [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. For almost a century, cell cultures were being developed on surfaces of Petri dishes and glass plates in the form of 2D monolayers and tests were performed on them. However, they had major limitations as cell microenvironments were 3D. Hence scientists started to engineer 3D-substrates to make cell cultures. Eventually, they succeeded in doing so using artificial polymers; but the polymers were difficult to fabricate and were mostly non-biodegradable. Thus, the focus shifted to paper-based materials and the substrates developed so far, showed promising potential [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, synthetic polymers were used to make scaffolds. Fabrication of these scaffolds was neither convenient nor feasible, but now research is ongoing to replace it with paper-based-scaffolds [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which are low-cost and can mimic the biological Extra-Cellular-Matrix (ECM). The paper-based scaffolds can provide a valuable platform for basic stem cell research to study material effects and also to perform drug test [

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. Generally, for tissue engineering fibrous nature, porosity and flexibility of scaffolds are desired and possessing all these characteristics paper [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] has the potential to replace conventional scaffolding materials like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), glass fiber, chitosan, which are difficult to fabricate and are not feasible for low-income economies. For the proper proliferation of cells [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] in vitro, a microenvironment that mimics the in vivo characteristics of the body is necessary [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the challenge with paper is that it is 2D in structure, hence researchers stacked the cell-laden papers on top of one another to make the 3D microenvironments. Using this technique, researchers developed "a beating heart on paper", which was beating for about 3 months; and in another instance, researchers developed a 3D liver model on paper scaffold which showed similar response, like in a real liver in vivo [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similar to Î¼PADs, paper substrate used in the fabrication of cultures and scaffolds were surface modified to enhance cellular growth.
