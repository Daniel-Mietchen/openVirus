<p id="p0025">This review intends to enumerate the development in the field of Î¼PADs, paper-based cell cultures, and paper-based scaffolds over the last decade. We have explained their structure, composition, surface modification, and functionality. Hopefully, this review will encourage more research in these fields and the development of more commercially viable paper-based devices. Also, may this review be helpful to the new-comers in this field and may demonstrate the importance of such low-cost paper-based analytical devices and scaffolds.</p>
