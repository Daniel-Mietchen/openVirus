<p id="p0010">Historically, paper has been used as a tool to record and preserve information [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but over time it has found its application in the field of Biomedical Sciences [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Paper being a cellulose-based substrate, has a long history to perform biomolecular assays. Due to its affordability, wide availability, and its hydrophilic nature, it is considered to be one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of paper-based biosensors [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first paper-based device for the semi-quantitative detection of glucose in urine was demonstrated in 1956 that further developed into immunochromatographic paper-based lateral flow test strips, with the well-known example of pregnancy test kits [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Later on, George Whitesides introduced the method of fabricating microchannels on paper for multiplex analyte detection based on colorimetry; thus giving rise to microfluidic paper-based analytical devices or simply, μPAD [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A μPAD can be defined as a paper-based analytical device used to perform biomolecular assays, consisting of a sample-loading zone and a testing zone with varying architecture of channels concerning its application. Thin, light and flexible nature of cellulose paper makes it an excellent raw material to fabricate μPAD with applications ranging from blood-plasma separation to detecting viral, cardiac and oncological biomarkers [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These low-cost devices can be used in developing economies in Asia and Africa, where deploying sophisticated detection devices like spectrophotometers [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] are not economically viable. Moreover, the population in these economies is higher; thus increasing the chances of the prevalence of epidemics like Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Africa and China, respectively. Hence, the development of low-cost paper-based analytical devices can help in quarantining those infected by such viruses as well as facilitate early detection of diseases and conditions like Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) infection and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE).
