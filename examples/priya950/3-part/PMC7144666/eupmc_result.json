    "In human history, the paper has long been used as a platform to record and preserve information. However, over the decades, paper has found its application in Biomedical Sciences, too. Both paper-based microfluidic devices (μPADs) and paper-based cultures and scaffolds have shown immense potential to be used as a sensor as well as a supporting material for in vitro tissue engineering. μPADs can be used to perform low-cost and fast biomolecular assays at Point-Of-Care (POC). They are being used to detect various biomarkers like viral proteins, metabolites, oncogenes, and antigens; and conditions like Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). On the other hand, the paper has also been used to develop paper-based 3D cultures and scaffolds to test drugs, and monitor cytotoxic effects in vitro cell microenvironments and also as implantable tissues. In this review, we intend to enumerate the development in the field of μPADs, paper-based cell cultures, and paper-based scaffolds and their plethora of applications over the last decade."
