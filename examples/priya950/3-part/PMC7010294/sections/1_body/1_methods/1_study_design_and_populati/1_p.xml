<p>A qualitative study was conducted in the Colombian cities of Cali (situated in the south-west) and Villavicencio (situated in central-east) in 2018. Both locations have a tropical climate, with average daily mean temperatures ranging from 23.4–24.2°C and 24.2–26.7°C throughout the year in Cali and Villavicencio, respectively (meteorological data from the Insituto de Hidrologia Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales). The Colombian Departments of Valle de Cauca and Meta containing the cities of Cali and Villavicencio, respectively, experienced different Zika incidence between 2016–2017, with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reporting upper estimates of 40 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Meta and 605 cases per 100,000 in Valle de Cauca [

The study consisted of a series of 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) with female participants, and 14 one-to-one semi-structured interviews (SSI) with male participants. Participants fell into 3 categories: pregnant women, non-pregnant women of reproductive age, and their male partners. Pregnant and non-pregnant FGDs were held separately. In total, 10 FGDs were held with pregnant, and 9 with non-pregnant women. These FGDs took place in public institutions (such as libraries and health centers), contained between 2–11 participants (average of 7.5 per group) and lasted between 45–60 minutes. The focus group with only two participants was convened after the particular participants dropped out of their initially scheduled sessions. There were 14 one-to-one interviews with male participants, each lasting between 10–20 minutes. A total of 143 (71 pregnant and 72 non-pregnant) women, and 14 men consented to take part in the study. The female participants' ages ranged from 18 to 45 years, with an average age of 27.7 years. The male participants’ ages ranged from 19–58 with an average age of 36.7 years.
