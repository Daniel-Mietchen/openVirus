<p>Whilst conducting a partial retrospective study was necessary in order to gain insights into the knowledge and perceptions of Zika virus before and after the outbreak occurred in Colombia, studies of this kind can be problematic due to the reliance on participant memory and response. Responder opinions of their actions and awareness may be tainted by experiences that have occurred since the period they have been asked to reflect upon or the pressures felt at the time of being asked specific questions. These factors are likely to introduce responder and/or recall bias. The validity of this study is also at risk of ‘social interaction threat’, which is expected to occur within a focus group setting due to the social relationships and interactions present within this environment [

Despite this, due to the level of interpretation required to analyse qualitative data, there is still likely to be an element of researcher bias introduced by personal idiosyncrasies. In addition, issues around transferability may be apparent, since findings concluded are specific to the participants and may not be generalisable to alternate group in Colombia. Field notes were not taken and hence non-verbal information could not be considered. We believe this should not affect the results as recordings were available and transcripts were analysed by teams including the individuals performing the field work.
