<p>A number of laboratory studies have investigated the potential for using mosquito repelling compounds to protect against bites from 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. These include studies showing long-lasting protection from topical repellent applications [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and studies showing efficient protection from permethrin-impregnated fabrics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], including promising results from experimental hut trials [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, epidemiological data demonstrating impacts of impregnated clothing are still lacking. Mathematical modelling, considering populations of school children in Thailand wearing permethrin impregnated school uniforms, suggests that repellent clothing could have a significant impact on dengue transmission in that setting [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the model emphasized the importance of achieving high rates of uptake. There are a number of factors that could influence the uptake of a repellent clothing intervention, including an absence of disease awareness, a lack of full appreciation of disease risk, or anxieties over the safety of the repellent active ingredient itself [

The disparity between the diseases may be due, in part, to a greater historical familiarity with dengue. While Colombia has been experiencing epidemics of dengue for many decades, with thousands of cases of hemorrhagic dengue reported since the early 1990s [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Zika is relatively emergent, with the first cases reported in 2015. A perception of Zika as being of lower severity than dengue was also been reported among women of reproductive age in Peru, where Zika was ranked as the least severe of the mosquito-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although pregnant women were generally better informed about Zika than non-pregnant women and were more likely to consider Zika to be the arbovirus of primary personal concern, the FGDs revealed that some pregnant women were completely unaware of the possibility of congenital Zika. This lack of basic knowledge about Zika was further highlighted by a frequent conflation by participants of the Zika and chikungunya viruses. A lack of knowledge about congenital effects of Zika virus was also found among residents of communities in Honduras, where only 40% of respondents reported an awareness of a causal relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly in newborns [

Moreover, although most participants were able to correctly identify the bite of a mosquito as the primary infection route, sexual transmission was seldom mentioned. Particularly low levels of knowledge of sexual transmission have been noted in several other studies examining respondents from various countries including the US [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Honduras [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Peru [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These results reveal gaps in awareness of some of important aspects of Zika transmission and pathology in Colombia, and highlight the need to increase and refine public health messaging.
