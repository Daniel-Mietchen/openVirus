<p>However, achieving meaningful uptake of repellents and pyrethroid-impregnated clothing is likely to be a challenge even in the presence of enhanced messaging and education. A variety of social factors have been correlated with improved vector borne disease protection knowledge and practices and include high educational status, living in a stand-alone house and having a more advanced knowledge of a disease [

Participants identified community health workers as being particularly trusted sources of information, suggesting that teams comprising trained community members could provide educational sessions to pregnant women in future outbreaks. Furthermore, the capacity to implement appropriate personal mosquito control interventions is also based on an individualâ€™s economic capacity to purchase control products [

Some pregnant participants described not having sufficient income to purchase repellents, or reported allocating money to provide repellents for their children, while being unable to afford repellents for themselves or their partner. Similarly, a large proportion of women in a survey in Peru felt that the only preventative action for Zika was larval source reduction, since repellents were too expensive [

At risk populations may often be aware of the benefits of repellents, but may not necessarily have the financial means to purchase products and implement effective personal protection. To increase coverage, the federal government in Brazil implemented free distributions of insect repellents to low-income/at-risk individuals [
