<p>The Zika virus is a flavivirus, closely related to dengue, and is principally transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. Sexual contact is a secondary transmission route [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are competent Zika vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and are abundant in Colombia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with the former species responsible for most cases of urban Zika transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is a highly anthropophilic and aggressive day-time biter, often taking multiple human blood-meals in a short space of time [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Control of these vectors in Colombia largely focuses on the larviciding of domestic water containers and the cleaning-up of refuse that can collect water and act as larval breeding sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with the addition of emergency-response insecticidal spraying when outbreaks of vector-borne diseases are detected [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
