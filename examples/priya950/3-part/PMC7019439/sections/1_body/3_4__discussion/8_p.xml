<p>Seroprevalence studies in humans have shown that the risk of transmission from infected cattle to humans may be very high. Indeed, seroprevalence rates of 91% (HI assay) and 97% (VN assay) have been documented in cattle-workers, as opposed to 18% (on VN assay) in control subjects without contact with cattle [

The increased risk of transmission to humans is supported by the finding that the IDV hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein exhibits an open receptor-binding cavity, which forms the basis for its broad cell tropism and, consequently, its broad host tropism [
