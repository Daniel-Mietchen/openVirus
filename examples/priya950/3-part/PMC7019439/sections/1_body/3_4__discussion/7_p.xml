<p>To date, no indications that IDV can cause disease in humans have been found, but several groups have already signalled its potential threat as an emerging pathogen in specific target groups, such as cattle-workers [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or as a considerable public health risk [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This eventuality is supported by a number of findings by different groups. One of the main risks stems from the ability of the virus to infect and to be transmitted to a number of domestic mammal species, such as cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and camelids, and also to wild animals, such as feral pigs [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that IDV can infect ferrets, the gold standard for influenza studies in animals [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and guinea pigs, as shown by transmission studies [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
