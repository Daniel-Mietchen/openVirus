<p>The potential IDV circulation in pigs in Northern Italy in 2015 [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which was confirmed by PCR analysis, positive virus isolation, and increased IDV specific HI antibody responses in animals from the farms affected, may have been associated with an increase in IDV HI-specific antibodies in humans from 25.7% in 2015 to 33.9% in 2016. These data also indicate that there could have been undetected IDV circulation in pigs and/or cattle already in 2007 and reflect a confirmed outbreak in cattle in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], since the seroprevalence of HI specific antibodies in humans increased from 9.8% in 2007 to 37.9% in 2008 and from 19.6% in 2012 to 41.0% in 2013.
