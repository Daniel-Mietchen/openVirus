<p>These data clearly show that seroprevalence against IDV increased in Italy from 2005 to 2017. This increase was not constant over the years, it shows sharp rises in some years followed by drops in subsequent years. The seroprevalence peaks detected in humans appear to follow IDV epidemics in animals, as an epidemic in cattle in France in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an outbreak in pigs in Italy in 2015 [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have been reported. Moreover, as the titres did not remain high in the years following the increase, but dropped to lower levels, we could speculate that a spill over event from an animal reservoir occurred, and that the virus does not circulate primarily in humans. However, IDV proved able to elicit an immune response in humans. The background seropositivity rate in the population was higher in 2017 (11.9%) than in 2005 (5.1%), although this difference did not prove statistically significant. Follow-up studies over the next couples of years should be performed in order to determine whether the titres drop further to levels below 10% over the years or remain at a higher level than that observed in 2005. In addition, cattle and pigs should be carefully observed and analysed with respect to potential new outbreaks, which could be followed by an increase in IDV-specific antibodies in humans in the subsequent year.
