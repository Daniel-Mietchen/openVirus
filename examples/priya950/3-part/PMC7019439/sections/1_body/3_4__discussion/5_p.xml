<p>Although IDV was first isolated from a diseased pig in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], this virus is notable for being the first influenza virus identified in cattle [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is supported by evidences of past infection in cattle from the same farm as the diseased pig. Finally, additional studies revealed cows to be the primary reservoir [
