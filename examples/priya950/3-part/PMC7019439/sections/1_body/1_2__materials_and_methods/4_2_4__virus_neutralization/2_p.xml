<p>Serum samples, including positive and negative controls, previously heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and tested in duplicate, were two-fold diluted with EMEM culture medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum in a 96-well plate and mixed with an equal volume of virus (100 TCID50/well). After 1 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the mixture was added to the MDCK cell suspension (1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL). Plates were read for HA activity in the supernatant after three days of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
