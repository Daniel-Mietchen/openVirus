<p>The HI assay was performed as described in Hause et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. All serum samples, including positive and negative controls, were pre-treated with receptor-destroying enzyme from Vibrio Cholerae (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) (ratio 1:5) followed by heat inactivation for 1 h at 56 Â°C. Serum samples were tested in duplicate by using turkey red blood cells (0.35%). The antibody titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that showed complete inhibition of agglutination. Since the starting dilution was 1:10, when the titre was below the detectable threshold, the results were conventionally expressed as 5 for calculation purposes [
