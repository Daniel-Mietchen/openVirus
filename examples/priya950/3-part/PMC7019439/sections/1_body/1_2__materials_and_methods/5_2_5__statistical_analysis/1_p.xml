<p>According to the definition of seropositivity used for other newly emerging viruses, all positive serological responses (HI titres ≥1:10) were classified as seropositive, while non-detectable HI responses (&lt;1:10) were regarded as negative and arbitrarily expressed as a value of 5 [

For the purpose of direct comparison of HI and virus neutralization (VN) assays, the proportions for each category of titres were calculated by applying the total number of serum samples tested in the HI and VN assays. Calculation of the 95% confidence intervals for the proportions was based on the Clopper–Pearson exact method [
