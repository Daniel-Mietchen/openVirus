<p>For positive and highly positive titres, the Pearson’s Chi-squared test was used to verify the significant differences among the proportions of titres between the two assays across years, and to make yearly-based comparisons of the observed proportions for each assay. The Marascuilo procedure was used for the post-hoc analysis, which accounts for multiple comparisons. Relative changes of proportions were evaluated in relation to the value of the proportion measured for 2005, the first year tested, which was used as the base year for the analysis. The Hodrick–Prescott filter, with a smoothness penalty parameter
