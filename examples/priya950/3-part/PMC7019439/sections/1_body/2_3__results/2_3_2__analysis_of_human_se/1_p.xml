<p>A total of 1281 human serum samples, collected randomly from adults in the Italian regions of Tuscany and Apulia from 2005 to 2017, were tested by HI assay in order to detect the presence of antibodies against IDV. The results clearly show that IDV specific HI antibodies were present in at least a small subset of serum samples taken in every single year between 2005 and 2017, although IDV was isolated and described for the first time in 2011 ((A) in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00030-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). IDV antibodies displayed low levels, between 5.1% and 9.8%, in the years 2005–2007, followed by a sharp increase in 2008; the highest levels (33.9–46.0%) were reached in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016, while the lowest levels (11.9–25.7%) were seen in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2017.
