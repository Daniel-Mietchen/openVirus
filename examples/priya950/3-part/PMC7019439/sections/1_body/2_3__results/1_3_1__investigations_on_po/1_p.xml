<p>The specificity of the HI assay with respect to the potential cross-reactivity between IDV and ICV was evaluated by testing both viral antigens against IDV and ICV specific hyper-immune antisera generated in swine and rooster. As shown in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00030-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, no cross-reaction between IDV and ICV was observed. The anti-serum specific for the D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain showed a high HI titre (1:10,240) as did the anti-serum specific for the C/Victoria/2/2012 (HI titre 1:640). No HI titres were detectable when the hyper-immune antisera were tested against the respective heterologous influenza C or D strain. These results demonstrated the specificity of the IDV HI assay and were therefore used for the analysis of the presence of IDV-specific antibodies in human serum samples.
