<p>Differences between the HI and VN assays proportions in homologous class of titres were not significant. By contrast, the analysis of proportions among years showed significant differences for both assays in each class of titres (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00030">Table S2</xref>). Comparisons of the titre proportions over years were conducted on each class of titres except the negative class, as this class is overtly complementary to the positive (≥1:10) class of titres (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00030">Table S3</xref>). In the HI assay, the proportions of titres ≥1:10 in the first three years (2005–2007) proved to be almost always lower than the values measured in the other years. The proportion observed in the year 2017 significantly differed only when compared with the values recorded for the years 2010–2014.
