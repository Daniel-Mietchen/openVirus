<p>Likewise, in the VN assay, the proportions in the years 2005 and 2006 proved to be almost always different from the proportions in the other years. The 2007 value, however, was significantly different only when compared with the values for the years 2013–2014, as well as the 2017 value. Significant differences in the proportions of HI titres ≥1:20 were identified only between the peak values (in 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014) and the values recorded in the first two years, 2005 and 2006. Regarding the class of highly positive titres (≥1:40), there was not enough evidence to identify significance on pairwise comparisons of proportions.</p>
