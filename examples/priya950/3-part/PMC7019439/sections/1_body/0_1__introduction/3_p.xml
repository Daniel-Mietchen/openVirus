<p>The prevalence of antibodies against IDV in domestic pigs ranges from 9.5% to 11.7% [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], indicating that the virus is able to circulate among domestic pigs, but is not yet widespread [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A similar IDV antibody prevalence has also been reported in horses in the Midwest United States [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A higher seroprevalence (19.1%) has been found in feral pigs, which could have been due to the increased chances of having contact with various domestic and wild animals and, hence, a higher exposure to IDV [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Seroprevalence of antibodies against IDV increases substantially especially in newborn calves, as a result of maternal antibodies, and in older cattle. As the level of maternal antibodies declines, calves become more susceptible to IDV infection; this increases the risk of active transmission and the potential to create a virus reservoir [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, IDV can be efficiently transmitted among cattle by direct contact [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The presence of IDV in pigs and cattle has also been reported in Italy, where it has been confirmed by PCR and virus isolation, as well as serological analysis for the presence of IDV specific haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Specifically, a study conducted in the swine population in Northern Italy revealed a high prevalence (11.7%) of antibodies against IDV in 2015, which demonstrated significantly increased seroprevalence compared to the reported rate in 2009 (prevalence 0.6%) [
