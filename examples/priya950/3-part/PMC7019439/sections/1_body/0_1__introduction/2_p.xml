<p>Several epidemiological and serological studies have reported the isolation of IDV in cattle from many geographic areas (Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Mexico, Luxemburg, Ireland, France and China), suggesting that cattle may be a primary natural reservoir for the virus [

IDV has also been identified in other animal species, such as sheep, goats, camelids and horses across countries in different continents (Europe, North America, Africa and Asia), but there is no evidence of infections in chickens and turkeys [
