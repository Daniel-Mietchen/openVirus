<p>Effective and sustainable vector control is the current challenge to reduce the burden of dengue in the population. In order to achieve this, integrated and alternative vector control strategies are needed [

 <xref rid="pone.0228346.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The importance of intersectoral actions is reiterated and popular participation is encouraged. It is from this perspective that the global strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) for dengue prevention aims to reduce mortality rates by 50% by 2020. These measures will be carried out, in particular, through early diagnosis and appropriate management of severe cases. Measures should also be taken to reduce morbidity by 25% by better outbreak prediction and detection through integrated management of epidemiological and entomological surveillance of vector control and combat [

Using the integrated vector management approach using community-based methods and adapted to the local context is one of the strategies recommended to achieve these goals. In order to boost vector control and combat capacity worldwide, WHO has developed the Global Vector Control Response 2017–2030 [

This plan provides guidance and strategies to countries to strengthen vector control, focused on four pillars: (1) integrated vector and disease surveillance, (2) vector control, (3) community engagement and mobilization, and (4) inter- and intra-sectoral collaboration.
