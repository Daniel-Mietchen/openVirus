<p>Similar results on the occurrence of dengue in the Brazilian regions and the positive relationship with population density and climate were reported by Dias [
 <xref rid="pone.0228346.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Brazilian geographic regions present seasonality associated with the incidence of dengue, with peaks generally observed during the warmer and humid months [

 <xref rid="pone.0228346.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings demonstrate how dengue is widespread in the tropics and subtropics, with risk factors influenced by local spatial variations in rainfall, temperature, humidity, and urbanization [

Even with fewer cases recorded in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (temperate climate), attention should be paid to climate change and to dengue cases in these regions. However, attention should be given to this region not only for climate conditions but could serve to identify potentialities and potential weaknesses of the National Dengue Control Program (

 <italic>PNCD</italic>). Evidence has pointed to an increasing epidemic potential of dengue in temperate regions, influenced by the increase of diurnal temperature range (DTR) [
