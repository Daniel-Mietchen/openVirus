<p>Epigenetic regulatory mechanism, which includes DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications (PTM), leads to chromatin remodelling and regulated gene expression. Chromatin remodelling represents a critical process through which inputs, such as light or food, are transduced by the cell to generate permissive and silencing histone modifications to influence gene transcription and ultimately signalling pathway activity. CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent activation of clock-controlled genes is connected to circadian changes in histone PTM at their own promoters. Numerous chromatin remodelers, such as the deacetylases Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), are recruited to the promoter region of the clock-controlled genes in a circadian manner [

Importantly, the core element of the clockwork machinery, the transcription factor CLOCK, displays histone acetyltransferase activity as well. In the absence of these chromatin modifiers, the rhythmic expression of the clock-controlled genes is abrogated [

One of the most common epigenetic modifications is the methylation of DNA (addition of a methyl group to the cytosine residue in CpG dinucleotides mediated by the family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b). Overall DNA methylation with focal hypermethylation on the promoter of tumour suppressor genes, causing transcriptional silencing, is a mechanism of carcinogenesis [
