<p>The efficacy of vaccination is also thought to be under circadian control as suggested by results obtained in mice and human studies. Silver et al. have shown in immunized mice that vaccination at the time of higher TLR9 (Toll-like receptor 9) expression led to enhanced immune response, likely due to the circadian expression pattern of TLR9 [

Likewise, the antibody response to viral challenge in humans was also reported to be time dependent: immunization with hepatitis A and influenza virus vaccines in the morning led to higher antibody response as compared to afternoon vaccination [
