<p>In addition, the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ compete with RORα, RORβ, and RORγ at ROR-binding elements (ROREs) in the promoter region of

The CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer activates another auxiliary loop operated by the PAR-bZip transcription factors D-Box Binding PAR BZIP (DBP), Thyrotrophic Embryonic Factor (TEF), and Hepatic Leukemia Factor (HLF); bind to D-box-containing sites within the promoter region of the transcriptional repressor NFIL3 (alias E4BP4); and prompts numerous downstream transcriptional events [
