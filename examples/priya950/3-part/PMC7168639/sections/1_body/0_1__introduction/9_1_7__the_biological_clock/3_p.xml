<p>Furthermore, the time of day of virus infection crucially impacts the outcome of IAV and this effect is observed under different types of light–dark cycles (12-h light/12-h darkness versus constant darkness), as well as in genetic circadian disruption models. The time of infection impacted late-viral clearance and IAV survival in

Analysis of the 24-h time-resolved RNA sequencing performed on laser-captured AECs indicates that extensive transcriptomic changes in circadian enriched pathways are linked to lipid metabolism, xenobiotic detoxification, extracellular matrix, and chemokine signalling [
