<p>Even though much has been investigated in the circadian clock/immune system field in recent years, several open and outstanding questions remain to be addressed. Are different branches of the immune system differentially regulated by circadian rhythms? If autonomous ticking is dampened in peripheral tissues, do peripheral immune cells alter their rhythms/responses relative to immune cells in the thymus and lymph nodes? Do responses to vaccines that need boosters show different time-dependent patterns? Would different adjuvants boost vaccine responses in a time-of-day-dependent manner? Does deregulation of circadian rhythms correlate with reactivation of viruses known to cause latent infections (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, human herpesvirus 7, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, JC virus, BK virus, parvovirus, and adenovirus)? Do hibernating animal species mount different antiviral responses during hibernation? These are extremely interesting topics for future research, and the answers to the questions above will help pave new directions in the study of circadian–immune network interactions in the context of viral infections.</p>
