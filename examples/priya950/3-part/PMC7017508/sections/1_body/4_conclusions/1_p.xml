<p id="Par39">We identified the annual and seasonal patterns of causative pathogens in children with CAP requiring hospitalization. Throughout the study period, MP and RSV were the most common causes of CAP, with cyclic peaks in specific seasons. The disease burden due to pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization is largely due to RSV pneumonia, especially in infants and young children. The relatively lower rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, contrary to the known high prevalence of macrolide-refractory MP pneumonia, highlights the appropriate treatment strategies for patients with MP pneumonia. The results of the present study may aid in establishing treatment and management strategies for pediatric CAP and policies to reduce the disease burden by improving public health policies for children with CAP.</p>
