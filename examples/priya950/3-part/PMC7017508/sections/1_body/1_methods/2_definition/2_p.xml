<p id="Par25">The clinical courses of MP pneumonia have shown heterogeneous features, even in patients with the same in vitro sensitivity to macrolide results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some previous studies have shown no significant differences in clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features between children with macrolide-resistant MP pneumonia and those with MSMP pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the present study, MP susceptibility tests for macrolides were not performed. Instead, to characterize the clinically heterogeneous MP pneumonia into more homogenous clinical groups, we defined clinical MSMP, macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP), and macrolide less-effective MP (MLEP) pneumonia according to fever duration in each pneumonia episode after the initiation of macrolides, regardless of the sensitivity test for macrolides, as follows: fever for less than 3 days, fever for more than 7 days, and more than 3 days but less than 7 days, respectively.
