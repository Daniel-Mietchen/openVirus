<p id="Par35">In the present study, we found that RSV was the most common cause of CAP in children younger than 2â€‰years of age, which is consistent with the findings of other studies performed in other countries, regardless of the detection methods used or national income levels of the children who were analyzed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The immune response in RSV infection differs according to age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Notably, inefficient and ineffective immune responses in early life contribute to more severe clinical courses and higher incidence of RSV infection; this is especially problematic in infants, who are most frequently affected by RSV pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These findings may be valuable to guide therapeutic approaches, such as application of immune-modulatory drugs for enhancement of immune responses, and preventive strategies for children with CAP; moreover, the results of the present study suggest that the development of strategies to prevent RSV infection, especially in infants and younger children, might aid in decreasing the worldwide disease burden due to CAP.
