<p id="Par36">The number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia was typically highest between October and November. In the previous studies, the peak incidence of MP pneumonia showed a similar pattern to that observed in the present study, regardless of age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, in the 2011 Korean epidemic, the peak rate of hospitalization due to MP pneumonia in children occurred in September, whereas the peak rate in the 2015 epidemic occurred in November. In addition, the number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia in the 2015 epidemic was smaller than that in the 2011 epidemic. These findings were consistent with the results of another study [
