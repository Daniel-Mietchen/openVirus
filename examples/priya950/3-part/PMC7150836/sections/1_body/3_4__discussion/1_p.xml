<p>Our study shows that multiple RNA viruses that were initially detected in honey bees or Argentine ants infect a range of pollinators and associated arthropods. We have added to the growing body of evidence of bee viruses infecting and replicating in non-
 <italic>Apis</italic> hosts. To our knowledge, this work represents the first study to confirm active LhuBLV1 and MKV infections in arthropod hosts by detecting the positive and negative viral strand intermediate, respectively. Virus replication in novel hosts is a key contributor in disease emergence; nevertheless, even hosts without active virus replication may show active virus replication at a different time [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The arthropods we examined typically did not display any symptoms of viral infection. The absence of obvious symptoms is common in dicistroviruses like BQCV and KBV [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], yet there may be negative effects on the host. For example, covert KBV infections in bumble bees reduce reproduction [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and DWV-infected honey bees rarely display wing deformities, although covert infections reduce foraging and long-term survival [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To which extent these viruses affect hosts other than bees is not well characterised and remains to be investigated [
