<p>In case of the more recently discovered viruses, such as MKV and LhuBLV1, the knowledge of disease symptoms, dynamics, or host range is very limited [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Studies suggest that the predatory wasp

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We confirmed active MKV replication in three different wasp species and an overall high prevalence in Vespinae, supporting the potential virus reservoir. Negative sense ssRNA viruses of the Bunyavirales family are found in many species, including LhuBLV1 in Argentine ants [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> Bunyavirus 1 and 2 in honey bees [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We detected the positive strand intermediate of LhuBLV1 in Argentine ants but not in any other host. LhuBLV1 did not seem specific to Argentine ants, as four other species were found virus positive. Yet, no pollinator species tested positive for this virus, making LhuBLV1 unlikely to be an emerging virus that poses a risk on pollinator communities.
