<p>DWV appears to be the most prevalent honey bee pathogen, occurring in approximately 55% of colonies worldwide [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We found high DWV prevalence in honey bees but also in Argentine ants. The list of DWV hosts is long [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We add to it by reporting the first DWV case in the order Orthoptera (
 <italic>Bobilla</italic>) and in New Zealand native Hymenoptera (
 <italic>Xanthocryptus novozealandicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sphictostethus nitidus</italic>), Coleoptera (
