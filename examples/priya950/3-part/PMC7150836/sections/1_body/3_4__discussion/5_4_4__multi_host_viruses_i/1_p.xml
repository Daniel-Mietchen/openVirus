<p>Single-stranded RNA viruses have been considered to be the most likely type of pathogen to jump between species and cause disease outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that could devastate wild pollinator populations. High mutation rates in RNA viruses result in virus populations with high variation amongst genotypes [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Over time, multi-host parasites can evolve into different species-specialist strains or populations, or remain a generalist parasite with lower than optimal virulence [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For multi-host viruses, a lack of host specificity may result in a trade-off between virulence in different hosts that depends on the host quality and availability [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Whether a virus that invades a new host causes an emerging disease or only a minor outbreak depends factors, such as its ability to replicate in a novel host and transmission routes [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
