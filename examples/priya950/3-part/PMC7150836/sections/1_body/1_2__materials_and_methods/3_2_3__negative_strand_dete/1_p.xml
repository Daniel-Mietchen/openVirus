<p>DWV, KBV, MKV, and LhuBLV1-positive samples were further analysed for active virus infection. Strand-specific RT-PCR allows for detection of the negative strand, which in +ssRNA viruses (DWV, KBV, MKV) indicates active replication and parasitism of host cells by the virus [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, the positive strand in an -ssRNA virus (LhuBLV1) functions as mRNA for protein production or as a template to produce new â€“ssRNA and indicates an active infection [
