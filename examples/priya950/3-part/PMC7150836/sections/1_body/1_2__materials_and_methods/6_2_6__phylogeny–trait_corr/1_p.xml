<p>Phylogeny–trait association analysis was used to test to which extent phenotypic traits of a viral strain, such as host species or geographic location, are correlated with shared ancestry [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and monophyletic clade (MC) scores of dated and non-dated phylogenies were computed using BaTS (Bayesian tip-association significance testing) beta build 2 [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] by comparing a null model of random trait–tip assignments to the known trait distribution. BaTS accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty by testing many trees from the posterior distribution. Trait–tip association analyses were run with 500 replicates (500 random trees from the dated Bayesian phylogenetic analysis) to estimate a null distribution for each statistic.
