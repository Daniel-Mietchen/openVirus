<p>RT-PCR products were visualised on a 2% agarose gel (1.5% for DWV) stained with SYBR™ Safe DNA stain (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and run alongside a TrackIt 100-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A subset of positive samples were cleaned using ExoSAP-IT™ (Applied Biosystems™, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and sent for Sanger sequencing to Macrogen Inc (Seoul, South Korea). This subset included at least one virus positive sample for every arthropod species for each virus. Sequences were confirmed using a BLASTn search (
