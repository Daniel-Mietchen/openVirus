<p>Samples were screened for four +ssRNA viruses, DWV, BQCV, KBV, and MKV, and an –ssRNA virus, LhuBLV1, using RT-PCR. MKV has only recently been discovered in wasps and bees [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A preliminary screening of a pooled sample for the seven Argentine ant viruses discovered by Viljakainen et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] concluded that only the –ssRNA virus LhuBLV1 was hosted by insects other than Argentine ants and was therefore included in the analysis. Individual whole arthropod samples were homogenized in 1000 µL (ants in 500 µL) Trizol™ (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNA was extracted and precipitated using isopropanol following the “Trizol™ extraction” protocol as recommended in the COLOSS bee book [
