<p>Sequences were trimmed and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in Geneious v11.1.5 [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. MEGA v.10.1 [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was used to find the best substitution model using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores, determining HKY+G as the best model for both viruses. Final alignments were 440 bp in the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region for DWV and 360 bp in the 
 <italic>vp3</italic> region for KBV.
