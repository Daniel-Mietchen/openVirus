<p>All viruses, except BQCV which was only detected in honey bees, were tested for virus replication, or active virus infections in the case of LhuBLV1. Active LhuBLV1 infection was only found in Argentine ants while all +ssRNA viruses replicated in multiple species (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Fourteen different species tested positive for DWV; active viral replication could be confirmed for five of them (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For KBV, 5 out of the 9 virus positive species showed active replication and MKV replication was confirmed in 5 out of 10 species including the 
 <italic>Polistes</italic> and 
 <italic>Vespula</italic> species tested (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The negative strand RT-PCR assay is highly conservative and can only confirm the presence of the negative strand intermediate, which is indicative of viral replication but does not allow the exclusion of the possibility for replication.
