<p>Out of the five viruses tested, up to four were found to co-infect individual workers of Argentine ants and honey bees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00358-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The most prevalent viruses were DWV in honey bees (100%, 95% CI: 94%–100%) and LhuBLV1 in Argentine ants (78%, 95% CI: 61%–90%) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). LhuBLV1 was only detected in Argentine ants and associated arthropods in two sites that had ant nests, indicating that other species can host this virus, or that its detection on other arthropods could have resulted from contamination. Only Argentine ants tested positive for the mRNA intermediate of LhuBLV1, suggesting that this virus may be 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> specific. Interestingly, all ants that tested positive for DWV were sampled from a nest in an apiary (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Figure S1</xref>, site WAI). In a test of proportions, DWV was more prevalent in bees than in ants (Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 35.98, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), KBV was more prevalent in ants than in bees (Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 6.69, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.010), and MKV infections were not significantly different between the two species (Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.689) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). MKV was found at a high prevalence in Vespinae species (n= 17, 88% infected, 95% CI: 65%–98%); this group also showed a KBV prevalence similar to honey bees (24%, 95% CI: 8%–49%).
