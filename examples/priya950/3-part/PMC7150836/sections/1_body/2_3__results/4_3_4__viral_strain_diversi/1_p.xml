<p>Using BLAST searches, we confirmed the virus identity and identified locations and hosts infected with viral strains most similar to those observed in our samples. BLAST searches showed that BQCV most closely matched the polyprotein of BQCV found in a honey bee in Lithuania (KP223790) (96% identity, 100% query cover). The MKV sequences from 10 different species showed little sequence variation; all sequences derived in this study closely matched (99%–100% identity, 97%–100% query cover) the MKV polyprotein found in 
 <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> in Belgium (MF346349) and 
 <italic>Vespula pensylvanica</italic> from Hawaii (KU645789). LhuBLV1 most closely matched the putative 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> complex gene of the only available LhuBLV1 sequences on GenBank (MH213237) from Argentine ants from Spain (100% identity, 95% query cover).
