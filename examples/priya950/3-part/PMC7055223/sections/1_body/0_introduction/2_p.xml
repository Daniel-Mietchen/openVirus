<p id="Par3">The World Health Organization lists Dengue virus (DENV) as the most common mosquito-borne viral disease with CHIKV, YFV and JEV as other arboviruses being endemic in various parts of the world. The majority of human population that resides in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world is at risk for at least one of these arboviral infections. These pathogens are transmitted via vectors that are found in overlapping geographical regions;

 </sup>. Furthermore, the clinical symptoms of infection with these viruses can be remarkably similar making differential diagnosis difficult

 </sup>. Hence, an effective control of these viruses requires active vaccination in endemic areas and in the most vulnerable populations. Currently, a live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccine for YFV and a LAV as well as a killed JEV vaccine is available for use in humans

 </sup>. However, these vaccines utilize viral strains from the early 70â€‰s and have limitations including safety and availability. Similarly, a tetravalent LAV vaccine for Dengue has recently been approved with limited success and much controversy regarding its effectiveness
