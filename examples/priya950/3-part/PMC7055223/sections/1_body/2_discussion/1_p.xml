 </sup>. While the incidence of arboviruses is on the rise, there is a lack of specific treatment for these diseases. Thus, there is a combined effort on prevention of infection by controlling the mosquito and tick vector populations, reducing mosquito and tick bites, travel advisories etc. However, such measures largely rely on availability of ample resources and human compliance and hence have proven less effective
