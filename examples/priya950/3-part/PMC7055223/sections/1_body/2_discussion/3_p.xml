 </sup>. These particles provide several advantages over other vaccine platforms including 1) resemble native viruses thereby providing repetitive antigens on the surface of VLPs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. 2) Are replication incompetent making them safe to use in immunocompromised populations. 3) Ease as well as consistency of production using stable cell lines provides easy scale up and commercialization. A VLP vaccine against CHIKV has shown efficacy in animal models and has now progressed to human trials

 </sup>. Similarly a ZIKV VLP vaccine has been tested in our lab in small animal model and shown to generate high titer neutralizing antibodies that protect against live virus challenge

 </sup>. While a number of arboviral VLPs have been developed including some for JEV and DENV, most of these studies utilize prME expression and the particles lack Capsid protein
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. The inclusion of Capsid protein in all of our VLP preps provides an additional antigen and better immunogenicity as evident from our Zika studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, previous studies on arboviral VLPs including CHIKV have been conducted in monovalent forms and there is no study on whether a multivalent VLP vaccine against related arboviruses would provide effective immunity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Our study was geared towards determining whether a multivalent VLP formulation encompassing CHIKV, JEV, YFV and ZIKV would provide effective neutralizing response against all four viruses. The use of multivalent VLPs from closely related viruses is not unprecedented and in fact, the current Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) VLP vaccine is a 9 valent vaccine against HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and cost effectiveness of this multivalent VLP vaccine
