<p id="Par21">In previous studies, our group has developed a prME and CprME VLP vaccine against ZIKV and demonstrated the superiority of Capsid protein containing VLP vaccine (CprME) over VLPs without capsid (prME)

 </sup>. We have also developed a strategy to generate Capsid protein containing VLPs for ZIKV using a bicistronic vector that expresses the structural proteins CprME as well as the Zika NS2B3 protease. This bicistronic vector helped us establish stable cell lines that are high secretors of Zika CprME VLPs

 </sup>. In this study, we modified the bicistronic vector by replacing CprME region of ZIKV with that of YFV or JEV. Interestingly, ZIKV NS2B3 was effective at cleaving C from prME for both JEV and YFV allowing us to use the vector to establish stable cell lines. We used a self-inactivating lentiviral system with Blasticidin resistance gene to generate stable single cell clones of 293â€‰T cells secreting VLPs for the above four viruses. Extensive characterization showed that the cell lines were stable, produced VLPs relatively consistently either in the presence or absence of Blasticidin and could be scaled up to higher density cultures like five layer multiflasks or suspension cells for VLP production.
