<p id="Par22">Although use of multilayer flasks and other modified surface cell culture vessels are available for adherent cell expansion; the adaptation of adherent cells to suspension growth can be efficient strategy to scale up production to bioreactors. 293 T cells are amiable to adaptation to suspension growth using specialized media and culture conditions

 </sup>. We were able to adapt all of our stable cell lines to grow in 293 T Ex Cell serum free media in shaker cultures with no reduction in VLP production compared to adherent cells. Furthermore, the use of serum free media provides an added advantage of eliminating animal origin products for commercial production of VLPs using these adapted cells in bioreactors.
