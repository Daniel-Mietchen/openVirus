<p id="Par23">Immunization studies in Balb/c mice showed that the VLPs (monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent) generated neutralizing antibodies as determined via RVP based assay. Further, confirmation of the neutralizing potential will need to be conducted using infectious virus. We also find a dose dependent response against the antigen as tetravalent formulations had 1/4
 <sup>th</sup> the amount of each antigen (total protein) compared to the monovalent vaccine. The tetravalent vaccine hence generated a comparatively lower neutralizing antibody titer determined by RVP based neutralization assays and anti E antibodies determined via immunoprecipitation. These findings are important as this suggests that the amount of antigen/VLPs from each virus can be adjusted to achieve desired neutralizing efficacy. However, in order to achieve this, it will be important to determine the precise antigen amount of each VLP in the multivalent mix preferably as E antigen equivalents. The effectiveness of the VLPs in different combinations as bivalent or tetravalent combinations also shows the versatility of the system and the possibility of tailoring the vaccine to different geographical regions. Overall, our study provides a significant advancement both in terms of VLP vaccines as well as the strategy of using multivalent VLP vaccine candidates to target arboviruses. Further studies in appropriate animal models are needed to determine if the neutralizing antibody titers elicited upon immunization with the multivalent VLP vaccine are able to protect against a lethal virus challenge.
