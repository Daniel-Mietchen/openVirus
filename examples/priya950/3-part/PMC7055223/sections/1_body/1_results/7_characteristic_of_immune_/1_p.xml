<p id="Par16">Our data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> clearly demonstrates that immunization of mice with monovalent, bivalent and tetravalent CJaYZ vaccine induces a potent neutralizing antibody response. We next looked at the characteristic of specific antibodies generated in immunized mice. For this, cell lysates form ZIKV, JEV, YFV and CHIKV VLP secreting stable cell lines were immunoprecipitated with pooled sera derived from different groups of immunized mice. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and consistent with the neutralizing antibody data, the CHIKV monovalent VLP vaccine generated the strongest antibody titers followed by the bivalent and tetravalent combinations. Interestingly, for CHIKV, generation of Capsid antibodies was highly robust and also followed a declining pattern in the bivalent and tetravalent combinations. This clearly demonstrates the presence of Capsid protein in CHIKV VLPs and generation of an anti-Capsid immune response upon immunization. For YFV, JEV and ZIKV

Overall, these data demonstrate the generation of specific YFV, JEV ZIKV and CHIKV E, prM and Capsid antibodies upon immunization with the multivalent VLP vaccine.
