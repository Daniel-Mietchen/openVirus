<p id="Par17">Commercial success of VLP vaccines is predicated on culture of large volume of cell lines in bioreactors. Moreover, propagation of cells in serum free media facilities exclusion of unwanted proteins present in serum. Although 293 T based cell lines produced in our study produce copious amounts of VLPs, the adaptation of these cells to suspension growth would facilitate commercial success of the vaccine platform. 293 T cells are amenable to suspension adaptation using specialized media and specific culture conditions

 <bold>)</bold>. This is likely due to the growth of cells to higher density in suspension culture compared to adherent cells. These data demonstrate the feasibility of stable cell lines to be adapted to suspension growth in the absence of serum proteins which secrete high concentrations of VLPs in the culture supernatants.
