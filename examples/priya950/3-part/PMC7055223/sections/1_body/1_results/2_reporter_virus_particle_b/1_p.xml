 </sup>. These pseudovirions are capable of infecting cells once in a manner identical to the native virus but are non-replicating. In case of flaviviruses, the structural proteins (CprME) from a separate plasmid can complement a subgenomic WNV replicon expressing a GFP reporter gene to generate RVPs. This RVP based system has been shown to work well for different flaviviruses including WNV and Zika
