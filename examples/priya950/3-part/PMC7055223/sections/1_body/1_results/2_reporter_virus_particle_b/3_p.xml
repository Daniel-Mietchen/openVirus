<p id="Par10">Having developed RVP based infectivity assays for Zika, JEV, YFV and CHKV, we next asked if infection via RVPs was Env specific and if it could be inhibited via specific sera. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A–D</xref> there was good neutralization of individual RVPs in the presence of specific sera in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, no inhibition of JEV, YFV, ZIKV and CHIKV RVPs was seen in the presence of matched control sera. These data demonstrate that the RVP based assay is highly sensitive and specific and can be effectively used for detection of a neutralizing antibody response.
