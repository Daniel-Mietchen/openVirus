 </sup>, demonstrated that HIV reporter particles pseudotyped with CHIKV Env generate a specific and sensitive RVP system that can be used for neutralizing antibody detection. To develop CHIKV RVPs, pcDNA3.1 vector expressing the Env region was co-transfected with HIV NL.LucR-E- vector to generate luciferase expressing CHIKV pseudotyped RVPs. Once again, infection of Vero cells in the presence of serial dilutions of CHIKV RVPs showed a dose dependent luciferase signal
