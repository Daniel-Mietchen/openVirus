<p id="Par6">To develop a multivalent arboviral vaccine, we first designed structural protein expression vectors for the above viruses. For ZIKV, YFV and JEV it included the CprME genes and for CHIKV the C-E3-E2-E1 genes. We have previously developed a VLP based platform for Zika Virus using a codon optimized synthetic gene construct

 </sup> and used a similar approach for developing structural protein constructs for the other arboviruses with minor modifications. We developed a consensus sequence for CHIKV, JEV and YFV to include the most representative circulating virus sequences in our vaccine platform. Full length genomic sequences from the ViPR database were used to generate a consensus sequence using DNAStar software. This consensus sequence was then used to generate a codon optimized expression vector spanning the structural proteins of CHIKV, JEV and YFV. Codon optimized sequences were synthesized commercially and cloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector and tested for protein expression. As demonstrated in Fig.
