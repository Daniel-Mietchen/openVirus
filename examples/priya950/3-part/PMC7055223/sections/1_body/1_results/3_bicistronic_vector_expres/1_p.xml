 </sup>. In order to produce CprME VLPs, NS2B3 expression can be achieved either in trans as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> above or from a bicistronic vector. The use of lentiviral vectors to stably transduce cells provides a much needed advantage for generation of VLP secreting cell lines. We have previously developed a biscistronic vector that co-expresses ZIKV CprME and NS2B3 using an IRES sequence between the ORFs

 </sup>. We used the same vector to replace Zika CprME with either JEV or YFV CprME and tested them for VLP production. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the bicistronic vectors resulted in robust production of JEV and YFV VLPs in the supernatant that show incorporation of Capsid protein. Moreover, the CHKV lentiviral vector also showed robust VLP secretion in the culture supernatants. Thus, a bicistronic vector expressing flaviviral CprME and Zika NS2B3 robustly secretes Capsid protein containing VLPs into the supernatant.
