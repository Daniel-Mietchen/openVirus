 </sup>. Plasmid containing the WNV NS2B3 accessory fusion protein expressing the active protease was a kind gift from Dr. Frank Scholle (NC State Univ.) pNL4-3 R-E- plasmid was kindly provided by the AIDS reagent program. JEV and YFV CprME regions were developed based on a consensus sequence generated using full length genomic sequences available from the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) database. The consensus sequence was translated and the amino acid sequence of the CprME region was codon optimized and synthesized using gene synthesis (GenScript Inc.). The synthetic genes were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ expression vector. A codon optimized Zika NS2B3 containing an HA Tag and IRES sequence was synthesized by GenScript Inc. using gene synthesis technology and has been described previously

 </sup>. This construct was subcloned downstream of the CprME cassette in the lentiviral vector pLentiZikaCprME to generate pLentiZika CprME-IRES-NS2B3

 </sup>. To generate YFV and JEV bicistronic constructs, the Zika CprME in the pLentiZikaCprME vector was replaced with YFV and JEV CprME respectively. The NS2B-3 open reading frame was also cloned into pcDNA3.1+ vector using the directional pcDNA3.1 TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) to generate Zika-NS2B3.
