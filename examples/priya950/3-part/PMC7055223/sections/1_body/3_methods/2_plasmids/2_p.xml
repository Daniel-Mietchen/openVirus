<p id="Par26">A similar approach was taken to generate CHIKV structural protein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) from a consensus sequence that was further codon optimized and gene synthesized. The CHIKV synthetic gene cassette was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+â€‰vector as well as pLenti6/V5 vector (Invitrogen). The CHIKV E region (E3-E2-6K-E1) was PCR amplified from the synthetic gene construct and cloned into pCDNA3.1 TOPO vector to generate a CHIKV E expression vector.</p>
