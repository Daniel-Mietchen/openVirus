 </sup>. Lentiviral vectors expressing ZIKV, JEV or YFV CprME-IRES-NS2B-3 were packaged into lentiviral particles in 293 T cells by transfecting with the lentiviral vector along with the helper construct php-dl-NA (NIH AIDS Reagent program) and VSVG Env. The viral supernatants were collected at 48 h post transfection, aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. To generate stable cell lines, 293 T cells were transduced with the lentiviral particles and the cells were selected using Blasticidin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Bulk selected cells were passaged 8–10 times and stained for ZIKV E protein expression using monoclonal antibody MAB10216 (4G2, Millipore) at regular intervals to confirm selection. Subsequently, single cell clones were generated from the bulk selected cells using limiting dilution cloning in 96 well plates. Each single cell clone was further characterized for E protein expression using immunostaining followed by flow cytometry. The release of VLPs from selected cell lines was determined by western blotting and the clone most potent at VLP release was selected for further studies. The same strategy was used for generation of CHIKV VLP secreting cell line. In this case the lentivirus expressed the CHIKV structural proteins (C-E3-E2-6K-E1). The transduced 293 T cells were bulk selected in the presence of Blasticidin before limiting dilution cloning followed by selection of single cell clones.
