 </sup>. For this, the CHIKV Envelope region (E3-E2-6K-E1) was PCR amplified from the synthetic gene construct and cloned into pCDNA 3.1 TOPO vector to generate a CHIKV E expression vector. The HIV pNLLucR-E- vector that expresses the HIV genome minus the Env and includes a luciferase gene along with CHIKV Env was used to generate luciferase expressing CHIKV pseudotyped RVPs.
