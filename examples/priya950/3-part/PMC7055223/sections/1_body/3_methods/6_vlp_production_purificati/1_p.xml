 </sup> with some modifications. Cell lines were seeded in 5 layer multi flasks (Corning) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence of blasticidin. Culture supernatants were harvested every 2–3 days at which point cells were sub-cultured. VLPs were concentrated as per the protocol of Brien

 </sup>. Harvested supernatants (25–30 ml) were transferred into ultracentrifuge tubes and carefully underlayered with 5 ml of 25% glycerol in TNE buffer. VLPs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 110,500 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the supernatant was carefully removed and the VLP pellet resuspended in TNE buffer. The total protein content in the VLP preps was measured using the micro BCA kit (Pierce) and the presence of E protein in the preps was detected by western blotting using specific antibodies.
