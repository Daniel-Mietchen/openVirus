 </sup>. This was conducted either via immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry or western blotting. For fluorescence microscopy, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS followed by permeabilization with 0.1% TritonX100/PBS. The cells were stained using E specific primary antibodies (4G2 or CHIKV E Ab; 1:200 dilution) followed by Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, 1:200 dilution) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using the Nikon EclipseTi microscope. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix Cytoperm reagent (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Cells were stained using the primary antibody 4G2 or CHIKV E Ab at 1:500 dilution followed by secondary antibody Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, 1:500 dilution). Cells were assayed by flow cytometry on a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and at least 20,000 events for each sample were acquired. Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). For Western blotting, lysates were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto PVDF membranes and probed with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by HRP conjugated secondary antibody and bands visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence using the super signal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). The protocol for radiolabeling of cells with [35S]Met/Cys protein labeling mix followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates has been described previously
