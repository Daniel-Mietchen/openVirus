 </sup>. All animal use was reviewed and approved by the TTUHSC El Paso Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. For immunization studies, 8 week old Balb/c mice were purchased from Jackson laboratory and housed in pathogen free animal facility at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso. Mice were divided into groups of six mice each and immunized with different monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent vaccine combinations conjugated with 2% Alhydrogel as adjuvant (InvivoGen). The VLP:Alhydrogel mix was injected intramuscularly in each thigh in a volume of 50 μl. Mice received one respective booster VLP dose at week 2 after the primary immunization. Control mice were sham injected with PBS mixed with Alhydrogel. Blood was collected at week ~7 post first immunization under terminal isoflurane anesthesia followed by intracardiac puncture. Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes as per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Beckman Coulter). After coagulation, the tubes were centrifuged, sera harvested, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use.
