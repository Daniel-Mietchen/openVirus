  <p>Characterization of stable single cell clones. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> JEV-JD12, YFV-YF9 and CHIKV-CH3 cell lines were stained for E and/or Capsid protein expression. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and images acquired. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The stable cell lines were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (−) of blasticidin for a period of 30 days with routine sub-culturing. Culture supernatants were analyzed for E protein expression by western blotting. M = Protein molecular weight marker. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> VLPs harvested from the individual stable cell lines were negatively stained and analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Scale = 50 nm. Fluorescence microscopy images were analyzed using NIS Elements AR software version 3.2 (Nikon;
