  <p>Quality of antibody response generated in VLP immunized mice. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> CHIKV-E3-E2-E1 stable cell line was radiolabeled with [35S]Met-Cyst and cell lysates immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from indicated groups of immunized mice. Complexes were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by fluorography. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> YFV-CprME stable cell line was radiolabeled with [35S]Met-Cyst and cell lysates immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from relevant groups of immunized mice. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> JEV-CprME stable cell line was radiolabeled with [35S]Met-Cyst and cell lysates immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from indicated groups of immunized mice. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> ZIKV-CprME stable cell line was radiolabeled with [35S]Met-Cyst and cell lysates immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from indicated groups of immunized mice. Quantitation of bands for Env, prM and Capsid protein is depicted in the graphs alongside each gel. Gel images were analyzed using the Multi Gauge software version 3.0 (
