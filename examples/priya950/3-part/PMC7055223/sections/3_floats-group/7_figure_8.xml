  <p>Adaptation of stable cell lines for growth in suspension culture. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> JEV, YFV, ZIKV and CHIKV stable cell lines were adapted to grow in suspension culture. After complete adaptation, cells were stained for E protein expression via flow cytometry. The respective adherent counterparts were used as staining controls alongside. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> VLP production from the adapted suspension cell lines was determined by western blotting for the E protein and compared to VLP secretion from the respective adherent counterparts. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Morphology of suspension cell lines via brightfield microscopy and comparison with their respective adherent counterparts. Flow cytometry histograms were created using the FloJo Software version 10.6.0 (Tree Star,
