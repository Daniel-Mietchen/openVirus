  <p>Generation and characterization of bicistronic lentiviral vectors expressing flaviviral structural proteins. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> JEV CprME was cloned into a lentiviral vector that included an IRES sequence followed by the Zika NS2B-3 protease. 293â€‰T cells were transfected with the JEV CprME construct alone or the bicistronic JEV lentiviral construct. Culture supernatants were harvested and VLPs analyzed for JEV E protein and Capsid protein secretion via western blotting. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> YFV CprME was cloned into a lentiviral vector as above and VLP secretion determined in the culture supernatants by western blotting for E and Capsid protein. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CHIKV C-E3-E2-E1 genes were cloned into a lentiviral vector and VLP secretion determined in the culture supernatants by western blotting for E1-E2 protein. Images were analyzed using GENETOOLS gel analysis Software version 4.03 (f). (Syngene,
