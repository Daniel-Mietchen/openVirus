<p>Seasonal influenza infections are estimated to cause about three to five million cases of severe illness including 290,000 to 650,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Groups most at risk for severe illness are young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and the elderly. Currently, trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV/QIV) as well as live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are on the market as seasonal vaccines. TIV/QIV are aimed to induce neutralizing antibodies against the highly variable surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) but the efficacy is rather moderate especially in the elderly (50–60%) [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, LAIV are able to induce cross-reactive T cell responses that provide some degree of immunity against heterologous influenza A Virus (IAV) strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but so far, they were only effective in children and even this efficacy varied substantially in recent years [
