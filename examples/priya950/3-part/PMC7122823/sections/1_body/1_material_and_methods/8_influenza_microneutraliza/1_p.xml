<p>Influenza-specific neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in a microneutralization assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, two-fold serial dilutions of serum samples were prepared in infection medium (DMEM containing 0.18% BSA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1.2 μg/ml Trypsin; Gibco). Those dilutions were then incubated with 2000 plaque-forming units (PFU) H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) or pH1N1 A/Hamburg/4/2009 (pandemic isolate from 2009; pdm09) for 45 minutes at 37°C in a total volume of 100 μl infection medium. After the incubation, the serum-virus mixtures were transferred on confluent MDCK II cells in a 96-well plate. After four days cultivation at 37°C, neutralization of the virus was assessed in each well by crystal violet staining (0.13% w/v crystal violet, 26% Methanol in water). The highest reciprocal sample dilution, which completely inhibited an infection, was considered as the neutralization titer.
