<p>Results are shown as mean + SEM or as median ± interquartile range. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test and non-parametric two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons) were used because normality testing for small datasets has little power. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. For reasons of clarity, only significant differences between the controls (naive, pVax-empty) and the adjuvanted groups are displayed in most figures. Raw data is available as S1 Raw data file.
