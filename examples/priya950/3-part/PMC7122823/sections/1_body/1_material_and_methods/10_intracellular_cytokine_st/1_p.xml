<p>At the indicated time points, T cell responses in PBMCs or splenocytes were analysed. Spleens were mashed through a 70 μm cell strainer before ammonium-chloride-potassium lysis, while blood was directly subjected to this treatment. 10
 <sup>6</sup> splenocytes or PBMCs were plated per well in a 96-well round-bottom plate and incubated for 6 hours at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in 200 μl R10 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM l-Glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) containing monensin (2 μM), anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml, eBioscience), anti-CD107a-FITC (clone eBio1D4B, eBioscience) and 5 μg/ml of the MHC-I peptides HA
 <sub>518–526</sub> (IYSTVASSL) or NP
 <sub>147–155</sub> (TYQRTRALV), respectively. Non-stimulated samples were used for subtraction of background cytokine production (negative values were set as zero). After the stimulation, cells were stained with anti-CD8a-Pacific blue (clone 53–6.7, BD Biosciences; 1:300) and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor® 780 (eBioscience; 1:2000) for 20 min at 4°C. After fixation in 2% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilization (buffer and conditions see above), cells were stained intracellularly with anti-IL-2-APC (clone JES6-5H4, BD Biosciences), anti-TNFα-PECy7 (clone MPG-XT22, BD Biosciences), and anti-IFN-y-PE (clone XMG1.2, eBioscience; all 1:300) for 30 min at 4°C. Data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II and analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
