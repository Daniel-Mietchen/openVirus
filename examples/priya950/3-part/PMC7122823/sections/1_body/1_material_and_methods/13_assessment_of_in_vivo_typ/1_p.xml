<p>Mx2-Luc mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] were immunized by intramuscular DNA injection followed by electroporation as described above. 72 hours later, mice were euthanized and muscles of the hind legs were excised. The muscle tissues were homogenized with a gentleMACS dissociator in M tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) and 10 μl of the cleared supernatant was incubated with 90 μl Bright-Glo lysis buffer (Promega) for 10 minutes at RT. Subsequently, 25 μl Bright-Glo Luciferase substrate (Promega) was added and the luciferase signal was measured with an IVIS Lumina Series II (PerkinElmer).
