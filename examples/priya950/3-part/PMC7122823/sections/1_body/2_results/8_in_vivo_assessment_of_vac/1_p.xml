<p>We were not able to demonstrate any consistent adjuvant effect in our DNA vaccination setting beside slight effects of pV-IL-1β on antigen persistence and IgG1 induction. Although the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity of the adjuvants was verified in the beginning, we wondered whether this bioactivity is also present 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, transgenic Mx2-Luc mice were exploited, which express the firefly luciferase under the control of the type I and type III IFN-inducible Mx2 promoter [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], to investigate the induction of type I and III IFN as a surrogate for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> inflammation. Mx2-Luc mice were immunized with 10 μg pVax-empty or the respective amount adjuvant plasmid and 72 hours later, the luciferase signal was determined in whole muscle lysates. Compared to naive mice, an increased luciferase activity was detected in all mice that received a DNA immunization (

This led us to the speculation that the administered DNA (independent of the insert) together with the electroporation already present a quite inflammatory stimulus and this could perhaps provide redundancy to the adjuvant-specific effects. We further underlined this hypothesis by demonstrating that the electroporation without DNA and the electroporation with pVax-empty each resulted in an incremental increase of the Mx2 promoter activity (
