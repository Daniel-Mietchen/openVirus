<p>To test the immunogenicity of the genetic adjuvants, we immunized mice with IAV antigen-encoding plasmids (10 μg pV-HA and 10 μg pV-NP) and the respective adjuvant plasmid (or pVax-empty as control; all 10 μg) by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 28 days later, blood samples were taken to analyse the vaccine-induced antibody responses. Using a FACS-based assay to detect antigen-binding antibodies, it was found that all immunization strategies induced humoral responses against NP and the homologous HA of the PR8 strain (

However, the amount of antibodies able to bind a heterologous HA variant from pH1N1 A/Hamburg/4/2009 (pandemic isolate from 2009; pdm09) were slightly increased by the co-administration of IL-1β (
