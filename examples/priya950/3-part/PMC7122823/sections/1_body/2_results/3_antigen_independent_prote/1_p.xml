<p>The previous experiment showed that expression of the DNA vaccine is able to persist for several weeks. To exclude that an ongoing production of the genetic adjuvants might affect the protection against a lethal IAV infection, mice that only received the respective adjuvant plasmid without viral antigens were infected with 250 PFU (25 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8). Importantly, neither the RIG-I- nor the NALP3-related adjuvants had an impact on the weight loss (
