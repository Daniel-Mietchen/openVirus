<p>Next, the immunogenicity was assessed in terms of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses. We wanted to assure not to miss transient adjuvant effects and therefore analysed the responses longitudinally between day 7 and day 21 in peripheral blood. For reasons of simplicity, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g007">Fig 7</xref> depicts all antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that respond with IFN-γ (

 <sup>+</sup>IL-2
 <sup>+</sup>TNFα
 <sup>+</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). While the total pool of IFN-γ-producing cells peaks around day 10 and then steadily declined in size, the polyfunctional population seemed much more stable over time, presumable reflecting the phenotypic differences between short-lived effector cells and memory T cells. Regarding the different adjuvant strategies, neither HA-specific (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>) nor NP-specific responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g007">Fig 7B and 7D</xref>) showed any statistically significant differences among the immunized groups. Thus, none of the genetic adjuvants improved the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses significantly.
