  <title>Protective efficacy against influenza infections.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg pVax-HA, 10 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty as control) via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 35 days after the immunization, mice were infected with 2500 PFU H1N1 PR8 (A) or 5000 PFU pdm09 (B) and the weight loss was monitored daily (A+C). Five (B) and eight days (D) post-infection, mice were euthanized, lungs were harvested, and virus replication was analysed by qRT-PCR in those samples (B+D). Weight loss is depicted as mean ± SEM and the results of the qRT-PCR are displayed as individual data point for each animal and the group median (n = 4–6 animals per group). #, p &lt; 0.05 vs. naive (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test). No statistically significant differences between pVax-empty and the adjuvanted groups were found.</p>
