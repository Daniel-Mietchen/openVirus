  <title>Protective efficacy after DNA vaccination with combined adjuvants.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 5 μg pVax-HA, 5 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg of each adjuvant DNA via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 35 days after the immunization, mice were infected with 5000 PFU pH1N1 pdm09 and the weight loss was monitored daily (A). Eight days post-infection, mice were euthanized, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed, and lungs were harvested. Virus replication was analysed by qRT-PCR in lung homogenates (B) and infiltrated immune cells in BAL fluids were assessed by flow cytometry (C). Weight loss is depicted as mean ± SEM, the results of the qRT-PCR are displayed as individual data point for each animal and the group median, and the cellular infiltration is shown as mean with SEM (n = 6–8 animals per group). #, p &lt; 0.05 vs. naive; *, p &lt; 0.05 vs. pVax-empty (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test).</p>
