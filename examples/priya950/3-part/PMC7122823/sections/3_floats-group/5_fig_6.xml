  <title>Humoral responses after DNA vaccination with combined adjuvants.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 5 μg pVax-HA, 5 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg of each adjuvant DNA via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 28 days after the immunization, serum samples were generated from peripheral blood and the humoral response was analysed. (A-B) NP- and HA-expressing HEK 293T cells were incubated with 1:100 serum dilutions and antigen-specific antibodies were measured with a FITC-conjugated detection antibody via flow cytometry. Values are depicted as mean + SEM for all groups and statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; #, p&lt;0.05 vs. naive; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 7–8 animals per group). (C) The neutralization capacity of serum samples was assessed by an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay against H1N1 PR8. Depicted are individual data points for each animal and the group median. The dotted line represents the detection limit (1:10 dilution). Statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; #, p&lt;0.05 vs. naive; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 7–8 animals per group). (D-E) IAV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a were analysed by an antigen-specific antibody ELISA with coated the PR8 strain. Serum samples were measured in a 1:100 dilution and mean values with SEM of the relative light units (RLU) is shown (D). In (E) the IgG2a/IgG1 ratios are depicted. Statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 7–8 animals per group).
