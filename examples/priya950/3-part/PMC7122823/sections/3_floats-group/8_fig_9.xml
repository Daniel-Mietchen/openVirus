  <p>Mx2-Luc reporter mice were immunized with 10 μg of the respective plasmid via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation (A) or were treated as depicted in the graph (B). 72 hours later, the electroporated muscles were excised and homogenized. The luciferase signal was analysed in the muscle homogenate as a surrogate for Mx2 promoter activity. Depicted are individual data points from each animal (two legs per mouse measured) and the group median (2–4 animals per group). #, p &lt; 0.05 vs. naive; ***, p &lt; 0.001 (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test). RLU/s, relative light units per second.</p>
