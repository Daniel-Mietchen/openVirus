  <title>Neutralization of pdm09 strain.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg pVax-HA, 10 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty as control) via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 28 days after the immunization, serum samples were generated from peripheral blood and the humoral response was analysed. The neutralization capacity of serum samples was assessed by an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay against pH1N1 pdm09 A/Hamburg/4/2009. Depicted are individual data points for each animal and the group median. The dotted line represents the detection limit (1:10 dilution). n = 5–6 animals per group.
