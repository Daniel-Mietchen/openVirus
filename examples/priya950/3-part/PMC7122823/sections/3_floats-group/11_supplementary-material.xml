  <title>qPCR analysis of viral RNA in BALF.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 5 μg pVax-HA, 5 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg total adjuvant DNA via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 35 days after the immunization, mice were infected with 5000 PFU pH1N1 A/Hamburg/4/2009. Eight days post-infection, mice were euthanized, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed, and virus replication was analysed by qRT-PCR in BALF. The results of the qRT-PCR are displayed as individual data point for each animal and the group median (n = 4–6 animals per group). #, p &lt; 0.05 vs. naive; *, p &lt; 0.05 vs. pVax-empty (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test).</p>
