<p>We foresee the capability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in causing future epidemics and pandemics by virtue of their extensive distribution and ability to spread different arboviruses. Despite concerns addressing the global distribution of these vectors, a comprehensive global strategy to understand the implications of global occurrence—in terms of public health (pandemic threat), population genetics of the responsible vectors and corresponding arboviruses, and the lack of overt prevention and response—is urgently needed. A multidisciplinary approach is desired for prevention and control of these two key players associated with large arbovirus epidemics.
