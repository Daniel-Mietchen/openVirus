<p>The risk drivers shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> form the basis for understanding and analyzing effects of emerging infectious diseases and serve as inputs for risk analysis, which then can be used for risk mitigation. Methods and standards for information exchange should be developed with the aim of increasing coverage and awareness of potential risk and eventualities pertaining to arbovirus outbreaks. Building capacity and institutional development will enhance a common basis for training and education of people at different professional levels, such as (1) training aids as manuals and tutorials for exercises; (2) gamed-based training tools for first responders and health care workers; (3) accredited reference laboratories supporting reference samples to ensure delivery of reliable results that will foster better patient management and treatment; (4) rapid diagnostic tests that need to be developed, optimized, and incorporated as part of routine diagnostics, especially in hospital settings and community health care centers located in endemic and risk areas; and (5) application of high-throughput sequencing platforms, as part of the point-of-care diagnostics, to enable detection of known and suspected emerging diseases in risk populations outside epidemics. Through next-generation sequencing (NGS), population genetics of both vectors and emerging arbovirus diseases will be understood. Discovery of new pathogens by NGS will provide greater insights into pathogen, vector, and host dynamics and will over time support risk planning and priority setting. To ensure effective control of mosquito vectors, a number of factors should be considered, including the safety of the environment, health of humans, animals and other living creatures, vector capacity, and social acceptance by relevant authority of the community in question.
