<p>The review provides an overview of existing capabilities that (if combined properly) could greatly improve the preparedness to combat mosquito-borne diseases in the future. The solution to these problems seems not to be exclusively dependent on new sophisticated techniques, new innovated research findings, or more money, but to use what is existing, combine techniques, collaborate across borders with disease monitoring, vector surveillance, vector and pathogen identification, information sharing, and use standardized guidelines and procedures (SOPs) for sampling, preparation, and transportation. Visualization of the relationship or interplay between different resources and tasks has been demonstrated in

This is highly cost-effective and efficient. It is most important to reach out with relevant information to the community, national authorities, and decision makers. For that purpose, funded national and international programs and research communication through workshops, conferences, stakeholder meetings, and media are important to spread this urgent information and prepare for awareness and capability building against large epidemics and/or pandemics.
