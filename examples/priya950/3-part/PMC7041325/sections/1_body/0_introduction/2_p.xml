<p>By this review, we present some basic characteristics and abilities of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to colonize and establish populations in new geographical areas along with their associated arboviruses, expose the potential risk to global health, and give some recommendations for vector control and risk minimization.
