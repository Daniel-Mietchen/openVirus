<p>Research based on bloodmeal analysis of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> demonstrates that both mosquito species feed on a wide range of vertebrate hosts (Eritja et al. 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, Barrera et al. 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is more anthropophilic than 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, hence a more efficient vector in urban areas (Paupy et al. 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Valerio et al. 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Some studies have indicated a decline of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population and a simultaneous increase of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population, especially in regions where they coexist (Christophers 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>, O'meara et al. 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>, Lounibos et al. 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This observation could be attributed to interspecies competition beside the control 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population by intensive vector control methods such as environmental sanitation and population reduction using 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic>-targeted traps, mainly the sentinel autocidal gravid ovitraps in urban settings (Barrera et al. 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A suggested explanation for the competitive displacement of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is satyrization, a mating interference method where males of one species mate with females of another species, hence decreasing their fitness without generating hybrids (Tripet et al. 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
