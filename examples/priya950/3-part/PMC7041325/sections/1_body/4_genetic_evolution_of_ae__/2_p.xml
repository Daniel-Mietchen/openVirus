<p>One interesting observation from population genetics is the inferred linkage between genetic markers and vector competence, for example, the susceptibility of subpopulations from 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to DENV serotype 2 (Failloux et al. 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This discovery may lead to further understanding of the establishment of mosquito populations and appropriate prevention and control strategies considering that mosquitoes may belong to different genetic lineages. A population dynamic study on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> involving genetically divergent strains with varying insecticide resistance levels, genetic markers, and vector competence for DENV revealed the possibility of transmitting characteristics from one mosquito population to another by creating new genetic variants through random mating (Ocampo and Wesson 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These variants may pose challenges to insecticide resistance, which directly impact the control of mosquito populations, since it results in a reduction in the susceptibility of vector populations to insecticides (Vontas et al. 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).
