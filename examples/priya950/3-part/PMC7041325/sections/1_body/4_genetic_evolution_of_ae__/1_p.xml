<p>Mitochondrial genes of mosquitoes within the 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> genus are relatively conserved and maternally inherited (Arctander 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>, Hudson and Turelli 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Hlaing et al. 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Behura et al. 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, some coding genes have been shown to undergo a more rapid evolution, which is informative when characterizing relationships between populations. Certain genes, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, are frequently used for species identification of mosquitoes (Helmersson 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Engdahl et al. 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Genetic variations found in mitochondrial genes of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> indicate that both species have haplotypes spatially distributed across the world. Population genetic analyses of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> of Thailand and North America indicated the presence of several haplotypes also in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and dehydrogenase subunit 4 mitochondrial DNA gene sequence (ND4) (Bosio et al. 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, Mousson et al. 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations have undergone genetic changes in the region encoding the sodium dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5), leading to distinct haplotypes (Avise 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). This gene is a useful marker when studying the spatiotemporal evolution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. Moreover, the mitochondrial gene ND5 has been shown to be the most variable protein-coding sequence within the genus of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (Besansky et al. 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).
