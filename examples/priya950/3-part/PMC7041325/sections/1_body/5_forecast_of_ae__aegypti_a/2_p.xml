<p>A wide range of risk drivers are known to exacerbate the emergence and spread of arbovirus diseases. The major drivers are globalization and changes in the environment (including climate change). Other components are sociodemographic factors (population aging, urbanization, social inequality, and lifestyle), insecticide resistance, health care capacity, animal health, and food safety. Intensive agriculture, population density, and inadequate infrastructure, such as improper water storage, are other risk factors that affect the impact of an outbreak. Dissemination and expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> also involve human activities such as trade of used tires and water storage in open containers (O'meara et al. 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The mutual ability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to transmit similar pathogens and even become coinfected with viral pathogens may have consequences for the severity of the disease in susceptible hosts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates an overview of risk drivers affecting local and/or global spread of mosquito vectors and their accompanying arboviruses. These risk factors exemplify topics that could be useful when raising awareness and suggest focus areas for a comprehensive risk analysis, which then can be used for a more holistic risk mitigation strategy.
