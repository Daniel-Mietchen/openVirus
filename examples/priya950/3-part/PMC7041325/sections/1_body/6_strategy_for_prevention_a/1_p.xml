<p>So far, there is no single vector prevention and control method that is effective in controlling mosquito populations in all settings. Therefore, a combination of vector control methods, including biological, chemical, and genetic methods, is needed. Biological procedures are an attractive and environmentally friendly way to control vector populations. The use of fish feeding on mosquito larvae can be applied in containers with stagnant water, especially when targeting

 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</italic> can act as biological larvicides (de Melo-Santos et al.
