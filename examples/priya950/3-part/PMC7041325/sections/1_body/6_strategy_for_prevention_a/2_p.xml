<p>Genetic vector control methods have been used to limit mosquito populations, yet they are too slow to affect populations and require too much infrastructure to ever be useful for outbreaks. For example, genetic modification of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been applied using self-limiting genes such as OX513A that interfere with the survival of its offspring (Entwistle and Dhang 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Carvalho et al. 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The OX513A gene could also be used in combination with fluorescent markers for monitoring (Wallace 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Gabrieli et al. 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This latter method has been utilized for visualization of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Brazil, Malaysia, Cayman Islands, and the United States, and it could potentially be applicable in the control of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes as well (Harris et al. 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Subramaniam et al. 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Carvalho et al. 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Nimmo and Beech 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Release of genetically modified mosquitoes in nature might become feasible in arbovirus-endemic settings, for example, transgenic mosquitoes, to suppress the occurrence of vector-competent mosquitoes and hence reduce transmission. In addition, the application of CRISPR/Cas9 enables genetic modification of mosquitoes to block genes responsible for virus transmission and reduces vector competence in mosquito populations (Gantz et al. 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, this method needs to be coupled with caution and involvement with relevant stakeholders, experts, and communities to avoid side effects (Knols et al. 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).
