<p>Since the 20th century, a number of mosquitoes have developed resistance to insecticides, including natural (pyrethrum, nicotine, and neem extracts), organic chemical compounds (organophosphates and carbonates), and inorganic material (metals). Presently, insecticide resistance has become a large public health problem, especially when controlling mosquito vectors that transmit arboviruses to humans. Resistance to DDT was first demonstrated in the 
 <italic>Ae. nigromaculis</italic> mosquito species by Bohart and Murray (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> resistance against DDT was detected in Puerto Rico in the 1960s (Fox

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1964</xref>). Data from the Arthropod Pesticide Resistance Database (APRD) indicate that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is resistant to 24 insecticides across 41 countries. Since then, subsequent reports of insecticide resistance in other disease vectors such as 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> have been described.
