<p>An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies sympatric speciation. Such speciation may be a product of reproductive isolation—which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing gene flow—that results in genetic divergence. Sympatric speciation does not imply secondary contact, which is speciation or divergence in allopatry, followed by range expansions, leading to an area of sympatry. Sympatric species or taxa in secondary contact may or may not interbreed.</p>
