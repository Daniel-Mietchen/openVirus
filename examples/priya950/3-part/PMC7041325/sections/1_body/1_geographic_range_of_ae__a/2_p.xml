<p>To our knowledge, there are only a few geostatistical methods to explore sympatric 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. In an article by Duncombe et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), they found that although 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes reside sympatrically, they prefer different locations (Duncombe et al. 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In biology, two related species or populations are considered sympatric when they exist in the same geographic area and frequently encounter one another. It is important to remember that cryptic species may be medically important in vector-borne disease transmission, vector ecology, and evolutionary biology.
