 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is an indigenous species of Southeast Asia that has successively expanded its presence to Africa, Europe, Australia, the Americas, and Middle East (Gratz 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, Benedict et al. 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Currently, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is more geographically widespread than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Southeast Asia and Southeastern United States (Medlock et al. 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The first reported observations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> outside Asia were in Albania, Texas, and Brazil in 1979, 1985, and 1986, respectively (Forattini

 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>, Adhami and Reiter 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Later, it became established also in other parts of the Americas, West and Central Africa, the Pacific and Indian Ocean islands, Australia, New Zealand, and the Caribbean islands (Gratz

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Paupy et al. 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, in some countries such as New Zealand, Barbados, and Trinidad, the vector is presently absent, perhaps due to effective entomological surveillance programs situated at the ports of entry (Lambrechts et al. 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Currently, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is considered as one of the most invasive mosquito species (Bonizzoni et al. 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
