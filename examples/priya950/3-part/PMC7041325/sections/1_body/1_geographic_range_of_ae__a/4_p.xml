<p>To exemplify, the introduction of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to Asia in the 19th century led to this species becoming the dominant dengue fever vector in cities in which it was better adapted for than native 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (Lounibos 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, Gratz 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Since then, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has adjusted to urban environments, although it still favors areas of dense vegetation, and the two species reside sympatrically throughout Asia. Generally, wherever the density of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was found to be high, the density of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was low, and vice versa. However, it would be interesting to foresee whether the global distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus</italic> species leads to sympatric coexistence or competitive exclusion.
