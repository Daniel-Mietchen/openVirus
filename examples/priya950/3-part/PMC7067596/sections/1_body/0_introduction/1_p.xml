<p>Enteroviruses are responsible for a number of human and animal diseases, with poliovirus (PV) being the best-characterized member. PV is the causative agent of poliomyelitis, a devastating paralytic and sometimes fatal infection that was responsible for global epidemics in the last century. However, since the introduction of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, there has been a &gt;99% reduction in the number of cases worldwide, with wild-type (wt) poliovirus now only endemic to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria (

This reduction is primarily attributable to the use of two highly effective vaccines, the live-attenuated oral PV vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated PV vaccine (IPV), both of which target all three PV serotypes (PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3). wt PV-2 has been declared globally eradicated, as none has been isolated since 1999 (
