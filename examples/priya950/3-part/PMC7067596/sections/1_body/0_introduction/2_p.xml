<p>Due to the genetic instability of OPV, the attenuated virus can quickly revert to virulence, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), especially in areas of low vaccine coverage, leading to circulating vaccine-derived PV (cVDPV) (

Additionally, individuals with undiagnosed compromised immune systems may become chronic carriers of cVDPV postvaccination, acting as reservoirs capable of reintroducing PV to the environment (
