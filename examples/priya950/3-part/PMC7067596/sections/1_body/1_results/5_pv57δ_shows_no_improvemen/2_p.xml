<p>Reagents specific to C antigen revealed that both wt DP and PV57δ DP VLPs produced large amounts of C antigen, whereas the PV57δ-2A-3CD and PV57δ-IRES-3CD VLPs were below the threshold of detection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that despite VLPs being processed correctly and detectable by immunoblotting, these two expression systems are less efficient for VLP production than the dual promoter system. However, neither the wt nor any of the PV57δ VLPs contained detectable D antigen in this assay. As expected, the HC-only control gradient fractions were negative for both D and C antigenic forms.
