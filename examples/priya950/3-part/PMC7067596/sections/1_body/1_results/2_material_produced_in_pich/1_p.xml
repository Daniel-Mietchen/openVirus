<p>The best-expressing 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> clones for each expression system then were induced using 0.5% methanol in a 200-ml culture volume, and cell pellets collected 48 h postinduction for purification. To determine whether each of the different expression systems produced higher-order structures, the cell pellets were homogenized at ∼275 MPa and subjected to multistep centrifugal purification, culminating in separation through 15 to 45% sucrose gradients. Gradient fractions then were analyzed for the presence of VP1 by immunoblot assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, the HC vector-only sample was not positive for VP1, whereas the expression cassettes for wt DP, PV57δ DP, and PV57δ-IRES-3CD produced material that peaked in fraction 6. For PV57δ-2A-3CD, the peak was slightly further down the gradient (in fraction 7). As a control, PV-1 Mahoney virus also was purified through a 15 to 45% sucrose gradient and probed for VP-1 by immunoblotting, and it showed two distinct populations, as expected (
