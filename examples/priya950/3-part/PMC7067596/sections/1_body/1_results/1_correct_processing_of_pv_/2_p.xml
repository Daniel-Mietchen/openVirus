<p>To modulate the expression of 3CD, we introduced either the 
 <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus (TaV) 2A peptide sequence between the end of P1 and the start of 3CD or the intergenic region internal ribosome entry site (IGR IRES; referred to as RhPV IRES) from 
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> virus (RhPV) between P1 and 3CD. TaV 2A peptide has one of the most efficient cleavage sequences, which should lead to a ratio of P1 to 3CD between 1:1 and 2:1, depending on the efficiency of translation reinitiation (
