<p>Following transformation, 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> colonies were tested for expression levels. Following 48 h of induction, samples from small-scale test expression were indirectly analyzed for the correct processing of P1 polyprotein using an anti-VP1 antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The anti-VP1 immunoblot showed that material derived from all three expression cassettes correctly processed P1, resulting in the appearance of an immunoreactive protein similar in size to the VP1 produced in PV-1 Mahoney-infected HeLa cell lysate, while the vector-only 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> control (HC only) showed no reactivity. The VP1 band for PV57δ-2A-3CD showed a small mobility shift, reflecting the 18-amino-acid extension to the C terminus of VP1. These lysates were also probed with anti-3D, which showed two major bands, at approximately 72 and 55 kDa, corresponding to the expected sizes of 3CD and 3D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The anti-3D immunoblot showed similar levels of 3CD expression between the dual promoter and 2A expression cassettes; however, as expected, the IRES-mediated 3CD expression was much lower.
