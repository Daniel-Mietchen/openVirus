<p>To further determine that the VLPs produced in 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> were empty and had not packaged cognate mRNA or any nonspecific yeast RNA, the peak fraction for each expression cassette was pelleted at 151,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 20 mM EDTA prior to analysis at absorbance wavelengths of 260 nm and 280 nm. The 260/280 nm ratios shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicate that the level of nucleic acid present in the VLP samples was very low. This suggests that the VLPs produced in 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> are reminiscent of ECs produced during mammalian cell infection, which contain no nucleic acid (
