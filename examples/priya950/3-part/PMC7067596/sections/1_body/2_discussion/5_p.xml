<p>2D particle analysis showed that all the expression cassettes produced icosahedral particles of ∼33 nm in diameter. Given that negative staining leads to an overestimation of particle size, these are very similar to the sizes of virions produced from natural infection (

The micrographs also highlighted a number of smaller particles purified along with PV57δ VLPs, whereas these contaminating particles were rarely seen in the wt VLP purifications. These small particles may represent assembly defects for the PV57δ mutant, leading to partially assembled particles. If so, these defects could be alleviated by the coexpression of HSP-90, which previously was shown to be beneficial for PV capsid assembly (
