<p>The production of VLPs from each expression cassette was determined by density gradient centrifugation and further confirmed by negative-stain EM. The VLPs all showed rates of sedimentation similar to that of the ECs produced from virus infection of mammalian cells. Interestingly, the peak produced from the PV57Î´-2A-3CD VLPs was detected one fraction further down the gradient than the other VLPs. These VLPs were assembled with an additional 20-amino-acid extension present on the C terminus of VP1, suggesting the 2A peptide has an impact on the sedimentation rate of VLPs.</p>
