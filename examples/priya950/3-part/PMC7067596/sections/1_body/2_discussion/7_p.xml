<p>In conclusion, we believe we have shown that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> is a viable expression system for large-scale production of PV VLPs, which share characteristics with ECs produced from mammalian cells. In accordance with other studies, we have shown that a dual promoter expression system is the most efficient way of producing picornavirus VLPs. Additionally, we also demonstrated translational control over protein expression levels through the use of molecular biology approaches, utilizing the TaV 2A peptide and the RhPV IRES. Although the PV57Î´ VLPs used here were shown to have stability superior to that of the wt when produced in a mammalian system, the stabilization did not extend to particles expressed in yeast, possibly for the reasons outlined above. However, in preliminary experiments using the thermostable mutants previously characterized by Fox et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), we have shown 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> to be capable of efficiently producing D antigen. Therefore, we believe that this system has the potential to produce a VLP vaccine not only for a polio-free world but also as a model system for enterovirus VLP vaccine production.
