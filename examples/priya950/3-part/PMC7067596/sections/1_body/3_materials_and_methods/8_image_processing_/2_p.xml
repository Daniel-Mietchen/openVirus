To generate templates for automated particle picking, a subset of particles was manually picked, extracted, and then classified by reference-free 2D classification. Automated particle picking resulted in large numbers of “junk” particles (corresponding to overlapping VLPs, disassembled VLPs, and other contaminants), which were removed by excluding poor-quality classes from a single round of reference-free 2D classification. Particles from the remaining classes were subjected to another round of reference-free 2D classification, and the resultant class averages were inspected. For each round of 2D classification, a regularization parameter of 2 was specified, and classification was allowed to proceed for 25 iterations. No symmetry was imposed during the 2D classification.
