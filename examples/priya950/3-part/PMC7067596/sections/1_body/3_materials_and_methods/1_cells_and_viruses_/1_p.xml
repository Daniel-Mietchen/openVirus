<p>HeLa cells were obtained from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), UK. PichiaPink yeast strain one (Invitrogen, USA) was grown according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cDNA of wt PV-1 (Mahoney strain) used in this study was sourced from Bert Semler, University of California, and was cloned downstream of a T7 RNA promoter to allow 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA synthesis. A hammerhead ribozyme was included at the 5â€² end, resulting in the production of authentic infectious PV-1 RNA (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To initiate infection, L cells (which lack the PV receptor CD155) were transfected with PV-1 RNA, and the resulting viruses were propagated in HeLa cells.
