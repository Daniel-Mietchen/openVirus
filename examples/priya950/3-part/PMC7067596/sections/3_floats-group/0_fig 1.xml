  <p>Schematic of the poliovirus genome, 
   <italic>Pichia</italic> expression systems, and correct processing of PV P1. (A) Schematic of the poliovirus genome highlighting the P1 structural region and the nonstructural proteins, including the viral protease 3CD. UTR, untranslated region; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA. (B) Schematic of the pPink HC plasmid and the position in which the different expression constructs were cloned. (C) Immunoblot for PV VP1 and 3D. The virus control sample was prepared from HeLa cell lysates 8 h postinfection. Yeast samples were collected 48 h postinduction and lysed using 0.1 M NaOH. All samples were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to analysis by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal α-VP1 and rabbit monoclonal α-3D antibody. Two exposures of the same α-3D immunoblot are shown to aid interpretation.
