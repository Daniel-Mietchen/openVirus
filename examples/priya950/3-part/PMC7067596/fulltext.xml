PV is the causative agent of poliomyelitis, a devastating paralytic and sometimes fatal infection that was responsible for global epidemics in the last century. However, since the introduction of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, there has been a &#x0003e;99% reduction in the number of cases worldwide, with wild-type (wt) poliovirus now only endemic to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/">http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/</ext-link>). This reduction is primarily attributable to the use of two highly effective vaccines, the live-attenuated oral PV vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated PV vaccine (IPV), both of which target all three PV serotypes (PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3). wt PV-2 has been declared globally eradicated, as none has been isolated since 1999 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, despite the success of these vaccines, there are significant safety concerns for their continued use in a &#x0201c;polio-free&#x0201d; world to guard against the potential catastrophe that would result from the reintroduction of the virus.</p><p>Due to the genetic instability of OPV, the attenuated virus can quickly revert to virulence, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), especially in areas of low vaccine coverage, leading to circulating vaccine-derived PV (cVDPV) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Indeed, cVDPV cases now outnumber wt PV-derived cases worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/">http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/</ext-link>). Additionally, individuals with undiagnosed compromised immune systems may become chronic carriers of cVDPV postvaccination, acting as reservoirs capable of reintroducing PV to the environment (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although IPV offers effective protection against polio disease, it does not prevent the replication of the virus in infected individuals and, therefore, cannot halt further transmission of the virus within a population (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, the production of IPV requires the growth of large amounts of highly concentrated infectious virus, which could be catastrophic in the event of accidental release (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/threats-and-outbreaks">https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/threats-and-outbreaks</ext-link>).</p><p>PV is a positive-sense RNA virus, belonging to the species <italic>Enterovirus C</italic>, with a 7.5-kb genome that contains 2 overlapping reading frames. The recently discovered small open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function has been shown to be important for replication in <italic>ex vivo</italic> human enteroids (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The major ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>) is translated as a single large polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the mature viral proteins (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The viral protease 3C and its precursor, 3CD, play key roles in viral replication. 3C is responsible for the processing of the P2 and P3 regions of the viral polyprotein, whereas 3CD has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to be responsible primarily for cleavage of the structural precursor protein P1 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, 3CD also has been shown to have an integral role in priming the viral RNA for replication by the viral polymerase 3D (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). P1 is processed to produce the capsid proteins VP0, VP3, and VP1, with the subsequent cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 thought to be driven by the encapsidation of the viral genome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Mature PV virions contain 60 copies of each of VP1 to VP4, forming an &#x0223c;30-nm icosahedral capsid (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, PV infection also leads to the production of empty capsids (ECs), which lack the viral genome but are otherwise identical to the mature virions, except that they contain uncleaved VP0 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recombinantly expressed ECs could be developed as a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to replace the current vaccines against PV. However, wt ECs are inherently unstable, resulting in a conformational expansion of the particles and conversion from native antigenicity (termed D antigen) to the nonnative form (termed C antigen) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This conformational switch is of particular importance as the nonnative antigen is a poor inducer of neutralizing antibodies and, therefore, is incapable of providing a long-lasting, protective immune response against PV (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, any attempts to produce PV VLPs must also attempt to ensure the particles maintain the D antigenic form.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic of the poliovirus genome, <italic>Pichia</italic> expression systems, and correct processing of PV P1.

Although the secretion of VLPs from insect cells is an attractive option, each of these systems can incur high production costs, making them less accessible for lower- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Yeast is a heterologous expression system with potential for technology transfer to LMICs, as it is inexpensive in terms of medium costs and infrastructure requirements. Additionally, yeast expression is currently licensed for the production of human vaccines against two viral pathogens, hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Using P1 sequences from the wt and a previously characterized mutant, we show that PV VLPs can be produced in the yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> via three different expression constructs.

The VLPs produced from each construct show physical properties similar to those of the ECs produced naturally during infection. Additionally, through two-dimensional (2D) class averaging of electron microscopy data, we show that PV VLPs produced from each expression cassette maintain the classic icosahedral morphology associated with picornavirus capsids, highlighting the potential of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> as a model system for the production of enterovirus VLPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Correct processing of PV P1 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content>.</title><p>To determine the feasibility of producing enterovirus VLPs in <italic>Pichia</italic>, using PV as an exemplar, we employed three different expression cassettes, as described for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>, each containing the P1 region together with the viral protease. Expression should result in the production of VP0, VP1, and VP3 and assembly into VLPs. A dual promoter expression system previously was used to produce VLPs for other enteroviruses, such as coxsackie A6, coxsackie A16, and enterovirus A71 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We employed this approach here for the wt and for a previously described capsid mutant of PV-1 Mahoney (PV57&#x003b4;), which we have shown to increase D antigen stability in mammalian cell culture (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Due to concerns over the potential toxicity of the viral protease 3CD, we modulated the level of 3CD expression to investigate its impact on VLP production (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). To this end, we designed two other constructs for comparative analysis alongside the dual promoter, using PV57&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>).</p><p>To modulate the expression of 3CD, we introduced either the <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus (TaV) 2A peptide sequence between the end of P1 and the start of 3CD or the intergenic region internal ribosome entry site (IGR IRES; referred to as RhPV IRES) from <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> virus (RhPV) between P1 and 3CD. TaV 2A peptide has one of the most efficient cleavage sequences, which should lead to a ratio of P1 to 3CD between 1:1 and 2:1, depending on the efficiency of translation reinitiation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The introduction of the RhPV IRES should have a more pronounced impact on the levels of 3CD, as IRES-mediated translation has been shown to be 5- to 20-fold lower than cap-driven translation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Following transformation, <italic>Pichia</italic> colonies were tested for expression levels. Following 48&#x02009;h of induction, samples from small-scale test expression were indirectly analyzed for the correct processing of P1 polyprotein using an anti-VP1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). The anti-VP1 immunoblot showed that material derived from all three expression cassettes correctly processed P1, resulting in the appearance of an immunoreactive protein similar in size to the VP1 produced in PV-1 Mahoney-infected HeLa cell lysate, while the vector-only <italic>Pichia</italic> control (HC only) showed no reactivity. The VP1 band for PV57&#x003b4;-2A-3CD showed a small mobility shift, reflecting the 18-amino-acid extension to the C terminus of VP1. These lysates were also probed with anti-3D, which showed two major bands, at approximately 72 and 55&#x02009;kDa, corresponding to the expected sizes of 3CD and 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). The anti-3D immunoblot showed similar levels of 3CD expression between the dual promoter and 2A expression cassettes; however, as expected, the IRES-mediated 3CD expression was much lower.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Material produced in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> sedimented similarly to PV-1 empty capsids.</title><p>The best-expressing <italic>Pichia</italic> clones for each expression system then were induced using 0.5% methanol in a 200-ml culture volume, and cell pellets collected 48&#x02009;h postinduction for purification. To determine whether each of the different expression systems produced higher-order structures, the cell pellets were homogenized at &#x0223c;275&#x02009;MPa and subjected to multistep centrifugal purification, culminating in separation through 15 to 45% sucrose gradients.

For PV57&#x003b4;-2A-3CD, the peak was slightly further down the gradient (in fraction 7).

However, both OPV and IPV require the production of large amounts of infectious virus, which raises biosafety concerns around the potential for the reintroduction of PV to the environment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, as we edge closer to a polio-free world, we need to consider alternative vaccine production strategies to ensure control of PV is maintained. One solution is to produce a virus-free VLP vaccine using a heterologous expression system. This approach has been successful for the production of PV VLPs in both plant and insect cell systems, but both of these require specialist equipment, which increases the cost of production, making it difficult to translate these production methods to LMICs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Yeast offers an alternative heterologous expression system that can produce levels of protein production similar to those of mammalian cells (e.g., 400&#x02009;mg/liter compared to 500&#x02009;mg/liter from mammalian cells [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) but at a fraction of the cost and with the added advantages of greater speed and ease of scalability (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, we looked to build on the previous work of Rombaut and Jore by producing PV VLPs in yeast to determine if this is a viable expression system for future enterovirus vaccine production, especially in light of the recent emergence of the neurovirulent enterovirus D68 as well as the increasing cases of enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16, the etiological agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>First, we investigated the production of PV VLPs using a range of expression cassettes. The dual promoter expression cassette was used previously for the production of other picornavirus VLPs, while the introduction of TaV 2A and RhPV IRES was used to modulate the expression of 3CD (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). 3C protease previously was shown to have a toxic effect on cell viability, whereas 3CD was shown to be the active protease in P1 processing and should be less toxic than 3C (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, in an attempt to reduce protease toxicity, we introduced a previously characterized noncleavable 3CD into our expression constructs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>, there is clear cleavage of 3CD, suggesting that the noncleavable phenotype is expression system dependent. Presumably, a host protease is responsible for the 3CD cleavage seen, which occurs at a sequence close to the natural cleavage site. It would be interesting to fully ablate this cleavage event in <italic>Pichia</italic> or introduce mutations into 3C<sup>pro</sup> to reduce toxicity, as shown previously for foot-and-mouth disease virus, and determine the impact of these modifications on VLP production (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We demonstrated that all three expression cassettes led to the correct processing of P1 through the detection of VP-1 using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 8650. This antibody also can detect full-length P1 and other processing intermediates; however, we detected no structural precursors by immunoblotting, suggesting good P1 processing efficiency in each expression cassette. Additionally, we also showed that both the TaV 2A and RhPV IRES were able to control 3CD translation in <italic>Pichia</italic>. These could be important tools for the production of VLPs from other virus families, such as flaviviruses or orthomyxoviruses, which may require differential expression of constructs required for protein maturation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>The production of VLPs from each expression cassette was determined by density gradient centrifugation and further confirmed by negative-stain EM. The VLPs all showed rates of sedimentation similar to that of the ECs produced from virus infection of mammalian cells. Interestingly, the peak produced from the PV57&#x003b4;-2A-3CD VLPs was detected one fraction further down the gradient than the other VLPs. These VLPs were assembled with an additional 20-amino-acid extension present on the C terminus of VP1, suggesting the 2A peptide has an impact on the sedimentation rate of VLPs.</p><p>To ensure that no host RNA or cognate mRNA was being nonselectively packaged into the VLPs, we used the 260/280-nm absorbance ratio to estimate the level of nucleic acid present in the purified VLPs. The ratio of nucleic acid to protein was far lower than that in the purified infectious virus and was similar to the levels of nucleic acid found in equivalent fractions in the vector-only purified yeast lysate, suggesting that the VLPs did not encapsidate substantial quantities of nonspecific nucleic acid.</p><p>2D particle analysis showed that all the expression cassettes produced icosahedral particles of &#x0223c;33&#x02009;nm in diameter. Given that negative staining leads to an overestimation of particle size, these are very similar to the sizes of virions produced from natural infection (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The micrographs also highlighted a number of smaller particles purified along with PV57&#x003b4; VLPs, whereas these contaminating particles were rarely seen in the wt VLP purifications. These small particles may represent assembly defects for the PV57&#x003b4; mutant, leading to partially assembled particles. If so, these defects could be alleviated by the coexpression of HSP-90, which previously was shown to be beneficial for PV capsid assembly (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Alternatively, these particles could be contaminants, which, for example, could be derived from yeast chaperones or enzyme complexes that copurify with PV57&#x003b4; for unknown reasons.</p><p>Unfortunately, the VLPs produced in this study were in the nonnative conformation, as highlighted by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>), and the clear conformational difference between the <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs and the PV virions was apparent by 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3b</xref>). Although this was expected for the wt sequence, it was surprising for PV57&#x003b4;. The PV57&#x003b4; mutant previously was shown to produce ECs in both C and D antigenic conformations in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is clear that the ELISA may not detect lower levels of antigen, as illustrated by no detection of either PV57&#x003b4;-2A-3CD or PV57&#x003b4;-IRES-3CD here. These data also suggest that the alternative, dual promoter expression cassette should be the primary choice for the production of other enterovirus VLPs. Although we cannot be certain that the <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs produced here would not lead to a protective immune response, the observation that these are positive for C antigen suggests that they are poor inducers of neutralizing antibodies and, therefore, are unlikely to induce protective immune responses (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The lack of pocket factor or the incorporation of a suboptimal molecule also could be responsible for the dominance of the C conformation. Pocket factor has been identified as a small lipid moiety that binds in a hydrophobic cleft in VP1 (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This molecule contributes to maintaining capsid stability and is displaced during receptor binding and consequent conformational changes associated with the cell entry process. Capsids produced in mammalian cells have a natural pocket factor; however, it is unclear whether VLPs produced in heterologous expression systems bind a cofactor that occupies the pocket. Structural analysis by cryo-EM of plant-derived PV VLPs failed to demonstrate the presence of pocket factor, suggesting that pocket-binding lipids can be expression system dependent (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, Rombaut and Jore (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) found that wt PV VLPs produced in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> required the addition of pocket binding compounds to maintain the native conformation, suggesting either the absence of pocket factor or the incorporation of a pocket factor with low binding affinity, which was easily displaced through the addition of pocket binding compounds.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe we have shown that <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> is a viable expression system for large-scale production of PV VLPs, which share characteristics with ECs produced from mammalian cells. In accordance with other studies, we have shown that a dual promoter expression system is the most efficient way of producing picornavirus VLPs. Additionally, we also demonstrated translational control over protein expression levels through the use of molecular biology approaches, utilizing the TaV 2A peptide and the RhPV IRES. Although the PV57&#x003b4; VLPs used here were shown to have stability superior to that of the wt when produced in a mammalian system, the stabilization did not extend to particles expressed in yeast, possibly for the reasons outlined above. However, in preliminary experiments using the thermostable mutants previously characterized by Fox et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), we have shown <italic>Pichia</italic> to be capable of efficiently producing D antigen. Therefore, we believe that this system has the potential to produce a VLP vaccine not only for a polio-free world but also as a model system for enterovirus VLP vaccine production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>HeLa cells were obtained from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), UK.

For the dual promoter constructs, the region from position 1 of the 3CD pPink-HC to position 1285 was amplified by PCR, with the primers inserting a SacII restriction site at both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the product. The P1 expression plasmid was linearized by SacII (NEB), and then the 3CD PCR product was inserted into SacII-linearized P1 plasmid.

Samples were imaged across a range of defocus values (&#x02212;2.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m to &#x02212;3.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) at a nominal magnification of &#x000d7;25,000, resulting in an object sampling of 0.418&#x02009;nm/pixel.</p></sec><sec id="s4.8"><title>Image processing.</title><p>Raw micrographs were visualized with ImageJ, 1.51d (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The measuring tool of ImageJ was used to calculate VLP/virion diameter; three separate measurements were taken and averaged to give a diameter for each VLP/virion.</p><p>The RELION-3.0 pipeline (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) was used for further image processing of EM data. To generate templates for automated particle picking, a subset of particles was manually picked, extracted, and then classified by reference-free 2D classification. Automated particle picking resulted in large numbers of &#x0201c;junk&#x0201d; particles (corresponding to overlapping VLPs, disassembled VLPs, and other contaminants), which were removed by excluding poor-quality classes from a single round of reference-free 2D classification. Particles from the remaining classes were subjected to another round of reference-free 2D classification, and the resultant class averages were inspected. For each round of 2D classification, a regularization parameter of 2 was specified, and classification was allowed to proceed for 25 iterations. No symmetry was imposed during the 2D classification.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Elisabetta Groppelli, Morgan Herod, Diane Wilkinson, and Natalie Kingston, as well as other members of the Stonehouse/Rowlands group, at the University of Leeds, for their insightful contributions.
