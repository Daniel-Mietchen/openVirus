  <p>Principle of next generation sequencing platforms currently available.</p>
  <p>
   <italic>Roche 454</italic>, specific adaptor containing DNAs are denatured into single strands and captured by amplification beads followed by their emulsion PCR then pyrosequencing where oxyluciferin release is monitored. 
   <italic>SOLiD</italic>, this is a ligation based method that uses DNA ligase enzyme to identify the presence of nucleotide at a given position in a DNA sequence. 
   <italic>Illumina</italic>, selected DNA fragments are ligated with adaptors, and primers designed against them are used for the synthesis. Bridge amplification is carried by PCR and polony generations take place. 
   <italic>Oxford Nanopore</italic>, This is actually based on the tunneling of polymer molecules passing through a protein nanopore, separating two compartments. Movement of DNA through this pore causes disruption in the current set against the voltage across the pore. Change in the current helps to identify the specific molecule and real time advances the quick data analysis.
