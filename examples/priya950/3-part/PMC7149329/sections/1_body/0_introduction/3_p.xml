<p id="p0015">Over the past decade massively parallel sequencing technologies have become the focus of development. Its potential to gain insight into the structure, function, or regulation of genomes and genes has revolutionized many disciplines of life science. The utilization of these techniques in molecular diagnostics has been exploited in microbiology with the potential to detect novel microorganisms, including viruses in diverse specimens and ecosystems. It can also be used for inspection of viral diversity, evolution and spread, for investigation of pathogenesis of viral agents and for characterization of the viral community (
