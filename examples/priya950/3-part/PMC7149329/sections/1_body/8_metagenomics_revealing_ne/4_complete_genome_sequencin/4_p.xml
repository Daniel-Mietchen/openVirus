<p id="p0395">Another well-known virus family that encompasses large dsDNA viruses, among them the feared pathogen of smallpox, is 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>. This virus family has a rather wide host-range spanning from invertebrates to human, including fish. The presence of pox-like viruses in fish was discovered in carp (
 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) 40 years ago (
 <xref rid="bib168" ref-type="bibr">Murakami et al., 1976</xref>) causing the carp edema disease (
 <xref rid="bib177" ref-type="bibr">Ono et al., 1986</xref>). The causative agent could not be isolated yet, in spite of the several attempts, however its complete genome sequencing using metagenomics is in the pipeline (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Haenen et al., 2016</xref>). Another poxvirus (salmon gill poxvirus) was reported from salmon (
 <italic>Salmo salar</italic>), and its full genome was determined by NGS using the organs of diseased fish. Phylogeny inference suggested that the fish poxvirus represented the most basal branch of the subfamily 
 <italic>Chordopoxvirinae</italic> (
