<p id="p0390">Ranaviruses of fish (family 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>) were also sequenced by NGS. The European sheatfish virus was isolated from wels catfish (

 <xref rid="bib221" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 1991</xref>). These viruses share very high nucleotide identity alongside their entire genome (99%). After sequencing their whole genome by NGS, regions showing insertions/deletions were identified, which allows us to design PCR-based diagnostic that differentiates between the viruses without sequencing them (
 <xref rid="bib151" ref-type="bibr">Mavian et al., 2012</xref>). NGS could also be used, if the isolation of a virus fails.
