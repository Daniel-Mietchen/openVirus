<p id="p0385">NGS could be used for the full-length sequencing of already known viruses, this method proved to be very useful for the complete genome characterization of large dsDNA viruses (adeno-, herpes-, iridovirus). For example, the complete genomes of all members of the genus 
 <italic>Cyprinivirus</italic> (Cyprinid herpesviruses, CyHV-1, -2, -3 and Anguillid herpesvirus, AngHV-1) were sequenced by NGS, their genome sizes proved to be the largest among herpesviruses (248–295 kbp). Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (KHV) is the most ill-famed among the above mentioned viruses, revealing its complete genome was necessary for developing reliable diagnostic methods (PCR, qPCR) and designing DNA vaccine for KHV (

In another study, the deep sequencing of poly(A) RNA of the formerly mentioned AngHV-1 was carried out, providing the first data about the transcriptome of a fish herpesvirus. They found surprisingly lots of RNA splicing, and a low level (1.5/%) of antisense transcription in predicted protein-coding regions unlike in the genome of mammalian herpesviruses (

 <italic>Ictalurivirus</italic> were also sequenced, namely the Ictalurid herpesvirus 2 (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Borzak et al., 2018</xref>) and the Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (Doszpoly et al., unpublished). These viruses have a significantly shorter genome (143–165 kbp) than that of the cypriniviruses.
