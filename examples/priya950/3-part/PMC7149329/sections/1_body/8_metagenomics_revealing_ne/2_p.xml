<p id="p0365">Diseases caused by viruses have a devastating economic effect on aquaculture worldwide, which could be estimated in billions of US dollars annually. NGShas speeded up and revolutionized the viral research of aquatic viruses, as well. The high abundance of aquatic viruses has been known since the 1990s (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Hara et al., 1991</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib188" ref-type="bibr">Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that viruses are the most abundant organisms in the marine environment (

 <xref rid="bib237" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2004</xref>). The large number of viral ORFs showing no homologies to any known sequences in databases suggest that the diversity of aquatic viruses may be even greater than imagined (

However, these aquatic viruses infect a much wider range of marine and freshwater species than fishes and shrimps, which are the economically most important species for humans, majority of the detected viruses have hosts among phyto- and zooplankton, and some of them were found in marine mammals, as well. Four major application of NGS in aquaculture could be distinguished and will be discussed below in this order: (1) Metagenomic characterization of the viromes of aquatic environment. (2) Whole genome sequencing of already known/isolated viruses. (3) Discovering novel viruses in diseased or asymptomatic hosts. (4) Molecular epidemiology (tracking the mutations causing changes in the virulence/pathogenicity of viruses), and studying the evolution of viruses (
