<p id="p0415">Tilapia lake virus, an orthomyxo-like virus, was also detected by NGS from brain tissues of diseased fish (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bacharach et al., 2016</xref>). In an interesting case, three viruses from three different virus families were described in a single sea bream (
 <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) using NGS. Fish showed the symptoms of lymphocystis disease, usually caused by an iridovirus (lymphocystis disease virus, LCDV). However, in this case a papilloma- and a polyomavirus were also detected in the same specimen, their complete genome sequences were recovered, providing the first description of a papillomavirus in fish. Moreover, the genome of the sequenced iridovirus (termed as LCDV-Sa) proved to be much longer (the largest known vertebrate iridovirus genome) then the formerly described LCDVs, thus LCDV-Sa should be considered a novel and distinct virus species within the genus
