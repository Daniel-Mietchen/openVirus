<p id="p0400">If all the traditional methods to identify viruses have failed and when the viral pathogen is not culturable in vitro, then NGS is a very powerful tool to discover novel viruses. For example, a novel ssRNA virus was detected from carp (
 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) in Hungary by metagenomics. Its genome proved to be 8712 nucleotide in lengths. The virus was named fisavirus, phylogenetic calculations clustered it under the order 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic>, and it shows a distant relation to posaviruses, however a novel family should probably be established for this virus (
