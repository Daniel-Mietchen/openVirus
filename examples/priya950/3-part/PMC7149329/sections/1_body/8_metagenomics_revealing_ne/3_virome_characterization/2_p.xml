 <italic>Caudovirales</italic>) infecting a wide range of microbial hosts (
 <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>) and members of the family 
 <italic>Phycodnaviridae</italic> (large eukaryotic phytoplankton viruses) showed the highest abundance. For example in a study on the virome of the marine environment in Goseong Bay (Korea), the BLAST searches showed that only 0.74% of the sequences were associated with known viruses, and 87% of these known sequences were originating from bacteriophages and only 13% showed homology to viruses of eukaryotes (
