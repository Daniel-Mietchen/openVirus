<p id="p0430">Viral metagenomics based on sequence-independent amplification techniques coupled with massive parallel sequencing on new generation sequencers have led to the discovery of numerous novel animal DNA and RNA viruses in intensively reared livestock and poultry, pets, and selected aquaculture species over the past decade. In most cases, the pathogenic role, if any, of the newly discovered viruses has remained unclear. Direct and indirect epidemiological investigations, coupled with animal experiments, will be necessary to obtain clearer indications for an etiologic and clinical connection. Nonetheless, new portable next generation sequencers are on the horizon and MinIon sequencer has proven to serve a promising approach in the field application of disease outbreaks. Currently, the application of this laboratory approach is still in the developmental stage and will likely remain so until per sample sequencing costs becomes acceptable for farmers or pet owners, clinical sensitivity approaches the sensitivity of other multiplexed molecular methods commonly used in diagnostic laboratories and, importantly, bioinformatics pipelines become an easy task not requiring special skills.</p>
