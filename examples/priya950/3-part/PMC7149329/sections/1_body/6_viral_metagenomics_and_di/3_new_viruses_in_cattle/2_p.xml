 <xref rid="bib209" ref-type="bibr">Schlottau et al., 2016</xref>) have been identified in the brain tissues of bovine with encephalitis, having phylogenetic similarity with that of ovine astrovirus, were sequenced through metagenomics. Metagenomics helped in establishing the relationships between various neurologic diseases among various farm animals like bovine, mink, sheep, etc., and comparison was drawn with the outbreak in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Blomstrom et al., 2010</xref>). Initially, BoAstV-NeuroS1 etiology was misdiagnosed. But metagenomics led to the proper diagnosis of an astrovirus-related neurologic disorder. A novel astrovirus has also been reported in diarrheic Yak having genetic closeness with deer in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (
