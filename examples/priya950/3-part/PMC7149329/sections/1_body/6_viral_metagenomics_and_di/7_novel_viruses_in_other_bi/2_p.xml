 <xref rid="bib183" ref-type="bibr">Phan et al. (2013)</xref> collected fecal specimens from feral pigeons. They identified and proposed a new genus, namely aviparvovirus. Two related picornaviruses, Mesivirus-1 and -2, were also characterized. Moreover, they described group G RV from pigeons. 
 <xref rid="bib224" ref-type="bibr">Teske et al. (2017)</xref> identified novel aviadenovirus (pigeon adenovirus 2) in the fecal virome of domestic pigeons, sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. This novel virus may have immunosuppressive potential, which has a role in the evolution of a multifactorial disease, the young pigeon disease syndrome.
