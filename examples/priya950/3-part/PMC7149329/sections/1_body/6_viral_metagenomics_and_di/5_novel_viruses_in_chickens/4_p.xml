 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Ledermann et al. (2014)</xref> characterized the complete nucleotide sequence a novel Sunguru virus (family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), which was first isolated from the blood of domestic chickens from a market in Uganda in 2011. The semiconductor sequencer, Ion Torrent PGM, was used in this study. There is no evidence for this agent to be able to cause disease, moreover the mode of transmission is unknown; thus, further investigations will be needed to determine these missing but important details.
