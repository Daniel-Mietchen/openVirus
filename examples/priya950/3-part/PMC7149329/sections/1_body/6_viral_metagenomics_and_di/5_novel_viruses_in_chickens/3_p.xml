 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Bullman et al. (2014)</xref> characterized a novel picornavirus (sicinivirus) from fecal samples of broilers which was proposed to represent a novel genus within 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. It was considered as a putative avian pathogen, because only a few picornavirus have been detected in birds. 
 <xref rid="bib248" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</xref> identified the first sicinivirus isolate (strain JSY) from layer chickens by using viral metagenomics technique. The chickens showed serious symptoms associated with high mortality. Later, 
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015b</xref> identified the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus from chicken. It is similar to two chickensâ€™ megriviruses from Hungary. It was suggested that both viruses belong to the same species, Melegrivirus A, but based on the nucleotide identity analysis they may represent different serotypes. The young commercial chickens often suffer from transmissible viral proventriculitis and the novel picornavirus is thought to be responsible for this disease. 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Boros et al. (2016)</xref> reported the complete genome of six known picornaviruses and a novel virus, called chicken phacovirus 1, from a diarrheic chicken.
