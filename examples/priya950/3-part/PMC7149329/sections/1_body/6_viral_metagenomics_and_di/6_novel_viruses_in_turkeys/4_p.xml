They examined fecal samples by metagenomics analysis (Illumina HiSeq) and characterized picobirnavirus strains associated with LTS and non-LTS turkeys. In 2016, Day et al. characterized enteric picornaviruses in turkey and chicken samples also, which may participate in the development of the enteric disease syndromes.
