<p id="p0225">In 2015, BÃ¡nyai et al. described a novel clade of avipoxviruses (turkey poxvirus-HU1124/2011) in turkeys associated with cutaneous and oral cavity lesions. Interestingly, the flock was vaccinated by commercial fowlpox virus vaccines. This study reaffirms that for better prevention, it is important to characterize genetic differences between strains and monitor avipoxviruses in birds.</p>
