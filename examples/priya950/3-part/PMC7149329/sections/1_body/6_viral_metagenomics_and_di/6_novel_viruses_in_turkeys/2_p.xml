 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Day et al. (2010)</xref> performed metagenomics analysis on RNA virus community in the turkey gut by using Genome Sequencer. Their study targeted the presence of turkey-origin picornaviruses, picobirnaviruses, and caliciviruses. The detection of putative novel enteric viruses in turkey is very important for the poultry industry, as these discoveries may allow new insight into the etiology of multifactorial diseases, such as severe enteric disease which is associated with high mortality in turkey flocks.
