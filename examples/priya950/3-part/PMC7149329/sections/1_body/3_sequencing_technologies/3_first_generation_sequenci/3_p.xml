<p id="p0050">Sequencing methods have benefited from the development of PCR, recombinant DNA technologies, discovery and molecular cloning of thermostable sequencing polymerases (e.g., Taq polymerase), and reverse transcriptase, as well as the development of fluorescent dye-labeled ddNTPs and process parallelization, which facilitated the birth of genome projects and the field of metagenomics (

Collectively, the major advantages of this technology are the long read lengths and the excellent resolution of sequence repeats and homopolymer regions. The drawbacks include the limited throughput and the relatively high per base sequencing cost (
