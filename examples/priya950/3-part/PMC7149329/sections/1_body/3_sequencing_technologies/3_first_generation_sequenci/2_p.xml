<p id="p0045">Since 1970s two methods have been developed to determine the precise order of nucleotides (DNA sequencing). In 
 <xref rid="bib206" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>, “plus and minus” method was published by Sanger and Coulson and historically it was the first DNA sequencing method. In 1977, Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert invented a new protocol (Maxam-Gilbert sequencing or chemical sequencing), which is based on chemical cleavage of the radiolabelled bases and subsequent separation of the resulting DNA fragments by electrophoresis. This method, however, has not become widely adopted. Finally, in 
 <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>, Sanger et al. accomplished the method of DNA sequencing which ultimately led to the development of the “dideoxy method” or chain-termination sequencing technique. This process—which definitively amended the progress of DNA sequencing technology—depends on the application of dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to cause base-specific termination of primed DNA synthesis. Initially, the radio-labeled fragments were separated by denaturating polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. These days the technique is coupled with fluorescence and capillary electrophoresis-based sequencers.
