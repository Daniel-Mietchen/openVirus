<p id="p0095">To overcome some inconveniences related to second-generation sequencing technologies (e.g., the lengthy procedure of library preparation step, difficult genome assembly due to the relatively short read lengths, biases in identification of indels and homopolymer regions), the third-generation sequencing methods has been developed. At present two approaches are available in the market.</p>
