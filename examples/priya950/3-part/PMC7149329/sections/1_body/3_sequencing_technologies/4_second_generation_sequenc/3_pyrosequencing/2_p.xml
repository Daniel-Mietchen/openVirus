<p id="p0060">The first commercially available NGS technology was the “pyrosequencing technique” developed by 454 Life Sciences in 2005 and acquired by Roche in 2007, which is a sequencing-by-synthesis method (

 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2.2</xref> ). The Adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase converts pyrophosphate into ATP, which is used as a substrate for luciferase, hence visible light is detected and measured (chemiluminescence) with charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The process is reinitiated by adding the next complementary dNTP in the next dispensing cycle (

The method has disadvantages, including the high error rates in homopolymer repeats, the appearance of indels (insertions, deletions), as well as the time consuming sample preparation protocols. In contrast, the number of sequencing reactions and reads dramatically extended, the quality of data improved by reducing cross-talk between reaction wells, and the system was miniaturized (PicoTiterPlates) enabling the reduction of reaction volume. Furthermore, this platform provides long read lengths (400 bp to 1 kb) (
