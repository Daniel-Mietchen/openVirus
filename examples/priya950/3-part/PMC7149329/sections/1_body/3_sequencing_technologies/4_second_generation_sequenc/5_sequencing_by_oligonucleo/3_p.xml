<p id="p0080">Due to the di-base encoding system and the exact call chemistry (ECC), the accuracy is greater than 99.94% (5500 Series SOLiD System’s accuracy is 99.99%). It provides inherent error correction, because the probes interrogate two base per reaction. In addition, sequencing of homopolymeric regions by the SOLiD technology is not a major issue. Besides more efficient sequencing, the throughput is increased on 5500 series (up to 10–15 Gb on 5500, up to 120 Gb per run on 5500xl W). Nonetheless, the major drawback of the method is the very short read lengths (75 bp (fragment), 75 bp×35 bp (paired-end), up to 60 bp×60 bp (mate-paired)) and the need for advanced computational infrastructure [
