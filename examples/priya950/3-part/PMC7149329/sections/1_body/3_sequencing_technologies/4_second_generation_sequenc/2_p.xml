<p id="p0055">These methods can handle the parallel sequencing of several samples by molecular barcoding at very high-throughput and at reduced per nucleotide costs due to the miniaturization of the sequencing reactions. For metagenomic applications an added advantage was the lack of need for prior cloning of amplified target genomic DNA/RNA. With the initiation of NGS methods, the efficiency of DNA and RNA-base examinations explosively increased and the relative costs of sequencing have dramatically decreased (
