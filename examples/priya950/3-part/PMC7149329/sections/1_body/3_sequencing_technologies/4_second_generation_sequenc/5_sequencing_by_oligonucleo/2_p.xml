<p id="p0075">Another commercially available NGS platform, the Sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD) technology, also known as polony sequencing, was developed by George Church. The technology was purchased and improved by Applied Biosystems in 2007. The sequencer adopts the technology of two-base sequencing based on ligation sequencing. These probes are fluorescently labeled and compete for ligation to the sequencing primer by DNA ligase. The fluorescent signal is captured when the probe complement to the template is ligated. The cycle can be repeated by using cleavable probes to remove the fluorescent dye or by removing and hybridizing a new primer to the template.</p>
