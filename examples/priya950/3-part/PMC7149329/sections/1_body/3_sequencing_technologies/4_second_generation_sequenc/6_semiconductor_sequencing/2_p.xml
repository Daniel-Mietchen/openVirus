<p id="p0085">With Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing a new paradigm in next generation sequencing was established in 2010. The sequencing technology exploits the fact that addition of a dNTP to a DNA polymer releases an H+ ion and changes the pH of the solution that is proportional to the numbers of incorporated nucleotides. If there are two identical bases on the DNA strand, the sequencing chip will record two identical bases. If the next nucleotide is not a match, no base will be recorded. This process can be detected by a sequencing chip, which functions like a small solid-state pH meter. Overall, the method provides shorter workflow and simpler, faster, and more affordable sequencing to users. Life Technologies offers several next generation sequencing systems and sequencing chips: Ion Proton with Ion PI Chip, Ion S5 System with Ion 520, 530 540 Chip Kit, Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) with the Ion 314, 316, 318 Chip. The read lengths (200–400 bp), the accuracy (99%) and the run time (2–7 hours) are similar, but there are differences in the output (reads per run ranges from 0–5 to 60–80 million reads/run; with up to 2–10 Gb per run). The major disadvantages of this technology are biases in detection of insertions, deletions, and homopolymer sequences. However, there are numerous advantages like stable quality of sequencing, better GC depth distribution, higher map rate, relatively longer read lengths, and fastness [
