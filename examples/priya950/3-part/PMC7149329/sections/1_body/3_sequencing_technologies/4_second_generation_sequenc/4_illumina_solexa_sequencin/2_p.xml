<p id="p0065">Solexa developed the Genome Analyzer in 2006 that was acquired by Illumina in 2007. Currently, it is the most widespread sequencing system with the technology of sequencing-by-synthesis (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2.2</xref>). It differs from the Roche 454 sequencer in that it uses reversible chain-terminating nucleotides, which are fluorescently labeled. The fluorescent tags block the 3â€²-OH of the new nucleotide and so the next base can only be added when the tag is removed. When a nucleotide is incorporated into DNA template strands, the photon emission from each cluster is recorded by a CCD camera. Illumina provides currently benchtop sequencers (iSeq 100, MiniSeq, MiSeq/MiSeq Dx/MiSeq FGx, and NextSeq 550/NextSeq 550 Dx) and production-scale sequencers (HiSeq 2500/HiSeq 3000/HiSeq 4000, HiSeq X series Five or Ten, and NovaSeq 6000).
