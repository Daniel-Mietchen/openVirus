<p id="p0355">A recent evolution toward the diagnostic application of NGS takes advantage of an enrichment/selection step of cDNA with a mixture of oligonucleotide DNA and RNA probes (targeted genome capture, TGC) (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Gnirke et al., 2009</xref>). TGC coupled with NGS has been performed to detect and generate sequence data of multiple pathogens from three felid species (domestic cats, bobcats, and mountain lions) (
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Thirty-one pathogens in 28 samples representing nine of 11 targeted taxa were retrieved from the NGS experiments. Eleven out of 31 pathogens had not been previously detected despite being subjected to standard diagnostic methods. Seven of 11 pathogens were completely or partially sequenced, including feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus, feline foamy virus, felid alphaherpesvirus 1, and feline leukemia virus.
