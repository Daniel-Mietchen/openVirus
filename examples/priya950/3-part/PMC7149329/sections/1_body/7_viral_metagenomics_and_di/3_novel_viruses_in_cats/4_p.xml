 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2012a</xref>). The pathogenic role of bocaparvovirues is unclear. The nearly complete genome sequence of a feline bocaparvovirus has been subsequently retrieved in the brain tissues of a cat also infected with feline panleukopenia virus. This was the first evidence of nervous system infection by bocaparvovirus (
