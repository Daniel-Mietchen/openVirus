<p id="p0255">Deep sequencing of pooled stools of wild and domestic canids (wolfs and dogs) in Portugal (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Conceição-Neto et al., 2017</xref>) has revealed at least 15 different viruses of 12 virus families, including 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> (densovirus, protoparvovirus, dependoparvovirus, and bocaparvovirus), 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (kobuvirus), 
 <italic>Nodaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Paramixoviridae</italic> (canine distemper virus), 
 <italic>Mycodnaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Vigaviridae</italic>, and a number of unassigned viruses. Some of the identified viruses (caninovirus, gemycircularvirus, and densovirus), which are commonly found in arthropods, were likely associated with diet, as wild canids may feed on carcasses infested with a wide range of insects. A novel wolf bocavirus was identified, distantly related to other canine and feline bocaparvoviruses.
