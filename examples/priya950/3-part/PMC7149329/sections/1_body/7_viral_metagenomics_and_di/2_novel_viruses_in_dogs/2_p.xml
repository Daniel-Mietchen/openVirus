<p id="p0250">The first study describing the use of high-throughput sequencing for exploring the virome of dogs dates back to 2011 (
 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Deep sequencing of nucleic acids from the feces of 18 diarrheic dogs were identified as known canine parvoviruses, coronaviruses, and RVs. Also, the study discovered the genomes of canine kobuvirus (
 <italic>Picornavirida</italic>e) and sapovirus (
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>). Canine sapovirus constituted a novel genogroup within the genus 
 <italic>Sapovirus</italic>, a group of viruses also associated with human and animal diarrhea.
