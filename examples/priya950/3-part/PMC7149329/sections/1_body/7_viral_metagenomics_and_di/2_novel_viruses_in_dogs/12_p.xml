<p id="p0300">A novel flavivirus (ssRNA+) with considerable genomic similarity to human hepatitis C virus was discovered in 2011 in respiratory samples of domestic dogs and tentatively named as canine hepacivirus (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Burbelo et al., 2012</xref>), and both viruses are currently referred to as nonprimate hepacivirus (NPHV). Epidemiological investigations in the UK dog population identified NPHV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in tracheal tissues of 48 out of 210 dogs and in the liver, lung, and/or tracheal tissues of 12 out of 20 dogs. The presence of NPHV RNA was confirmed by in situ hybridization. Histopathological examination demonstrated a trend toward higher histopathological scores in NPHV-positive respiratory tissues, although, this was not statistically significant (
