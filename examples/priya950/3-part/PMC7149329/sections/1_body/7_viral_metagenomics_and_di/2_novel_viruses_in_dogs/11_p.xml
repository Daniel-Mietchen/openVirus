<p id="p0295">Several advances have been gathered using sequence-independent assays and deep sequencing for caliciviruses (ssRNA+) of pets. Caliciviruses include important enteric pathogens of humans (noroviruses and sapoviruses) (

 <xref rid="bib176" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 2015</xref>) and animal viruses (

 <xref rid="bib190" ref-type="bibr">Radford et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib175" ref-type="bibr">Ohlinger et al., 1990</xref>). In 2008 noroviruses were first discovered in dogs (
 <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2008</xref>). The virus was genetically related to Alphatron-like (GIV) human noroviruses. In the subsequent years, norovirus strains genetically heterogeneous have been reported in several countries (

 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib229" ref-type="bibr">Tse et al., 2012</xref>) and exposure of dogs to noroviruses has been confirmed in several epidemiological investigations (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Caddy et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib157" ref-type="bibr">Mesquita et al., 2014</xref>). In 2011 the genome of a canine sapovirus was reconstructed in a metagenomic study in the United States (
 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Similar sapoviruses have been identified later on in Italy (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Bodnar et al., 2016</xref>) and Japan (
 <xref rid="bib220" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 2015</xref>). Also, specific antibodies and age-related patterns of prevalence have been identified in dogs, confirming that the virus is common in dogs (
 <xref rid="bib154" ref-type="bibr">Melegari et al., 2018</xref>). In 2015, a novel vesivirus was reported in Italy (
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Martella et al., 2015</xref>). The canine vesivirus was highly related to caliciviruses found as contaminants of Chinese hamster ovary cells in the United States and Europe (strain 2117-like) and distantly related to the prototype canine calicivirus strain 48. The virus was detected at a low frequency in household dogs but at a high frequency in kennel dogs. Genome sequencing of old (1960sâ€“70s) canine calicivirus isolates in the United States has characterized the isolates as either 2117-like or strain 48-like vesiviruses (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Binn et al., 2018</xref>). Also, an acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis outbreak caused by vesiviruses has been described in the United States in 2015 (
 <xref rid="bib191" ref-type="bibr">Renshaw et al., 2018</xref>). The outbreak affected 11 dogs following a stay in a pet housing facility and four dogs died.
