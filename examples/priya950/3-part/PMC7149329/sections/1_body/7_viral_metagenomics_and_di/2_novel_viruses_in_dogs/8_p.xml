<p id="p0280">Papillomaviruses (PVs) are nonenveloped, dsDNA viruses with a circular genome of about 8000 base pairs. They are generally host species-specific with some exceptions. Numerous of known PVs are associated with benign and malignant neoplasias of the skin and mucous membranes in humans and animals, but there is evidence that asymptomatic infections are more common. More than 200 human and 140 animal PVs have been characterized, illustrating broad genetic diversity (
