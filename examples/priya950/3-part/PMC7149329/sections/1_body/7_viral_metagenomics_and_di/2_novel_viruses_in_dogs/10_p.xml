<p id="p0290">Picornaviruses (ssRNA+) constitute one of the largest virus families and include several human and animal pathogens. However, picornaviruses were not known in the canine host until 2011, when a canine kobuvirus, genetically related to human Aichi virus, was discovered in fecal samples of dogs (
