A novel protoparvovirus, distantly related to canine parvovirus 2, was identified in young dogs with respiratory disease that tested negative to a panel of respiratory pathogens. The virus was also detected in collections of respiratory and enteric swabs, and its presence was significantly associated only in young animals (&lt;6 months) with respiratory disease (
