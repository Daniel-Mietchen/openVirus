<p id="p0120">NGS has dramatically increased the amount of sequenced data. Storage and handling of such data is challenging. Bioinformatics provide software and several workflows (bioinformatics pipelines) to analyze biological data. The main purposes include the conversion of NGS-based signals to sequence data that can be readily processed and the adequate interpretation of the processed sequence data to obtain the desired biological information (
