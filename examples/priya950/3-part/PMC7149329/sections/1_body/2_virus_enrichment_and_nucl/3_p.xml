<p id="p0035">The amount of extracted nucleic acids is often too low for sequencing on available next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms; in such a case the amplification of viral nucleic acids is inevitable. Sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) is among the most common amplification methods (
 <xref rid="bib195" ref-type="bibr">Reyes and Kim, 1991</xref>). Initially this method was carried out by starting with restriction digestion and followed by ligation of an asymmetric primer or adaptors to both ends of the DNA molecules. By using a primer complementary to the ligated oligonucleotide, the nucleic acid fragments present in the sample could be amplified by PCR. Since then the original method has been modified to achieve more effective enrichment of nucleic acids or identification of viruses, such as DNase-SISPA and Virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP. Another widely used method is random PCR. It uses a single primer with a known sequence at 5′ end and with a random hexamer or heptamer sequence at 3′ end in the first reaction. After that, the second PCR reaction is executable with a specific primer complementary to the defined 5′ of the first random primer. To amplify circular DNA viral genomes, rolling circle amplification is an alternative option. This method requires short oligonucleotide primers composed of random sequences and polymerase enzyme with strand displacement activity (e.g., bacteriophage ϕ29 DNA polymerase). Another ϕ29 DNA polymerase-based method is the multiple displacement amplification. These techniques are often called whole genome amplification methods (
