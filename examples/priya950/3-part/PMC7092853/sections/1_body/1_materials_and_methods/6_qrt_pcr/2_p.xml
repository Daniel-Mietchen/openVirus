<p id="p0065">The total RNA of cells was extracted 24 or 48 h after CET treatment using Trizol reagent (Ambion). Gene expression was then quantified using the One-Step qRT-PCR SYBR green kit (Bioman, cat no. QRP001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer sequences used for ZIKV, DENV, and β-actin are shown in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Specifically, qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates and absorbance was measured using the Roche Lightcycler 480 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Measurements were obtained in triplicate, and β-actin was used as an internal control. The relative quantification of gene expression was determined using the 2
