<p id="p0050">Cell viability profiles of CET-treated cells were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit 8 (DOJINDO Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a monolayer of Vero cells was plated in 96-well microplates, and variable concentrations of CET were added to triplicate wells. Vero cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. At the end of the incubation period, the culture medium was discarded, and 100 μl of fresh medium containing 10 μl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well for 1 h. The optical densities of treated cells were then measured at 450 nm using a Bio-Tek Synergy Multi-Mode microplate reader, and values for treated cells were normalized with those of untreated cells [
