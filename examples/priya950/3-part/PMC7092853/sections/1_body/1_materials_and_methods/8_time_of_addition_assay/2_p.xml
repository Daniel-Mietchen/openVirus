<p id="p0075">To determine which stage of the viral life cycle that CET acts upon, we compared its effects with full-duration treatment, co-treatment, pre-treatment, and post-treatment groups via a time of addition assay. For this, after confluent Vero cells were plated in 12-well microplates, indicated concentrations of CET were added to the medium at various time points as follows. (1) For the full-duration treatment group, CET was added throughout the infection period. (2) For the co-treatment group, CET was added at the initial point of ZIKV infection. (3) For the post-treatment group, CET was added after ZIKV infection. (4) For the pre-treatment group, CET was added 3 h before ZIKV infection. Following ZIKV infection, Vero cells in all treatment groups were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, at which point the levels of intracellular viral RNA were compared with those of a vehicle group using qRT-PCR [
