<p id="p0150">We further sought to determine the possible mechanism by which CET influences ZIKV RNA replication. Previous research which investigated VZV determined that both HT and HHT likely employ other mechanisms in inhibiting ZIKV. For example, HT and HHT likely inhibit lytic gene expression and replication, which may in turn interfere with signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in VZV lytic gene expression. On the other hand, in herpesviruses (HHVs), HT and HHT are able to block cell cycle progression during the G1/S or G2/M transition, which in turn affects lytic gene expression and replication [
