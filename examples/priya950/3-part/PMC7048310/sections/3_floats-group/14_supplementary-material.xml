  <title>Three-month incremental test model predictions of cluster frequency up to a year in advance.</title>
  <p>To predict the frequency of an antigenic cluster in X months in the future, we fit a two-part model that first predicted whether the cluster would be present at the specified date, and if so, then the estimated frequency. The number of clusters present at the time of initial sampling, but expected to persist in the future, decreases with increasing month-ahead predictions. Out of 2846 unique clusters, 2279 cluster were present above 1% relative frequency at 3 months; 1921 clusters at 6 months, 1624 clusters at 9 months, and 1378 clusters at 12 months. As the models predict further into the future, the model underestimates future-high frequency circulating clusters, which are usually clusters that will establish. We tested the performance of the best-fit model for each 3-month increment on a new data set consisting of 5 random time points over a 25-year period, corresponding to 310 time points over all 62 simulations. These test predictions are shown in panels a-d. To improve model fit, the target frequency, f
   <sub>c</sub>' in X months was log-transformed. The black line represents perfect agreement between the actual and predicted log frequencies. Black dots represent clusters that will eventually establish, and grey dots are clusters that will transiently circulate. In addition, we tried fitting the model the frequency fold in X monthsâ€™ time, i.e. f
   <sub>c(t+x)</sub> /f
   <sub>c(t)</sub>; however, the model's goodness-of-fit, as measured by the adjusted R
   <sup>2</sup> was consistently lower than that of the models predicting the log-transformed frequency.
