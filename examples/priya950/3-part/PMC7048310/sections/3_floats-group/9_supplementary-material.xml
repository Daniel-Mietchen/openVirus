  <title>The fate of novel antigenic clusters.</title>
  <p>(a) Each point represents the number of antigenic clusters in our simulations that reach increasing surveillance thresholds (i.e., relative frequency in the population). As the surveillance threshold increases from 1 to 10%, the number of candidate clusters decreases from 7969 clusters at the 1% threshold to 1816 clusters at the 10% surveillance threshold. Each point represents the number of data points we used to construct the predictive models for a given surveillance threshold. (b) Given a cluster has reached a surveillance threshold, the proportion of antigenic clusters that will establish (i.e. reaches &gt; 20% for 45 days) increases with higher surveillance thresholds.</p>
