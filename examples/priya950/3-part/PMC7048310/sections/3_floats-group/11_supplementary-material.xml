  <title>Predictive models that rely on data from a single sampling event perform similarly to those that include data from multiple sampling events.</title>
  <p>Each point represents the performance of the optimal combination of candidate predictors that best predicts the evolutionary fate of antigenic clusters under two different surveillance strategies, whether the model includes data from a single time point (yellow) or multiple time points (purple). For a target surveillance threshold, models that incorporated data from multiple sampling events used data from the 1% surveillance threshold, the mid-point relative frequency, and the target surveillance threshold. For the multiple sampling event models, candidate predictors included all variables listed in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s009">S1 Table</xref>, as well as the difference in predictor values between 1% and the mid-point relative frequency, and the mid-point relative frequency and the target surveillance threshold. Dots represent the median, and vertical error bars span the range of performance values across the five folds of cross-validation of the best-fit model. In our main results we focus on strategy that only incorporates current data because of the simplicity in the methodology and reduction of candidate predictors.
