  <title>The sensitivity and positive predictive value trade-off of two surveillance strategies: 1) surveillance threshold (circles, triangles) and 2) random sampling through time (squares).</title>
  <p>Each set of symbols highlights the tradeoff between sensitivity and positive predictive value at different probability thresholds for what constitutes a positive prediction, i.e. a future successful cluster. All models converge in areas with low sensitivity and high positive predictive value, where the probability threshold for what classifies as a positive prediction is 0.9. However, in regions of greater sensitivity, the random sample time model consistently underperforms models that use a &lt; 5% surveillance threshold. The black stars represent the probability threshold that maximizes the F1 value, the harmonic average of a model's positive predictive value and sensitivity.</p>
