  <title>The proportion of total infections caused by established clusters is more sensitive to a frequency criterion than the duration of time.</title>
  <p>Established antigenic clusters account for the majority of the disease activity. In our analysis, established clusters are those that circulate above 20% relative frequency for at least 45 days. We choose the most stringent criteria that, when only accounting for clusters that reached the criteria, still maintained the overall cyclical influenza dynamics.</p>
