<p>Another approach to estimating the growth rate of an emerging cluster is to treat it as a composite quantity. We evaluated several proxy measures of cluster growth rate, including the relative fold-change in frequency between two time points. Models based on fold change rather than the true growth rate actually have greater sensitivity, that is, they are more likely to detect clusters destined for dominance when they first emerge. However, the positive predictive values of our best models drop from 0.81 to 0.67, meaning that replacing the true growth rates with an approximation increases the rate of false alarms. Importantly, the proxy model improves with the addition of a second predictor, the variance in fold-change across the viral population, which can also be readily estimated from surveillance data. Thus, variance in fitness appears to be a robust secondary predictor of future sweeps, regardless of how fitness is quantified. Surprisingly, a model based on seemingly naive approximations of growth rate––the time elapsed between two frequency thresholds and the number of other co-circulating clusters rising in frequency––was even more accurate, though still inferior to the true growth rate models. We did not evaluate a promising alternative strategy for approximating fitness, based on the phylogenetic reconstruction of currently circulating sequences [

Finally, although not as informative as predictors that quantify the evolutionary and immunological state of the population, easily quantifiable predictors such as the total number of infected individuals or the frequency of the circulating dominant cluster, can be incorporated into future predictive models.
