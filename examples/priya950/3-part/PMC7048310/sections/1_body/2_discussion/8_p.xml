<p>As policy-makers consider new strategies for antigenic surveillance and forecasting, the trade-off between prediction accuracy and lead time has practical implications. For example, a detection system targeting new viruses as soon as they reach 1% relative frequency has the benefit of early warning and drawback of low accuracy, which translate into economic and humanitarian costs and benefits. On the positive side, early warning increases the probability that seasonal vaccines will provide a good match with circulating strains, and thus lowers the expected future morbidity and mortality attributable to seasonal influenza. Based on the vaccine production and delivery schedule, the surveillance window for emerging clades is from October to February for the Northern Hemisphere and vaccine composition is determined at an international meeting in February [

Our analysis suggests that, at nine months before an emerging cluster sweeps to dominance, it is likely to be circulating at a low relative frequency in the range of 1% to 4%. On the negative side, the low surveillance threshold for candidate clusters and consequent lower accuracy require far more surveillance and vaccine development resources than higher surveillance thresholds. In our simulations, for example, the number of clusters screened at the 1% threshold is an order of magnitude higher than at the 10% surveillance threshold and the number of false positive predictions potentially prompting further investigation is also manifold greater.
