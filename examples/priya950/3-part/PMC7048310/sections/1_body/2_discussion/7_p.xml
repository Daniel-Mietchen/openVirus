<p>Nonetheless, we believe that our simulation results provide robust insight into the limits of influenza surveillance and molecular forecasting. While the certainty of our predictions improves as clusters increase in relative frequency, there is a trade-off with lead time. The longer we wait to assess a rising cluster, the less time there will be to update vaccines and implement other intervention measures. For a successful cluster detected at a relative frequency of 1%, there will be, on average, 10 months before the cluster becomes established (maintains a relative frequency over 20% for 45 days). If detected only after reaching a relative frequency of 10%, the expected lead time shrinks to four months. Although real-world surveillance is noisy and dependent on sufficient sampling depth and geographic coverage, our results suggest that, with a perfect knowledge of the host and viral populations, predictions can be made with at least 85% sensitivity and confidence before a cluster rises to 10% of all circulating strains.</p>
