<p>While our study provides actionable suggestions for improving both the surveillance and forecasting of antigenic turnover, it is limited by several assumptions. One caveat of our method is that we do not capture the explicit phylogenetic structure of the influenza population. Therefore, we do not distinguish between clusters that are successful because of one mutation and clusters that are successful because of a series of mutations. If for instance, a novel antigenic mutation caused the emergence of a new cluster (phenotype) that circulated briefly before a second novel antigenic mutation caused a second phenotype that eventually achieved our defined criteria, we ignore the fact that the established cluster is a subclade of the first and that the antigenic mutation that conferred the first phenotype is fixed along with the second antigenic mutation [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This scenario follows Koelle &amp; Rasmussen’s description of a two-step antigenic change molecular pathway that leads to antigenic cluster transitions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our analysis is therefore relevant for scenarios that depict their described jackpot strategy—a combination of one large antigenic mutation occurring on a low deleterious background. Second, the simulation represents global H3N2 dynamics and ignores both differences in temperate and tropical transmission dynamics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the emergence of a novel antigenic cluster via importation. Prior studies have revealed considerable global variation in transmission rates, which should positively correlate with the frequency of cluster transitions. Furthermore, viruses that emerge in tropical regions are more likely to be the source of viruses that eventually circulate in temperate regions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Temperate regions produce more extreme seasonal bottlenecks, potentially leading to greater stochasticity in viral dynamics, which makes it more difficult for novel strains that emerge in temperate regions to spread globally [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For imported viruses, we expect the predictors of success to be similar to those arriving via mutation. However, an importing virus with a large antigenic jump may change the rate of establishment and reduce the time horizon for prediction. We also do not consider selective pressures imposed by seasonal vaccination. Its impact on antigenic turnover depends on vaccination rates and the immunological match between the vaccine and all co-circulating viruses. Seasonal vaccination could differentially modify the effective susceptibility of clusters, suppressing some while creating competitive vacuums for others. Theoretical study suggests that antigenic drift should slow down [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the circulation of co-dominant clusters may become more common [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Given these caveats, we emphasize our qualitative rather than the quantitative results. Our study highlights promising predictors of viral success, characterizes robust trade-offs between the timing, costs and accuracy of such predictions, and serves as proof-of-concept that model-derived surveillance strategies can accelerate and improve forecasts of antigenic sweeps. If we fit similar models to surveillance data as it becomes increasingly available, the resulting predictions will likely reflect greater uncertainty but perhaps naturally reflect global variation in influenza dynamics and vaccination pressures.
