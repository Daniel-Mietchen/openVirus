<p>For each surveillance threshold, we centered and scaled candidate predictors and removed collinear factors. Using five-fold cross validation, we partitioned the data into five subsets, keeping data from individual simulations in the same subsets. We fit mixed-effects logistic regression models using four subsets for training and controlling for differences between independent simulations. Predictors were added sequentially based on which term lowered the average Akaike Information Criterion of the five training folds the most and provided a statistically significant better fit than the reduced model.</p>
