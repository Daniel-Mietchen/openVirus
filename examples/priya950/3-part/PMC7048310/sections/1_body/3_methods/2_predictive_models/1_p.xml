<p>Restricting our analysis to transient and established clusters, we used generalized linear modeling to identify important early predictors of evolutionary fate. For each antigenic cluster, we predicted its evolutionary future (i.e., whether it ultimately becomes established) at specified surveillance thresholds, such as 5% relative frequency. Specifically, we recorded all candidate epidemiological and evolutionary predictors at the moment each cluster crossed the threshold. We analyzed all ten surveillance thresholds ranging from 1% to 10% at 1% increments. When a rising cluster reached 1% relative frequency, the median prevalence of infections caused by the cluster was 118 (IQR: 65–205); at 10% relative frequency, the median prevalence was 1039 (IQR: 503–1940).</p>
