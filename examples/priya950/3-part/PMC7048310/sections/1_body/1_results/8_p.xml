<p>Classifier models had substantial discriminatory and predictive power even when an antigenic cluster was present at low frequencies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Model AUC’s tended to decrease as the frequency of the candidate clusters increased. Conversely, the positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity increased at higher surveillance thresholds. The gains in sensitivity and PPV per month decreased at higher surveillance thresholds. Between the 1% and 5% surveillance thresholds, there was on average a 4% increase in sensitivity and a 4.5% increase in positive predictive value per month lost in lead-time. However, between the 6% and 10% surveillance thresholds, sensitivity gains dropped to 1.2% and PPV to 3.6% per month lost in lead-time. This decreasing tradeoff between gain in certainty and loss of lead-time reflected shorter intervals between surveillance thresholds as the cluster began to rapidly expand and the model’s prediction capabilities reached upper capacity.
