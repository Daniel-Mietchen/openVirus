<p>Our logistic regression model classified clusters as either 
 <italic>positives</italic> that are likely to establish or 
 <italic>negatives</italic> that are expected to circulate only transiently. As we increased the surveillance threshold, the fraction of successful clusters that were misclassified as negatives decreased. In a representative out-of-sample 25-year simulation, 17 of 132 detectable clusters eventually rose to dominance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Of these, 65% and 88% were correctly predicted when they reached the 1% and 10% surveillance threshold, respectively. The number of true negative events decreased considerably, from 109 at the 1% surveillance threshold to only 11 at the 10% surveillance threshold, while the other types of events held relatively constant.
