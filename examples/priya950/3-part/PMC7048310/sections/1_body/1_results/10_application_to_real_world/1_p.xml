<p>Finally, using 6271 real influenza A/H3N2 sequences sampled from around the globe between 2006 and 2018, we assessed whether this methodology can use available influenza surveillance data to predict emerging clusters. Using the opportunistic sampling nature of the data, our models classified clusters that had reached at least 1% relative frequency, but not yet 20% relative frequency as either likely to establish or as expected to circulate only transiently. Clusters were distinguished by single mutations to epitope sites on the HA1 sequence and successful clusters were those that reached a relative frequency of at least 20% for at least 45 days. Despite sparse sampling, the dynamics of antigenic transitions resembled those produced by our simulations (
