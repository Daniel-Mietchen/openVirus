<p>The World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) coordinates influenza surveillance efforts to survey and characterize the diversity of influenza viruses circulating in humans. Viral samples are rapidly analyzed via sequencing of HA and NA genes, serologic assays, and other laboratory tests to identify newly emerging antigenic clusters. Within the past decade, the number of complete HA gene sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu [

However, the research and public health communities have just begun to determine effective strategies for extracting and integrating useful information into the vaccine selection process.
