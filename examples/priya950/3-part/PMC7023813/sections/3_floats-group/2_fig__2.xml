  <p>The production and immune response of monoglycosylated influenza vaccine. The production of monoglycosylated split virus vaccine adds two key steps to the traditional egg-based platform. Kifunensine, a mannosidase I inhibitor, is added during egg inoculation to arrest viral glycoprotein processing, resulting in a uniformly high mannose composition. Endoglycosidase H is added after harvest to trim high mannose residues down to a single GlcNAc. The resultant monoglycosylated split vaccine provides a more diverse immune response and more effective cross-strain protection than conventional egg-based vaccines. HA
   <sub>fg</sub>, non-modified egg-based vaccine with complex type N-glycans attached to HA; HA
   <sub>hm</sub>, HA with only high mannose type N-glycans; HA
   <sub>mg</sub>, HA with a single GlcNAc at its N-glycosylation sites. Models of HA
   <sub>fg</sub>, HA
   <sub>hm</sub> and HA
   <sub>mg</sub> are created with Protein Data Bank ID code 3LZG and 6FYT by adding glycan with GlyProt (
