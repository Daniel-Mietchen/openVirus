<p id="Par68">Precisely characterizing influenza immunity and correlates of immune protection is one of the three major areas for improvement outlined in NIAID’s strategic plan for a universal influenza vaccine [

Serological assays such as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and single radial hemolysis (SRH) have long been held by regulatory agencies as a correlate of protection for inactivated influenza vaccine licensure. European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) criteria indicates that for seasonal influenza vaccine approval one of three conditions must be met: seroprotection (HI titer of ≧1:40 or SRH of 25 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) rate of over 70%, seroconversion (4-fold increase in titer) rate more than 40%, or a geometric mean increase (pre- vs post-vaccination) of 2.5 times in healthy adults, and 60, 30%, 2.0x respectively for elders [
