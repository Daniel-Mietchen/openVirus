<p id="Par69">However, HAI and SRH assays may not always be applicable when it comes to LAIV or novel next-generation vaccines currently under development. HAI measures the antibody-mediated inhibition of erythrocyte agglutination caused by HA binding to sialic acids on the erythrocyte surface. As such, the assay only detects antibodies directed at the HA head domain where its receptor binding site is located. Universal vaccine strategies based on eliciting immune response against conserved epitopes on the HA stem domain, M2, M1 or NP would not be detected by the HAI assay. SRH detects the concentration of influenza-targeting antibodies by measuring a ring of hemolysis caused by the antibody-virus-erythrocyte complex activating the complement system [
