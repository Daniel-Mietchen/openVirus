According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) adult influenza vaccine contract pricing for 2019â€“2020, the cost of the cell-based vaccine Flucelvax is approximately 40% higher than an inactivated egg-based vaccine produced by the same manufacturer. The recombinant HA vaccine Flublok can be more than twice as expensive as egg-based vaccines [
