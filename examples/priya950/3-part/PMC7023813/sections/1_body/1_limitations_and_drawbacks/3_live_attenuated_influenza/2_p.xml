<p id="Par45">Recently however, the necessity of effective replication in human respiratory tissue has emerged as an area of concern. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended against LAIV between 2016 to 2018 due to low efficacy of the H1N1 component [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The reason for this lack of efficacy is still unclear, but possibilities include viral interference of tetravalent vaccine strains resulting in reduced virus shedding for the weakest strain, strong cross-reactive antibodies from previous seasons preventing virus replication, and inherent lower replication in host tissue by the H1N1 pandemic strain [
