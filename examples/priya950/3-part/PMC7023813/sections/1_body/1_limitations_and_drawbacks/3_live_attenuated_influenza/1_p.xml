<p id="Par44">LAIV is generated by combining the HA and NA of currently circulating strains with the internal proteins of an attenuated cold-adapted strain. This results in a reassortant vaccine virus that can be administered intranasally and has some limited replicative ability in the human upper respiratory tract. As the entire influenza replication cycle is utilized at the site of infection, LAIV has also been reported to elicit cell-mediated immunity [
