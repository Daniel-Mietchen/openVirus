<p id="Par41">The strain-specific nature of current vaccines necessitates the annual selection of candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), including screening the antigenicity of isolates, preparing reassortant viruses, and adaptation of the virus to eggs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For egg-based manufacture, the entire process from strain selection to vaccine availability typically takes 6~8 months with tight time constraints, and any unexpected circumstance such as a delayed WHO strain recommendation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or unexpected low virus yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], can snowball into significant production delays and directly affect vaccine supply. This lengthy interval also gives circulating influenza viruses time to mutate, as it did during the 2014–2015 flu season when late-emerging H3N2 variants rendered the recommended vaccine strain ineffective [
