<p id="Par42">A second drawback of using an egg-based platform stems from the adaptation process of culturing a human virus in avian tissue, where adaptive mutations may accumulate and potentially change the strain’s antigenicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. HA, apart from being the primary target for neutralizing antibodies, is the main facilitator of influenza virus entry by binding to sialic acids on the surface of the host cells. Human influenza HA preferentially bind to α-2,6 linked sialic acids commonly found on epithelial cells in the human upper respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in egg-based production vaccine strains are inoculated into the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs which only contain α-2,3 linkages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. With successive passages, this becomes a selective pressure that can cause the acquisition or a total shift in receptor specificity, with its accompanying mutations and antigenic changes on HA’s receptor binding site. A recent example of this occurred during the 2016–2017 flu season, when egg-adapted vaccine strains were found to lack a glycosylation site (T160, H3 numbering) on H3N2 HA antigenic site B, one of the five major antigenic sites that induce neutralizing antibodies [
