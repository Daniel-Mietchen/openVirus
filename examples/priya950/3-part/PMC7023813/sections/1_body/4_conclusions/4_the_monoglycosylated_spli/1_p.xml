<p id="Par76">Due to the rapid mutation rate of the influenza virus, using only a single conserved epitope as the antigenic target for universal vaccine runs the risk of generating escape mutants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In our previous studies we have only demonstrated the concept that monoglycosylated split virus vaccine induces more stem-specific antibodies directed against conserved epitopes on the HA stem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, in theory by trimming off oligosaccharides on every N-glycosylation site on the HA, multiple conserved epitopes would be exposed, inducing a multi-faceted immune response that imposes a higher evolutionary barrier for escape mutant generation. Another influenza glycoprotein that could potentially benefit from the monoglycosylation process is NA. The preparation of monoglycosylated split virus vaccine would remove glycans from not only HA but also NA, hypothetically inducing more anti-NA antibodies that interfere with virus budding, disease progression and severity of symptoms [
