<p id="Par78">Whether novel vaccine strategies that are effective on healthy adults are equally suitable for all age groups remains a concern. Due to having the same constituents as an IIV, the monoglycosylated split vaccine can be expected to offer a similar safety profile as the conventional flu vaccine. As such, it is possible that formulations suitable for different age groups, such as reduced dosage for children and high dose/adjuvanted vaccines for the elderly, can also be applied to our monoglycosylated split vaccine. Furthermore, the robust humoral immunity induced by IIV assures sufficient protection for infants &lt; 6 months by maternal vaccination.</p>
