<p id="Par79">Even though recent advances in influenza vaccine manufacture such as cell-based and recombinant HA have allowed for a much quicker production timeline, using conventional strain-specific vaccines against a rapidly evolving influenza virus assures we are always playing catch-up. As our understanding of influenza pathogenesis and immune response continues to grow, developing a universal vaccine that provides long-lasting protection against divergent strains or subtypes is becoming an increasingly attainable goal. We believe our monoglycosylated split vaccine strategy that applies a simple modification step to pre-existing egg-based production platforms to provide broader immunity in the end product, is a significant step towards this goal.</p>
