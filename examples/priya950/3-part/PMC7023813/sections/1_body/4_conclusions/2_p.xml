<p id="Par74">Our group has pioneered the strategy of exposing previously-shielded conserved epitopes on the HA through enzymatic trimming of N-glycans. This technique has been shown to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against antigenically diverse strains of influenza viruses within a subtype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and thus hypothetically a trivalent or tetravalent monoglycosylated vaccine containing the three influenza subtypes (H1, H3, and influenza B) circulating in the human population would be, for all intents and purposes, a universal flu vaccine.
