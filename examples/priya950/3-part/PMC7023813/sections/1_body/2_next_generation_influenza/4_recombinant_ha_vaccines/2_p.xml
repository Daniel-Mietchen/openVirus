<p id="Par61">Another candidate is a chimeric HA (cHA) vaccine born from a collaboration between Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and GSK/NIH. This strategy originates from the observation that our immune system tends to focus on the immunodominant but highly variable HA head domain, while the subdominant conserved stem region has a better ability to elicit bnAbs. By sequential immunization with a cHA protein consisting of a stem from circulating strains coupled to an irrelevant HA head from exotic influenzas, the strategy is devised to re-direct our immune system to better stimulate stem-specific responses [

In a preclinical study, ferrets sequentially immunized with heterologous influenza strains including live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) bearing an H8 head domain and an H1 stem domain (cH8/1) and a split-inactivated vaccine bearing an H5 head domain and an H1 stem domain (cH5/1), conferred superior protection against challenge with pandemic H1N1 virus following different prime-boost combinations and immunization regimens [
