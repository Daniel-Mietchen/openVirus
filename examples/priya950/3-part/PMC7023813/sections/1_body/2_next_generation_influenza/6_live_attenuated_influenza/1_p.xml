<p id="Par64">CodaVax is an LAIV being developed by Codagenix that takes advantage of inherent human codon pair bias to reconstruct the influenza viral genome with synonymous but sub-optimal codons. This results in viral proteins that have the same amino acid sequence and antigenicity as wild type strains but attenuated due to excessive use of rare codons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In animal models, the vaccine is shown to be effective at lower doses than conventional LAIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. CodaVax has scheduled a phase I/II trial in the first quarter of 2017.
