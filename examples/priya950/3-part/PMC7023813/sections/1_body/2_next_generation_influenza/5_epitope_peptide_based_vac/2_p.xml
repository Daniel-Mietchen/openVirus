<p id="Par63">FLU-v is another epitope-based vaccine developed by SEEK (PepTcell) based on in silico multiple alignment of influenza sequences and prediction of possible T-cell epitopes. Six consensus sequences from influenza NP, M1 and matrix 2 (M2) proteins were identified and synthesized into a candidate vaccine. Flu-v has been shown to induce a specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> response against these conserved epitopes and confer protection against heterotypic infection in mice [
