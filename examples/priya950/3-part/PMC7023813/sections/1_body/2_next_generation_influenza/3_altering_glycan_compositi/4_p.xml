<p id="Par56">Therefore, our group focuses on harnessing glycoengineering techniques to alter N-glycan composition on the HA, creating recombinant HAs that retain only a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached to asparagine per N-glycosylation site (monoglycosylated HA, or HA
 <sub>mg</sub>). To accomplish this, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I deficient (GnTI
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>) human embryonic kidney cells that are unable to synthesize complex type N-glycans were used to produce secreted, transmembrane domain truncated HAs that have only high mannose residues on their N-glycosylation sites. These high mannose HAs were then further trimmed with the high mannose-cleaving enzyme endoglycosidase H leaving a single GlcNAc residue, dramatically decreasing the size and shielding effect of these N-glycans while still maintaining the native HA structure in its trimeric state.
