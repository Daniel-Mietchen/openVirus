<p id="Par53">Historically, a crucial strategy of influenza virus’ escape from pre-existing immunity is the addition of N-glycosylation sites on the immunodominant HA head domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. These bulky but poorly-immunogenic N-glycans allow the virus to hide antigenically-conserved domains from host immune system recognition [
