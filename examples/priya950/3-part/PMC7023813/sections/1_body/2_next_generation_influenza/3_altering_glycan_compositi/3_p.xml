<p id="Par55">These observations indicate that exposing the comparatively conserved, glycan-shielded regions of viral hemagglutinin could be a potential strategy to increase the breadth of influenza vaccine protection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, previous attempts have shown complete de-glycosylation of all carbohydrate moieties on influenza HA by either prokaryotic production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], tunicamycin treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] or PNGase F digestion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] does not appear to be a viable strategy. Conserved N-glycosylation sites on the HA stem are essential for intracellular transport, correct glycoprotein folding and HA trimerization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and a completely unglycosylated HA would have a high chance of altered antigenicity.
