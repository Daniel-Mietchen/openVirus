 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> are a family of enveloped viruses with a genome consisting of 6~8 segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, including four genera of influenza virus: A, B, C and D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Influenza A and B are the main cause of annual flu outbreaks in humans, with influenza A further classified into subtypes based on their surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 18 HA subtypes (H1~H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1~N11) are currently known, most notable today are the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes that co-circulate in the human population. Since the 1970s influenza B has diverged into two lineages based on antigenicity, the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, with little or no serum cross-reactivity [
