<p id="Par36">Recurrent influenza epidemics with pre-existing immunity occurs because the influenza virus employs two mechanisms to escape recognition: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is the gradual accumulation of point mutations on the influenza virus’ surface glycoproteins HA and NA, driven by high error rates (estimated at 1.5 × 10
 <sup>− 5</sup> per nucleotide per replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) of the virus’ RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Mutations that allow the virus to evade the host immune system are positively selected for and become fixed, resulting in the rise of new strains that are antigenically different from what the host was vaccinated against. The second escape mechanism, antigenic shift, is the reassortment of gene segments across different strains infecting the same host, resulting in a wholesale change in antigenicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Antigenic shift have historically been associated with influenza pandemics, the most recent example being the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 that included segments from classical swine H1N1, Eurasian swine H1N1, and a triple reassortant from 1998 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The rise of new strains through antigenic drift and shift is followed by cross-immunity mediated competition between antigenically similar strains, which results in a progressive replacement of existing strains with new variants [
