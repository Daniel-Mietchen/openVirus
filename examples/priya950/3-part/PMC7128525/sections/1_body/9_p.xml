<p id="para100">Both the supporters of the Global Virome Project and its skeptics need to be heard. An objective, apolitical assessment would be helpful in deciding whether spending up to $3Â·4 billion over the next decade is likely to produce scientific knowledge whose benefits are greater than the costs. If the conclusion of such an assessment is that filling in some of the missing knowledge about viruses has significant merit, then the second step would be to set out how, where, and when to take it forward, and how to arrange adequate and sustained financing. Side discussions at venues such as the G20 or the UN General Assembly, could be opportunities for policy makers to set out implementation arrangements. They will need to draw on the advice of knowledgeable experts, including animal and human health researchers from low-income and middle-income countries, biomedical industry interests, economists, financial analysts, and big data expertise. How about it?</p>
