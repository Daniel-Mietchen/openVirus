<p id="para20">Others look to many past and present spillovers of pathogens from animals to humans and see a pattern. In some cases, inadequate preparedness and vigilance have led to humans being sentinels for animal diseases. In other cases, the pathogens might not cause disease symptoms in animals but an absence of basic data on the reservoir results in delayed diagnosis and preventable morbidity and mortality in humans. Spillovers where scarcity of data caused deadly and costly delays in diagnosis and response to human illness include novel strains of influenza, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Dengue virus, AIDS, and tuberculosis between pastoralists and their livestock in Ethiopia.

 </xref> The spillover of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from camels in Saudi Arabia in 2013 was exported halfway across the world, causing an outbreak in humans and a severe, though thankfully temporary, shock to the economy of South Korea in 2015. Severe acute respiratory syndrome from civets in China spread to infect people in over 30 countries in 2003. Other infectious zoonotic pathogens, such as malaria, rabies, Zika, or Lyme disease, transmit in human populations, although not directly through human-to-human contact.
