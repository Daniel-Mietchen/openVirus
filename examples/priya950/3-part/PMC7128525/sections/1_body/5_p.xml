<p id="para60">First, even a single regional disease outbreak, especially one that crosses borders, can result in considerable human illness and death and cost tens of billions in productivity, trade, economic growth, and social welfare. For example, the economic, health, and social costs of the 2014–15 Ebola outbreak in west Africa are estimated to be over $53 billion.

 </xref> The economic cost of pandemics of novel influenza (or other readily transmissible viral diseases) has been conservatively estimated as $80 billion annually when averaged over a century.

 </xref> Investments to reduce these risks yield high economic benefits. An expenditure of $400 million a year on the Global Virome Project—which is at the higher end of the Global Virome Project cost range—would be equivalent to just 0·5% of the ongoing annual economic risk of $80 billion from pandemic influenza (and other readily transmissible viral diseases) and thus be justified as a prudential measure. The Global Virome Project would complement ongoing efforts, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the International Vaccines Task Force, and the surveillance and preparedness capacity-building projects in the REDISSE programme financed by the World Bank.
