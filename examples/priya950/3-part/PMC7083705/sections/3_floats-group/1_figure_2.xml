  <p>Schematic of disease state transitions and demographic turnover. Seasonal trends in births and carcass persistence are shown in bar plots. Seasonal trends in the intensity of sampling by hunting and carcass sampling are shown in the line plots. There were three mechanisms of mortality: disease‐induced (
   <italic>I</italic>
   <sub>2</sub>), natural death, or through hunting. There are two potential routes of transmission: direct (d) or carcass‐based (c), which occur via a spatial contact function, 
   <italic>F</italic>(C), and a transmission probability given contact, 
   <italic>β</italic> (
   <italic>β
    <sub>d</sub>
   </italic> for direct and 
   <italic>β
    <sub>c</sub>
   </italic> for carcass‐based). Persistence of carcasses on the landscape varied seasonally (to reflect weather‐based differences in degradation rates) but were the same regardless of the mechanism of death, such that carcasses by all mortality mechanisms had equal probability of being sampled. Seasonal trends in conception probability, carcass persistence, and sampling modes were all multiplied by scaling parameters (
   <italic>θ</italic>, 
   <italic>π</italic>, 
   <italic>ρ
    <sub>h</sub>
   </italic>, 
   <italic>ρ
    <sub>c</sub>
   </italic>) which were estimated. We also allowed for exposed individuals to be introduced along the eastern border at frequency
