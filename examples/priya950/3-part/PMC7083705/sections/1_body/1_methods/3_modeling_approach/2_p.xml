<p>To account for wild boar population dynamics and their impact on ASFV ecology, we developed a spatially explicit, individual‐based model that accounts for variation among individuals in spatial behavior and social interactions (Gabor, Hellgren, Van Den Bussche, &amp; Silvy,

 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We estimated unknown parameters by fitting our model to ASFV surveillance data from Poland using methods of ABC (described below). We estimated rates of new viral introduction and probabilities of direct and carcass‐based transmission that best explained the data. Rates of viral introduction from Belarus ranged from a single event to 60 introductions per year (i.e., continuous spillover at the border). Likewise for both direct and carcass‐based transmission mechanisms, we considered prior distributions that ranged from 0% transmission probability to 100% transmission probability to neighbors daily. Without prior knowledge on transmission dynamics in this specific system, this design allowed us to estimate the relative contribution of these three persistence mechanisms in explaining the observed surveillance data. Due to extreme computational requirements, sensitivity analyses were completed on a subset of data to broadly evaluate how mechanisms of viral maintenance vary over a range of host population densities. The general schematic for our modeling approach is outlined in Figure
