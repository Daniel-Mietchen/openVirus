<p>We fit the model to 4 different landscapes separately: “patchy” including high (2 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>) and low (0.5 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>) density patches guided by the location of cases in the real data (average density ~1 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>); and “homogenous” landscapes with densities of 1, 1.5, and 2 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>. This design evaluated whether observed outbreak patterns could have arisen from the underlying distribution of boar density being higher in patches where the disease was observed relative to other patches, as opposed to alternative mechanisms such as the surveillance patterns.
