<p>Approximate Bayesian computation selects parameter sets for the posterior distribution using distance metrics (difference between model predictions and the observed data), a measure of how well a model parameter set approximates target patterns in the observed data. We used three distance metrics concurrently; the sum for each of: (a) monthly cases from carcasses, (b) monthly cases from hunter‐harvest sampling, and (c) monthly maximum distance from the border. Distance metric tolerance values were 48 for monthly cases from carcasses, 24 for monthly cases from hunter‐harvest samples, and 120 for maximum distance from the border. Parameter sets with outcomes lower than these values for all 3 metrics comprised the posterior distribution. This allowed average error rates of 2 (carcass) and 1 (hunter harvest) cases, and 5 km from the border per month on average. We chose tolerance values based on what we believed to be an acceptable level of error for planning control strategies and risk assessment. Also, more stringent error rates would require restrictively large computational resources unless prior distributions are more informed.</p>
