<p>To determine the “best” landscape model, we ranked models from the different landscapes based on their distance metrics (where minimum values are best) and the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values (squared correlation coefficient of the observed and predicted data) for the observed versus the predicted monthly cases and monthly distance from the border (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To calculate the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values, for each landscape we conducted 1,000 simulations using random draws from the posterior distributions of parameters and calculated the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> value for each simulation. We then took the mean of the 1,000 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values for each metric (monthly cases and distance) to represent the overall 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values for the metrics of a particular model. As another measure of predictive ability, we tested the ability of our models to forecast ASF dynamics by using the parameters estimated from fits to the 2014–2015 data to predict the first 7 months of 2016 (January–July.). We then compared the

 <sup>2</sup> values for the in‐sample predictions relative to the full set of predictions (Table
