<p>Each parameter had a uniform prior distribution as follows: frequency of introduction 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> ~Unif(0,60),

 <italic>β
  <sub>wd</sub>
 </italic> ~Unif(0.01,1), and 
 <italic>β
  <sub>wc</sub>
 </italic> ~Unif(0.001,1). Prior distribution ranges were informed by movement and contact data (Kay et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Podgórski et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As part of the parameter generation process we implemented the following constraints for each parameter set: 
 <italic>β
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>&gt; 
 <italic>β
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>β
  <sub>wd</sub>
 </italic>&gt; 
 <italic>β
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>β
  <sub>wc</sub>
 </italic> &gt;
 <italic> β
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic>; to further inform prior distributions with biologically realistic knowledge. To sample across parameter space efficiently, we used a Latin hypercube algorithm to generate 979,592 parameter sets and then ran the model twice on each parameter set (for a total of 1,959,184 iterations; or 2 chains of 979,592). 
 <italic>β
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>, 
 <italic>β
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic>, and 
 <italic>ρ
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> were sampled on a log
 <sub>e</sub> scale. Because the epidemiological model was time‐intensive we used a two‐tiered approach to evaluating parameter sets. First, simulations were terminated early if the trajectory was unrealistic—specific criteria were as follows: (a) the landscape‐wide host density dropped below 20% of the initial density, (b) more than 150 new cases occurred per day, (c) there were no new cases sampled by either type of surveillance method in the past 6 months, or (d) the total number of cases sampled by both methods of surveillance totaled more than 300 (more than double the actual number). We then only considered parameter sets for which the simulation reached the end of the two‐year time frame. For this reduced set, the posterior distributions consisted of all unique parameter sets (considering both chains) that were within the absolute distance of three metrics: the sum of absolute differences between observed and simulated data for monthly positive samples from live and dead animals (considered separately), and the maximum monthly distance of cases from the border.
