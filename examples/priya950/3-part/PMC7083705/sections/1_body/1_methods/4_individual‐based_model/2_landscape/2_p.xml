<p>The landscape was comprised of 5 × 5 km (25 km
 <sup>2</sup>) grid cells arranged similarly to the outbreak area (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Grid cells each had a carrying capacity of 0.5–2 boars/km
 <sup>2</sup>, which controlled heterogeneity in population density across the landscape through density‐dependent reproduction. The total landscape size was 120 × 50 km (6,000 km
