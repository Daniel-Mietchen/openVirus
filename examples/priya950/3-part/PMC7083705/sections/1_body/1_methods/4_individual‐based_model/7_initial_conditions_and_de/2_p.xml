<p>Populations were initialized as follows. A matrix with the number of rows equivalent to the desired population size was created. Each individual (row) was assigned attributes at random (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For males whose age was beyond dispersal age, dispersal status was recorded as completed. All females and males less than dispersal age were divided into group sizes that were ¼ of the maximum sounder size (plus one smaller group of remaining individuals if applicable). Each individual or group was assigned to a grid cell ID chosen at random (the algorithm ensured that unoccupied grid cells were selected first). Within each grid cell, the individual or group was given [
 <italic>x</italic>,
 <italic>y</italic>] coordinates selected at random. After the population was initialized, population dynamics were allowed to occur for 10 years. The population at the end of the 10 years was used as the starting point for all simulation conditions with disease transmission.
