<p>Social structure of wild boar is based on cohesive, matrilineal groups, composed of a few subadult and adult females and their offspring (Gabor et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Kaminski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Podgórski, Lusseau, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Podgórski, Scandura, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Studies demonstrate that the frequency of direct contacts is much higher among individuals within than between groups (Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Podgórski, Lusseau, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Further, social groups may temporarily break, reform, or exchange individuals (Gabor et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Poteaux et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), but group members usually form stable and long‐lasting relationships (Podgórski, Lusseau, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Thus, social and spatial movement behavior can constrain wild boar contact and modulate the spread of infectious diseases (Loehle, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). We accounted for the effects of social structure as described in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>. Females and immatures occurred in family groups. Members of the same family group had the same home range centroid. Adult males were independent (not part of a group, each having a unique home range centroid). Social structure was dynamic—family groups that became too large (according to a maximum group size parameter; Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), split in half and one group dispersed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Likewise, because adult females are rarely found alone (Kaminski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Podgórski, Lusseau, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), independent females were joined to the nearest family group that was below capacity (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Maximum group size). Dispersal caused permanent relocation of the home range centroid (
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> coordinates). Dispersal distances were chosen at random from a Weibull distribution (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). In addition to dispersal due to social structuring, natal dispersal also occurred, but only once at a randomly selected age (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) assigned at birth. Males dispersed independently and females dispersed with their sisters. Although the dispersal of young wild boar leaving their maternal groups is the main source of long‐distance movement, the majority of individuals disperse in relatively short distances (1–3 km diameter) from an average home range (&lt;5 km
 <sup>2</sup>) and longer dispersals (5–30 km) are less common (Kay et al.,
