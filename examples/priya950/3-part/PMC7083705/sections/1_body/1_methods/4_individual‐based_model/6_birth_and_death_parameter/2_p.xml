<p>Boar conception occurred randomly in reproductively active females based on a seasonally varying conception probability (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Pregnant females gave birth to 6 offspring (3 male, 3 female) after a gestation period of 115 days (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Following birth, there was a fixed lag of 3 months before the possibility of conceiving again (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, the maximum number of litters per year was 2. Net population growth rate was controlled by multiplying the seasonal trends in conception probability by a scaling parameter (
 <italic>Ɵ</italic>). The full range of the prior distribution of 
 <italic>Ɵ</italic> allowed net population growth rates to range between 1.3 and 2.3 for population densities at 10% of the carrying capacity, consistent. Conception probability was density dependent such that conception did not occur in individuals in grid cells that were already at carrying capacity. The population‐level host demographic dynamics were similar to a logistic model (Pepin, Davis, Cunningham, VerCauteren, &amp; Eckery,
