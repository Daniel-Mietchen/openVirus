<p>Individual‐level attributes were monitored and updated at a daily time step. Attributes included disease status, age, sex, unique group identification, dispersal age and distance, status of life, reproduction, age at natural death, 
 <italic>x</italic> coordinate, 
 <italic>y</italic> coordinate, and grid cell ID. The following disease states were included in the model to track ASFV transmission: susceptible, exposed, infectious (alive), and infectious (dead carcass) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Sex, dispersal distance, and age at natural death were fixed throughout life but the other attributes changed based on time, age, group size, and grid cell density. Space was continuous at the individual‐level (individual home range centroids were continuous variables assigned to individuals that were located in discrete grid cells). Life status was monitored as alive (i.e., contributing to host population dynamics) or dead (i.e., a carcass on the landscape that can transmit disease but does not move or reproduce). Reproductive status described age‐based conception ability, gestation status, and time since last birth for females. Individual attributes were updated based on the following processes: natural mortality, disease transmission, dispersal and social dynamics, surveillance sampling (permanent removal of individuals from the landscape), and reproduction.
