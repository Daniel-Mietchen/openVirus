<p>Sensitivity analyses were conducted on homogenous landscapes varying in density from 1–4 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>, reflecting the observed densities of wild boar in Eastern Europe (Melis, Szafrańska, Jędrzejewska, &amp; Bartoń, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). We completed a full factorial sensitivity analysis to assess how ASF persistence and transmission dynamics respond to changes in

 <italic>ϕ</italic> was varied from 1 introduction to 50 introductions per year. All other parameters were fixed with a parameter set from the posterior distribution of the patchy landscape model. Sensitivity analyses were completed using 3 different 50 km × 50 km landscapes that varied in host density (1–4 boars/km
 <sup>2</sup>). The index case occurred in grid cell 50 (middle of the most right side column of grid cells) on day 30 (same day of introduction in the ABC analyses). All runs were conducted for 2 years. We ran 100 replicate simulations for each set of conditions. We recorded all cases (true behavior), but included host mortality due to hunting and removal of dead carcasses due to surveillance sampling. We recorded the following output: (a) persistence probability (proportion of 100 simulations where at least one case occurs in the last week of the two‐year period after only a single introduction at the start), and (b) the proportion of transmission events that were from direct and carcass‐based transmission. The latter output was obtained by recording the proportion of transmission events that were direct transmission for each day and taking the median value over time, considering only days where at least one transmission event occurred. We modeled the outputs using generalized linear models using appropriate distributions and/or data transformations for each of the 4 response variables and including the transmission probability parameters and introduction frequency as covariates, and all interactions. The purpose of these models was simply to interpolate the relationships at a higher resolution within the range of values used in the simulations. For modeling persistence probability, we also included up to 4th order interactions because the relationships were highly nonlinear and thus these were important for accurately interpolating the relationships.
