<p>Our implementation of wild boar spatial processes is a simplification of reality. We assumed that individuals could potentially contact other individuals in all directions each day, with a contact probability that decayed with distance. However, in reality, wild boar movements are biased toward habitat features and related individuals (Kay et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Podgórski, Lusseau, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Although these movements would lead to temporal variation in the distance‐transmission probability relationship as we assumed, it may be that the particular locations of the movements (e.g., biased toward particular resources or conspecifics) are important to capture, rather than just the overall distance‐variation structure. Indeed, recent work has shown that accounting for elk movement mechanistically can provide predictions of spatio‐temporal prevalence of brucellosis disease in response to changing seasonality and climate (Merkle et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Mechanistic movement models based on landscape heterogeneity have also been used to predict areas of highest contact rates (Tardy, Massé, Pelletier, &amp; Fortin, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), another metric of disease transmission risk. Adaptive prediction of where and when disease transmission risk may be highest is important for enabling managers to prioritize mitigation strategies in space and time in a cost‐effective manner. Additionally, although theory predicts that implementing reactive control based on knowledge of social structure can help determine the effectiveness of control (e.g., Azman and Lessler (
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)), we rarely know individual‐level relationship status a priori. Understanding the link between mechanistic movement, landscape heterogeneity, and disease transmission could help provide more practical (landscape‐based) guidance for prioritizing surveillance and interventions.
