<p>Our model tended to predict a relatively high incidence immediately after introduction of the index case, as would be expected by a new disease introduced into a completely susceptible population. However, hunting was limited initially in the 1st 3–4 months which accounts for the low number of observed cases during this time. Once the hunting ban was lifted, the number of observed cases increased, although the underlying dynamics were more consistent (data not shown). We accounted for temporal trends in hunting using data on overall sample sizes, but we did not have precise locations for negative surveillance data. Locations of all samples are important for data fitting because, as we saw with the temporal sampling data, the surveillance system limits our observation of the underlying process. If in reality surveillance sampling locations shifted in spatial clusters that were nearer versus farther from the border, rather than all samples being spread out randomly, it is possible that cases that were further from the border may have been detected that is, representing the surveillance process as spatially random could have diluted detection of cases that occurred further away. Indeed, the true rates of spatial spread were faster than the predicted observed rates in our model (e.g., 16.8 vs. 20.2 km from the border respectively for year 1, and 26.8 vs. 31.5 km respectively for year 2), suggesting that accounting for spatial locations of all surveillance samples could help to improve inference of the spatial spreading process, and potentially our understanding of the role of transmission mechanisms. Our analyses highlight the importance of fully recording metadata for negative samples and appropriately accounting for the full sampling design in the observation process.</p>
