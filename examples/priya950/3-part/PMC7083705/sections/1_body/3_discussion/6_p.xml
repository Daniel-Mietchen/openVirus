<p>A recent study found that for wild boar, a social species that aggregates in family groups (Podgórski, Lusseau, et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), spatially targeted culling that focuses on removing all members of family groups is more effective than random removal of individuals (Pepin &amp; VerCauteren, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Although this simulation model did not account for movement responses due to culling, it did include effects of social structuring in disease transmission. Because intensive hunting can induce escape movements and intergroup mixing (e.g., Scillitani, Monaco, &amp; Toso,
