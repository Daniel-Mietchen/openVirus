<p>We assumed that ASF was 100% lethal in wild boar, which is an oversimplification of the system. Indeed, surveillance data in the region suggest there are survivors with &lt;1% of individuals testing positive for antibodies against ASFV in the outbreak region (unpublished data of the National Veterinary Research Institute). Because we assumed absolute lethality, our models predicted that ongoing transmission of ASFV led to decreased host densities and higher levels of carcass‐based transmission over time. However, if a strain of ASFV with reduced lethality were to emerge in this area we might expect different epidemiological dynamics. Specifically, if more hosts remained alive, they would be available to reproduce, maintaining higher host densities and a more consistent influx of naïve hosts which could lead to persistence or recurrent epidemics by direct transmission alone (Stone, Olinky, &amp; Hupert, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Thus, surveillance for changes in lethality is important for optimizing control strategies in local areas over time.
