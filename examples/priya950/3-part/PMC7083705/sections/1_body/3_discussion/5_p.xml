<p>Several studies have observed reductions in prevalence of target pathogens from within populations that diseased hosts are removed from (e.g., Boadella, Vicente, Ruiz‐Fons, Fuente, &amp; Gortázar, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Donnelly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Manjerovic, Green, Mateus‐Pinilla, &amp; Novakofski, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Mateus‐Pinilla, Weng, Ruiz, Shelton, &amp; Novakofski, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, as others have emphasized, there can be unexpected consequences of culling programs—for example, adaptation of the virus to low‐density conditions (Bolzoni &amp; De Leo, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), or increases in long‐range host movements that lead to increased spread of disease (Bielby, Donnelly, Pope, Burke, &amp; Woodroffe, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Our sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that decreasing host density could have unexpected consequences. We found that while high host densities allowed autonomous persistence by direct transmission, carcass‐based transmission could allow persistence as host density decreases by effectively extending the opportunity for hosts to contact contaminated carcasses. Thus, a thorough understanding of the host‐pathogen transmission ecology in response to management is important before planning abundance reduction programs (Harrison, Newey, Gilbert, Haydon, &amp; Thirgood, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). To control ASFV, density reduction programs will likely be most successful if they include intensive surveillance and the removal of dead carcasses, especially as populations reach low densities.
