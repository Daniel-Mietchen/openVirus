<p>The persistence of ASFV in wild boar in Eastern Europe remains a significant threat to domestic pig populations globally, and hence international trade and food security. By fitting a mechanistic disease‐dynamic model to spatio‐temporal disease surveillance data using prior knowledge of wild boar population dynamics, we inferred that 53%–66% of ASFV transmission events occurred through the contact of susceptible hosts with dead carcasses. Because wild boar tend not to contact carcasses immediately, but will continue to contact carcasses even during the later stages of decay (Probst et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), increased surveillance and elimination of carcasses could dramatically decrease transmission (Morelle, Jezek, Licoppe, &amp; Podgorski, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Thus, developing cost‐effective methods for carcass detection and retrieval may be critical to reduce transmission rates in wild boar populations (Guinat et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Additionally, as we found that the relative importance of transmission mechanisms depended critically on host density, our results emphasize the importance of considering wild boar population dynamics in control (EFSA et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
