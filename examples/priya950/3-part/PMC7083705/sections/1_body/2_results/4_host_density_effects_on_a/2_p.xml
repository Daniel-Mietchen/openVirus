<p>Sensitivity analyses showed that densities higher than 1 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup> were important for autonomous persistence (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, d and g). Without carcass‐based transmission, persistence required re‐introduction 10 or more times per year at lower host densities (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and e). However, with only carcass‐based transmission, persistence occurred across some narrow range of carcass‐based transmission probabilities even at low host densities (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c and f) with few to no re‐introductions. In contrast, high host density (4 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>) allowed for autonomous persistence when carcass‐based transmission was absent (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g–i) over some narrow range of transmission probabilities for either transmission mechanism on its own.
