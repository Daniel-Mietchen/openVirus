<p>Rejection rates for the proposed parameter sets were high for all four models, such that posterior distributions ranged between 6–53 values (0.00031%–0.0027% model acceptance rate) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and uncertainty in parameter estimates were large (See Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Due to the high amount of stochasticity in model processes and uncertainty in parameter estimates, the model fit the data
