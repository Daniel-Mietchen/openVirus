<p>Despite high uncertainty in several estimated parameters, the models captured the general trends in the surveillance data well (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). All models captured monthly cases better than monthly maximum distance from the border (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Relative to the observed data, the model predicted higher incidence during months 14–16 (February–April of the second year which included a birth pulse) and lower incidence than the observed data in months 5–7 (May–July of the first year, which included a period of abnormally low surveillance) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). The average prevalence observed through surveillance in the model tracked the magnitude of true sample prevalence for both hunter‐harvest and carcass surveillance samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Models fit on homogenous landscapes of host density did not capture spatial spreading rates as well as the patchy landscapes that included high‐density patches (2 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>; average 1 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>; Table
