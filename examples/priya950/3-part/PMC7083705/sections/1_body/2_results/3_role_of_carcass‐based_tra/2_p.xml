<p>The models predicted a substantial amount of carcass‐based transmission (monthly average between 53% and 66% during 2014–2015 depending on the landscape; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and a much higher prevalence of ASF in sampled carcasses versus hunter‐harvested samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>a). The best model (patchy landscape) also predicted a slow decline of the wild boar population over time (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>b), which corresponded to proportionately more transmission events originating from carcass‐based transmission over time (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), especially in the patchy and low‐density homogenous landscapes.
