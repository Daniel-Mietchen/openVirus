<p>Carcass‐based transmission is a special case of environmental transmission but where the contamination is from biological material. Carcass‐based transmission is hypothesized as a potential mechanism allowing low‐level persistence because carcasses can remain infectious for long periods of time relative to live infectious hosts. A second hypothesis to explain persistence of ASFV in wild boar populations is that continual introduction from neighboring countries plays a role in persistence. To evaluate these hypotheses, we developed and fit a spatially explicit mechanistic epidemiological model to spatio‐temporal disease surveillance data (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We estimated the levels of direct transmission, carcass‐based transmission, and continued introduction that best explained spatial spreading patterns of ASFV. As a separate objective, we used sensitivity analysis on the transmission mechanism parameters to understand the relationship between host density and the importance of carcass‐based transmission. We hypothesized that because wild boar tend not to move very far, carcass‐based transmission likely accounts for a substantial amount of overall transmission. Along the same lines, we predicted that the potential role of carcass‐based transmission would increase with decreasing host density because at low host densities direct contact would be more limited due to the short‐range movement tendencies of wild boar and short infectious period of the virus.
