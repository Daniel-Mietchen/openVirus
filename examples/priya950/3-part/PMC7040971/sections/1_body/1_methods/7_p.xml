<p>Within the EBS framework, when a clinician or nurse detected a signal, they were instructed to notify the healthcare facility EBS focal point, who would immediately call CPC to report it (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12684-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When CPC received the telephone call, they conducted the process of triage while on the phone, confirming that one or more of the four signals were met and that the current signal did not represent a duplicate of a previously reported signal (ie, that it was a true signal). For all true signals, the CPC and LNSP worked cooperatively to conduct the process of verification. This entailed traveling to the healthcare facility to interview the clinician and patient to determine if the situation represented a threat to public health.
