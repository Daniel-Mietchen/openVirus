<p>During each verification, CPC/LNSP completed a verification form to collect basic information such as the number of human cases, types of symptoms, severity of illness, and exposure history. Laboratory testing is not an essential component of EBS verification; however, the pilot had the capacity to include it. While at the healthcare facility, CPC/LNSP would collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. Specimens were taken from all people involved in the signal. Following verification, if CPC/LNSP determined the situation as a public health threat, the signal was categorized as an event.</p>
