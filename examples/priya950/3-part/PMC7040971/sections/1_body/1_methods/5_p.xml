<p>After defining the signals and selecting pilot health facilities, two training courses to operationalize and launch the EBS program were conducted. The first course was a 2‐day national‐level training of trainers hosted by DLMEP with technical support from CDC, and held in Yaoundé, Cameroon in February 2017. Participants were leadership and operational staff from DLMEP, CPC, and LNSP. This course taught fundamental EBS concepts—how to conduct triage and verification when signals are reported—as well as how to teach signal detection and reporting to the health facility staff at the subsequent training.</p>
