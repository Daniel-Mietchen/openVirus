<p>In this EBS system focused on healthcare facilities, availability of signal definitions can guide healthcare workers to detect potential health events. Therefore, as a first step of implementing respiratory‐focused EBS, the DLMEP defined four signals that could indicate a potential public health event (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12684-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The signals were focused on (a) healthcare worker illness, (b) illness clusters, (c) zoonotic transmission, and (d) unusual respiratory cases. The DLMEP selected health facilities within Yaoundé to participate in the program, including private, public, military, and religious institutions.
