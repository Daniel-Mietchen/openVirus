<p>In March 2017, the second 1‐day course was held in Mfou, Cameroon, outside of the capital city. The participants included health facility focal points and clinicians and were taught by DLMEP, CPC, and LNSP representatives who had participated in the national‐level training of trainers. The second course was focused on signal detection and reporting, and everyone received posters describing the four signals. Participants were instructed to hang the posters at their health facilities and sensitize colleagues in signal detection. The EBS program was launched in May 2017 when health facility focal points received mobile telephones.</p>
