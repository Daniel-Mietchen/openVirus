<p>From May 2017 to January 2018, 30 signals were detected and reported (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12684-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). All healthcare facilities reported at least one signal, and more than three‐quarters of the facilities reported two or more signals. Signal four, “any unusual cases of severe acute‐onset respiratory illness” was reported 25 times (83.3% of all signals), and it was routinely reported throughout the 9‐month pilot. The signal corresponding to a cluster of patients with respiratory disease was reported three times (10%), and the signal corresponding to healthcare worker illness was reported twice (6.7%). During the triage process, nine of the 30 signals (30%) were determined to be false and 21 (70%) were considered true signals that warranted collection of additional information. The signals that were determined to be false were so categorized because they did not match signal criteria; no duplicate signals were reported.
