<p>At the time, Cameroon had two surveillance systems that may have detected severe respiratory disease in humans in the circumstance that avian‐to‐human transmission occurred. The MOH's Division for the Fight against Disease, Epidemics and Pandemics (Direction de la Lutte Contre la Maladie, les Epidémies et les Pandémies [DLMEP]) coordinates a national surveillance platform for integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR), where cases of priority diseases are counted weekly and registered at the national level.
 <xref rid="irv12684-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Each health facility is expected to routinely report aggregate IDSR data and immediately notify DLMEP if a suspected outbreak occurs. The other surveillance system was an indicator‐based sentinel surveillance for influenza, coordinated by the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun (CPC), Cameroon's national influenza center, where 16 hospitals (five of which were in Yaoundé) utilize the World Health Organization (WHO) standard case definitions for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and/or influenza‐like illness (ILI) to detect possible influenza cases.
