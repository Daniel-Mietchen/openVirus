<p>The H5N1 outbreak that occurred among poultry in 2016 resulted in rapid notification from animal to human health sectors, demonstrating strong one health multi‐sectoral collaboration for avian influenza, one of the country's prioritized zoonotic diseases.
 <xref rid="irv12684-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Yet, there was concern that rapid reporting from healthcare facility to public health officials of potential respiratory outbreaks in humans was not routinely occurring. Prior to EBS, large Yaoundé health facilities seldom communicated unusual cases to the public health authorities, with poor adherence to IDSR reporting requirements. Cameroon's MOH implemented EBS in Yaoundé to enable rapid detection and notification of emerging respiratory events, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report that focuses on EBS implementation with healthcare facilities providing the primary source of data. Improving capacity for detection of public health events is an important component of the International Health Regulations, a 2005 global agreement to improve health security.
