<p>Based on the experience gained from this pilot, DLMEP is scaling up EBS in health facilities in multiple regions throughout the country and plans to formally integrate EBS reporting into Cameroon's IDSR platform. Event‐based surveillance is an essential capacity for a country to rapidly identify and appropriately respond to public health events. Event‐based surveillance systems can be tailored to the specific needs of a country: designed broadly to detect all hazards, or with a particular focus, such as respiratory diseases in this pilot surveillance program.</p>
