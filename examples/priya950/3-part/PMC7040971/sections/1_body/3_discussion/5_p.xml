<p>There may be a number of reasons as to why an event‐based surveillance approach may be more effective than indicator‐based surveillance systems for rapidly detecting emerging events and/or outbreaks in resource‐limited health facility settings. First, EBS does not require clinicians to follow a specific case definition, but rather encourages medical professionals to draw upon their clinical training and experience to recognize that something is unusual or unexpected. The signals in EBS are designed for clinicians to recognize patterns and unusual trends, in contrast to traditional surveillance case definitions, which are based on disease‐specific identification (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12684-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Second, by utilizing a short list of signals and not requiring any documentation at the health facility, it was easy for clinical staff to engage with the EBS system. The health facility was simply required to call the public health authorities when they detected one or more of the signals. Lastly, health facility EBS systems do not require laboratory confirmation as a condition of reporting. While this pilot integrated a mechanism for laboratory testing during the verification process, outside of the capital, Cameroon does not have reliable laboratory capacity, and surveillance systems that rely on laboratory confirmation could potentially delay reporting from healthcare facilities. By incorporating laboratory testing, however, as a component of verification, clinicians in this pilot gained a non‐financial incentive to participate in EBS, that is, access to laboratory testing for their patients that might not have otherwise been available.
