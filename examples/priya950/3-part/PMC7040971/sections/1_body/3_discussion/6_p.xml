<p>The events detected in this pilot were caused by routine respiratory bacteria and viruses, and no novel influenza viruses or other emerging respiratory threats were identified. DLMEP did not consider any of the events to warrant additional public health action. Despite this, however, an important outcome of the pilot was that EBS helped promote behavior change among clinicians and health facility staff toward detection and reporting of potential outbreaks. An example of this was at health facility E, where a suspected hospital‐acquired infection was recognized and reported as a potential public health threat within 24 hours of detection. The EBS system enabled the clinician to recognize that a potential hospital‐acquired infection could be a risk to public health and that notification was warranted and provided a mechanism to report to public health officials. While the doctor was ultimately diagnosed with rhinovirus, and the situation was deemed low risk, the clinician's heightened public health awareness helped to strengthen communication and reporting practices.</p>
