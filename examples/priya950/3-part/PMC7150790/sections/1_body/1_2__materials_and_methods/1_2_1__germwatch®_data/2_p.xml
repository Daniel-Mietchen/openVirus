<p>The principal laboratory methods of virus identification were direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), viral culture, and rapid antigen testing between 2000 and 2007. After 2007, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology became the primary method of identification, but DFA and rapid antigen testing was still available. Due to the aggregated nature of our dataset, it is not possible to differentiate between which tests were used for each data point. However, the more sensitive method (i.e., PCR &gt; DFA &gt; rapid antigen testing) was used in the analysis if different methods were ordered and to exclude duplicate test results.</p>
