<p>We obtained weekly frequency data for six seasonal respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, RSV, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus), from Intermountain Healthcare’s GermWatch
 <sup>®</sup> database, for the 2005–2006 winter season to the 2017–2018 winter season. We did not have data for summer 2018, nor did we have access to data at the individual level. Intermountain Healthcare is the largest health-care provider in the Intermountain West region of the United States and operates a nonprofit system of 22 hospitals and more than 190 clinics. The study was considered exempt by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham Young University.
