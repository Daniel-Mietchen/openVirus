<p>In order to validate our method, we compared our estimates of peak and epidemic duration of RSV with those reported by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00275" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Denver was the closest NREVSS surveillance site and is generally used to describe trends in the Western Region of the United States. NREVSS indicates onset, peak, and offset dates for RSV trends. Of the 9 seasonal years that NREVSS indicated peak dates, 7 of them fell within our peak durations (T2 and T3).
