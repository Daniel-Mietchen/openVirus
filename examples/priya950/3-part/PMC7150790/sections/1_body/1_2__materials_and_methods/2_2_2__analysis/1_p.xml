<p>We conducted two separate analyses to compare epidemic timing between viruses over the study period. The first was a descriptive analysis in which epidemic initiation, peak, and termination were identified based on a change point model. Second, we conducted a wavelet analysis to compare epidemic synchrony across seasons. All analyses were conducted in R (v. 3.5.1) [
