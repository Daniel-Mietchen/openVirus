<p>The complex ecological interactions between viruses are difficult to discern using typical measures of correlation, since relationships between epidemics may shift over time, depending on strain severity, host immunity, and climate factors. In this study, we compared epidemic timing and calculated phase differences between seasonal epidemics of RSV, influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus, using descriptive and wavelet analyses. Wavelet analysis allows for viewing changes in epidemic synchronistic patterns over multiple years [
