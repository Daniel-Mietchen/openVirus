  <p>Wavelet analysis of positive viral samples from 2004 to 2018: (
   <bold>a</bold>) Raw frequency data. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Normalized frequencies. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Reconstructed component from wavelet analysis, using periods 32–65 for Rhinovirus, Metapneumovirus, RSV, and Enterovirus, and 32–108 for influenza A and B. A loess smoother was applied to rhinovirus, to correct for an increase in testing during 2007–2008. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Phase angles using the aforementioned periods. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Phase differences between each virus and RSV. Lines at zero indicate phase synchrony. Lines deviating from zero indicate the epidemics are not in phase.
