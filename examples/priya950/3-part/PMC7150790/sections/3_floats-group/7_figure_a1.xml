  <p>Five virus change point plots: mean count of monthly timing of positive viral samples for influenza A (INFLA), influenza B (INFLB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and rhinovirus (RHINO) from mid-2004 (
   <bold>a</bold>) to late-2017 (
   <bold>m</bold>), in the Intermountain Health Care system. Note that November 2006 was the first month data were available for HMPV, and November 2007 was the first month data were available for RHINO, so respective viral data are provided starting after given dates. Enterovirus (EV) is plotted separately due to significant difference in mean counts and seasonal peak patterns (see
