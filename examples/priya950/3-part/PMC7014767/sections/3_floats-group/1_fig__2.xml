   <italic>E. coli</italic> (denoted by 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> with the dilution ratio behind), ESBL (denoted by ESBL with the dilution ratio behind) and MRSA (denoted by MRSA with the dilution ratio behind) were subjected to VUV light disinfection. The log10 (CFU/mL reduction) were plotted against the time of disinfection. Data were plotted as the means of triplicate biological replicates Â±error
