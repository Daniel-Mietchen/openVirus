<p id="Par67">Airborne pathogens are important indoor air quality concerns. A good and reliable disinfection system is a must to maintain good indoor air quality. Vacuum-UV lamps with ozone production were found to be effective for inactivating various human pathogens. With the best tested situation, 3-log10 inactivation of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and seasonal influenza viruses can be achieved with ≤10 min of VUV treatment except 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> which needed about 20 min. This demonstrated the high resistance against UV disinfection of MTB. Valid germicidal results, reflected with 3-log10 inactivation for bacteria, 4-log10 inactivation for viruses and 5-log10 inactivation for MTB, can be obtained with all tested pathogens. The duration of VUV treatment required for valid germicidal result of most of the bacteria was ≤10 min while MTB needed about 30 min. 20 min was adequate for the influenza viruses. This indicated that VUV light is an effective approach against different environmental and pathogenic microorganisms, and can potentially be used for air-purifying units in future ventilation systems.
