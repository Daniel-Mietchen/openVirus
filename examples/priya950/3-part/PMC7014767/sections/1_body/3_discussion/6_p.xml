<p id="Par62">At 20 min disinfection, VUV light disinfection could only result in a 3-log10 reduction in viable plate count. This is insufficient according to our 5-log10 reduction criterion for mycobacterial disinfection. It was only after 30 min of disinfection that the required 5-log10 reduction of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> viable bacterial load could be achieved regardless of the bacterial concentration. This is concordant to previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] where mycobacterial species were generally more resistant to UV disinfection. This is probably accounted by the thicker lipid cell wall in 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species.
