<p id="Par58">In addition, the high-energy VUV could also lead to the formation of both OH radicals and O
 <sub>3</sub>, which diffuse into anywhere that is shielded from direct UV irradiation and inhibit the growth of microorganism. This explained the excellent bactericidal efficiency of VUV light disinfection even in the presence of the opaque nitrocellulose filter. Our result has further revealed the potential of VUV light to provide a thorough disinfection, even for dust particles and large aerosols contaminated with pathogens where direct UV illumination cannot penetrate.
