<p id="Par64">From literature, various research teams reported the UV dosages required attaining 99.9% (3-log) inactivation of various bacteria or viruses under light from low pressure mercury vapour lamps. For example, the UV dosages in mJ/cm

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and 158 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], respectively. Most of their experiments were conducted with bacteria and viruses virtually unprotected. In our experiment, attaining 3-log inactivation typically required 10 min. Considering that our equipment provided 21 and 2.3 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup> light power at 254 nm and 185 nm, and the total UV power is ~ 23 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The UV dosage of 10 min illumination is ~ 14,000 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, far higher than the usual values. This could be the consequence of our testing condition created by loading the suspended bacteria or viruses onto nitrocellulose filter paper. Some bacteria were actually protected from direct UV light by the shading effect of filter paper which is different from the testing setup in the literature.
