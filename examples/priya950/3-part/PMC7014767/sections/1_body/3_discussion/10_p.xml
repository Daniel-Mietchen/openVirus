<p id="Par66">Although, the disinfection under the environment with a moderate barrier to light was successful, there are limitations in the present study. The current pilot study on the disinfection efficacy of VUV light disinfection was conducted in laboratory-controlled conditions. For example, due to safety consideration, device type testing on aerosolized bacteria and viruses is not possible. All bacterial and viral inoculums were prepared in liquid suspension and illuminated by VUV on a Petri dish, which differed from actual environmental settings.</p>
