<p id="Par59">In this study, we demonstrated that VUV light disinfection is effective against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. For the best tested situation, with the criterion of 3-log10 inactivation of bacteria, valid germicidal result can be achieved with ≤10 min of VUV treatment. Additionally, more than 5-log10 reduction in viable plate count can be attained below 15 min of disinfection.
