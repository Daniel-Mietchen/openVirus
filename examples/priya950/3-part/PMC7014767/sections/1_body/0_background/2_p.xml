<p id="Par26">One major source of indoor air pollution is the presence of micro-organisms, which could cause even more serious problems than some organic and inorganic air contaminants. This is particularly more phenomenal in cases of inadequate ventilation, as the condensation in ventilation system can act as a breeding ground for harmful bacteria which are dispensed through the ventilation ducts. Environmental airborne bacteria such as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces albus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and complex populations of micro-organisms within normal flora were all etiological agents to hypersensitivity pulmonary diseases. Several additional infectious agents such as 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) pose even more grave concerns to the IAQ, as these airborne pathogenic bacteria are known to cause severe illness in humans. Meanwhile, viruses such as influenza virus were originally thought to be only transmitted from person to person via aerosols of body fluids. However, in a recent study conducted by Weistein et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the production of infectious droplet nuclei of diameter &lt; 5 μm could remain suspended and disseminated by air current to infect a susceptible host. A good and reliable disinfection system, therefore, is required to disinfect the airborne microorganisms in order to maintain good IAQ.
