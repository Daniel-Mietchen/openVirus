<p id="Par30">To evaluate the biocidal effect of VUV light, bacteria and viruses were irradiated with a pair of hot cathode low pressure mercury vapor lamps. The lamps were 10 W, U-VIX brand, ZW10D15Y, ozone generating. The distance between the light source and the microorganisms was approximately 5 cm and the UV intensities at 254 nm and 185 nm, respectively measured by a ZDZ-1 UV-C meter and an ILT1400 radiometer were 21 and 2.3 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. To reduce the leakage of UV light and lamp-generated ozone to the surrounding, the lamps and the microorganisms under test were contained in a metal chamber during the experiments as shown in Fig.
