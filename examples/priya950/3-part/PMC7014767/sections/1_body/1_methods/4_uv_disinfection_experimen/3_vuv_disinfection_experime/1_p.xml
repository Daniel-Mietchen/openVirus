<p id="Par44">To analyze the virucidal effect of VUV light, 2 mL virus samples at ~ 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL were added onto nitrocellulose filter papers and irradiated by vacuum ultraviolet light (VUV) for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min at an illumination distance of 5 cm at 25 °C. The illuminated viral suspension and nitrocellulose filter were vigorously washed, and the suspension was then serially diluted (10

 <sup>− 8</sup>) by Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplement with TPCK-trypsin. Each diluted sample was used to infect Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in the presence of TPCK-trypsin at 37 °C for 3 days. The end point of cytopathic effects (CPE) as small, round and degeneration was recorded. Virus sample without VUV illumination was used to infect MDCK as positive control and to determine the original viral load. Each test was conducted in triplicate.
