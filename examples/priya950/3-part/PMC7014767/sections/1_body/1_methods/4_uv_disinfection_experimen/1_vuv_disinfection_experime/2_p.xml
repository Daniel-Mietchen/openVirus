 <sup>− 4</sup>, and 100 μL of each of the serially diluted bacterial suspensions was spread onto a Mueller-Hinton agar plate. Meanwhile, bacterial test suspensions without VUV illumination were spread onto Mueller Hinton agar to obtain the initial colony-forming units (CFU) before the use of VUV light disinfection as control.
