<p id="Par47">For each test, outliers were removed by Dixonâ€™s Q test at 95% significance level. The resultant log10 reduction in CFU/ml of each bacterial strain and the resultant log10 reduction in TCID
 <sub>50</sub> for each viral strain were plotted against disinfection durations, and error bars showing the data of the experiments that deviate from the corresponding mean value were also provided. MS Excel was used in all calculations and graph generation. A spreadsheet file containing raw data and intermediate calculations is provided in as a supplementary information file.
