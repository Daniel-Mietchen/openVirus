<p id="Par38">Both seasonal influenza A viruses were cultured in MDCK cells in MEM (GiBCO) supplemented with TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Virus-infected cells were harvested when almost all MDCK cells exhibited cytopathic effects. Infected cells and the conditioned media underwent one freeze-thaw cycle to release viral particles. The suspension was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatant containing viral particles was collected. Tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined in a 96-well tissue culture plate using Reed Muench method. Virus stock was stored at − 80 °C prior usage.
