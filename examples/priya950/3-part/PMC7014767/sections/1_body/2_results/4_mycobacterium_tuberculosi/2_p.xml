<p id="Par52">Gradual reduction in bacterial count was observed with prolonged VUV disinfection time. Complete inhibition of bacterial growth was observed after 30 min VUV light disinfection. At 20 min VUV illumination, VUV light was able to produce an average of 4-log10 and 3.6-log10 reduction in 0.5 McFarland standard and the 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums, respectively (Fig.
