 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> as Expt. 5 and Expt. 6, were (3.7 ± 0.9) × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and (3.8 ± 1.7) × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, respectively. At 10 min of VUV light disinfection, the bacteria of the 10-fold diluted and the 100-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums were completely inhibited, resulting in at least 5-log10 growth reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b).
