<p id="Par49">Initial bacterial counts of ESBL for 10-fold diluted and 100-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums across triple experimental sets, presented in the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> as Expt. 3 and Expt. 4, were (2.7 ± 0.3) × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL and (3.2 ± 0.7) × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, respectively. It was observed that after 15-min disinfection, both 10-fold diluted and 100-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums were able to achieve complete inhibition of bacterial growth, resulting in at least 6-log10 growth reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). However, at 10-min of disinfection time, although, the device was able to produce at least 6-log10 reduction of bacterial growth for the 100-fold diluted inoculum, VUV light was only able to produce a borderline to insufficient bactericidal effect for the 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum. The test only demonstrated an average of 2.96-log10 reduction with 99.63% growth inhibition. The results have demonstrated that VUV light is more effective against a lower concentration of ESBL
