<p>This preliminary study presents some limitations, mainly based on the small number of samples that were analyzed and the use of HA and head subunits from a single influenza strain. Further studies will be done with the aim to qualify the assay, both by using a mixture of head and stalk reactive monoclonal antibodies as controls and by comparing the results obtained with other assays that are based on the use of chimeric HA proteins to directly detect stalk antibodies. Other parameters will address the influence of the protein concentration that is used during the treatment of samples and the inclusion of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies to ensure that the head protein retains its native conformation after coating. In this first study, we used a quite high protein concentration in order to make sure that any serum antibodies were fully adsorbed or competed with soluble protein.</p>
