<p>Human serum samples that were obtained before and after vaccination were used in this study. As a proof-of-concept to evaluate the performance of ELISA in distinguishing between head- and stalk-specific differences, a total of 16 pairs of serum samples (pre-/post-vaccination) from adult subjects and eight pairs of serum samples (pre-/post-vaccination) from children were selected on the basis of their HI titers. In the first run of experiments, we selected eight adults and four children. Among the adults, we selected: one subject in whom the HI assay gave negative results both pre- and post-vaccination (5/5); three subjects with negative pre-vaccination HI titers and seroprotective post-vaccination HI titers (5/40); three subjects with very high boost (5/1280) of HI titers after vaccination; and one subject with a pre-existing HI titer of 160 which only marginally increased to 320 after vaccination. These selected samples were titrated by serological assays that are generally used in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of an influenza vaccine (MN, SRH and ELLA), along with the competitive head/stalk-specific ELISA described here (

We decided to investigate the immune response and the accuracy of the new ELISA method in a small number of children, too, because we expected to find significant differences in the stalk response between the two age-groups (adults and children) as a result of the previous exposure and/or vaccination of the adults. In the second run of experiments, to broaden our view of the variation in anti-head/stalk responses in individual subjects, we evaluated the performance of the head/stalk-specific ELISA on another eight pairs of samples from adults and four pairs of samples from children with different pre- and post-vaccination HI titers (
