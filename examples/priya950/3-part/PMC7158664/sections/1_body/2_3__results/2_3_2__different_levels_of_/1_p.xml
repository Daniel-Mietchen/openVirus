<p>We investigated the presence of anti-stalk antibody response in pre- and post-vaccination serum samples from adults and young children. All pre-vaccination samples from adults presented detectable stalk-specific antibodies (green bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00043-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The highest pre-vaccination levels assigned to the stalk antibodies were found in adult subjects 8 and 13, but they were completely independent from the measured HI titers of 5 and 160, respectively, which still correlated with the specific head response. In contrast to the results obtained in adults, no antibody responses against the stalk domain were detected in pre-vaccination pediatric serum samples when using the competitive ELISA, with the exception of subject 8 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00043-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Heterogeneous levels of anti-head antibody signals were detected in all samples; no head signals were found in samples 2 and 14 (adults) and sample 1 (children). The magnitude of the head response detected by ELISA after vaccination generally agreed with the increase that was registered by the HI assay, apart from three cases that were observed in adult subjects 1, 7 and 14. In subject 1, a post-vaccination increase in head antibodies was seen in the ELISA, but this was not seen in the HI assay, which remained negative after vaccination. Interestingly, we identified two adult subjects with positive HI titers of 1280 after vaccination (subject 7) or of 40 before vaccination (subject 14), though they had very low, or even undetectable head responses. These quite striking observations can most likely be attributed to the high level of antibodies against conserved epitopes, a response that may be able to result in an effective steric hindrance of hemagglutination activity.
