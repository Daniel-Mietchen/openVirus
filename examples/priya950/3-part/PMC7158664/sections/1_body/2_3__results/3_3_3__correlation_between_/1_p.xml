<p>Given that serological assays such as MN and SRH are not able to distinguish between antibodies against the head and stalk subunits of the HA, we compared the results yielded by the ELISA with those obtained with the aforementioned methods. The SRH data appeared to be more in line with the anti-head response detected by the ELISA and HI assay than with the titers measured by the MN assay. In all adults and children assessed by the SRH assay (yellow dot in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00043-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), we were able to detect a post-vaccination increase in the hemolysis area, apart from adult subject 3, who showed no increase in SRH but did show an HI seroconversion and an increase in the head response. By contrast, the MN assay seemed to be more specific than the SRH assay; it was possible to detect at least a two-fold increase in the neutralizing titer only in subjects that showed a greater increase in head response in the ELISA (adult subjects 5–8 and child subjects 1–4). For a more comprehensive overview on the immunological characterization of each subject, we also evaluated the anti-NA antibody response by using the ELLA test. We found that the NA response, as expected, generally did not correlate with the anti-head or the anti-stalk response. This was clearly seen in adult subjects 4 and 6. Subject 4 showed an eight-fold increase in ELLA but no increase in MN or stalk antibody responses and only quite low increases in HI and head responses. However, subject 6 did not show a post-vaccination increase in the NA antibody titer, despite high responses in the HI, MN and head ELISA tests. These results confirmed that the immunological responses against NA could not be related to or predicted by the HA responses.
