<p>Along with vaccination coverage, which remains unsatisfactory [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], one of the main drawbacks of the current influenza vaccines is the need for an annual reformulation and consequent global re-administration, owing to the antigenic drift of the influenza virus. In the last two decades, growing interest in the possibility of developing a universal vaccine has given new impetus to influenza research. Several studies have focused on the extracellular domain of the M2 protein [

 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The ectodomain sequence has proven to be highly conserved among human and avian influenza viruses. However, antibodies that are elicited against this conserved portion are not neutralizing, but, due to the high expression of M2 on the surface of infected cells, they can promote protection through the effector function of their Fc region [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. NA, the second most abundant glycoprotein that is present on the surface of the influenza virus, is another important target. Previous murine studies that were conducted with virus-like particles bearing the N1 antigen showed protection against lethal infection by homologous and heterologous strains [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Compared with the immunodominant globular head, the stalk domain is far less variable and is able to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. The first description of a mouse monoclonal antibody that was specific for the stalk domain (C179) dates back to 1993 [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This antibody showed no HI activity; however, it was capable of neutralizing group 1 viruses (H1 and H2). In recent years, promising research has been carried out with a view to developing a stalk-based universal influenza vaccine; this research has mainly been based on a novel approach involving the construction of cHA molecules. Repeated vaccination with these constructs has been highly effective in boosting the antibody response against conserved regions of the stalk domain, resulting in high anti-stalk titers and a reduction of viral titers in lungs and nasal turbinates in mice and ferrets [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A universal influenza vaccine that is able to stimulate stalk-specific antibodies has the potential to avoid the need for the annual vaccine reformulation of the H1, H3 and B strains; moreover, it would confer greater protection against new emerging influenza viruses, particularly those that pose a pandemic threat [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this paper, we present a possible approach that allows for head- and stalk-specific antibody responses to be clearly distinguished through the specific re-adaptation of a competitive ELISA. Unlike the HI, SRH, MN assays or the ELLA, which detect functional antibodies, this adapted ELISA only detects binding antibodies. Nevertheless, it can support studies of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines by detecting and quantifying specific immune responses against mainly continuously changing epitopes in the head domain of the HA molecule (antigenic drift) and mainly conserved epitopes in the stalk region. This approach will be particularly helpful for the study of the immune responses that are induced by next-generation influenza vaccines, such as those based on conserved epitopes from the stalk domain of the HA protein [
