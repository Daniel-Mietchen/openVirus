<p>The MN assay was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, heat-inactivated serum samples were mixed and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere with a standardized amount of live A/California/7/2009 H1N1 influenza virus (100 tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50)). After the incubation period, the serum–virus mixtures were transferred to a plate that contained 90% confluent pre-seeded Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) (ATCC® CCL-34™) cells that were monolayered in an UltraMDCK serum-free medium (Lonza, Milano, Italy) with 7 µg/ml of acetylated trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The plates were then incubated for 5 days at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in humidified atmosphere before being inspected by an inverted optical microscope for the presence/absence of a cytopathic effect (CPE).
