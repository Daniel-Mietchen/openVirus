<p>Anti-NA antibodies were also determined by the ELLA assay in accordance with the protocol described by Couzens and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, inactivated and 2-fold diluted serum samples were mixed with a standardized amount of influenza pseudotypes bearing N1 from A/California/7/2009, and incubated for 16â€“18 hours in a fetuin- (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) coated plate. After the incubation period, the plates were washed, and peanut agglutinin (PNA) that was conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation, the plates were washed, and an o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) substrate was added. The reaction was stopped, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm.
