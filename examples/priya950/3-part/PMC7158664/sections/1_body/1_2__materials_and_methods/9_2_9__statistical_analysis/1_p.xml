<p>Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism. The ELLA, SRH and MN results were normalized by applying the Z-Score. Significant differences between pre- and post-vaccination OD signals (a value of 4 at the lower plateau level) for the head and stalk were evaluated with a paired T-test. The homogeneity of variances was previously verified through an F-test. A significance level of 5% was considered for all the statistical tests.</p>
