<p>The development of a universal influenza vaccine would avoid potential mismatches of recommended vaccine strains and the need for the annual re-formulation and re-administration of vaccines; it would also enable timely intervention in the event of a pandemic, and it might result in the eradication of influenza B virus in humans. Several candidate target antigens could be considered for use in universal influenza vaccines, such as the M2 ion channel [

 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The stalk domain is the most conserved region of HA in the influenza A and B viruses. Its main function is to mediate the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes once the virus has been internalized by endosomes in order to permit the release of the viral genome into the cytosol [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In order to carry out this function, the stalk domain has to undergo considerable structural rearrangements; this is why all possible mutations that could potentially interfere with this process are not permitted [
