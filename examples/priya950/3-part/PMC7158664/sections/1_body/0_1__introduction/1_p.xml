<p>Influenza continues to have a significant impact on public health and is still responsible for high morbidity and mortality in humans, with annual attack rates estimated to be up to 10% in adults and 30% in children [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vaccination is still the most effective method of preventing the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza infection, especially in groups at high risk of dangerous complications, such as young children and the elderly [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], although the effectiveness of influenza vaccination is strictly dependent on the age-group and vaccine formulation [

 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Influenza A and B viruses, which are responsible for annual epidemics in humans, undergo antigenic changes within the antibody-binding sites of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens; these changes are able to render the new strains different enough to at least partially avoid the immunity induced by previous infection or vaccination (antigenic drift) [

 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, the composition of vaccines needs to be updated every year in response to changes in HA antigens. Current inactivated intramuscular/intradermal vaccines (IIVs) or live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) are made with a carefully standardized amount of HA from three (trivalent influenza vaccine—TIV) or four (quadrivalent influenza vaccine—QIV) seasonal strains on the basis of recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
