<p>Possible reasons for the lack of antiviral activity may be the inability of the molecules to enter the cell, or their conversion into inactive metabolites in infected cells. However, since compound 
 <bold>6</bold> proved to be cytotoxic (CC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;3.99 μM), it is likely that this compound and analogues thereof can enter the cells. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>9 a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> against the host MTase (Table 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) hints toward an antimetabolic effect. Another possible explanation is that compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>9 a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold> mainly inhibit the 2′‐O MTase activity without affecting the N7 MTase activity. This could explain the very poor inhibition of ZIKV replication in the cell‐based assay, as the 2′‐O methylation of the cap is not essential for viral replication in most cell lines. Derivative 
 <bold>11 b</bold>, which showed some MTase inhibitory activity, also exhibited antiviral activity against ZIKV in the cell‐based assay (EC
 <sub>50</sub>=4.78 μM). Interestingly, derivative 
 <bold>15</bold>,
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> which did not show any activity against ZIKV NS5‐MTase, was able to inhibit ZIKV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.67 μM. It is plausible that 
 <bold>15</bold> inhibits ZIKV replication via a different mode of action than via NS5‐MTase inhibition, or that this compound is partially metabolized in the treated cells.
