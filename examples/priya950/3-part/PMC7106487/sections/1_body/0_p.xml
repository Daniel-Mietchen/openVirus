 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and it causes mild‐severe diseases in humans and animals. ZIKV is closely related to Dengue virus (DENV), and just like DENV, is mainly transmitted to humans by bites of an infected 
 <italic>Aedes s</italic>pecies mosquitoes (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus)</italic>.
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> However, ZIKV can also be transmitted between humans through contact with blood or other body fluids, sexual transmission

 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> While global epidemics of DENV have spread over the past few decades causing more than 20,000 demises per year, ZIKV infections have emerged as a major public health concern only in the last few years. Before 2007, only sporadic human disease cases were reported in Africa and Asia. However, following the recent outbreaks in the Americas in 2015, ZIKV was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and the first case of sexually‐transmitted ZIKV was reported in USA in 2008. While ZIKV infections generally cause a mild fever, headache, malaise, skin rashes and joint pain, they have been associated in several cases with severe neurological and fetal complications leading to microcephaly in new‐borns

 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> The recent 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> outbreaks, as well as the increasing number of cases of ZIKV infections worldwide, have raised the attention of pharmaceutical industries and healthcare providers toward the identification and development of efficient treatments against these diseases. Although a vaccine against DENV has recently been commercialized (DENGVAXIA
 <sup>®</sup>),
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> there is as yet no vaccine against ZIKV available. In addition, there are no drugs available to treat or prevent ZIKV infections, especially in the event of an outbreak. A limited number of early‐phase discovery studies have identified few inhibitors of DENV and ZIKV replication,
