<p>Finally, the ability of all the derivatives synthesized in this work to inhibit ZIKV replication was assessed. Results of the most active compounds, as well as their effect on cell viability, are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>9 a</bold>–
