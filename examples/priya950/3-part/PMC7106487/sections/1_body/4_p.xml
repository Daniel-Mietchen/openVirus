<p>Next, a library of analogues of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> was designed and synthesized to explore the chemical space around the urea scaffold (Scheme 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-5001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The carbazole derivatives 
 <bold>9 a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> were first synthesized through reaction of carbazole 
 <bold>7</bold> with the appropriate isocyanate 
 <bold>8</bold> in toluene at 60 °C with the aim to investigate the effect of different substituents (electron‐donating and electron‐withdrawing) on the phenyl ring bound to the urea moiety (Scheme 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-5001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Similarly, thioureas 
 <bold>11 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold> were synthesized from 
 <bold>10 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold> to investigate the role of the isosteric sulfur in place of the urea oxygen atom and to evaluate the influence of an extra methylene group in 
 <bold>11 b</bold> on MTase inhibition (Scheme 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-5001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).
