<p>Prevention of severe diseases by inoculation or contagion with the respective germ is an intuitive notion and has been practiced since pre-historical times in order to generate a protective immune response in healthy persons or animals. Vaccination, in this way, contributed to the health and survival of even illiterate communities. In fact, vaccination did not strictly start with academic knowledge. Different kinds of vaccinations were practiced to avoid diseases since 1796 in Europe and since the 1500's in Africa, China, and India. However, viral and bacterial diseases started to be controlled by vaccination 250 years after the invention of the microscope and the description of most microorganisms. One exception is the vaccine against Variola, which is a viral disease known since the 16th BCE that was successfully eradicated through massive international vaccination. In contrast, Malaria, a severe and lethal protozoan disease, has been known since the fifth century BCE, but no vaccine for it has yet been granted a license.</p>
