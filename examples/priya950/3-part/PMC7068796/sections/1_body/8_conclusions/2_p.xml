<p>Vaccination started with the use of live germs and evolved through the use of germs of related species that do not cause disease but instead provide heterologous protection in the host. After that, inactivation of germs contributed to an increase in safety. More recently, subunit native or recombinant DNA and synthetic safe vaccines have been developed thanks to advances in biotechnology and industrial development. In this way, vaccines gained safety but lost immunogenicity and efficacy. Only in some cases has this effect been reverted by the use of potent adjuvants. Our historical approach leads us to conclude that the vaccines that were not developed using live, heterologous, or attenuated formulations in the period ranging from 1600 to the 1800's faced so many regulatory limitations and safety concerns in modern times that they lost their capability to control the epidemics. This seems to be the case of the human Malaria vaccine. The first candidate that applied for a licensing status is not a live vaccine but is, instead, a modern recombinant, very defined formulation that, unfortunately, shows a very low vaccine efficacy. Therefore, protozoan infections are the cause of neglected diseases against which human vaccines have been developed only recently using the most modern regulatory and safety criteria. The situation is better in the case of visceral leishmaniasis, which is a canid zoonosis. The licensed second-generation vaccines against canine VL show higher efficacies than the human Malaria vaccine. As they are veterinary formulations, they can include higher concentrations of antigen and adjuvants, which enable them to control veterinary epidemics and indirectly, the incidence of the human infection as well.</p>
