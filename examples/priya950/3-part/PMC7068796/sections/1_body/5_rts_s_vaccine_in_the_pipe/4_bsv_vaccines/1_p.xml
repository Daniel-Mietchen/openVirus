<p>A second scenario for Malaria vaccines is represented by the blood-stage vaccines, which prevent the disease but not the infection. Immune protection against the blood stage is mediated through neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Merozoite surface proteins and infected red blood cells were used as candidates for the BSV vaccines. The merozoite surface proteins MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, serine repeat antigen, erythrocyte binding antigen, ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), glutamate rich protein (GLURP), and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) were tested as potential candidates (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). As discussed for the PEV vaccines, infection with a parasite that holds a genetic sequence different from the strain used for the BSV vaccine might determine the type of Malaria disease (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Although the AMA-1 antigen recently demonstrated efficacy against clinical malaria provoked by parasites that showed genetic identity with the vaccine strain, the limitations associated with the genetic diversity of the etiological agents indicated that only a multivalent universal vaccine could be used to control Malaria (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In fact, a strain-specific vaccine would not be useful considering the great diversity of strains composing the 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infective agent. A recent Phase III assay of the AMA-1/ASO2 formulation in Africa showed no vaccine efficacy (VE) considering the whole cohort of vaccines (VE = 17%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.18) but revealed allele-specific efficacy (VE = 64%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) against the vaccine strain. Hence, the AMA-1 antigen could be a component of a multivalent vaccine (
