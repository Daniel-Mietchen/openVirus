<p>Despite the enormous effort made toward testing the RTS,S vaccine in Africa and its imminent license and review for policy recommendations, the WHO considers its efficacy low and states that the global health community expects the development and licensing, by 2030, of malaria vaccines with protective efficacy of at least 75%. Hence, the available malaria vaccines are considered only as a complementary tool for the control of the disease and should not replace the current interventions (vector control, chemoprevention, diagnosis, and treatment) (

In spite of the time, resources, and effort invested, the RTS,S Malaria vaccine that is going to be licensed is an example of how the technology used to discover and define vaccine antigens, allied with the ethical limitations of high doses of adjuvants in humans, led to a vaccine with limited efficacy, without the expected prevention and control of the disease.
