<p>In Malaria-infected women, during pregnancy, red blood cells are retained in the placenta. Binding of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected red blood cells is mediated by the exposure of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> PfEMP1 erythrocyte membrane protein, which interacts with the chondroitin sulfate antigen of the placenta matrix (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). While this binding is responsible for the blood supply to the placenta, at the same time it increases the risk of babies with low birth weight. Currently, the research is focused on the development of a vaccine against conserved regions of the PfEMP protein in order to reduce Malaria in Sub Saharan Africa (
