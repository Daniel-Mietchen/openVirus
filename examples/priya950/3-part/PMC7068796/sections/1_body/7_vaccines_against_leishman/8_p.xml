<p>As discussed before, dead parasites with or without adjuvants composed the first generation of vaccines against leishmaniasis. These were mainly directed toward preventing the infections caused by the agents of CL (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Later, second-generation vaccines were developed, which included in their formulation either genetically modified live

 <italic>Leishmania</italic> genes expressed by viruses or recombinant, synthetic, or partially purified native antigen subunits. Finally, the third-generation vaccines are composed of parasite antigens cloned in eukaryotic promoter vectors injected into the host muscle (
