<p>Previously, VL was considered a disease present in rural areas, but since the 1980's, it has become endemic in more urbanized regions (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) showing the clear process of epidemiological transition. The geographical spread of the disease is directly related to the migration of people from regions where VL is endemic (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). The change in the epidemiological profile is also related to anthropic actions, such as urbanization and deforestation, which cause an environmental imbalance. This confirms that environmental changes and ecological disturbances have a significant influence on disease proliferation (
