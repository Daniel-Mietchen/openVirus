 <italic>G. lamblia</italic> is an enteric protozoan parasite that causes endemic enteric infections of human and animal clinical importance. It is one of the most common causes of enteric infections in children and in farm and domestic animals (dogs and cats) and is mainly associated with poor sanitary conditions and zoonotic transmission (

 <italic>Giardia</italic> cysts. It is a zoonotic disease. Clinical manifestations of giardiasis include diarrhea, loss of weight, anorexia, and lethargy, both in humans and animals. Currently, there is no human-licensed vaccine against giardiasis, but a crude veterinary vaccine composed of the total lysate of 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> trophozoites, called GiardiaVaxÂ® (
