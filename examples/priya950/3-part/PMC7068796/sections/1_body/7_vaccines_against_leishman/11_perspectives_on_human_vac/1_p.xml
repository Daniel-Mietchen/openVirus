<p>Although different degrees of prevention of canine leishmaniasis are currently achievable, depending on which of the four veterinary licensed vaccines is used, a subsequent decrease of human incidence of VL was only described in areas where dogs were vaccinated with Leishmune® (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Meanwhile, direct protection obtained through human vaccination is not yet possible, since no human vaccine has achieved the status of registration. However, two human vaccines have been tested in clinical trials. The first-generation Alum-precipitated autoclaved 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> (L.) 
 <italic>major</italic> vaccine was assayed with BCG in a phase II study with children in Sudan; it showed to be immunogenic and safe and converted the leishmanin skin test to positive (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). The dosage of the vaccine was also studied (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>). Furthermore, safety and immunogenicity were also observed in 76% of the human volunteers that produced IFN-γ in response to the 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> lysate (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). However, the vaccine only induced 43% efficacy among vaccinated subjects in whom the intradermal skin reaction was converted (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). This performance was expected for a first-generation vaccine against leishmaniasis (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
