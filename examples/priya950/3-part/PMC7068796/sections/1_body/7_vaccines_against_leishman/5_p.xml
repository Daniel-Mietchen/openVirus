<p>The infection caused by the species 
 <italic>L</italic>. (L) 
 <italic>infantum chagasi</italic> has two distinct cycles, which are defined as wild and domestic. In the wild cycle of the disease, the bush dog, the manned wolf, the field fox and the skunk are the main reservoirs. In the domestic cycle, the reservoirs are dogs. The proximity of domestic animals to humans makes them occupy a prominent position in the epidemiological chain, and dogs are considered to be mainly responsible for the persistence of VL in tropical and neotropical environments (
