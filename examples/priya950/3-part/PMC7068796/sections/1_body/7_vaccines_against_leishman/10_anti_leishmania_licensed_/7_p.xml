<p>These summarized results explain why, when used on a large scale, in Brazilian endemic areas, Leishmune® decreased the incidence of human and canine ZVL (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). If Leishmune® reduces the presence of parasites in dog skins (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>) and is a transmission-blocking vaccine (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>), its use in dog vaccinations would reduce the canine and, subsequently, the human cases of the disease, interrupting epidemics. The impact of the use of Leishmune® on the official epidemiological data of Campo Grande, Araçatuba, and Belo Horizonte, three important Brazilian towns where ZVL is endemic, was analyzed. The results showed that, in spite of promoting an increase in anti-FML antibodies, vaccination with Leishmune® did not interfere with a serological control campaign that screened 110,000 dogs. Positivity was detected only in 1.3% of the animals, 76 among 5,860 dogs, in which the presence of parasites could not be detected (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Furthermore, the potential additive effect of vaccination with Leishmune® over dog culling from 2004 to 2006 was studied. In Araçatuba, decreases of 25% in dog cases and 61% in human cases were reported. In Belo Horizonte, rising numbers of canine and human cases were observed in the districts where no vaccination was performed, while the vaccinated district exhibited stable or decreased incidences after Leishmune® vaccination. The districts that had the highest vaccination rates (63.27 and 27.27%, respectively) exhibited the strongest decrease in human incidence (−36.5%) and the lowest dog incidence (−3.36 and 1.89%, respectively). In contrast, the almost unvaccinated districts showed a very high increase of canine incidence (24.48, 21.85, and 328.57%) and human incidence of VL (14, 4, and 17%, respectively) after the two year study period. Therefore, the decline of canine and human incidences is correlated with the increase in the number of vaccinated dogs (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) and proved the beneficial contribution of Leishmune® vaccination over dog culling in the control campaign (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). In fact, Leishmune® became a new important tool to be used in the preventive epidemiological control of VL.
