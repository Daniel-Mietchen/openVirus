After 2 years, only 8% of vaccinated dogs showed mild signs of the disease, indicating that 92% protection was achieved. Among these 6 dogs, infection was confirmed by PCR analysis in only three of them. In contrast, 33% of the untreated controls developed clinical VL or died of ZVL. In fact, four control dogs died, while another six showed clinical signs, confirmed by PCR. The difference in the infection rate was highly significant, and the calculated vaccine efficacy for the FML-saponin formulation was 76% (33%−8/33% × 100 = 76%) (
