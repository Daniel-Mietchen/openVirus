<p>In a simultaneous field assay in North-East Brazil using FML and QuilA saponin, 100% positive antibody and DTH responses were achieved 2 months after vaccination and was sustained for at least 3.5 years (

This difference was significant and indicated that 95% of vaccinated dogs were protected. On month 41 after vaccination, the vaccinated dogs still showed a positive DTH response. No parasites were detected through microscopic observation of bone marrow smears or by PCR of bone marrow and blood samples. In contrast, PCR and microscopic observations of amastigotes were positive in three control dogs (
