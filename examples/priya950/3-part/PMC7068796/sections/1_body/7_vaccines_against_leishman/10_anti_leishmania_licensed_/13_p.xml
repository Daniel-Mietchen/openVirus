 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>) and was licensed in Europe in 2016. This vaccine protected dogs from experimental infection (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). In fact, vaccinated dogs showed a lower number and lower intensity of symptoms than controls and no signs of parasites in target organs (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). Furthermore, Letifend速 was assayed in Phase III trials in France and Spain, where cases were represented by dogs that showed clinical signs confirmed by positive serological assay and that held parasites in bone marrow or lymph nodes, as evidenced by PCR or microscopic analysis of smears. In these assays, the vaccine efficacy disclosed for Letifend速 was 72% (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>).
