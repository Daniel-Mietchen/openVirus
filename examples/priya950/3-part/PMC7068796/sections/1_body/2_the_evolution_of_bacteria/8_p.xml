<p>In summary, after live vaccination was first used against smallpox in 1796, enormous efforts were made in the early 1900s toward the development of bacterial vaccines. These efforts were successful for the control of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and pertussis. After that, the emergence of tissue culture techniques in the 1950's represented a second stage of viral vaccine development, which yielded the vaccines against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Since the 1970's, a third phase of research and development privileged safety and enabled the licensing of vaccines composed of molecules of microorganisms instead of the whole germs. Now, different technologies are being used, leading to polysaccharide vaccines against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and
