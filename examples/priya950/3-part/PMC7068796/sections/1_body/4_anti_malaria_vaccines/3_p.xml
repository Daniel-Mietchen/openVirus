<p>The research in Malaria vaccines started in 1930 with the use of inactivated or dead parasites. However, only partial protection was obtained in ducklings and only with the addition of adjuvants (

 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites delivered by mosquito bites (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, since this approach was considered impractical for large-scale vaccination, synthetic peptides based on immunogenic parasite proteins started to be used for vaccination in the 1980's. The absence of clear correlates of protection for malaria was considered an important problem to overcome.
