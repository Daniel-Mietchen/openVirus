<p>Several tests of safety and reactogenicity were needed before testing the vaccine in a Phase II trial in children of endemic areas. These tests were very laborious and time-consuming and required extensive funding, besides running the risk of negative results. To circumvent this risk, since the 1940's, controlled human Malaria infection (CHMI) has been used to test malaria vaccines and drugs and to evaluate the products in well-controlled early-phase proof-of-concept studies (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In CHMI tests, participants are inoculated with sporozoites through the bite of an Anopheles mosquito under well-controlled conditions. CHMI can therefore be used as an immunization strategy, to determine drug and vaccine efficacies, and to study the human immune response to the parasite (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). CHMI can be promoted either by inoculation of sporozoites via mosquito bite or by injection of sporozoites or 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected blood. CHMI implies that the blood-stage infection is truncated by antimalarial drug treatment. Initial tests of the RTS,S vaccine using CHMI subjects have shown its efficacy and have allowed the adjuvant and formulation to be chosen (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Recent advances have included the use of cryopreserved aseptic non-irradiated parasites and inoculation by injection (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, as the current risk of multiresistant strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is high, and as the sporozoites remain a cryptic infection, they could promote Malaria in immunocompromised subjects; therefore, it is surprising that this technique has been ethically accepted.
