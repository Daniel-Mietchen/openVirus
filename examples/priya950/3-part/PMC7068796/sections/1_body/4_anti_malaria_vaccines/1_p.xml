<p>Approximately half of the world is at risk of Malaria infection (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the poorer countries, the incidence of deaths due to Malaria is particularly high, mainly in children under 5 years old living in Sub-Saharan Africa (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The biological cycle of the agents of Malaria, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, P. ovale</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, is highly complex. It starts when a sporozoite is injected through the Anopheles insect bite into the blood of a human host and reaches the liver, where it multiplies and produces 30–40,000 progeny inside the hepatocytes, through a pre-erythrocytic schizogony (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). When the hepatocytes rupture, the released merozoites invade red blood cells, where they rapidly multiply to produce 8–24 merozoites each (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These merozoites are further released with massive erythrocyte rupture, which is accompanied by fever, headache, chills, and malaise (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). At this early stage of clinical signs, fever occurs periodically (24 h for 
 <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>; 48 h for 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and 72 h for 
 <italic>P. malariae</italic>). These symptoms match the release of a new generation of merozoites into the blood. The cycles in erythrocytes are repeated, but some merozoites, instead of following the described asexual replication, begin developing into the sexual form, called gametocytes, inside red blood cells. If a mosquito bites this host, it ingests the gametocytes, which, inside the gut transform, transform into mature gametes. The female gamete can be fertilized by a masculine gamete, and the resultant ookynete can invade the gut membrane of the mosquito, where it transforms into an oocyst. Inside the oocysts, thousands of sporozoites develop, and when the oocyst is disrupted, they migrate toward the salivary gland, from where they can be forwarded into another human host during a new mosquito blood meal (
