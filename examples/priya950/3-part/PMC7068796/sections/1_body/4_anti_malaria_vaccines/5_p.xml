<p>Furthermore, the development of synthetic vaccines against malaria started in the 1980's, and field assays were conducted in the 1990's, using the SPf66 subunit composed of three 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage antigens and the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) (

 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> brought hope for the design of an anti-Malaria vaccine (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and other vaccines, such as the anti-pregnancy associated Malaria vaccines (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), anti-toxic (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), or combination vaccines (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, after 40 years of research and clinical trials, only the PEV vaccine has arrived at the Phase III trial stage.
