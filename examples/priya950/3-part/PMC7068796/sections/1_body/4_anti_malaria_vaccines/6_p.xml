<p>The PEV vaccine protects against the early infection of hepatocytes and in this way impedes the whole parasite cycle in the host, while the BSV vaccine only blocks the blood infection and prevents the onset of the first clinical signs of disease (fever, chills, headache, and anemia). The TBV vaccines direct the immunity against the gametocyte stage that infects mosquitoes. Therefore, TBV vaccines do not impede the human infection but, instead, the antibodies raised against it, impede the binding of the gametes to the gut membranes of the insect vector blocking its development. Therefore, mosquitoes fed with the blood of a TBV-vaccinated person do not forward the parasite to the next host. That is why the vaccine is considered a transmission-blocking vaccine and, with high coverage, can block the epidemics. This is an altruistic vaccine that does not immediately protect the vaccinated subject but, at a high coverage, can interrupt the contagion and epidemics (
