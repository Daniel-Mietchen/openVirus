<p>Fewer studies have been carried out on the other pre-erythrocytic vaccines: ME-TRAP (multiple epitope thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) and the whole–sporozoite vaccine. ME-TRAP is composed of B-cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell epitopes of 
 <italic>P falciparum</italic> liver antigens but failed to induce protection in a Phase IIb trial in children from Kenya (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and a 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> circumsporozoite synthetic antigen called VMP-001 (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Furthermore, going back to the first malaria vaccine, 100% protection was also obtained in six North American volunteers who were vaccinated intravenously with irradiated sporozoites. However, the route of administration makes this kind of vaccination unfeasible (
