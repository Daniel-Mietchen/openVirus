<p>RTS,S is the leading PEV vaccine (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The early research on the RTS,S vaccine was performed with CHMI; it predicted the efficacy of the vaccine and helped to select the adjuvant and the future lyophilized formulation (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It is formulated as a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) fused with the CPS central repeat and thrombospondin domain. The vaccine is adjuvanted with ASO1, which is a liposome composed of 3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A and the QS21 saponin from 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> Molina extract. RTS,S is therefore a recombinant complex comprising the conserved sequences of the 3D7 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Its R (repeat) portion contains the conserved tetrapeptide sequence of CSP (N-acetyl neuraminic acid phosphatase, NANP) amino acid sequence repeats and the T-lymphocyte portion (T), which includes T cell epitopes separated by immunodominant CD4+ and CD8+ (Th2R and Th3R) sequences. The RT peptide is fused to the N-terminal of HBsAg, which represents the surface portion and is called “S.” Another non-fused HBsAg moiety accounts for the second “S” of RTS,S. Altogether, they comprise the RTS,S complex (
