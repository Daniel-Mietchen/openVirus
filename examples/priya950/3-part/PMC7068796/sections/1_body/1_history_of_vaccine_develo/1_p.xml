<p>The habit of exposing an individual to a natural infection in order to render him immune and protect him from future diseases has a long history, for instance with plague, variolation, and leishmanization (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The first record of variolation comes from China, where dried pustules from patients with smallpox were blown into the noses of healthy people or scratched into their skins to induce a mild self-resolved infection that would give future protection against the severe form of the disease (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Later, in 1796, Edward Jenner, a British physician who was himself variolized, inoculated material obtained from lesions of cowpox in an 8-year-old child, who showed protection when challenged with material obtained from pustules of smallpox infection. Jenner did not know at that time that he was inoculating a virus. The work of Jenner then reproduced variolation but with the cowpox virus, generating mild lesions that give high cross-protection (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The strong merit of Jenner's work was, however, not the invention of the Variola vaccine but the universalization of its use. He actually convinced George Washington to vaccinate the USA army. To date, the biological origin of vaccinia virus is uncertain, and it has been suggested that a horsepox-like pigpox, or even smallpox, virus was an ancestor (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Rinderpest was the second global lethal disease caused by a virus and was also eradicated by vaccination (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It killed calves and provoked millions of human deaths related to the famines that it induced. In 1980, an attenuated virus vaccine began to be applied against rinderpest (
