<p>The second step in the evolution of vaccines consisted of using a live pathogen that causes an analogous disease in another species in order to cause heterologous cross-protection (cowpox) but not the disease. Afterward, the use of the homologous live pathogens that underwent attenuation started in the 1960's with the Sabin vaccine against poliomyelitis. This was followed by the first-generation vaccines, comprising dead or inactivated microorganisms or lysates (pertussis, cholera Typhus, paratyphus, Influenza, rabies, and anti-poliomyelitis Salk) or inactivated exotoxins (diphtheria and tetanus), which are immunogenic but cannot revert to virulence. The second-generation vaccines against bacteria include native pathogen molecules (anti-pneumococcus and anti-meningitis) and recombinant proteins (anti-Hepatitis B) (
