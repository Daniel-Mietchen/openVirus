<p>We mapped all the sites identified as being under positive selection to the available atomic structures of the OROV Gc head domain and the closely related SBV stem domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). This analysis reveals that three sites under selection (corresponding to residues A71, L106, and T145) are located at alpha-helixes in the head domain, and one (residue G269) occurs at a loop connecting the stem domain I N terminus to the head domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Although A71 is buried and residue L106 is only partially accessible from within the protein structure, residues T145 and G269 are completely accessible (Fig. S6), with the former located at the top of the trimeric spike structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Structure-based mapping of the residues equivalent to T145 in BUNV and LACV suggests that this residue could help to facilitate the formation of a closed trimeric interface (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), so substitutions at this location may affect the protein-protein interface and change the antigenic surface of the spike complex.
