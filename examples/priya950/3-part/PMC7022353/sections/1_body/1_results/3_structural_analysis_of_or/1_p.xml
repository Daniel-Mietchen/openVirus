<p>Viral glycoproteins are important targets of positive selection and drivers of virus adaptation due to their direct interactions with the host immune system (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In orthobunyaviruses, glycoproteins are expressed as a polyprotein, encoded by a single open reading frame (ORF) of the M segment that is expressed and posttranslationally cleaved into the Gn, NSm (nonstructural), and Gc proteins, respectively. The main component of the OROV particle spikes is Gc, which is composed of four main domains: a head domain, two stem domains, and a core region (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We identified eight sites under selection in Gc overall (four of which fall within the head and stem domains) and two putative, previously unreported N-linked glycosylation sites (

 <italic>dS</italic> ratios are similar for each domain (

 <italic>dS</italic> ratios are estimated separately for the two M segment lineages, then we obtain higher

 <italic>dS</italic> estimates for the head and stem domains of lineage 2, although the large confidence limits mean these differences are not significant (
