<p>In addition to the sites under positive selection, we identified two previously unreported N-linked glycosylation sequons at residues 133 (motif NNTD) and 218 (motif NISL). Both of these putative glycosylation sites are located on the Gc head domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and they do not co-occur in any of the sequences, which supports the hypothesis that they may be alternative motifs serving similar functional roles. Furthermore, these sites appear to be phylogenetically associated with the different M segment lineages, with motif NNTD being exclusive to lineage 1 and motif NISL occurring exclusively in lineage 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Based on shared ancestry, it is likely that the motif NNTD appeared in a Brazilian common ancestor that excludes the Mazag√£o outbreak sequences, since this motif is not found in either the Panama or Trinidad sequences belonging to lineage 1.
