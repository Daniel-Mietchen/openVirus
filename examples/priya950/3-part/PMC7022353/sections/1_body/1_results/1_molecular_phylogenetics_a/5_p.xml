<p>In the S segment phylogeny, samples obtained through the 1950s and 1960s are located at the base of the tree. The tree splits into two cocirculating clusters around 1969 (95% HPD, 1964 to 1973). Both clusters include sequences mostly from central Brazil and Panama, and one of the clusters suggests multiple introductions to Peru as early as the mid 1970s. The 2009 Mazagão outbreak and the 2016 Ecuador sequences arise from one of these Peruvian clusters, with the latter sharing a common ancestor around late 2011 (95% HPD, 2009 to 2015) (

On the other hand, the L segment tree shows two divergent lineages that split sometime in the early to mid-20th century (95% HPDs, 1900 to 1953 and 1918 to 1979) and more closely match the M segment lineage structure. One of these L segment lineages includes most of the Brazilian diversity (the Mazagão sequences are distinct and cluster in the other L segment lineage) and a cluster of sequences from Panama. The other includes a second cluster of Panama sequences and all of the Peruvian diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The Ecuadorian sequences are again descended from Peruvian strains, with a TMRCA in early 2014 (95% HPD, 2011 to 2016). This date is similar in the other segments (the estimated Ecuador TMRCA is mid 2011 in the M segment; 95% HPD, 2008 to 2015). These results suggest a recent introduction of OROV to northern Ecuador with no reassortment events leading to its emergence.
