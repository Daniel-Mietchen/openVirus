<p>The evolutionary timescale for OROV in America, estimated using a Bayesian phylogenetic molecular clock approach (relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock [UCLD] model), yielded highly variable dates for the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each segment. The origins of the S and L segments can be traced back to the early to mid-20th century, while the M segment shows long internal branches and an older mean root age, dating back to approximately 1608 (95% highest posterior density [HPD], 1116 to 1924) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The estimated TMRCA of the S segment is approximately 1940 (95% HPD, 1916 to 1955), while that of the L segment is slightly older, around 1919 (95% HPD, 1854 to 1955). It is also noteworthy that the M segment splits into two distinct lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), observed both in the ML and the Bayesian phylogenies. Lineage 1 represents an eastern-central clade that includes the earliest OROV case in Trinidad and Tobago, sequences obtained from patients in Panama between the late 80s and late 90s, and the entirety of the Brazilian genetic diversity of the virus. Lineage 1 is estimated to have emerged around 1887 (95% HPD, 1804 to 1945). On the other hand, lineage 2 contains sequences from western South America, including sequences from Panama (from the late 1980s), Peru and Ecuador, with an estimated origin around 1905 (95% HPD, 1841 to 1962). The estimated mean evolutionary rate of the M segment appears to be significantly lower than that of other segments (mean rates = 1.75 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year for segment S, 3.65 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year for segment M, and 1.64 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year for segment L). We also attempted to estimate evolutionary rates estimated separately for each lineage within the M segment phylogeny. A systematic comparison of different molecular clock methods was used to evaluate the reliability of the lineage-specific estimates (Fig. S4). While the estimated rates for Lineage 1 are similar to those for the whole M segment, the rate estimates for lineage 2 are highly uncertain and also inconsistent among methods and models (Fig. S4). Thus, the small sample size of lineage 2 renders the estimate for that lineage unreliable and prevents us from concluding the lineages evolve at different or similar rates. The systematic comparisons in Fig. S4 and 2b also show that the relative rates of the segments are broadly consistent (i.e., L is fastest, S is intermediate, and M is slowest; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and Fig. S4), despite differences in their estimated absolute rates. The UCLD clock remains the most reliable and realistic model choice due to the high among lineage rate variation we observe (coefficient of variation &gt;1 for all segments) and low
