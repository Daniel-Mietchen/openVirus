<p>The estimated ML phylogenies for each OROV genome segment are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. An interactive phylogenetic representation that includes additional information such as sampling location is available through Microreact (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) (URL links are provided in Table S2). The phylogenies show spatially structured virus populations as evidenced by the clustering of taxa according to country of isolate collection. In all three phylogenies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">c</xref>), our new sequences from Ecuador (yellow) cluster together in a single monophyletic group (with 100% bootstrap support, Fig. S2) that descends from OROV sequences from Peru (red), suggesting the Ecuadorian sequences represent an unreported outbreak in 2016 that is related to cases observed in Peru in the middle to late 2000s. The large (L) and medium (M) segment trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">c</xref>) contain long internal branches and distinct lineages. Sequences from Panama (orange) are found in two distinct clusters, while Brazilian sequences (blue) are split into two distinct groups. One Brazilian group corresponds to the 2009 OROV outbreak in the municipality of Mazagão (Amapá state) in northern Brazil (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), while the other contains sequences from isolates obtained between 1960 and 2006 from seven different states (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Pará, and Rondônia) (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Most of these clusters are supported by high bootstrap scores (&gt;95%), but there is less consistent and sometimes limited support for phylogenetic structure 
 <italic>within</italic> clusters (Fig. S2b and c). The OROV small (S) segment phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) contains more sequences but has less phylogenetic structure (i.e., the internal branches are shorter, and several basal nodes have weak bootstrap support). Geographical clustering is also less evident; there are three well-supported clusters of sequences from Brazil or Brazil/Panama, and the Ecuadorian sequences are again found in a strongly supported cluster descended from the Peruvian isolate IQE7894, but the remaining sequences from Peru cluster elsewhere in the tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S2a).
