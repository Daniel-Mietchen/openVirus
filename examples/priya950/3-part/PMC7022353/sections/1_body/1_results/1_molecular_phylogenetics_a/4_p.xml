<p>In order to explore whether these differences in evolutionary rates might result from rate heterogeneity between the M segment lineages, we calculated the mean relative genetic distance of Lineage 1 and 2 to a closely related outgroup, Iquitos virus (IQTV), using a sliding window approach. In each window we divided the mean genetic distance of each lineage to the outgroup by the sum of the genetic distances for both lineages, resulting in a relative genetic distance to IQTV (see supplementary R Script at

These relative distances are the fraction of the cumulative genetic distance of both lineages to the selected outgroup (and accordingly sum to 1). Different regions of the M segment exhibit different relative distances to the outgroup, ranging between 0.58 and 0.42 (as expected for two lineages that are roughly equidistant to the outgroup). The lines cross where one lineage becomes relatively less divergent to the outgroup, and several such events occur between the NSm and Gn reading frames, within the Gn reading frame, and the core region and head domain of the Gc reading frame (
