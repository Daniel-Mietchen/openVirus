<p>Despite a heightened interest in OROV, reflected by an increasing number of publications covering the virus in recent years (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), many aspects of OROV history, biology, and ecology remain poorly understood. Although the evolution of the virus has been previously studied using standard phylogenetic methods (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), a comprehensive analysis of the molecular evolution of OROV that incorporates the complete genetic diversity of the virus (represented by whole genomes) and a comparison of the evolutionary histories of its genome segments has not yet been undertaken. Here, we present the results of an in-depth analysis of the OROV genomes from the Americas that includes the genomes of six new OROV isolates sampled in Ecuador (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and explores the differences between the evolutionary histories of the three viral segments through comparative phylogenetics. We evaluate the temporal signal of each RNA segment, estimate their dates of origin and rates of evolution, and test for recombination and reassortment. Furthermore, we combine phylogenetic tests for natural selection on the viral genome with structural mapping and N-linked glycosylation sequon analysis to determine the factors that drive the evolution of the viral genome and explain the observed differences between segments.
