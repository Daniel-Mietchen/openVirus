<p>We explored how the evolutionary history of OROV has been shaped by molecular adaptation of different domains of the Gc protein by estimating the 
 <italic>dN</italic>/
 <italic>dS</italic> ratio (i.e., the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates) for each protein domain using the renaissance counting approach (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) implemented in BEAST 1.10.1 (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). These estimates were independently performed for the full set of M sequences and for the two previously described lineages, using an empirical posterior sample of phylogenies comprising &gt;100,000 trees. The 95% HPD credible intervals for the normalized 
 <italic>dN</italic> and 
 <italic>dS</italic> values were summarized using the 
 <italic>coda</italic> package in R (

The normalized values are the observed count of each substitution type, divided by the expected count of each substitution type under the substitution and evolutionary models and independent of the data.
