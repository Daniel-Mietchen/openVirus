<p>Before sequence alignment, the untranscribed terminal repeats of each segment were removed, and the ORF of each segment was identified (only the largest ORF of the S segment, corresponding to the N gene, was analyzed). Sequences were then aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm, as implemented in Geneious 9.0.5 (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), and the alignments were manually checked and edited to ensure they were codon aligned. The L alignment included 59 published sequences plus the six new sequences from Ecuador. The M segment alignment included 58 published sequences and the six Ecuadorian sequences. Finally, the S segment alignment included 143 published sequences plus the six Ecuadorian sequences.
