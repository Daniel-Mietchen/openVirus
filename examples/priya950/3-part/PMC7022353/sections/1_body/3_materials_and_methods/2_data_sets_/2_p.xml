<p>Additional data for the OROV sequences included the sampling date (with varying precision of year, month, or exact day, depending on the sequence), the identity of the host species (most samples were obtained from human patients, while a few were obtained from potential arthropod vectors and mammalian reservoir species), and the location of each sample (state or department of origin was used for the samples from Brazil and Peru, while only the country of origin was available for the Panama sequences; the samples from Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago were obtained from a single location). No exact sampling date is available for the Ecuadorian sequences, but sampling was conducted between the months of April and May of 2016 (Sully MÃ¡rquez, unpublished data).</p>
