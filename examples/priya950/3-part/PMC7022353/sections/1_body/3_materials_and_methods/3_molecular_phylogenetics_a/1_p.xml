<p>All three alignments were scanned for recombinant sequences using the suite of methods implemented in RDP4 (RDP, BOOTSCAN, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, 3SEQ, GENECONV, LARD, and SISCAN) (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Sequences identified as recombinant (i.e., evidence for recombination was found by at least four methods) were removed from all further analyses (only two M segment sequences were excluded). For each alignment, a molecular phylogeny was estimated using the maximum-likelihood (ML) approach implemented in RAxML 8.0 (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). ML trees were estimated using a general-time-reversible substitution model with a gamma-distribution model of among-site heterogeneity. Phylogenetic node support was assessed using a nonparametric bootstrap approach with 100 replicates. No outgroup sequences were used, and all trees were midpoint rooted. A visual comparison of the tree topologies (after collapsing some nodes to facilitate visualization) and bootstrap scores for each segment was used to evaluate possible OROV reassortment events during its evolutionary history. Well-supported topological incongruencies between trees were interpreted as a potential reassortment event between the corresponding genome segments.
