<p>Our ML and TempEst analyses (above) revealed two monophyletic lineages in the M segment phylogeny, one with a weak temporal signal (correlation coefficient = 0.66) and one with a stronger signal (correlation coefficient = 0.94; see Results and Fig. S1). These lineages were separated by long internal branches that might have unexpected effects on the estimation of evolutionary rates and the age of the root of the tree (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Therefore, the molecular clock analysis of the M segment was performed as a two-step process. First, we estimated a time-calibrated tree separately for the two M lineages and noted the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the larger lineage 1 (the very small sample size of lineage 2 means that it is unlikely to generate a robust evolutionary timescale; see results below and Fig. S4). We then performed a second analysis of the whole group M phylogeny, in which this TMCRA estimate was used as an additional calibration point (i.e., as an informative prior on the date of the common ancestor of lineage 1). Similarly, mean evolutionary rates were coestimated with phylogeny for each of the three segments using the UCLD clock model and subsequently compared. We further repeated this analysis separately for M segment lineages 1 and 2. Additional analyses using a less-realistic strict molecular clock were also performed for model comparison purposes.
