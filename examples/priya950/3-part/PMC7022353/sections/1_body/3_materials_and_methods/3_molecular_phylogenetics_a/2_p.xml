<p>To explore the rates of OROV molecular evolution and to evaluate the temporal signal in each OROV alignment, we correlated tip-to-root genetic distances in the ML tree against the sampling dates of the corresponding sequences, using the approach implemented in TempEst 1.5.1 (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The regression plots were inspected visually to identify notable outliers, and the linear correlation coefficient of the regression was used as a measure of the degree to which the sequences evolve in a clock-like manner.
