<p>We estimated the evolutionary history of OROV outbreaks in South America by constructing time-calibrated maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees for each segment. Each MCC tree summarizes a posterior distribution of phylogenies that were sampled using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach implemented in BEAST 1.10.1 (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Trees were sampled under a HKY substitution model with codon-position partitioning and a gamma-distribution model of among-site heterogeneity (this model was chosen following previously reported results [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]), a Bayesian Skyline tree prior (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), and a relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock (UCLD) (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) model. For all molecular clock analyses from this point onward, the outlier sequences identified from the tip-to-root regression plots (Fig. S1) were removed from their corresponding data sets.
