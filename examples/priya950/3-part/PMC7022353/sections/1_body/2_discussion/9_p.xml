<p>Our report incorporates new OROV genomes obtained from febrile patients in the province of Esmeraldas in northern Ecuador, representing the first direct detection and whole-genome sequencing of the virus in the country (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Previous prospective studies have suggested that OROV may circulate in both the coastal and Amazonian provinces of Ecuador (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) but failed to directly detect or isolate the virus. Our sequences probably represent an undetected outbreak of OROV on Ecuadorâ€™s northern coast, which may also include the southern coast of Colombia. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the Ecuadorian isolates form a single lineage that is closely related to viruses circulating in Peru, indicating a contiguous expansion of the known area of OROV circulation. The Ecuadorian isolates carry a distinct M segment that is shared with sequences from Peru and Panama, suggesting the presence of a divergent OROV lineage in the western, Pacific-bordering countries of South America.
