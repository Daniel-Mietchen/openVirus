<p>The N-terminal head and stem domains of the orthobunyaviral Gc spike are the only regions for which atomic structures are available (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), making structure-based mapping of sites feasible. Although little is known about the host immune response to OROV, SBV Gc has been shown to be a target of antibody-mediated immune responses following infection (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and is therefore likely to be under host selective pressure. Codons 269 and 442 (identified as evolving under positive selection) encode residues located in different domains of the Gc protein, in the first stem domain and core region, respectively. We mapped codon 269 to a loop at the N terminus of the stem domain I, which connects to the head domain. Although we cannot discount a potential role in shielding the fusion loop in the core region, crystallographic analysis and comparison of this region with other reported orthobunyavirus Gc structures suggests that this loop may act as a flexible hinge that permits fusogenic rearrangements of the spike complex (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, and in line with the hypothesis that this region is important in stabilizing the mature spike complex, an identified neutralizing antibody against SBV directly interacts with residues closer to the C terminus of the protein’s head domain, potentially disrupting Gc-mediated trimerization of the spike protein, as presented on viral particles (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A similar immunogenic mechanism could play a role in the evolution of residue G269, rendering it a potential target of the neutralizing antibody response. Of the residues that were identified as evolving under diversifying selection by the MEME approach alone, codon 145 encodes a residue that is solvent accessible and mapped to an alpha-helix in the head domain (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), specifically the tip of the trimeric spike complex. The latter site could also constitute an antibody epitope, even if the evidence for this is presently weak (only one method identifies this residue as evolving under positive selection). Furthermore, if this region includes an epitope, the acquisition of N-linked glycosylation may mask the protein surface, similar to the “glycan shields” described for Old World arenaviruses and HIV-1 (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). N-linked glycosylation that is not essential for replication but increases virus infectivity of new cells has been described in BUNV (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) and RVFV (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), suggesting that different bunyaviruses could gain and lose glycosylation sites as they evolve, as a mechanism to mask spike epitopes from the humoral immune system. Mechanisms other than immune selection might play a role. For example, mutations in the E1 protein of Chikungunya virus affect its infectivity in different vector species (A226V increases infectivity in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes albopictus</named-content> compared to 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes aegypti</named-content>) (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The geographical spread of our isolates means that OROV variation could be associated with different host or vector species in South America; however, current data are insufficient to explore this idea further.
