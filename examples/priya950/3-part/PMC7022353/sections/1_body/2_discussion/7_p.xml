<p>We also detected positive selection on codon 86 of the NSm. The function of this protein among the orthobunyaviruses is variable, ranging from being essential for viral assembly in BUNV (particularly the N-terminal hydrophobic domains) (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) to being nonessential for viral growth in OROV (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and other related pathogens such as Maguari virus (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), NSm is nonessential for viral replication (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) but plays a role in the suppression of apoptosis in infected cells (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Other potential roles for NSm in different bunyaviruses have been proposed (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), including a role in the infection of arthropod vectors (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The reason for the adaptive evolution in OROV NSm detected here is therefore unclear.
