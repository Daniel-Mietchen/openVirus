<p>Molecular clock phylogenetic analyses can be used to infer the emergence times of pathogens and the timescales of outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Some of these tools are particularly applicable to heterochronous data sets, in which sequences from rapidly evolving populations have been sampled longitudinally through time. For molecular clock analyses to be reliable, samples collected at different time points must accumulate sufficient genetic differences to be distinct from one another (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (i.e., contain sufficient “temporal signal”). A combination of factors may affect the accuracy of estimated TMRCAs. Our analyses of the S and L segments suggest that OROV first emerged in the early to mid 1900s, a more recent estimate than previously reported (late 1700s, inferred from S segment sequences) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This difference may reflect the fact that our analysis incorporates more sequences, or it may reflect differences in the evolutionary models or prior distributions used in Bayesian phylogenetic inference. It should be also noted that the aforementioned earlier study (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) did not report a test for temporal signal in the data set; the absence of this signal could affect the precision of estimates.
