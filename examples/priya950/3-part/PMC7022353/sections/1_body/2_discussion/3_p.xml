<p>A key factor of OROV evolutionary dynamics is the distinction between two well-supported lineages for the M segment. We estimate that these two lineages split more than two centuries before the estimated TMRCAs of the other segments. The split between lineages 1 and 2 is also reflected in the L segment phylogeny, where two well-supported lineages that mostly coincide with the M phylogeny are observed, with the exception of the 2009 Mazag√£o outbreak reassortant group (see
