<p>The lower evolutionary rate of the M segment is also unexpected, given the tendency of bunyaviral surface proteins to evolve faster than the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These differences are hard to reconcile with the available data, but the reliability of the temporal signal should be considered. A systematic comparison of different molecular clock approaches indicates a lineage 2-specific rate cannot be reliably estimated. We conclude that most of the temporal signal in the M segment comes from lineage 1 sequences, due to the small sample size and high uncertainty of lineage 2 rate estimates. More OROV genome sequences (especially for lineage 2) are clearly needed to provide a robust understanding of whether the molecular evolution of the two lineages truly differ.
