<p>OROV continues to be a neglected tropical disease and the numbers of genetic sequences for the virus are still limited. The genetic data that are available tend to be biased toward the shorter S segment, which has lower phylogenetic resolution and provides only a partial picture of OROV evolution. Available sequences are for the most part limited to viral diversity detected during human outbreaks and therefore fail to capture the dynamics of OROV in reservoir host species and vector populations. The generation of whole OROV genomes, for example, those generated locally using new rapid and portable sequencing technologies (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), and the broadening of sampling to other countries and host species are necessary to improve our understanding of the extent and nature of OROV transmission and the importance of reassortment for the evolution of this pathogen.
