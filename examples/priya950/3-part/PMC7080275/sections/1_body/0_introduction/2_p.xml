<p>Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue epidemiology is key for identifying reservoirs of infection, chains of transmission and quantifying the force of infection. Dengue epidemics occur intermittently, driven by climate suitability impacting mosquito density and vectorial capacity, and a sufficient non-immune population. In hyperendemic mainland regions, where the majority of the burden of disease occurs, dengue epidemiology is complexified by the co-circulation and/or rapid sequential circulation of several serotypes, large scale movement of people on daily, monthly and annual timescales, leading to a changing viral community on a changing human background. Coupled with difficulties in differentiating among DENV serotypes using serological methods and the high but variable incidence of inapparent infections, characterizing the spatio-temporal dimension of dengue epidemiology in such settings is challenging [
