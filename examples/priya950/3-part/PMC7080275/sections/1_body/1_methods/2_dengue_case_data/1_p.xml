<p>Institut Louis Malardé (ILM) is a local biomedical research institute that has been involved in arbovirus diagnostic, surveillance and research in French Polynesia since the 1960s. The ILM receives samples from medical practitioners, health centers and laboratories all over French Polynesia and has recorded dengue confirmed cases from March 1975. The geolocation of the cases only started in August 1978. From 1978 to 2014, different laboratory techniques have been used to confirm dengue cases and, whenever possible, identify the serotype involved: inhibition of haemagglutination assay (1975–1988); intrathoracic inoculation of mosquitoes with the serum from suspected cases (1979–1980); isolation of DENV on C6/36 mosquito cell culture (1984–2005); IgM ELISA (from 1986); Reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (since 2000); NS1 antigen ELISA (from 2006).</p>
