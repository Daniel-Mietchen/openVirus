 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This seems likely to be occurring to some extent in French Polynesia, but limited to the most inhabited islands. Inter-connectedness of islands does seem to enable dispersal of the virus throughout the territory, but with low probability of a subsequent epidemic occurring in the outlying islands. The long-term persistence of DENV during inter-epidemic periods is remarkable and suggests that the within-island scale needs to be addressed as the foci of infection are likely to be very spatially limited. The impact of inapparent infections is likely to be non-negligible and sero-surveys across the subdivisions would reveal the extent to which herd immunity rather than stochastic viral die-out tempers the progression of epidemic viral transmission.
