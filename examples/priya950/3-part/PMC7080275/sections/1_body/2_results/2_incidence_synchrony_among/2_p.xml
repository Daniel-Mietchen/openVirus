<p>We then performed cross-correlation analyses firstly for all islands within each subdivision with the “capital” island of the subdivision and then all islands with Tahiti. Capital islands of each subdivision are defined as those being both highly inhabited and most connected to the other islands by air and boat. Individuals can island hop but their specific place of departure is not known, thus islands may be indirectly connected to Tahiti (or other capital islands). There was a significant cross-correlation with zero month lag for nine islands. Five islands showed no significant temporal association, three showed association with a positive lag (later than Tahiti) and three islands had a negative lag association. Notably Bora Bora and Tahaa precede Tahiti by two months. Cross-correlations within each of the other four subdivisions using the major island of each subdivision as the lead island yielded improved correlation (increased χ
 <sup>2</sup>). Overall, when significant, most cross-correlations were either at zero lag or negative lag, suggesting that the smaller islands are synchronised with or leading the”capital” island within each archipelago (
