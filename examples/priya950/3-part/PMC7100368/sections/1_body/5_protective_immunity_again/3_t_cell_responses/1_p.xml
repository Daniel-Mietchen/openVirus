<p>Aside from the double-edged antibody responses, DENV and ZIKV infections also elicit strong T cell responses of dubious functions. For a long time, T cells activated during dengue virus infection was postulated to cause pathology through producing cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, which in some models directly increases vascular permeability (

In mouse models, DENV-specific CD8 + T cell responses were protective and essential for virus clearance during primary infection; and CD4 + T cell responses elicited after peptide vaccination also contributed to protection, although they seemed to be dispensable for virus clearance in primary infection (

 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Rivino et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>), whereas human CD4 + T cell epitopes are mainly located on C, NS3, and NS5 viral proteins (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Weiskopf et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Grifoni et al., 2017a</xref>). In some studies, DENV-3 specific CD8 + T cell responses were found to target both structural and non-structural proteins (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Weiskopf et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). Of note, all these observations were based on limited sample size and HLA types, and of unknown sequences of heterotypic infections when the subjects had experience secondary infections. These uncertainty in clinical studies might have not revealed the full scope of T cell responses toward conserved epitopes.
