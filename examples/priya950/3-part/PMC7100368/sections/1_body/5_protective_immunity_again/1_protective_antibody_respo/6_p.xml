<p>Other than antibodies to envelope proteins, there are abundant prM specific antibodies in human sera after dengue virus infection (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>). However, such antibodies are poorly neutralizing with high cross-reactivity, and induces ADE in a wide range of concentrations, probably because prM antibodies facilitate non-infectious immature virus to become mature and infectious (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010</xref>). In experimental models, immature viral particles may achieve infectivity with the help of antibody against “pr” upon entering the acidic endosome, where the “pr” peptide is cleaved together with the antibody by Furin. Even partially mature viruses that keeping pr peptides in some region on viral surface, can also obtain enhanced infection in Fcγ receptor bearing cells with the help of anti-pr antibodies (

 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Wirawan et al., 2019</xref>). Because of these reasons, prM antibody is now thought to be undesirable among vaccine induced immune responses.
