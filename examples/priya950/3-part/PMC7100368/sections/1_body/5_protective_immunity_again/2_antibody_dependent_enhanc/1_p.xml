<p>One adverse characteristic of flavivirus prM or E antibodies is their ability to induce ADE. When the concentration or affinity of antibodies is too low to neutralize virus infection, the immune complexes formed by virus and antibodies tend to interact with Fcγ receptors on myeloid cell surface through Fc domains of antibodies, they do not induce Fcγ-mediated viral clearance, but aid virus infection by directly increasing virus uptake through Fcγ receptor, or boosting virus replication intracellularly via activating downstream pathway to antagonize the innate immunity (

In the latter case, it is hypothesized that legation of Fcγ receptor transmits signals through spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and subsequently enhances the transcription of genes including IL-10, which antagonizes type-I IFN pathway through stimulating members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCs) (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have already demonstrated that most antibodies to DENV or ZIKV prM and E proteins have the potential to enhance viral infections at sub-neutralizing concentrations, irrespective of their neutralization potency (
