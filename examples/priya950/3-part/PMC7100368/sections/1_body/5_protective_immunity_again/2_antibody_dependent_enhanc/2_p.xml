<p>In addition to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using human samples, ADE of heterotypic DENV infection has been more stringently demonstrated in mouse models. Administering heterotypic DENV immune sera or viral-specific monoclonal antibodies to AG129 immune deficient mice prior to infection with non-lethal dose of DENV-2 increased viral replication and enhanced disease severity; and increased infection of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were observed for all four serotypes of clinical isolates (

Further, the increased risk of hospitalization in younger children vaccinated with CYD-TDV in Phase III clinical trials are also suspected to have been caused by ADE, as a result of vaccine-induced poorly neutralizing antibodies. More recently, a long-term study on a Nicaragua pediatric cohort showed that the risk of severe dengue diseases was highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers, affirming antibody concentration is a critical determinant of ADE (
