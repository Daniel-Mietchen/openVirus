<p>The development of inactivated Zika vaccine was started soon after the ZIKV outbreaks. There are currently two purified inactivated Zika vaccine candidates in Phase I clinical trials, they were developed by WRAIR/NIAID/Harvard University/Sanofi Pasteur (ZPIV) and Valneva Australia GmbH (VLA1601) separately. Inactivated vaccine has the advantages of easy manufacture, established platforms based on many other vaccines, such as those for Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Polio viruses, have been developed. According to preliminary results of the WRAIR/NIAID vaccine (ZPIV) in three Phase I trials, the formalin-inactivated virus vaccine induced 95% seroconversion, had a peak neutralization antibody GMT of 286, with only moderate adverse effect. Adoptive transfer of human IgG from vaccine recipients to mice prior to challenge with ZIKV led to reduced viremia in mice, indicating its potential for protection in humans (
