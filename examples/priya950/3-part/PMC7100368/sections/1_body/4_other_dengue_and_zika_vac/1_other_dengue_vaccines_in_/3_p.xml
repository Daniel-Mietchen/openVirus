<p>A second tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine candidate is LAVDelta30 (TV003/TV005), invented by US NIAID and under co-development with Butantan Institute. This vaccine is comprised of attenuated DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4 viruses that contain a 30-nucleotide deletion or additional 31-nucleotide deletion in 3â€² UTR regions (rDEN1delta30, rDEN3delta30/31, rDEN4delta30) (

In completed trials and released results, this vaccine was reported to produce neutralizing antibodies and multi-type specific T cell responses in both seronegative and seropositive recipients, although GMTs of neutralizing antibody in seropositive recipients are always higher than those in seronegatives (
