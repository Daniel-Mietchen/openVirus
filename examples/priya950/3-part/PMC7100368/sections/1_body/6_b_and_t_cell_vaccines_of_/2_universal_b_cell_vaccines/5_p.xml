<p>In summary, through enriching conserved epitopes and selectively presenting broadly neutralizing epitopes, we should be able to construct a universal dengue and Zika B cell vaccine. Furthermore, with suitable heterologous vaccines in prime-and-boost regimens, we might have a chance to achieve the induction of potent, broadly reactive, and protective B cell immune responses that have limited ADE effect.</p>
