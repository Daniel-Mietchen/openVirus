<p>Previous investigation on dengue and Zika vaccine mainly focused on the B cell immunity, aiming to elicit enough neutralizing antibodies for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protection. Because of the complex interaction among antibody responses to four DENV serotypes and ZIKV, an ideal dengue vaccine should elicit long-lasting, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies to each serotype of virus or broadly neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with all serotypes of viruses. Zika vaccines developed independently need to be able to trigger autologous neutralizing antibodies but minimal cross-reactivity with dengue viruses. Alternatively, pentavalent vaccines would be necessary, if ADE cross sero-complex is verified in epidemiological studies in the future. However, to induce long-term B cell memory response that sustains potent neutralization is not easy, and to produce adequate and relatively balanced neutralizing antibodies against each of these viruses is also difficult. The following approaches may be considered.
