<p>Live attenuated vaccine has an advantage on eliciting T cell responses. TAK-003 and TV003 containing non-structural proteins of DENV have been shown to elicit both antibody responses and T cell responses. However, to avoid ADE, a flavivirus T cell vaccine without cell surface epitopes is obviously more suitable for the proof-of-concept study. To accomplish this goal, many factors affecting the immunogenicity of T cell antigens should be considered. First, immunogens activating two main subsets of T cells have to be delivered in different ways. CD4 + T cell epitopes are mainly presented through an exogenous antigen presentation pathway, whereas CD8 + T cell epitopes are presented more efficiently through an endogenous antigen presentation pathway (

Second, immune dominance of T cell epitopes might be affected by epitope composition of vaccines, and will also be influenced by prior flavivirus infection. How to induce protective T cell immunity toward four serotypes of DENV and ZIKV simultaneously, and whether cross-reactive T cell responses could be induced through heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy, are all questions that have to be addressed during flavivirus T cell vaccine development. Finally, to achieve sterilizing immunity against viruses is extremely hard through T cell vaccine alone, as the effector T cells are only activated by processed immunogens and only target infected cells bearing linear epitopes on surface, both of which happen after cells were infected.
