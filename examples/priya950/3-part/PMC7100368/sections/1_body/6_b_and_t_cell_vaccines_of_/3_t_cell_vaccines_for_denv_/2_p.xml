<p>Distinct from B cell epitopes, T cell epitopes are linear, continuous and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen (human leukocyte antigen, HLA, in humans) restricted. Some HLA-linked protective epitopes have already been identified for DENV and ZIKV, it is worthwhile to study epitope distribution for more HLA allotypes. This can be initiated through predictive computational algorithms according to parameters such as MHC affinity, and followed by experimental verification (

Dominant epitopes from different proteins of different viruses presented by various HLA allotypes can also be integrated into a polypeptide string, which can be made into immunogens to elicit protective T cell immunity in a large population, just as what has been done for HIV CD4 + T cell vaccine (
