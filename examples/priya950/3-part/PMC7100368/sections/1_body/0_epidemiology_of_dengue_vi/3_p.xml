<p>In comparison, Zika virus emerged more recently as a public health concern. The historical documents of Zika virus started as its first isolation from a monkey in Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Dick et al., 1952</xref>). In the following decades, only a few sporadic outbreaks were reported in Africa and South Asia, the number of cases during each outbreak never exceeded a few dozen before 2007 (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Grard et al., 2014</xref>). Symptoms of ZIKV infection including fever, arthralgia, rash and conjunctivitis were presented in patients during the early outbreaks, although 50–80% infections were asymptomatic (

Fundamental epidemic and clinical changes of the disease first appeared in an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, when 28,000 people were infected, and Guillain-Barre syndrome was observed for the first time to be associated with Zika virus infection, implicating the neurotropic feature of Zika virus (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Musso et al., 2018</xref>); additionally, detection of viral RNA in semen and urine were also documented during this outbreak. Nevertheless, the threat of Zika virus was not recognized until 2015–2016 when it caused much larger outbreaks in South America, most pronounced in Brazil (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al., 2015</xref>). In this outbreak, 40% notified Brazilian cases were from northeast region of Brazil (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2017</xref>), where Zika virus infected 63% peoples in Salvador. The virus spread to most countries in Americas (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Netto et al., 2017</xref>), and then further expanded into a pandemic with several outbreaks in South Asia and pacific islands (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Baud et al., 2017</xref>). In Europe, travel-associated ZIKV cases were reported in most EU (European Union) countries during 2015–2016, with the largest number of cases in France, and largest percentage related to the Caribbean (
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Spiteri et al., 2017</xref>). During the Brazil outbreak, ZIKV has been suspected to persistently replicate in multiple organs for months, and confirmed to be capable of sexual and vertical transmission; and found to be associated with increased ratios of microcephaly and congenital diseases in newborn babies (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2016</xref>). Soon after, the association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly was confirmed by extensive studies in mice (

 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">Vermillion et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">Szaba et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication of ZIKV in neuron, placenta and fetus was also verified by using autopsy samples (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Martines et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>). Since early 2016, WHO has declared Zika virus disease as a public health emergency of global concern.
