<p>Dengue viruses are antigenically classified into four serotypes that originate from one ancestor phylogenetically and cause common pathologies in human. Infection by any serotype of dengue virus can be either symptomatic (∼25%) or not (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">St John and Rathore, 2019</xref>). The majority of symptomatic infection only develop self-limited febrile illness with manifestations of high fever, facial flushing, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, vomiting, epistaxis, or gum bleeding. Febrile phase lasts 2–7 days, during which viremia and plasma NS1 can be detected in the initial 1–4 days. Only a small percentage of the symptomatic patients (mostly children) progress to more severe forms of dengue disease, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), in which plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations occur; meanwhile, leukopenia, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia can be detected by laboratory tests. Severe plasma leakage that leads to metabolic acidosis and shock with occasional organ impairment is fetal without proper treatment (

Immune responses induced during infection by one serotype of dengue virus can confer life-long protection against homotypic viruses and provide cross-protection toward heterotypic viruses for short-term. Strikingly, such cross-reactivities have the potential to enhance disease severity of a secondary heterotypic infection, probably through a mechanism called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Consistently, increased risk of DHF/DSS has been observed for secondary dengue virus infections in some epidemiological studies (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Katzelnick et al., 2017</xref>). Dengue like disease has been a public health problem for over two centuries. In 1780, Benjamin Rush recorded in Philadelphia an epidemic of bilious remitting fever, which is now considered as one of the earliest descriptions of dengue like diseases in America (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Rush, 1951</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Packard, 2016</xref>). In the following decades, such outbreaks appeared throughout Atlantic World. The name “dengue virus” appeared in the Caribbean in 1820s, it might have derived from Swahili “
 <italic>Ka-dinga-pepo</italic>” or Spanish “
 <italic>denguero</italic>,” meaning seizures caused by an evil spirit or referring to the special gait, to describe the agonizing status after infection (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barnett, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, whether all of these early epidemics were caused by dengue virus rather than another clinically similar arbovirus, chikungunya virus, was uncertain, as disease of these outbreaks was often named as “break bone fever” and some were described as rheumatic diseases (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Carey, 1971</xref>). Although it is unclear when dengue virus was first introduced to Asia, as sylvatic strains of DENV-1 (strain P72-1244), -2 (strain P8-1407), -4 (strain P73-1120 and P75-514, P75-215) were isolated from sentinel monkeys or 
 <italic>A. niveus</italic> mosquitoes in the rainforest of Malaysia, and the existence of sylvatic DENV-3 is supported indirectly by monkey seroconversion against DENV-3 in Malaysia, it is suggested that the four serotype viruses evolved independently in the rainforests of southeast Asia based on the phylogenic analysis (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Twiddy, 2003</xref>). The huge troop deployments during the Second World War might have also exacerbated the spread of dengue viruses in Asia (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 2002</xref>). Since the beginning of twentieth century, due to the increased urbanization and lacking control of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, all four serotypes of dengue viruses have been found in South Asia, causing endemics each year. Similarly, multiple serotypes of dengue virus were circulating in tropical and sub-tropical regions of America after 1950s, leading to regular outbreaks in these regions (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 1987</xref>). Coincide with this, increased DHF and DSS cases were reported in different outbreaks after World War II (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 1966</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 1966</xref>). Now, the four serotype viruses are co-circulating in all endemic regions (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie et al., 2004</xref>), and estimated to infect 390 million people, causing 10,000 death, and 96 million symptomatic infections in 128 countries each year (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Roughly, the world population live under the threat of dengue disease is recently predicted to increase to over 60% by 2080 (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2019</xref>). Although modern era of dengue research has begun since Sabin and his colleagues first isolated the virus in 1944 (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Sabin, 1952</xref>), the dissemination of dengue viruses are still continuing, as no antiviral drugs are available and the only licensed vaccine is far from satisfactory.
