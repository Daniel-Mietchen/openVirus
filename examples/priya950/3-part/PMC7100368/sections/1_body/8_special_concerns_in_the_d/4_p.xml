<p>To fulfill the criteria above, ZIKV vaccine strategy should also be modified, since the characteristics and type of protective immune responses in different organs are not the same. For example, the access of T cells to maternal-fetal interface was limited during pregnancy (

It has been found that weaker T cell responses were elicited by a live attenuated ZIKV vaccine during pregnancy, comparing to that in non-pregnant mice. In addition, higher neutralizing antibody titers were required to protect pregnant mice and block vertical transmission of ZIKV (

In another study, it is observed that CD4 + T cell mediated antibody response, but not CD8 + T cells, was essential for viral clearance in intravaginal infection model. Though further investigations are necessary, this might imply the importance of CD4 + T cell immunity in blocking sexual transmission, which should also be considered during vaccine design (
