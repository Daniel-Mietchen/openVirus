<p>The precursor of M protein, prM, shields fusion peptide of E protein from acidic environment in trans-Golgi apparatus through its globular “pr” domain when newly budded virus particles transit through exocytosis pathway and thus prevents virus from fusing with Golgi apparatus prematurely. After that, the “pr” peptide is cleaved by a proprotein convertase, Furin, in Golgi apparatus and it dissociates from virus surface once particle reaches extracellular space (

However, not only fully mature viral particles are produced during viral culture, partially mature or immature virions can also be detected in the supernatant. The immature viruses are those whose pr peptides were not fully proteolytic cleaved from all M proteins on surface. Functionally, in contrast to the mature virus, the immature DENV and ZIKV are non-infectious, however, such immature virus particle can also infect FcγR bearing cells after being bound by antibodies specific for “pr” peptides (
