<p>Besides structural proteins incorporated into viral particles, another membrane associated glycoprotein NS1 can also be secreted extracellularly as hexamers, and detected in blood during acute infection. The NS1 protein can cause pathology in humans through either altering endothelial permeability or inducing antibodies that cross-react with host endothelial proteins; it can also facilitate viral transmission in mosquitoes through antagonizing mosquito innate immunity via suppressing the expression of immune-related genes involved in ROS and JAK/STAT pathways (
