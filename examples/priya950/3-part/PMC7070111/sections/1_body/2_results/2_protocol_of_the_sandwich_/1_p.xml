<p id="Par17">First, 96-well polystyrene plates were precoated with H3-positive polyclonal serum (1:160 dilution) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked with 5% skim milk at 37 °C for 1 h. Antigen samples were distributed into each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mAb 9F12 was then diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA and added to the plates, which were again incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was diluted to 1:1000 with 1% BSA and added to the plates before incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After each incubation and before adding a new reagent, the plate wells were washed three times using PBST to remove unbound reagent. The plates were thoroughly washed, and 100 μL of a TMB substrate solution was added. Following incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 min, the chromogenic reaction was quenched with 50 μL of 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> values were measured using an ELISA plate reader.
