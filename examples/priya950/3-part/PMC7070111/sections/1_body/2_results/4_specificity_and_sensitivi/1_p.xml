<p id="Par19">H3 isolates were subjected to this ELISA, and the results were all positive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). H1–H2, H4–H16, NDV, ARV, EDS, FAdV4 and IBV were also assayed by the sandwich ELISA, and the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> values were all less than the cutoff value; thus, the samples were considered negative (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Each sample was assayed three times under the same conditions on different days, and the replicate analyses produced very similar results.
