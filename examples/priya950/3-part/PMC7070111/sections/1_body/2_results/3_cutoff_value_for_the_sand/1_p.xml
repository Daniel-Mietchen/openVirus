<p id="Par18">To determine the cutoff value for the sandwich ELISA, 60 H3-free samples, including chicken cloacal swab samples and tissue samples, were tested. The average (X) OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> was 0.1297, the SD was 0.0415, and the X + 3SD was 0.2542. For an OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> ≥ 0.2542, the sample was determined to be positive; for an OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> &lt; 0.2542, the sample was determined to be negative.
