<p id="Par3">The H3 influenza A virus plays unique roles in different hosts. Avian species are primary reservoirs of influenza A virus and can harbor viruses with significant pandemic potential. AIV is a pathogen of economic significance to the poultry industry, and the H3-subtype AIV plays an important role in the emergence of zoonotic infections. Some avian-origin H3N2 viruses transmitted to dogs in South Korea cause acute respiratory disease (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). H3N2-subtype AIV originating in ducks has been found to acquire the potential to infect humans after multiple infections in a pig population (Shichinohe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). Reassortment may occur between H3N2 and other influenza virus subtypes, and an H3N2 isolate containing genes from H7N3 and H7N7 has been found to show the highest sequence homology to the H7N9 virus (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). H3N2-subtype AIV poses a clear threat to human health, and ongoing surveillance of H3N2-subtype AIV in birds is warranted (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>); thus, we think it is critical to develop an antibody and diagnostic reagent for H3-subtype AIV. In our study, we produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against H3-subtype AIV and developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the detection of this subtype.
