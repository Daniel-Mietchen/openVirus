<p id="Par2">Influenza A virus, a member of the genus 
 <italic>Orthomyxovirus</italic>, is classified into different H and N subtypes according to differences in two major antigen genes, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The primary reservoirs of influenza A virus are waterfowl and shorebirds (Oshansky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). The H1–H16 and N1–N9 subtypes have been identified in poultry and wild birds, while H17–H18 and N10–N11 have recently been discovered in bats (Tong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). The H3 influenza A virus is an important subtype that has distinct significance for public health. This subtype has a wide range of hosts, infects mainly avian species and spreads directly to humans across interspecies barriers, circulating in swine, canines, equines, and felines and causing sporadic outbreaks in sea mammals (Bailey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). The H3 influenza A virus has different infection characteristics in different hosts. In poultry, H3-subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), the most ubiquitous HA subtype, is frequently isolated from live bird markets (LBMs) in China (Luo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). In humans, the pandemic virus A/Hong Kong/1968(H3N2) became endemic after the first year post emergence, and it has since caused yearly seasonal epidemics (Bailey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). In swine, the H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes are largely responsible for annual outbreaks of swine influenza (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). In addition, the avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus emerged in dogs in China or Korea in approximately 2005 and has since become an enzootic virus in Southeast Asia and the United States, causing occasional epizootics (He et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). The H3N8 equine influenza virus was first isolated from horses in Miami, Florida, in 1963 (Kitchen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1963</xref>). Currently, it is the only subtype affecting equine populations worldwide and has serious implications for public health (Alves Beuttemmuller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Sreenivasan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). In addition, an H3N8 influenza virus carrying mammalian adaptation mutations has been isolated from seals (Solorzano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>).
