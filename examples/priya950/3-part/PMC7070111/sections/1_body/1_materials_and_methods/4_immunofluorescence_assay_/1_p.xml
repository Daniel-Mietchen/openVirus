<p id="Par9">MDCK cells cultured in 48-well plates were inoculated with the strain 112D4(H3) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h. In addition, MDCK cells were inoculated with PBS as mock-infected controls. Following infection, viral growth medium consisting of fresh DMEM with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 µg/ml tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin and penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 µg/mL) was added, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h. The infected cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 20 min at room temperature. After washing the cells three times with PBS, blocking buffer was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then gently washed with PBS, the hybridoma culture supernatant or diluted murine ascetic fluid was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were again washed, and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, USA) was added at a dilution of 1:1000. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed again and observed by fluorescence microscopy.
