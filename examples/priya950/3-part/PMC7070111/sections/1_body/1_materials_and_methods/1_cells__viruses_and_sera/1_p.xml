<p id="Par5">The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and mouse myeloma (SP2/0) cell lines were purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC). The two cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) and penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 µg/mL). The H3-subtype AIV strains and other viruses used in this study are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Viral stocks were grown in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs or in MDCK cells, as stated in the text. Polyclonal sera were obtained from H3-positive and H3-negative SPF chickens.
