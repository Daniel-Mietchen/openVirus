<p id="Par14">A total of 180 swab samples (oral pharyngeal and cloacal swabs from the same bird were pooled as a single sample) were obtained as part of the AIV surveillance program in LBMs in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, from 2018 to 2019. The swab solutions were tested with the developed H3-subtype AIV sandwich ELISA method. In parallel, 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with the swab solutions for viral isolation, and allantoic fluid was collected and analyzed by HI test, also amplified with conventional RT-PCR followed by HA and NA amplicon sequencing.</p>
