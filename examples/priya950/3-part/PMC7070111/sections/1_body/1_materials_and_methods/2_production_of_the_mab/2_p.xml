<p id="Par7">Spleen cells were harvested from the immunized mice. SP2/0 cells and spleen cells were fused at a ratio of 1:5 with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. The treated cells were suspended in HAT (RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FBS, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mM hypoxanthine, 16 mM thymidine, and 400 mM aminopterin) and plated into 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in 200 µL of medium. After cultivation at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 9 days, 12 days, and 15 days, the medium was assayed for H3-subtype AIV-specific antibodies by HI test. Positive hybridoma cells with high antibody titers were subcloned three times. The broad-spectrum activity and specificity of the hybridoma cells were assessed with purified AIV (H1–H16 subtypes), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) by HI test. Finally, we chose a high-titer antibody and specific hybridoma cells for subsequent research. The selected hybridoma cells were inoculated into BALB/c mice, and ascetic fluid was purified by saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS) precipitation as described previously (Darcy et al.
