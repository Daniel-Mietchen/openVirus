<p id="Par6">The strain A/Duck/Guangxi/112D4/2012(H3N2) was chosen as an immunogen for preparation of the H3 mAb. The impurities were removed via low-speed centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min, and then the viral supernatant was further purified by ultracentrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 90 min. The viral particle pellet was resuspended using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight and finely purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation through a 10%/50% sucrose cushion. To inactivate the H3 virus, β-propiolactone was added, and the virus was incubated at 4 °C for 16-24 h. Successful inactivation was confirmed by a lack of growth under chick embryo propagation. Six-week-old female SPF BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously at multiple sites with an emulsion of the inactive H3 virus with an equal amount of Freund’s complete adjuvant. At 21 days and 35 days after the first injection, the second and third immunizations, respectively, were performed with the same antigen and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. At 49 days after the first injection, the antibody titers against H3-subtype AIV in the mice were detected by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. BALB/c mice with high antibody titers were selected, and immunity was boosted by intraperitoneal inoculation of the antigen without adjuvant 3 days before cell fusion.</p>
