<p id="Par23">In recent years, the use of gene expression or virus-like particles to produce antigens by genetic recombination has yielded antigens with increased purity and concentrations and has enabled long-lasting humoral immunity and cross-protection to be achieved. In our study, direct inoculation of mice with inactive virus kept the epitopes intact and preserved the natural spatial structure of the antigen, thus yielding an antigen that may be superior to those produced by gene expression. It is very likely that a protein does not fully recover its original stereoscopic conformation during the process of protein renaturation. Thus, we attempted to use inactive whole virus to prepare and produce the H3 mAb. Whole viruses have widely been used as immunogens for the production of mAbs to develop ELISAs for the diagnosis of disease (Chen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>). The HA glycoprotein, the major surface protein of influenza A virus, plays a critical role in viral infection and is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies (Ito et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). In our study, the mAb was screened by HI assay; thus, the mAb 9F12 was determined to recognize the HA of H3-subtype AIV. The Western blot and IFA results revealed that the mAb 9F12 specifically bound to the H3 virus with effective reactivity. In an analysis of 180 clinical samples, the detection results of this sandwich ELISA were consistent with those of gold standard methods for isolation and identification, but further analysis of more clinical samples is needed to validate this method and extend its use to the routine diagnostic epidemiological detection of H3-subtype AIV infection.
