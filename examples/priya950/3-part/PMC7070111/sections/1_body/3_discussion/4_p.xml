<p id="Par25">The sandwich ELISA included mainly the following five components: a polyclonal antibody, a sample, an mAb, a conjugated HRP antibody, and a substrate. The ELISA plate was coated with polyclonal antibody serum, and the antigen sample was added. If the sample had H3-subtype AIV, it combined with the polyclonal antibody to form an antigenâ€“antibody complex. After this step, the wells were rinsed with PBST to remove unbound components. The H3 mAb was then added and reacted with the antigen in the complex, binding to the ELISA plate. An HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was added to interact with the mAb. The results were determined qualitatively by a color change and quantitatively by the reaction of the TMB substrate, as measured by an ELISA reader. This ELISA allowed samples to first react with the polyclonal antibody and then react with the mAb. The mAb recognized a single antigen epitope. The specificity of the mAb was better than that of the polyclonal antibody, but the binding range was not as wide as that of the polyclonal antibody. The initial combination of clinical samples with polyclonal antibodies for preliminary screening and the subsequent reaction of the samples with the mAb increased the detection rate and prevented false negatives.</p>
