<p id="Par26">The hybridoma cells producing H3-subtype AIV prepared in this study can steadily secrete homogeneous and high-titer antibodies and provide a very useful mAb for further research on H3-subtype AIV. In addition, the sandwich ELISA method is time saving, convenient, highly specific, sensitive and repeatable. Furthermore, the method can produce results without a specific instrument or the need for professional technical staff; it is performed according to a simple protocol and provides an effective method for the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV. </p>
