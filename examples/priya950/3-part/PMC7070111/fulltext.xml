First, we have produced the essential reagent of mAb against AIV H3 strains with the development of an mAb-Mouse immunization with a purified H3-subtype AIV strain and cell fusion to generate hybridoma cells. These cells were screened with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and optimal cells were subcloned. We chose a hybridoma cell line that steadily secreted a specific H3-subtype AIV mAb, designated 9F12, that belongs to the IgG1 subclass and has a K-type light chain. 9F12 was shown to bind specifically to the H3-subtype AIV antigen by both immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Finally, a 9F12-based sandwich ELISA was successfully developed and used to specifically test for this antigen. The sandwich ELISA conditions were optimized, and the specificity and sensitivity were validated. The results for clinical sample detection were consistent with viral isolation. Consequently, the 9F12-based sandwich ELISA is a specific, sensitive, robust, rapid and versatile diagnostic tool for H3-subtype AIV and provides a promising strategy for effective influenza virus prevention and control.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>H3 subtype</kwd><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>ELISA</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Influenza A virus, a member of the genus <italic>Orthomyxovirus</italic>, is classified into different H and N subtypes according to differences in two major antigen genes, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The primary reservoirs of influenza A virus are waterfowl and shorebirds (Oshansky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). The H1&#x02013;H16 and N1&#x02013;N9 subtypes have been identified in poultry and wild birds, while H17&#x02013;H18 and N10&#x02013;N11 have recently been discovered in bats (Tong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). The H3 influenza A virus is an important subtype that has distinct significance for public health. This subtype has a wide range of hosts, infects mainly avian species and spreads directly to humans across interspecies barriers, circulating in swine, canines, equines, and felines and causing sporadic outbreaks in sea mammals (Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). The H3 influenza A virus has different infection characteristics in different hosts. In poultry, H3-subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), the most ubiquitous HA subtype, is frequently isolated from live bird markets (LBMs) in China (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). In humans, the pandemic virus A/Hong Kong/1968(H3N2) became endemic after the first year post emergence, and it has since caused yearly seasonal epidemics (Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). In swine, the H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes are largely responsible for annual outbreaks of swine influenza (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). In addition, the avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus emerged in dogs in China or Korea in approximately 2005 and has since become an enzootic virus in Southeast Asia and the United States, causing occasional epizootics (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). The H3N8 equine influenza virus was first isolated from horses in Miami, Florida, in 1963 (Kitchen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1963</xref>). Currently, it is the only subtype affecting equine populations worldwide and has serious implications for public health (Alves Beuttemmuller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Sreenivasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). In addition, an H3N8 influenza virus carrying mammalian adaptation mutations has been isolated from seals (Solorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The H3 influenza A virus plays unique roles in different hosts. Avian species are primary reservoirs of influenza A virus and can harbor viruses with significant pandemic potential. AIV is a pathogen of economic significance to the poultry industry, and the H3-subtype AIV plays an important role in the emergence of zoonotic infections. Some avian-origin H3N2 viruses transmitted to dogs in South Korea cause acute respiratory disease (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). H3N2-subtype AIV originating in ducks has been found to acquire the potential to infect humans after multiple infections in a pig population (Shichinohe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). Reassortment may occur between H3N2 and other influenza virus subtypes, and an H3N2 isolate containing genes from H7N3 and H7N7 has been found to show the highest sequence homology to the H7N9 virus (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). H3N2-subtype AIV poses a clear threat to human health, and ongoing surveillance of H3N2-subtype AIV in birds is warranted (Guan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>); thus, we think it is critical to develop an antibody and diagnostic reagent for H3-subtype AIV. In our study, we produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against H3-subtype AIV and developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the detection of this subtype.</p><p id="Par4">The traditional diagnostic method for H3-subtype AIV involves viral isolation and identification. These techniques are time consuming and tedious, require biosafety facilities and exhibit some limitations in practical application. Currently, detection methods for H3-subtype AIV are urgently needed as technical reserves, and mAbs and sandwich ELISA methods based on mAbs against H3-subtype AIV have rarely been reported. mAbs have a single epitope, display high specificity and have been widely adopted for medical examination. ELISA is highly suitable for epidemiological analyses involving a large number of samples, and sandwich ELISA methods based on mAbs have been developed for other pathogens (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>). This study had two purposes. First, we sought to produce an mAb against H3-subtype AIV in hybridoma cells and characterize its reactivity. Second, we sought to develop a sandwich ELISA method based on the mAb that could be used as an effective tool for the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells, viruses and sera</title><p id="Par5">The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and mouse myeloma (SP2/0) cell lines were purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC).

It is important to enhance surveillance for H3-subtype AIV, and a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and effective detection method suitable for mass detection is urgently needed. Some molecular methods for the detection of H3-subtype AIV have been developed. Thus far, several reports have described the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV using RT-LAMP, real-time RT-PCR and multiplex RT-PCR (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>; Teng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). However, serological detection methods for H3-subtype AIV have rarely been reported. Routine monitoring of H3-subtype AIV frequently involves large numbers of samples; notably, the developed ELISA method, which is performed with a 96-well plate, can be used to simultaneously analyze 94 samples in addition to the positive and negative control samples.</p><p id="Par23">In recent years, the use of gene expression or virus-like particles to produce antigens by genetic recombination has yielded antigens with increased purity and concentrations and has enabled long-lasting humoral immunity and cross-protection to be achieved. In our study, direct inoculation of mice with inactive virus kept the epitopes intact and preserved the natural spatial structure of the antigen, thus yielding an antigen that may be superior to those produced by gene expression. It is very likely that a protein does not fully recover its original stereoscopic conformation during the process of protein renaturation. Thus, we attempted to use inactive whole virus to prepare and produce the H3 mAb. Whole viruses have widely been used as immunogens for the production of mAbs to develop ELISAs for the diagnosis of disease (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>). The HA glycoprotein, the major surface protein of influenza A virus, plays a critical role in viral infection and is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies (Ito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). In our study, the mAb was screened by HI assay; thus, the mAb 9F12 was determined to recognize the HA of H3-subtype AIV. The Western blot and IFA results revealed that the mAb 9F12 specifically bound to the H3 virus with effective reactivity. In an analysis of 180 clinical samples, the detection results of this sandwich ELISA were consistent with those of gold standard methods for isolation and identification, but further analysis of more clinical samples is needed to validate this method and extend its use to the routine diagnostic epidemiological detection of H3-subtype AIV infection.</p><p id="Par24">BALB/c mice were inoculated with an inactive local epidemic strain of H3-subtype AIV, and hybridoma cells that could steadily secrete a high titer of antibody specific for H3-subtype AIV was obtained through a series of cell fusion screening, HI testing and subcloning steps. The mAb obtained from the resulting hybridoma cells had good specificity and sensitivity. The successful production of this mAb raised three key points. (1) For immunized mice, a higher antibody titer is associated with a higher success rate. If the antibody titer is low, the levels of corresponding specific antibodies in spleen cells are reduced, leading to a lack of a specific and high-titer mAb in the process of cell fusion. (2) PEG was used for cell fusion and was added within 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;min. In addition, attention was paid to the formation of particles. Once particles appear, the remaining PEG must be quickly added. The time of PEG addition must be controlled to avoid excessive fusion. (3) Myeloma cell activity must be ensured because cell morphology is not fully intact, and poor refraction will affect cell fusion, resulting in cell death. In this study, the preparation of the mAb laid a foundation for the establishment of a sandwich ELISA for the detection of H3-subtype AIV.</p><p id="Par25">The sandwich ELISA included mainly the following five components: a polyclonal antibody, a sample, an mAb, a conjugated HRP antibody, and a substrate. The ELISA plate was coated with polyclonal antibody serum, and the antigen sample was added. If the sample had H3-subtype AIV, it combined with the polyclonal antibody to form an antigen&#x02013;antibody complex. After this step, the wells were rinsed with PBST to remove unbound components. The H3 mAb was then added and reacted with the antigen in the complex, binding to the ELISA plate. An HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was added to interact with the mAb. The results were determined qualitatively by a color change and quantitatively by the reaction of the TMB substrate, as measured by an ELISA reader. This ELISA allowed samples to first react with the polyclonal antibody and then react with the mAb. The mAb recognized a single antigen epitope. The specificity of the mAb was better than that of the polyclonal antibody, but the binding range was not as wide as that of the polyclonal antibody. The initial combination of clinical samples with polyclonal antibodies for preliminary screening and the subsequent reaction of the samples with the mAb increased the detection rate and prevented false negatives.</p><p id="Par26">The hybridoma cells producing H3-subtype AIV prepared in this study can steadily secrete homogeneous and high-titer antibodies and provide a very useful mAb for further research on H3-subtype AIV. In addition, the sandwich ELISA method is time saving, convenient, highly specific, sensitive and repeatable. Furthermore, the method can produce results without a specific instrument or the need for professional technical staff; it is performed according to a simple protocol and provides an effective method for the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV.
