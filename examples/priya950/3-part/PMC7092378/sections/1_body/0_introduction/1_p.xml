<p>Each year, influenza epidemics infect about 5–10% of adults and 10–20% of children. Influenza causes febrile illnesses that range in severity from mild to severe and can lead to hospitalization and even death (

Unfortunately, influenza viruses continually change over time through genetic and antigenic drift of their surface glycoproteins to escape virus neutralization by immune response. Therefore, the composition of the influenza vaccines has to be reconsidered annually and if required, revision is performed according to the most recent changes of the circulating strains (
