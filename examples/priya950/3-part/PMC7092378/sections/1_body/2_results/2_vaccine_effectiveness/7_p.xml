<p>The epidemiologic situation during the three seasons shows clearly the diverse and complex pattern of the circulation of different influenza virus lineages and genetic clades and subclades during a season. This influences the IVE during the season and makes reliable IVE estimates even more difficult, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. This figure provides an overview on the results of the genetic characterization of the circulating influenza viruses during different time periods of epidemic influenza virus circulation (â‰¥50% of samples influenza virus positive) and their influence on IVE estimates.
