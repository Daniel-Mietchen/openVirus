<p>This table further demonstrates the great diversity and complexity in the pattern of the different circulating influenza virus lineages, and genetic clades and subclades observed during the three seasons. Of special interest was the emergence of HA-NA subclade reassortants of the A(H3N2) viruses during the season 2018/19 (
