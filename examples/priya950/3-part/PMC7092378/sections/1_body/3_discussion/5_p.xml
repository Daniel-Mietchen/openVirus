<p>In Austria the observed type-specific IVE of 45% against influenza B virus infections was comparable with international published data where a quite broad range from 25 to 55% was reported (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Despite the pronounced influenza B lineage mismatch of the TIV/aTIV vaccine strain (vaccine strain B/Victoria), still a quite good IVE against the circulating influenza B/Yamagata viruses was observed. This phenomenon can be explained by influenza B lineage cross-protection, where birth-cohort effects induced by differential prime-boost lineage-exposures may play a role in IVE. Cross lineage protection was observed previously in several studies (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Nevertheless, as expected, in patients vaccinated with quadrivalent vaccines (QIV/LAIV, perfect vaccine match for the influenza B/Yamagata component) an increased overall IVE of 46% and an IVE of 76% for children between 6 month and 14 years of age could be found for this season in Austria. This is in accordance with data described in Canada (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and differ to those obtained by the UK (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which show no effectivity for the TIV against influenza B, but excellent effectivity of the LAIV against influenza B (61%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (91%).
