<p>Influenza B lineage mismatch did not play any role in the following 
 <bold>season 2018/19</bold>, as this season was dominated by influenza A viruses. In Canada (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and Hong Kong (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) the 2018/19 influenza season was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. In Europe a complex and over the season constantly changing pattern of the circulation of both influenza A virus subtypes was observed. UK reported the co-circulation of both influenza A virus subtypes, while counties on the European continent reported the dominance or co-circulation of either A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) viruses. This significant differences in the geographic spread of the two influenza A subtypes and their genetic subclades, may also explain differences in IVE estimates.
