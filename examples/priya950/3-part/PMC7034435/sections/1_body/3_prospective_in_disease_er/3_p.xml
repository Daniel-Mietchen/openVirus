<p>The evidence of PPR in large ruminants, camels and other unusual hosts raises concerns for the strengthening of disease surveillance and control strategies. This is important in areas where the disease is enzootic and animal density, including for small and large ruminants, is high, such as in Africa and Asia. Since spatial and temporal heterogeneities exist in animal population density, and subsequent differences in susceptibility to PPR infection, disease eradication seems to be a long process that cannot solely rely on mass vaccination. Considering the susceptibility and role of unusual/atypical hosts in the spread of disease, there may be various factors influencing the hindrance of the global eradication of PPR, particularly in disease-endemic countries. Susceptibility of unusual hosts to PPR and their potential to spread disease, has been shown (Schulz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Therefore, the lack of disease surveillance, monitoring and proper diagnosis in these hosts may be causing the delay of disease eradication. Since data related to disease epidemiology and the contribution of large and unusual animals in disease transmission is scarce, efforts should be made to further research on spatial and temporal disease transmission in endemic countries. Effective and thorough targeting of a wide range of hosts (host heterogeneities) was one of the key factors that enabled the eradication of rinderpest. Furthermore, spatial and temporal heterogeneities in susceptible hosts, and their sensitivity to PPRV and role in disease epidemiology, make the situation even more complicated for disease eradication. As such, epidemiological modelling may be useful in these circumstances, to help in deciding on the best strategy for combating this devastating disease. Therefore, a good knowledge of species susceptibility and other epidemiological parameters is essential for the success of a PPR eradication programme. Additionally, realistic models taking host heterogeneities into account still require further research efforts in disease epidemiology and modelling.
