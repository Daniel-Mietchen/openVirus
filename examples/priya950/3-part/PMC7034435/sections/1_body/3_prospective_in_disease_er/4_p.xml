<p>In most endemic settings, small and large ruminants and camels are raised together, which easily leads to the occurrence of epidemics. Thereby, there is a dire need to devise novel disease control initiatives/strategies and standardised protocols involving disease surveillance and outbreak management in all susceptible hosts living together in a single unit production setting (combined small and large animal farming). A stronger knowledge of animal dynamics, single animal unit production, and management practices and animal movements (trade, transhumance), will be a critical condition for success. Serological surveys provide crucial information on the possible presence of any disease in unusual hosts, because information on active disease presence may not be available due to poor accessibility to these animals. A new framework, including one that investigates atypical hosts in disease surveillance, is needed by the concerned national and international authorities for a stage-wise progressive control of PPR. Such expansion of disease screening, on the basis of sample availability from all susceptible hosts including atypical hosts, will surely strengthen eradication modelling in the final stages of an eradication programme. A lack of proper awareness on the role of susceptibility of atypical hosts to PPRV in veterinary and para-veterinary personnel, may create a major obstacle towards the progressive control of PPR in disease endemic regions.</p>
