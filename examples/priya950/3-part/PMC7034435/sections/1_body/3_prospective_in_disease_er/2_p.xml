<p>PPR is an eminent disease and eradication needs to be prioritised for poverty alleviation and food security, because of the high morbidity and mortality in small ruminants commonly owned by resource-constrained farmers. However, to further support disease control policies, there is need for further research on several epidemiological features, such as transmission dynamics among known and/or novel hosts raised either under similar or different production systems (Jost et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In fact, mass die-offs in small and large ruminants in PPR endemic regions of developing countries are severely affecting the livestock productivity and poor communitiesâ€™ livelihoods. Hence, an analytical study about the incidence of the disease in various susceptible hosts would be extremely useful and elicit widespread interest by providing sufficient additional information, especially in the epidemiology of the disease (Dhar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Moreover, future studies on the genetic characterisation of current prevailing PPRV strains and their epizootiology, related to susceptible hosts, would be helpful in the implementation of disease control policies and also to determine if large ruminants, camels and unusual hosts play any role in the endemicity of PPR.
