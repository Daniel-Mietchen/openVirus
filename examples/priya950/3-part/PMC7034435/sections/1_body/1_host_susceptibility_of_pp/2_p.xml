<p>The transboundary nature of PPR is considered one of the main limitations in expanding the production of animals, particularly in enzootic regions of the world (Balamurugan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Besides domestic small ruminants as native hosts (Kumar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Aziz-ul-Rahman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shabbir et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), camels (Zakian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), large ruminant species, including cattle and water buffalo (Govindarajan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Lembo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), a wide range of wild animals (Aziz-ul-Rahman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and unusual hosts, such as pigs (Schulz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) are also considered as susceptible to PPRV infection with variable morbidity and mortality rates. Taken together, the significance of a widening host range in relation to possible disease control measures makes it also important to understand the disease potential of PPRV in large ruminants, camels and unusual hosts, particularly in disease-endemic regions.
