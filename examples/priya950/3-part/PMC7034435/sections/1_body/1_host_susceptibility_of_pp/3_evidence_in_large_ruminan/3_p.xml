<p>Experimental infections in cattle have shown susceptibility to PPRV in this species, without inducing any clinical signs (Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Couacy-Hymann et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), similar to what is seen in field epidemiological studies. Cattle in contact with PPRV-infected goats became sub-clinically infected (Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and all four genetic lineages were able to induce seroconversion (Couacy-Hymann et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Although PPRV persisted for at least 397â€‰days after infection (Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), there is no evidence for virus shedding in body secretions and excretions, indicating a low risk for further transmission (Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Couacy-Hymann et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis of large ruminants (at least cattle) being dead-end hosts for PPRV, (i.e., these species are susceptible to PPRV infection but not able to transmit the virus to other animals) (Agga et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Although, there is not yet any evidence of virus shedding in secretions or excretions in water buffaloes, it is reasonable to assume that this occurred in the clinical outbreak reported from India (Govindarajan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), because virus transmission between individual animals would be needed for such a devastating outcome.
