<p>Although, both cellular receptors (Nectin-4 and SLAM) have significance for host adaptation of PPRV, the conserved PPRV sequences obtained from domestic small ruminants and unusual host origin indicate that this virus has the potential to switch host without necessary mutations (Rahman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Such evidence suggests the possibility of crossing the species barrier. However, further serological-and molecular-based evidence is necessary. Both large ruminants and unusual hosts might be assessed to detect an eventual change in viral hostâ€“pathogen interaction for a wide range of species. The detection of PPRV nucleic acids in dogs, Asiatic lion and biting midges cannot be overlooked and may be of epizootiological significance in studying the host diversification capacity of viruses, which may also require new intervention strategies to control PPRV infection.
