<p>Peste des petits ruminant (PPR) caused by peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), is classified as an Office International des Epizooties (OIE)-listed Transboundary Animal Disease (TAD). In the developing world, this virus poses a major threat to sustainable agricultural growth by causing significant economic losses due to high morbidity and mortality in sheep and goats (Banyard et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In the acute form of infection, morbidity and case fatality rate may remain high (up to 100%) (Pope et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). PPRV is classified as a 
 <italic>Small ruminant morbillivirus</italic> and belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> (Amarasinghe et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It has a close antigenic relationship with other viruses of the same genus, including rinderpest virus (RPV), measles virus (MV) and canine distemper viruses (CDV). These morbilliviruses have the propensity to cross species barriers, which highlights their potential towards inter-species transmission and novel host adaptation (Cosby 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For instance, CDV has exhibited the capability to target diverse species of carnivores and non-human primates including pandas, minks and rhesus monkeys (Sun et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sakai et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Beineke et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The same has also been observed for MV, which may cause infection of high virulence in new susceptible hosts, such as rhesus monkeys (Leonard et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In the same way, it has been postulated that RPV crossed the species barrier into humans 1000–5000 years ago (Barrett 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Such evidence indicates the capability of morbilliviruses to cause infection by crossing species barriers from native to novel or unusual/atypical hosts. PPRV also has the propensity to cross species barriers (inter- and intra-species transmission) and has the potential to cause infection in non-native hosts (i.e., other than small ruminants) (Lembo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mahapatra et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Schulz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
