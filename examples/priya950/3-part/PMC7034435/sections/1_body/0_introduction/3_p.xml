<p>The potential of PPRV to target a wide range of susceptible hosts enforces the need to improve disease control strategies for eventual disease repression. After the successful eradication of rinderpest by mass vaccination, the suppression of PPR is now the primary concern for the FAO and OIE, for which they have launched a progressive control program in endemic regions. However, PPRVâ€™s propensity to cross the species barrier raises questions about the epidemiological role of all susceptible hosts in the spreading of the disease and evolutionary dynamics subsequent to novel host adaption. In this article, we have summarised the scattered data and listed the widening range of host species in which evidence of clinical and subclinical PPRV infection has been observed. This suggests that robust disease surveillance programmes may be initiated with appropriate interventions in disease endemic regions to eventually globally eradicate the disease.</p>
