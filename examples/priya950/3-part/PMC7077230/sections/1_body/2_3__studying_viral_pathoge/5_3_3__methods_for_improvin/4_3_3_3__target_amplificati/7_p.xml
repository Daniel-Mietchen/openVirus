<p>Target PCR becomes a challenge when organisms with high genome mutability are studied, e.g., HCV [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], influenza virus or 
 <italic>Noroviruses</italic>. Frequent changes in their genetic sequences interfere with primer annealing [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. A more subtle approach to designing primers could improve the outcome, but PCR alone is by definition incapable of identifying new viruses.
