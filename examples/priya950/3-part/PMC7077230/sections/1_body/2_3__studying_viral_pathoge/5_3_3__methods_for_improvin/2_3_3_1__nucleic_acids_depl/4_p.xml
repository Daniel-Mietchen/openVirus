<p>Although separation of target sequences from “junk” nucleic acids is the primary goal of depletion, high levels of host-cell nucleic acids can, in theory, impede probe-sequence binding by competitive mechanisms, in which case the effectiveness of depletion would sag. However, some modified protocols have been developed that tackle this issue [
