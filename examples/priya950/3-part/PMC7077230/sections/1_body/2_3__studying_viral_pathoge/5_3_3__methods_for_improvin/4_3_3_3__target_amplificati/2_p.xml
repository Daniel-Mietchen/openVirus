<p>This approach proves apt for investigating small viral genomes that can be covered with only a few PCR amplicons. However, vast heterogeneity of RNA viruses (e.g., HCV27, 
 <italic>Noroviruses</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhabdoviruses</italic>) might require the use of multiple primer sets to ensure amplification of all known genotypes [
