<p>Various types of clinical specimens routinely contain a large portion of host-cell nucleic acids, which can interfere with target PCR [

Utilizing biological, physical or chemical principles, it significantly decreases the content of host-cell DNA and/or RNA, while only negligibly lowering concentration of a pathogenâ€™s nucleic acids. Most depletion kits are based on hybridization of molecular probes with target sequences, which is a lengthy but effective process. Commercial depletion kits are widely available (Ribo-Zero, RiboCop, HostZERO, NEBNext, MolYsis).
