<p>Nevertheless, the price per sample remains high for this approach, and it has not gained much popularity yet due to insufficient data on its relative performance. In addition, hybridization protocols are time-consuming. According to official protocols, hybridization may take up to 24 h in some cases, after which there are additional steps required for library preparation, consuming a few extra hours. Secondly, viral genomes that differ from probe sequences for more than 40% will most likely fail to undergo enrichment [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Although this does not guarantee the loss of these viruses, the effectiveness of the procedure nosedives. For these reasons, MSS and PCR with degenerate primers might prove more effective, albeit yielding more “noise” data in the output, which is removable during processing. In the end, the choice of enrichment method boils down to the experiment design and quality of the input material.
