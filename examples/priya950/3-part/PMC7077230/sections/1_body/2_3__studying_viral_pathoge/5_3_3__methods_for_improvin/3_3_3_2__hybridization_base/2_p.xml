<p>The most notable feature of this approach is that molecular probes, instead of targeting selected viral species or families, bind to certain sequences in all known viral genera infecting vertebrates, thus supposedly creating the most comprehensive tool for viral screening. This enrichment technique greatly increases sequencing depth, while also raising the fraction of viral reads by 100–10,000 times compared to standard library preparation protocols [

In contrast, total sample sequencing could at least partly detect a new pathogen’s sequences, revealing its identity.
