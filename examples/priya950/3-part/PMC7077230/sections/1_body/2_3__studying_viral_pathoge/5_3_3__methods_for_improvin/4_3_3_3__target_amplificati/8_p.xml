<p>We suppose that new methods based on metabarcoding might aid identification of viruses in the future. Originally, barcoding—another type of target amplification-mediated approach—was developed to assess bacterial associations (e.g., gut microbiota), based on reliable universal phylogenetic markers, such as 16S, where short taxon-specific sequences consisting of a variable fragment flanked by conservative fragments are used for tagging organisms. Metabarcoding combines a metagenomic approach (i.e., studying multiple organisms in a sample) with barcoding, making it a powerful tool for studying complex microbial associations [

Usually, the scalability of a metabarcoding approach is limited by genus level; however, this limitation is compensated for by a significant cost reduction in comparison with metagenomics. Unfortunately, no such loci have been described for viruses, owing primarily to their genetic diversity; however, some attempts have been made at solving this issue with broad-range primer panels, created by computational methods [
