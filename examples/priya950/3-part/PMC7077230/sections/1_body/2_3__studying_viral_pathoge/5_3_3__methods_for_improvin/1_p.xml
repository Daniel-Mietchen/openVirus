 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], including protocols utilizing saponin [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and propidium monoazide [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Depletion is a powerful tool, but potential loss of target sequences restricts its use for samples with a low content of viral nucleic acids. Their fraction is usually lost during ethanol cleaning and stems from either weak probe affinity, competitive binding, low ethanol concentration or contamination with strong bases. Additionally, listed techniques are expensive and laborious. Unspecific amplification methods, e.g., multiple displacement amplification (MDA), utilize random primers and Phi29 polymerase to increase reaction output, however not necessarily with high enrichment quality [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and may lead to additional contamination, uneven fragment distribution and amplification errors, lowering the overall library quality [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Sometimes depletion protocols do not effectively remove host-cell DNA [
