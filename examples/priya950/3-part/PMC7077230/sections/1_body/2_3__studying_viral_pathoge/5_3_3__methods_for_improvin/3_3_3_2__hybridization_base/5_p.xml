<p>This approach has been successfully used to describe clinically significant viruses with varying genome sizes, such as HCV [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], HSV-1 [
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], VZV [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], EBV [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], HCMV [
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], HHV6 [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] and HHV7 [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Hybridization can be set up in a single tube and is easily automated [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Moreover, the use of probes yields results more reliable than those after cultivation. This is because acquired sequences are almost totally identical to original templates, whereas cultivation creates quasispecies, distorting actual genetic structure of a viral population [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].
