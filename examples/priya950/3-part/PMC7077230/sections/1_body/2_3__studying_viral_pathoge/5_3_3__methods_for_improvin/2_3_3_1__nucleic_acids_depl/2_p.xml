<p>In a protocol by Gu et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], Cas9 utilizes a set of guide RNAs to target unwanted nucleic acids during depletion of abundant sequences by hybridization (DASH). Cleavage-mediated depletion resulted in an up to 99% reduction of mitochondrial DNA. This approach can be used for targeting human genomic DNA in samples with viral nucleic acids.
