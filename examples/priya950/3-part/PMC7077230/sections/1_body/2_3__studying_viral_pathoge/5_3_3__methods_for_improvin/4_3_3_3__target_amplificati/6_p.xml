<p>Multiple PCRs require more input material. In clinical practice, an amount of sample drawn from a patient is usually limited. Multiplex PCR allows for parallel amplification of target sequences in a single tube, thus utilizing a smaller sample volume. In this case, compatibility of primers has to be assessed beforehand using bioinformatic tools to avoid artifacts, such as primer-dimers and false priming.</p>
