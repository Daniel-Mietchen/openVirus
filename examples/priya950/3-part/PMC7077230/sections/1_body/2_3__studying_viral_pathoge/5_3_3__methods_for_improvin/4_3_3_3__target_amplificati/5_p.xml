<p>Apparently, sometimes amplification, as described above, overloads laboratory workflow with numerous reactions and mandatory normalization of the productsâ€™ concentrations. There is always room for error, e.g., primers failing to anneal to targets due to unmatching primer sequences (particularly in rapidly mutating viruses [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Thus, even though this method allows for amplification and further sequencing of large viral genomes, technical complexity and low cost-effectiveness render it inapt for massive clinical research, reserving it primarily for scientific purposes.
