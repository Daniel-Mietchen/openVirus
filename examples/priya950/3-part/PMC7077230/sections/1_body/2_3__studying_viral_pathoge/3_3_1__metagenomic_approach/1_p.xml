 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, there are five major limitations: (1) sequences of interest should share at least low identity with the analogous sequences in a reference genome, ensuring correct mapping; (2) the analytical complexity of obtained data often requires employment of a qualified bioinformatician and the use of a specialized computational infrastructure (including both hardware and software; (3) hidden experimental and methodological prejudices towards certain taxa; (4) defining the method’s sensitivity and properly measuring it against a relevant reference; (5) dealing with the abundance of host-cell, bacterial and fungal nucleic acids.
