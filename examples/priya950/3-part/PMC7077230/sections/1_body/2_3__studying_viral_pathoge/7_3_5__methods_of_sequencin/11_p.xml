<p>PathSeq [
 <xref rid="B167-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>] is a powerful computational tool for analyzing the non-host part of sequencing data, which is able to detect the presence of both known and new pathogens. The PathSeq approach begins with a subtraction phase in which reads are aligned with human reference genome to subsequently exclude them, in an attempt to concentrate pathogen-derived data. This is followed by the analytical phase, in which the remaining reads are aligned to the microbial reference sequences and assembled de novo. The formation of large contigs, including several unmapped reads that do not have a significant similarity to alignment with any sequence in the referenced databases, may suggest a previously undetected organism.
