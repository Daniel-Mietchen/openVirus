<p>VirusFinder, for instance, first utilizes Bowtie2 [

 <xref rid="B162-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] to detect and remove sequences derived from human genome. Next, it engages BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] to align the remaining sequences to the database of viral genomes. During the final step, the short reads, supposedly viral, are assembled into longer sequences—contigs—using Trinity [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. VirusFinder, developed primarily to identify viral integration sites within the human genome, produces the best results when given sequencing reads with the maximum depth possible. In the original article [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], coverage varies between 31× and 121×. Acquired contigs are then used for phylogenetic analysis.
