<p>First filtering of the host reads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00211-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) works well only when the host’s genome has been thoroughly studied and described in detail, although it is not a problem for detection of human viral infections. As HTS technologies advance, more complete genome sequences become publicly available. Another problem is that viruses may contain nucleotide fragments that are similar to certain regions in the human (or other host) genomes, leading to false negative results. The second approach requires high coverage to work, thus significantly increasing both the processing time and the experiment cost. Moreover, whenever input data are insufficient, spaces might form between reads, impairing their assembly into contigs, thus halting virus classification. In principal, two pipelines utilize the same concept of comparing sequences that “survived” filtering against reference viral genomes [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Depending on the sample type and expected contaminants, the filtering step may also include rRNA, mtRNA, mRNA, bacterial or fungal sequences or non-human host genomes.
