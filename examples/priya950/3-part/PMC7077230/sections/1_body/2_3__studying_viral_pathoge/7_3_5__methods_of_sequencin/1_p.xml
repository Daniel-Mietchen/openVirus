<p>Whenever metagenomics is used for the detection of pathogens, it is crucial to use reliable bioinformatic tools and specialized databases that would help decide whether discovered microorganisms indeed have caused the infection or act merely as artifacts. Such processing normally demands lots of computing power and knowledge and skills in bioinformatics. Typically, data analysis mainly involves comparing obtained reads with reference genomes. Quite a few algorithms have been developed for this purpose [
