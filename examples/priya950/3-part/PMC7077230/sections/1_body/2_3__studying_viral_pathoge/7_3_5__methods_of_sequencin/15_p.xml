<p>All search methods rely on genome reference databases, such as the NCBI GenBank, RefSeq or BLAST nucleotide (nt) and non-redundant protein (nr) databases. The poor quality of the reference sequences is a major obstacle to processing data. Because of this, specialized databases are being compiled manually to ensure a strict quality control, e.g., ViPR [
 <xref rid="B170-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>], RVDB [
 <xref rid="B171-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] and viruSITE [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. However, they are reliable for the same reason that they are limited, because only a small fraction of all published sequences ever make it to these databases. As a consequence, reads obtained from supposedly new strains are frequently left out. Contrarily, a vast NCBI-based GenBank database is brimming with viral sequences, both complete and partial; however, the price for the quantity is the quality of the assembled data. Even so, GenBank is far from being truly comprehensive, but this is merely a question of time. Protein databases are also used, for example, Pfam [
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>] and UniProt [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Protein-level searches can usually detect more distant homology due to the usage of sensitive amino acid similarity matrices, which can improve the detection of divergent viruses, but untranslated regions of the genome remain unused.
