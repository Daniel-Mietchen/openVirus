<p>Apart from the differences in the methodology between first filtering out the host reads or leaving them included, there are other serious challenges, such as the proper taxonomic assignment of viral reads or contigs. Homology or alignment-based similarity search methods are often used, but a composition search, in which oligonucleotide frequencies or k-mer counts are matched to reference sequences, is also an option. At the same time, a composition search requires the program to be “trained” on reference data and it is not used much in viral genomics.</p>
