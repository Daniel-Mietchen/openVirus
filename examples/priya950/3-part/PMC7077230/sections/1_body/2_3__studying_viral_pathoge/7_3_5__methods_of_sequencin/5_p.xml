<p>Dismissing the hostâ€™s sequences is an important step that has been introduced into numerous processing algorithms, such as VirusFinder [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], VirusSeq [
 <xref rid="B159-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] or Vy-PER [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. This step helps remove false positives caused by similarities between some regions of the human and viral genomes.
