<p>The search for viral pathogens is often impeded by their genetic variability, caused by a multitude of factors: gene duplications and exchanges, frequent single-nucleotide mutations, gene-large insertions and rapid adaptation of viruses to new hosts. These become a particular nuisance whenever large sets of samples from various organisms are handled. Firstly, reliable reference genomes have only been assembled for a limited number of organisms, although, as previously mentioned, this issue is being addressed. Secondly, the amount of usable viral nucleic acids in a sample depends on numerous factors, including the stage of a pathogenâ€™s life cycle and the overall quality of material and its type, all of which might cause prejudice towards certain viral species and drop the amount of usable viral DNA and RNA. This complicates the assembly of contigs, because it requires the maximum number of reads possible. </p>
