<p>Vy-Per [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] is another bioinformatic instrument that utilizes reference human genome for filtering out reads of a host’s DNA. Sequences that are not dismissed during this step are compared with the data in the NCBI database using BLAT tool [
 <xref rid="B163-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Although experiments set up to test Vy-Per use samples with a rather high coverage (80× for samples and 40× for controls), it is not mandatory, but lowers the risk of false positives.
