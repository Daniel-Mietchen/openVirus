<p>Another type of NGS-based analysis is metagenomics, which was comprehensively defined by Chen and Pachter as “the application of modern genomics technique without the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species” [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In essence, it offers the means to investigate the taxonomic diversity of a microbial community in an environmental or biological sample as the entirety of present nucleic acids is studied. Further applications of this method extend to transcriptomics and proteomics, allowing for a deeper insight into several aspects of pathogens, such as drug resistance, adaptation mechanisms and vast communication networks between species.
