<p>Comparatively small genomes, like those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are frequently sequenced in research purposes, and attempts are being made to integrate this procedure into clinical practice [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Until recently, detection of drug-resistant strains required sequencing of only certain parts of viral genome. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was considered far too expensive for this purpose; however, we are obtaining more data on evolving mechanisms of drug resistance, including genetic mutations that define it [
