<p>Even though the cost per raw megabase of DNA sequence has plummeted over the years [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], HTS remains a costly and time-consuming method, requiring a complex procedure of sample preparation, expensive equipment and at least some bioinformatic training with laboratory personnel, therefore rendering it unsuitable for large-scale screening studies [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. For example, library preparation in the aforementioned study by Graf et al. took no less than 14 h. A HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) was used to conduct sequencing that lasted 11 consecutive days. Hypothetically, a metagenomic approach could be adapted to a clinical lab routine, provided that library preparation and run processing are optimized to deliver results as fast as conventional tests and present them in an easily interpretable form. Outsourcing of data processing is one option to solve this problem. Ranges of bioinformatics tools facilitate data analysis, e.g., Kraken [
