<p>In most NGS-based pathogen studies, clutter reads are a problem. Whenever clinical samples are used, the presence of a hostâ€™s nucleic acids becomes an inevitability, requiring additional computational power for filtering them out and, consequently, adding to the gross sequencing cost. To make matters worse, target DNA/RNA usually constitutes only a small fraction of total DNA/RNA. However, target amplification combined with enrichment become a game-changer, allowing for both concentration of target templates and removal of unwanted sequences.</p>
