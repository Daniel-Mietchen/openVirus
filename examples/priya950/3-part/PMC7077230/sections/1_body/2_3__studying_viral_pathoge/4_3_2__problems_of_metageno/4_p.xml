<p>A few strategies can tackle this methodological nuisance. In principal, they are based on either one or both of the following approaches [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]: (1) in silico separation of host sequences based on their similarity with the hosts reference genome; (2) conducting of taxonomic classification for the whole set of sequences using comprehensive databases which includes sequences of both target and host genome. The former option is very demanding in terms of computational power, since millions of reads undergo a complex analysis [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The latter is subject to faults of its own: partial or low-quality reference sequences, false mapping and high genetic diversity resulting in numerous polymorphisms [
