<p>In-house analysis is another alternative, given that the algorithms for sequence processing include criteria that would return a reliable interpretation of assessed reads. Ideally, such algorithms would not only filter out artefacts and perform mapping to the reference genome, but also suggest the most represented pathogen in each sample, narrowing down the spectrum of considered pathogens. This would create a fast definitive NGS-based diagnostic tool [
