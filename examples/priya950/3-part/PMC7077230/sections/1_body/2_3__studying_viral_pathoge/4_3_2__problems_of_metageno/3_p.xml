<p>Library preparation requires the use of total DNA/RNA from a sample, implying the presence of nucleic acids from other organisms. Direct shotgun sequencing (i.e., without contaminant nucleic acid removal) yields most reads from a host, whereas target reads constitute a mere fraction of total data [
