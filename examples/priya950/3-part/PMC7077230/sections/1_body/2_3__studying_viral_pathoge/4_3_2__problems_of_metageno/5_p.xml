<p>A pathogen’s content in a sample is unknown a priori and can only be approximated, for example, based on severity of an onset [

Consequently, it becomes difficult to evaluate a minimally required number of sequencing reads per sample (SRPS) sufficient for a reliable in-depth analysis. Underestimation of SRPS results in a low yield of target sequences, for example, 0.008% for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], 0.0003% for Lassa virus [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and 0.3% for Zika virus [

Considering that metagenomics focuses on relative quantities of nucleic acids rather than absolute counts, establishing appropriate thresholds for positive and negative results becomes challenging. In cases of cell cultures and tissues, calculating copies per cell (CPC) has been suggested [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]; however, this parameter would not work for other types of samples, e.g., swabs and washes. High content of a host’s nucleic acids might artificially lower CPC, falsely attributing negative results to samples. As we have mentioned, the sequencing depth is another aspect to this issue, because shallow sequencing provides little data with poor scalability, to the point where an extra round of sequencing is required to verify the results based on low SRPS data [
