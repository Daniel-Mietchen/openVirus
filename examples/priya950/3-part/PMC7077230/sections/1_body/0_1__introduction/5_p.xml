<p>Problems with conventional diagnostic methods have been stated in several studies. For example, Arnold et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that only 62% of viral respiratory infections among children could be confidently attributed to known pathogens, mostly to human metapneumovirus (63%) and adenoviruses (45%), while almost a third of all cases remained undiagnosed. In another study by Vu et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it was demonstrated that in 42.7% of cases of viral gastroenteritis the pathogen could not be identified with conventional methods. Kennedy et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] outline that up to 40% of viral encephalitis infections remain undiagnosed with modern clinical tests.
