<p>Immunoassays have been extensively used in clinical laboratories for over 60 years now. Fast and relatively reliable screening tests for infectious diseases have been successfully introduced into healthcare practice, e.g., for HIV, HBV, HEV, HAV, HCV, and Rubella virus. Although ELISA does not quantify pathogens with great precision, it effectively detects pathogens based on their antigen structure. Useful as they are, immunoassays are also subject to biases and fundamental pitfalls, although they are often disregarded for the sake of low cost and convenience.</p>
