<p>High throughput sequencing (HTS) represents a range of technologies based on sequencing by synthesis, which allow retrieving of multiple nucleotide sequences at once with high reliability for further pathogen identification. Thus, HTS may tackle the aforementioned diagnostic issues, adding an extra layer of data for identification and further insight into a pathogen.</p>
