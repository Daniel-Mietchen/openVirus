<p>As effective as they are, PCR tests are sometimes prone to major pitfalls, chiefly owing to high mutability of a viral genome, which significantly perplexes primer design and requires researchers to update primer sequences continually. With the entirety of human-infecting viruses, most of which are yet to be revealed, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain up-to-date primer panels while also ensuring the correct reaction conditions and high specificity for differentiating closely related viral species. This situation is aggravated by the low rates of correct pathogen identification [
