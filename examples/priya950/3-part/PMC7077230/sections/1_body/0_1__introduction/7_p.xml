<p>In this paper, we assess modern clinical tests for viral infections and explore the ways that HTS provides detailed data about a pathogenâ€™s genome, allowing for a deeper analysis of its features, such as drug resistance and phylogeny. We also hope to demonstrate how modern clinical laboratories would benefit from adopting HTS as a routine diagnostic technique.</p>
