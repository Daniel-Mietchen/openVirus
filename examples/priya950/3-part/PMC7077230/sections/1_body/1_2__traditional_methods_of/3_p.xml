<p>The development of molecular cloning and commercial solutions for Sanger sequencing aided the identification of new pathogens. The core principle of this approach includes three steps: (1) amplification of a selected region via PCR, (2) molecular cloning of the amplicons, and (3) Sanger sequencing of the molecular clones. In some cases, hybridization is used to detect viral nucleic acids. This requires at least some knowledge of the target sequences, as it utilizes a microarray with oligonucleotides nested on its surface that are complementary to the conservative sequences in the genomes of the chosen viral species. The technique never grew to become popular in diagnostics, because (1) content of viral nucleic acids in the sample had to be high, and (2) high levels of the hostâ€™s DNA and the DNA of the microbiome interfered with amplification [
