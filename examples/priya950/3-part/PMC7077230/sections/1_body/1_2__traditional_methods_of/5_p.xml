<p>In spite of a multitude of available technologies, real-time PCR remains, as of now, one of the most powerful and common, often regarded as a reference diagnostic test. RT-PCR has been extensively used [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], for which a significant number of primers have been designed [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since the potential of this method became apparent, many enterprises have stepped in, developing commercial PCR kits for reliable fast-track diagnosis of infections like enterovirus, influenza, herpes simplex, etc. While effective and highly sensitive, these panels by design cannot identify new strains and types with altered target sequences. Because of possible genetic similarities between known and previously undiscovered viruses, primers might anneal incorrectly, resulting in false positives and taxonomic misidentification. Multiplexing of primers and probes can be challenging, as there is always a risk of cross-specificity and primer-dimer formation. While separating reactions solves this issue, it requires greater volumes of clinical samples, which are usually limited. Furthermore, in the case of probes, the number of targets is strictly limited to a handful of available fluorophores.
