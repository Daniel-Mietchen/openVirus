<p>At present, two major research vectors exist: (1) developing techniques for depletion of bacterial and host sequences that would spare viral nucleic acids and (2) evolving long-range sequencing to the point where it becomes financially and qualitatively comparable to the second-generation methods. The key to success in the struggle against viruses and their shifty nature lies within combining current methods and thus potentiating the creation of the ultimate diagnostic tool. Ideally, it has to be able to detect and describe viral pathogens and predict the evolution of viruses to let clinicians combat them with the utmost effectiveness.</p>
