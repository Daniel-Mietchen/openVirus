<p>Studying viral genetics with NGS methods is rapidly gaining clinical significance, be it in diagnostics, epidemiological research, the hunt for drug resistance strains or infection control. Various approaches exist that feature WGS, amplicon sequencing, enrichment sequencing and metagenomics, the choice depending on the type of pathogen and experiment objective. Metagenomics, for instance, works best with unknown viruses, whereas PCR-based techniques are apt for samples with low diversity and short genomes. Target enrichment is preferred whenever viruses with large genomes are concerned or if the sample contains a multitude of heterogeneous viruses that feature well-identified nucleic acid sequences.</p>
