<p>It is also notable that detection of viral nucleic acids does not necessarily imply an ongoing infection, and therefore, positive results should be validated using supplementary methods targeted at pathogens suggested by the NGS tests. For instance, in the case of idiopathic encephalitis, positive results of NGS can be corroborated either using immunohistochemical assay [
