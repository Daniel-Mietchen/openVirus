<p>The risk of contamination and the issues with sensitivity are important to sequencing viral nucleic acids, because they cause false positive and false negative results, respectively. High-sensitivity sequencing (be it metagenomic, PCR-based or probe-enriched) allows for detection of minimal quantities of contaminating viral nucleic acids [
