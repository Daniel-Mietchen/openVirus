<p>Despite the apparent benefits of this approach, there are a few drawbacks to consider, e.g., significant error rates that require a large coverage for their partial compensation. This poses a problem that is particularly important for the research of drug resistance, the substrate for which is often a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms, particularly in RNA-viruses [
