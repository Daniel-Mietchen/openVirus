<p>In contrast, long read sequencing (LRS) technologies do not require significant DNA fragmentation or additional template amplification. For these reasons, they are frequently referred to as the “third-generation” sequencing technologies, although this distinction sometimes may not be accurate. Platforms such as PacBio (Pacific Biosciences), PromethION, GridION and MinION (ONT, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) are capable of reading exceptionally long fragments, including whole viral genomes. Secondly, these platforms potentially allow ultra-high coverage to be easily reached and even quantify the sample, because the viral load would be directly proportional to the number of detectable viral genomes in the sample. Thus, samples with high viral titer can provide high-quality sequences without prior amplification. Another feature of the ONT platforms is the sample turn-around time, which is often critical in the clinical environment; point-of-care testing makes it possible to identify the infectious agent virtually at the patient’s bed. In this setting, the correct therapy can be started within hours or days of disease manifestation, prospectively improving the patient care outcome.</p>
