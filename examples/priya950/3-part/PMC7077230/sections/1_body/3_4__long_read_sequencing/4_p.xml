<p>MinION has been extensively used in detecting known [

 <xref rid="B181-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>] and new [
 <xref rid="B182-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>] pathogen strains, for instance, of Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>], 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>] and 
 <italic>Papillomavirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Curiously, MinION allows samples to be detected and genotyped within mere hours from sample collection, even “in the field”, sometimes literally [

 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. It has also been successfully used for rapid investigation of Dengue virus outbreak in Angola [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] and Ebola epidemic in Guinea [
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Another experiment [
 <xref rid="B190-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] allowed for deciphering full genomes of three 
 <italic>Avipoxvirus</italic> strains in real-time, skipping extraction and enrichment altogether. Another analogous example is Everglades Virus (EVEV), which has been detected and subgenotyped on-site [
