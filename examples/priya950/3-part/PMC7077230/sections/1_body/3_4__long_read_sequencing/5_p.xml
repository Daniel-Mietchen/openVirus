<p>Another great advantage of Nanopore technology is that unique protocols for direct RNA sequencing have been developed, meaning that RNA viruses could be analyzed right away, without reverse transcription [

 <xref rid="B193-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Even more, depending on the experiment objective, either differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-Seq) or mRNA could be investigated, the latter being achieved by ligating an adapter only to the poly-A tail, thus allowing for transcriptome analysis [
