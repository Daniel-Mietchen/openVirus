<p>To summarize, small physical dimensions of MinION, along with other ONT sequencers, availability of DNA and RNA sequencing protocols, potentially high precision and high data processing rates create promising prospects for its clinical application [

Nevertheless, prior to extrapolating these positive results into the medical field, we need to develop and validate the workflows that would easily integrate into the everyday work of a clinical laboratory and not require any special bioinformatic training in the lab staff [
