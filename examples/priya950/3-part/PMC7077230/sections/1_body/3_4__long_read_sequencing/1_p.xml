<p>Despite being one of the most powerful research tools, the NGS sequencing, which is sometimes called second-generation sequencing, is not flawless. Namely, not a single platform can read fragments more than 700 bp [
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>], thus necessitating DNA fragmentation prior to sequencing. Additionally, second-generation platforms amplify the signal prior to detection. PCR is used for molecular cloning of the fragmented DNA, which inevitably results in overrepresentation of some amplicons and uneven sequence coverage. Small length of the reads sometimes becomes a trouble for haplotyping, significantly complicating localization of the questioned loci. It also causes problems when analyzing repeats and recombinant regions of the DNA due to mapping issues.
