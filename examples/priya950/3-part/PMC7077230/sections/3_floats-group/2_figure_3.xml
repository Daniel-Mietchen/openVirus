  <p>Pipelines for processing reads utilize two main strategies for filtering out “junk” data: (
   <bold>a</bold>) mapping raw reads onto the reference genome of the host and removing them, while preserving unmapped sequences for further analysis; (
   <bold>b</bold>) assembling short reads into contigs and comparing them against the host’s reference genome. Annotation follows both strategies.
