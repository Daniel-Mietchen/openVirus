  <p>Regulation of CHIKV immune responses by malaria infections. Murine malaria infections lead to the dysregulation of splenic germinal center (GC) responses resulting in impaired generation of memory B cells and reduced CHIKV‐specific IgG/IgM serum titers associated with delayed viral clearance in infected tissues. The expansion of popliteal lymph nodes is also affected in co‐infected animals (see Figure 
   <xref rid="imr12825-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Locally in the footpads, the antiviral affects of INFγ induced by pre‐existing malaria infections limit CHIKV replication and dissemination resulting in reduced viremia. Moreover, suppression of CHIKV‐induced swelling is associated with diminished infiltration of inflammatory innate subsets and CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells into infected tissues. BC, B cell; Tfh, follicular helper T cell; FDC, follicular dendritic cell; BMEM, memory B cell; PC, plasma cell; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; iMon, inflammatory monocytes; NK, natural killer cells; Neu, neutrophils; INFγ, interferon gamma.
