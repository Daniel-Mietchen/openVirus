<p>Neutrophils and NK cells have been also identified in inflamed tissues of CHIKF patients and in the swollen footpads of CHIKV‐infected mice.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Increased levels of powerful neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, and MPO (myeloperoxidase) have been observed in mouse infected joints at the peak of inflammation.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Supporting these observations, massive neutrophil infiltration has been linked to an exacerbated swelling pathology in mouse models.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> In a similar fashion, NK cells presence in inflamed tissues is believed to play an important role in CHIKV pathology by exerting direct antiviral activity through cytotoxic mechanisms and by producing IFNγ to enhance both innate and adaptive immune responses.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> Upregulation of IL‐12, a potent NK cell stimulator, has been reported in joints of virus‐infected mice
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> suggesting the involvement of activated NK cells. Moreover, a rapid expansion of NK cells and increased cytotoxic activity during the acute phase of CHIKF have been observed in a patient cohort.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Some insights on the function of NK cells in CHIKV‐induced swelling have also been observed in one of our studies.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Particularly, the more severe early acute joint swelling induced by La Réunion LR2006 OPY1 isolate as compared to the Caribbean CNR20235 isolate was associated with a higher and intensive NK cell activity during the early stages of the immune response in mouse joints. Importantly, the functional role of NK cells in early acute CHIKV‐induced swelling was demonstrated by depletion experiments in LR2006 OPY1 infection.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> These results suggest that NK cells are important mediators of CHIKV‐induced joint swelling likely through the activation of myeloid cells which release inflammatory mediators such us IL‐6,
