<p>The hypothetical function of T cells during CHIKV infection was initially postulated based on their proliferation and activation profiles in CHIKV‐infected patients. Activated peripheral CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell levels were found to be elevated in CHIKF patients from the 2006 to 2007 outbreaks in La Reunion Island.
