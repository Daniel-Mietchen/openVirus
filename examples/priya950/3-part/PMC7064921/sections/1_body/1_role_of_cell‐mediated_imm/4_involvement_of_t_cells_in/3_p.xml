<p>In further support of these observations, immune profiling of peripheral blood of patients from the Gabonese CHIKV outbreak of 2007
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> revealed a strong early activation and proliferation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells followed by the engagement of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses at a later point. These results supported a model in which the early expansion of CD8 T+ cells was probably required for clearance of virus‐infected cells, whereas the subsequent proliferation of helper T cells was needed to support the proper development of antiviral humoral responses. In support of this model, studies in SINV and RVV previously showed that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were involved in limiting SINV replication in the central nervous system
