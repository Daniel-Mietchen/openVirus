<p>The definitive roles of different T cell subsets were shown through depletion studies in mouse models. Subset specific depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells but not CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells abolished the major peak of joint swelling during CHIKV infection with no impact on viral tropism, demonstrating the pathogenic role of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In addition, adoptive transfer of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from CHIKV‐infected donors hastened and aggravated peak joint swelling in CHIKV‐infected TCR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice as compared to naive donors, demonstrating that this process is mediated by virus‐specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> CHIKV proteome‐wide screening assays identified nsP1‐P4‐2 (145‐162 aa, non‐structural protein 1) and E2EP3 (2800‐2818 aa, E2 glycoprotein) as dominant mouse CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> The transfer of primary CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell line specific for nsP1‐P4‐2 and E2EP3 generated through a prime/boost strategy, that predominantly express IFNγ, partially recapitulated joint swelling in TCR
 <sup>‐/‐</sup> mice, further supporting the pathogenic role of Th1 responses.
