<p>On the other hand, the protective role of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was ruled out based on experimental findings. Firstly, infection of CD8 deficient mice or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell‐depleted mice did not alter joint pathology or reduce viral load in the blood and tissues.

 <sup>+</sup> T cells induced upon live‐attenuated CHIKV vaccination failed to control CHIKV infection in mice.
