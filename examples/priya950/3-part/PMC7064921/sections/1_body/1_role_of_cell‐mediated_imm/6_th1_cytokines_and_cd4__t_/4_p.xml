<p>The contribution of IFNγ to CHIKV‐induced inflammation remains unclear, however, recent studies have suggested that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells might mediate CHIKV arthritic disease through the secretion of proteins other than IFNγ. RNA‐Seq analysis of CHIKV‐infected mouse footpads at the peak of swelling revealed highly induction of Granzyme A,

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and Th1 CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.

 <sup>−/−</sup>) or treatment with Serpinb6b—a Granzyme A inhibitor
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">67</xref>—in mice abolished CHIKV‐induced joint swelling without affecting viremia. Collectively, these results suggest that Th1 cells could be mediating virus‐induced swelling through Granzyme A but not IFNγ secretion. Further adoptive transfer experiments using CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from Granzyme A deficient mice into CHIKV‐infected TCR
 <sup>−/−</sup> recipients are needed to confirm that infiltrating CHIKV‐specific Th1 cells mediate swelling through Granzyme A (Figure
