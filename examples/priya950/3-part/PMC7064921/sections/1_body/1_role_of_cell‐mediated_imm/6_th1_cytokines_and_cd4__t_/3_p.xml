<p>CHIKV infection in the absence of IFNγ has provided inconclusive results. In Teo et al
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> infection of IFNγ‐deficient (IFNγ
 <sup>−/−</sup>) mice resulted in a slight increase in viremia, footpad viral load, and footpad swelling, suggesting a possible antiviral role for this cytokine as previously observed in other alphaviruses.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref> This is partially corroborated by a recent work
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> where CHIKV infection of IFNγ
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice led to higher viremia but a marginal reduction in footpad swelling. Conversely, Nakaya et al
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> reported that CHIKV‐infected IFNγ
 <sup>−/−</sup> animals displayed markedly reduced joint swelling with little effect on viremia. These discrepancies might be due to differential pathogenicity derived from the use of distinct CHIKV isolates: SGP11 in Ref. [

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref>] and LR2006‐OPY1 in Ref. [
