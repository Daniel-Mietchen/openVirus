<p>Although CHIKV‐malaria co‐infections in humans have been shown to occur in the African continent, there was a lack of evidence of such infections in Southeast Asia. However, anti‐CHIKV IgM and IgG antibodies detected in 36.5% and 88.5%, respectively, in patients diagnosed with acute 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> from Thailand suggested both pre‐exposure and ongoing CHIKV infection.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">90</xref> CHIKV‐
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co‐infections are therefore not only restricted to Africa and are likely to occur in areas of co‐circulation in Asia and Latin America. Moreover, although CHIKV and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are known to be vectored by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, respectively, entomological studies have reported the existence of CHIKV‐infected 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> populations that might contribute to viral transmission.
