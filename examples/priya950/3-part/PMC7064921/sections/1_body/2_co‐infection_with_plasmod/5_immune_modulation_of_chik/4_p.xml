<p>Impaired expansion and early apoptosis of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in draining lymph nodes in co‐infected mice could only partially explain the suppression of joint swelling. Virus‐specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the pLN was only suppressed by ~50%, but CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells detection in the co‐infected animals' footpad was almost completely abolished.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">119</xref> Using adoptive transfer of CSFE‐labeled CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from CHIKV‐infected mice, it was shown that the migratory potential of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into the infected footpad was also abolished by co‐infection. This blockage of migration was mediated by the suppression of Th1‐associated chemokines such as RANTES, MIP‐1α, MIP‐1β, and CXCL10 in the footpad. Furthermore, in vivo blockade experiments showed that Th1 chemokine receptor CXCR3 and not CCR5 is functionally important for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell‐mediated CHIKV inflammation and that CXCR3‐mediated chemotaxis was impaired during co‐infection.
