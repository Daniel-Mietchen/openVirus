<p>Immune profiling of the popliteal LN (pLN), the nearest draining LN to the site of infection, from the concurrent co‐infected animals revealed decreased numbers of total and CHIKV‐specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">119</xref> Concordantly, increased apoptotic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the pLN at 5 and 6 dpi were detected. This was supported by previous findings where apoptosis in lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid organs upon malaria infection was described.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0151" ref-type="ref">151</xref> In line with this, reduced numbers of conventional DCs in the pLN of co‐infected mice were also observed, suggesting that reduced expansion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells might be due in part to the drop in DCs numbers associated with malaria.
