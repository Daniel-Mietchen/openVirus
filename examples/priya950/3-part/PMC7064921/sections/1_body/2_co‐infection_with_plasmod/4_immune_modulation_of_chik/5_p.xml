 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> inoculation during an ongoing CHIKV infection modified the outcome of murine malaria. Co‐infection in mice pre‐infected with CHIKV for 4 days with either PbA or Py17x did not affect the development of footpad swelling or viremia. In contrast, ongoing CHIKV infection exacerbated 
 <italic>Plasmodium‐</italic>induced pathology by increasing the parasite load in the blood at the later stage of the disease. The availability of type I interferon induced by a pre‐existing CHIKV infection

Supporting this hypothesis, a recent mouse study reported that blockade of type I interferon signaling resulted in a better parasite control due to the establishment of robust antimalarial humoral responses reflected in increased Tfh numbers, GC reactions, and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>‐specific antibody titers.
