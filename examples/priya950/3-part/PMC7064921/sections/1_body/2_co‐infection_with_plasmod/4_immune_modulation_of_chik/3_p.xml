<p>The reduction of CHIKV‐induced footpad swelling in co‐infected animals was associated with lesser numbers of joint‐infiltrating innate pathogenic subsets such as neutrophils, NK cells, and inflammatory monocytes.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">119</xref> Reduced edema, muscle necrosis, and vascular leakage were also observed suggesting generalized suppression of signature inflammatory responses induced by CHIKV

 <xref rid="imr12825-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Of note, blood‐stage malaria has been linked to dysregulation in the motility of different inflammatory immune subsets. For example, 
 <italic>P. vivax</italic> controlled human malaria infection has been shown to induce the depletion of neutrophil populations coupled to the downregulation of chemokine receptors CRXCR1, CXCR2, CCR3, and the growth factor receptor CSF3R responsible of neutrophil maturation and survival.

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP‐1) impairs neutrophil chemotaxis through the blockade of NFκB signaling.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">121</xref> Reduced expression of cytoadhesion molecules such as CD11b, CD11c, and CD18 and diminished diapedesis and responsiveness to chemotactic factors (ie, TNFα or MCP‐1) have also been reported in monocytes upon 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">123</xref> Complementary studies are needed to demonstrate whether the observed reduction of the innate cellular infiltrate in joints of co‐infected animals is due to malaria‐associated impaired chemotaxis and dysregulation of the chemokine network in infected tissues.
