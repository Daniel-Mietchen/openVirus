<p>The abrogation of viremia only in animals pre‐infected with malaria (4 days prior CHIKV inoculation) suggested that immune mediators produced upon parasite infection could be responsible for the control of CHIKV dissemination. Human and mouse studies have reported early induction of IFNγ upon 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections

 <italic>Plasmodium‐</italic>CHIKV co‐infection, the abrogation of viremia was reverted in mice lacking IFNγ and in wildtype mice treated with IFNγ neutralizing antibodies.

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection could exert an antiviral activity through the priming of primary CHIKV targets such as fibroblasts, myocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages during the early stages of infection
