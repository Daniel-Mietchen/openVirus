<p>Among the arthritogenic alphaviruses, research on CHIKV was the most extensive owing to the global epidemics since 2005.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> The availability of mouse models that captures major features of human disease have generated a wealth of information.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> These studies have yielded important evidence on the involvement of host immune responses in the development of alphavirus arthritides. CHIKV infections trigger a strong immune response characterized by the release of pro‚Äêinflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
