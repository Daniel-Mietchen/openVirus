<p>The striking similarities between CHIKV arthritic disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at the transcriptomic and cytokine/chemokine levels suggested the potential involvement of common causative agents.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In fact, two CD4
 <sup>+</sup> effector T cell subsets: Th1 and Th17, have been implicated in the development of RA.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Th1 cells typically orchestrate cell‐mediated responses against intracellular pathogens through the release of signature cytokines such as IFNγ and IL‐2,

 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses.
