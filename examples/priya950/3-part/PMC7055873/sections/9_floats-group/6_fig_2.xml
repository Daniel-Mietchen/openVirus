  <title>HA and NA phylogeny of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic isolates in Myanmar in 2017.</title>
  <p>Trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using MEGA software (version 6.06). Bootstrap value was determined for 1000 iterations; only values greater than 70% are shown. Myanmar out-patient is shown in red fonts, and in-patient is shown in dark blue fonts. The HA and NA sequences of Myanmar strains belonged to clade 6B.1. Red circle (‚óè) represents oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant strain exhibiting NA H275Y substitution. Amino acid changes were based on A/California/07/2009.</p>
