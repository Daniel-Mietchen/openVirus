  <title>Monthly distribution of influenza virus by region in Myanmar during the 2017 influenza season and the location of sample collection sites.</title>
  <p>The total number of collected samples is shown in the black dashed line. Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 is shown as red bar; A(H3N2), blue bar; B/Victoria, purple bar and B/Yamagata, green bar. The seasonal peak of A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed in June-July, during the rainy season, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant subtype in Myanmar during the 2017 influenza season. The map of Myanmar and the green circles represent the two study sites, Yangon and Pyinmana. This map is generated by the software ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI Japan Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Boundaries are generated by using a world basemap supplied by ESRI Japan Corporation.</p>
