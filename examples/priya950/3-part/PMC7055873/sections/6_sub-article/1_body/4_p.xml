<p>1. In point 10 of the answer to reviewer comments, you argue that further analysis and details of the NGS genome sequencing results will be reported "in the next paper"...and added that comment in the text (P29, L566-570). Please change that for a more adequate statement, such as "analysis of NGS data is still ongoing and the results will be published elsewhere"</p>
