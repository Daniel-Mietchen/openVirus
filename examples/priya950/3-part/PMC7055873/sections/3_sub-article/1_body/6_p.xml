<p>I have received the reviews of your manuscript. While your paper addresses an interesting question, there are several issues raised by the reviewers that needs to be addressed.  Please see reviewers' insightful comments for detail.  On a personal level, I felt the paper is very descriptive and I agreed with the reviewers about the information for in-patients did not appear until "drug resistance testing", please provide more information regarding in-patients.  Also, some details on the phylogenetic analysis on the whole genome will help strengthen the merit of the paper.</p>
