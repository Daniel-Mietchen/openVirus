<p>In this study, we characterized the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains that circulated in Myanmar during the 2017 outbreak and attempted to identify factors that are responsible for the virulence of the virus, which may cause the severity of influenza among in-patients by comparing with the out-patient strains. Although viral genome features responsible for the differential severity of influenza between in-patients and out-patients could not be thoroughly elucidated, we present the first-time characterization of Myanmar influenza viruses by the full genome sequencing. This study demonstrates the importance of continuing antiviral monitoring, epidemiological investigations, and genetic characterization in the data-limited country like Myanmar.</p>
