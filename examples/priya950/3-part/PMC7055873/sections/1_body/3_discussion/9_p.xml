<p>Nonetheless, this study has several limitations. The samples tested herein were collected from two surveillance sites for out-patients and from one children hospital for in-patients. Due to the limitations of human resources in Myanmar, there was no hospital to collect samples from in-patients and out-patients in the same surveillance site within the study period. Therefore, we decided to select two hospitals for out-patients and one hospital for in-patients. Moreover, influenza-positive sample size of in-patients was quite small compared to out-patients even though we collected 288 in-patients. We detected the first oseltamivir-resistant strain in Myanmar, but the epidemiological link of the patient was unclear. Besides, we could analyze only two out-patients in Pyinmana by NGS. It would be more useful if we could increase the number of samples for sequencing for a more comprehensive analysis. Analysis of NGS data is still ongoing, and the results will be published elsewhere.</p>
