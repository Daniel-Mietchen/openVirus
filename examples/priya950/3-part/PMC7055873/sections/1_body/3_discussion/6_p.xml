<p>Genetic characterization of six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, and NS) showed that there were no marked genetic changes related to increased pathogenicity. Several complex factors are associated with severe pneumonia: viral factors, such as mutations in the polymerase, HA, PB1-F2, polymerase acidic protein frameshift, and host factors, such as comorbidities, single-nucleotide polymorphism, inflammation, high cytokines and chemokines; bacterial factors, such as function of attachment, replication, and loss of repair can result in secondary bacterial infections [

It was, thus, suggested that the severity of illness is not caused by the differences of virus strains between in-patients and out-patients but characteristics of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 causing viral pneumonia [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, internal genes of Indian strains and Myanmar strains were compared. The local circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed from 2016 to 2017 in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh prior to the outbreaks in Myanmar [

Among the four mutation differences between Myanmar and Indian strains, the only functional significance was at position 27 in the M2 segment that confers resistance to amantadine. Adamantane-resistant influenza variants have been circulating in the world for decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. M2 gene mutations associated with resistance to amantadine were found in only about 1% of V27A mutations compared to 95% of S31N mutation [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, all of Myanmar and Indian strains in this study also possessed S31N mutation. It is highly presumable that strains from the two countries shared the same source of origin because Myanmar and Indian strains shared higher percentage of sequence identity. No additional viral genetic changes associated with disease severity were identified so far.
