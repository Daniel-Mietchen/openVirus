<p>Antigenic analysis using the HI test showed that Myanmar strains in 2017 were similar to the vaccine strain A/Singapore/GP1908/2015, a vaccine component for the Japanese inactivated vaccine for the 2017/2018 season [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 belonged to 6B.1 clade and is antigenically similar to A/Michigan/45/2015, a vaccine component for the Southern hemisphere in 2017 [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Northern hemisphere in 2017/2018 [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, the HI results of the isolated viruses that reacted to the antisera raised against the vaccine strain had higher titer by 2–4 fold increase than the homologous titer of the vaccine strain virus. The higher HI titer of test viruses than vaccine viruses is often observed in the circulating strains, and it merely shows an antigenic match with the vaccine strains. Indeed, a recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control shows that the HI titer of the circulating viruses was 2–4 fold higher, indicating a match with the vaccine and the reference viruses [

WHO changed the vaccine component from A/California/7/2009 to A/Michigan/45/2015 for the Southern hemisphere vaccine in 2017 because of the increasing number of clade 6B.1 viruses observed at the beginning of 2016. Clade 6B.1 viruses were reported to show similar antigenicity to ferret antisera against A/California/7/2009 when tested by the HI test, but they reacted poorly with pediatric, adult, and older adult pre- and post-vaccination sera [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, WHO changed the vaccine component into A/Michigan/45/2015 from the 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine. In this outbreak, Myanmar experienced severe cases of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 in 2017; however, it turned out that these viruses matched with the vaccine strain.
