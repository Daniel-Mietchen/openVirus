<p>Here, we report the identification and detection of a H275Y mutation in NA that confer resistant to oseltamivir from an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolate in community samples of Myanmar, which was detected for the first time in Myanmar; however, its detection rate was low at only 0.5%. In Myanmar, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected in 2009 and the oseltamivir-resistant H275Y variant has not been detected in specimens, either from the community or hospitalized patients since then, although all isolates tested showed the S31N mutation in M2 that conferred resistance to amantadine [

Oseltamivir was not previously used for the treatment of influenza in Myanmar, but at the time of the outbreak in 2017, it was supplied by the WHO as an emergency control measure. The drug was administered to the admitted patients with severe cases of influenza infection (

It was already reported worldwide that oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections were detected in community settings with no known exposure to oseltamivir and the resistant virus spread within the community even in the absence of drug-selective pressure [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This fact suggests that there is a possibility of rapid transmission of resistant strains from patients, who were already treated with oseltamivir, in a short period after prescribing the antiviral drug in Myanmar. Moreover, this virus showed high reduced inhibition (HRI) with high fold-increase in IC
 <sub>50</sub> (198 and 274) to two NAIs, oseltamivir and peramivir. Global analysis on the susceptibility of human influenza viruses to the NAI reported that the most common NA amino acid substitution was H275Y in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which confers HRI by oseltamivir and peramivir [
