<p>In Myanmar, the first pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 case was detected in June 2009, with no reported fatal cases. Since then, it has been co-circulating with other seasonal influenza viruses in the country. Previously, we reported the epidemiology and genetic characterization of influenza virus A and B circulating in Myanmar [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and characterized the drug-susceptibility of seasonal and pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses in Myanmar in 2008 and 2009 [
