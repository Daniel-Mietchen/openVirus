<p>Of the 233 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from all the study sites, one isolate (0.4%) had the oseltamivir-resistance with H275Y mutation in the NA protein, as analyzed by cycling probe real-time PCR. The isolate originated from an out-patient, who was a 28 years old male with an onset date on 7 August 2017. He visited the medical institution in Pyinmana with a body temperature of 37.2 Â°C, headache, runny nose, and myalgia. He did not receive oseltamivir treatment prior to and after the medical visit. His precise illness course is unknown, but he recovered without complications. The epidemiological link of the H275Y mutant virus is unknown. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the variant frequency of oseltamivir-resistance histidine to tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 275 in the NA gene of this mutant virus was 99.8% (495 reads/496 total reads). All the other A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates from Yangon and Pyinmana study sites did not show H275Y mutation in NA (
