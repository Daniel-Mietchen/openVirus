 <italic>In vitro</italic> fluorescence-based NAI assay performed on the selected influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates (12 isolates from out-patients and 12 from in-patients) revealed that the H275Y mutant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has elevated IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for oseltamivir (301.5 nM with 198-fold increase) and peramivir (21.9 nM with 274-fold increase) but not for zanamivir (0.58 nM with 0.9-fold difference) and laninamivir (0.72 nM with 2.7-fold difference), when compared to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the reference drug-sensitive strain A/Perth/265/2009 (275H), indicating resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir with highly reduced inhibition. All of the remaining A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were sensitive to the four neuraminidase inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of less than 10-fold difference compared to the reference virus (
