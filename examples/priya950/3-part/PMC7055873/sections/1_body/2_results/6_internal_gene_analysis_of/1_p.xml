<p>We further characterized the amino acid substitutions in the remaining six segments of 25 Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains, 13 out-patients including a case with NA/H275Y mutation and 12 in-patients, using next-generation sequencing. FluSurver research tool (

The amino acid sequences of the six segments from the present study showed 99.0â€“99.8% identity with the reference strain A/Michigan/45/2015.
