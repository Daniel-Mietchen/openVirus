<p>All Myanmar in-patient strains except one possessed the amino acid substitutions (as compared to A/Michigan/45/2015) at positions 66, 299, 398, and 453 in PB2, at positions 12 and 375 in PB1, at position 27 in M2, and at position 65 in NS1. All these mutations were frequently observed (10/13, 77%) in Myanmar out-patient strains. A/Myanmar/17MP009/2017 and A/Myanmar/17MP015/2017 strains from two fatal cases possessed the same amino acid mutations found in out-patients and in-patients who recovered from the disease (
