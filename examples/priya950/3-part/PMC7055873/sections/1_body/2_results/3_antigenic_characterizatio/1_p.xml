<p>The twelve selected influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates were characterized by HI assay to determine the antigenicity of the influenza virus strains circulating during the outbreak season using post-infection rabbit antisera raised against the vaccine virus, A/Singapore/GP1908/2015, that was used for the Japanese influenza vaccine strain for the 2017â€“2018 seasons [
