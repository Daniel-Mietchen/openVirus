<p>The HA and NA genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in samples selected from 18 out-patients and 12 in-patients, including two cases with fatal outcomes, A/Myanmar/17MP009/2017 and A/Myanmar/17MP015/2017, were genetically characterized. To match the age group with in-patients, test samples of out-patients were randomly selected from children in the same age group (&lt; 5 years old) for better comparison. We failed to sequence six out of 18 viruses from in-patients. All the analyzed Myanmar viruses belonged to genetic clade 6B.1 with amino acid substitutions of S84N, S162N, and I216T in HA [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229601.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The majority (26, 87%) of viruses possessed S164T in HA and formed a clade with the Indian 2017 and Japanese 2017â€“2018 strains. Among them, 13 viruses from out-patients and 11 viruses from in-patients possessed a T314I substitution in HA. It was a unique amino acid substitution common among the Myanmar sequences. Two Myanmar out-patient viruses (A/Myanmar/17M204/2017 and A/Myanmar/17M307/2017) did not belong to these clusters but were closely related to Indian strains in the same year, 2017. Three out-patient viruses (A/Myanmar/17M109/2017, A/Myanmar/17M309/2017, and A/Myanmar/17M310/2017) and one in-patient virus (A/Myanmar/17MP001/2017) shared A215G and S297P substitutions and formed a group with the Japanese strains in 2016 and 2017, having a bootstrap value of over 90%.
