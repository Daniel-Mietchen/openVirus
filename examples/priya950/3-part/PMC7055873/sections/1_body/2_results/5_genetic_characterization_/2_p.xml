<p>In the phylogeny of the NA gene, all the Myanmar viruses possessed V13I, I34V, V264I, and N270K substitutions and belonged to clade 6B.1. Around 60% of Myanmar out-patient viruses and all in-patient viruses shared the R173K amino acid substitution. Among the viruses from this cluster, two out-patient viruses possessed T438A substitution. H275Y mutation on neuraminidase was found in one A(H1N1)pdm09 strain (A/Myanmar/17M307/2017), which was from an out-patient with no prior history of anti-viral treatment. This resistant virus and another sensitive out-patient virus exhibited P93H substitution in NA. Three out-patient viruses and one in-patient virus exhibited the D451G substitution, which formed a small separate cluster as HA (
