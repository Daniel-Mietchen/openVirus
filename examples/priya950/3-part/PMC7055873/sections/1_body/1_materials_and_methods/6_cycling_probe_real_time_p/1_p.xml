<p>RNA was extracted from A(H1N1)pdm09 positive isolates using Extragen II kits (Toso, Tokyo, Japan). Complementary DNA was synthesized using uni12 primer for generic influenza A amplification, as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cycling probe real-time PCR for the mutation on NA gene that confers resistance to oseltamivir was performed on the isolates using fluorescent-labeled chimeric RNA-DNA probes, RNase H, and the commercially available cycling probe real-time PCR kit, CycleavePCRCore kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Ohtsu, Japan), at the Division of International Health, Niigata University, Japan. These cycling probes were labeled with either 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), and the PCR reaction was prepared according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. This assay utilizes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for detecting oseltamivir-sensitive (H275) and oseltamivir-resistant (H275Y) viruses based on the reaction curves of FAM (H275) or ROX (H275Y) [
