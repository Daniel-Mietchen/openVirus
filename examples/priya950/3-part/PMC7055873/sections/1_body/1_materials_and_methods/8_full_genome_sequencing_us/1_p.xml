<p>The eight viral RNA segments for the selected Myanmar A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were sequenced using next-generation sequencing to obtain the whole viral genome. Briefly, a cDNA library was prepared using random hexamers and NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep kit (NEB) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, and sequenced using a MiSeq second-generation sequencer (Illumina) with Reagent Kit v2. The genomic sequences of the isolates were determined using FluGAS software (version 1.0.0, World Fusion, Tokyo, Japan), which mapped the output pair-end reads to reference sequences of each gene segment selected from the Influenza Virus Database in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Search database (NCBI) by the FluGAS algorithm. A consensus sequence was constructed when coverage was higher than three at each site and adopted a single nucleotide in at least 51% or more coverage, whereas mixed-base codes were adopted when multiple bases shared more than 15% out of the total coverage at the site. In this study, all of the consensus sequences subjected for phylogenetic analysis had more than 10 coverage at any site. The variant frequency at position 275 of the amino acid sequence in NA, which confers oseltamivir-resistance, was calculated using Genome Workbench (QIAGEN, Duesseldorf, Germany) software. Next-generation sequencing was performed at the National Institute of Animal Health, Tsukuba city, Japan.</p>
